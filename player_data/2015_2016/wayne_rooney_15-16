If he scores 20 goals this season, he'll become our all time top scorer... As long as he's our main striker, I think he'll get that this season. 19 behind Sir Bobby

But not *fixed* because United people are laaaaazy. Some background: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/manchester-united-goals-and-assists-1987-88-today.396084/page-5#post-17433369">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/manc...sts-1987-88-today.396084/page-5#post-17433369</a>

5~~~
Hopefully he can bang in 20+ in the league this season. Don't see it personally but also hope if he goes on a bad run LVG has the balls to take him out the side, which is why we need another striker in.

6~~~
Hopefully he can recover but he will be dropped if he starts the season the way he finished the last.

7~~~
Dropped for who exactly?

8~~~
Surely seeing as Euro 2016 is around the corner it's written for him to have a fecking brilliant season, only to injure himself around April and get rushed back, playing like shit and getting blamed when England go out on penalties to Italy in the quarter finals?

9~~~
Memphis or Hernandez as van Gaal suggested that he shall stay.

10~~~
Those players don't have the status to bench Rooney, even if playing well. For all this 'ruthlessness' talk going around lately, I can't see LVG dropping Rooney at all.

11~~~
This!

I can see him hitting 20 goals, give or take one or two. 

If he is settled up front on a weekly basis then it shouldn't be a problem for him. Looking at the players around him to supply him and his finishing still being very good, I don't see why we can't get a great season out of him.

12~~~
Still failing to understand the 20 goal belief here. Its only happened twice. Would be nice for us if he proves me wrong but I doubt it'll happen. Bordering on delusion for me.

13~~~
Twice in 2 seasons he played up front no ? If so then really any hope for him hitting those numbers isn't delusion at all.

14~~~
It happened four times. When looking at all competitions, because...why not?

15~~~
He scored like 3 goals in 15 games as a striker last season, I don't think he will score more than 15 if he plays as a striker in this one. It's not his fault, I just don't think that LVG's system is set up to get the best out of the strikers.

16~~~
Oh no, you didn't just say that, did you? ...

Aside from that, Van Gaal has also said he wants his captains to play. Seems he'll put a lot of stock in his captain choices, and that Rooney will play not because he is the most in-form 9, 10 or 8, but because he is the most important person in the squad (to LVG, presumably).

17~~~
Despite his endless fluffed chances(with a rotation of pretty marginal players supplying him), his record under Roy who has pretty kept in a consistent role is a solid indicator he could get 20 goals if he played like 35+ games....which he probably won't. The supporting cast at United is the best it's been for him also, given he was in the supporting cast more or less for RVN and Ronaldo. Exceptionally big 12 months for him. Hope he can stay injury free so it'll be on him how he responds to it.

18~~~
Its all about service. If he plays as the main striker and gets service into him he will score. Most of the top number #9's have a midfield feeding them through balls. We mostly get our chances from the wide players. Rooney in 2009/10 season was our out and out target man and most of the time found himself on the end of crosses, think he scored about 16 headers that season. We now have a midfield that can handle themselves leaving Rooney available to concentrate on attack. I curious to see where Van Gaal plays him tonight.

19~~~
We'll see. There's always an excuse for him.

20~~~
There's always an excuse to slate him too.

21~~~
There's rarely an excuse. It's just a pastime on here.

22~~~
True that! But I wasn't slating him. Just doubting that he'll hit 20.

23~~~
Rooney looked sharp in the first half IMO

24~~~
Thought he was very poor. He ruins so many attacks.

25~~~
Looked really poor, nothing came off for him and his touch is typical Rooney. First game in a while, hopefully he will improve although he did have a preseason touch for most of last season! We need a new striker.

26~~~
Typical veteran performance. Half arsed and mind still on holiday.

Rooney (and Carrick) know its going to be a long season.

27~~~
He's obviously not match fit as are so many other players. This is why preseason is so important.

28~~~
Thought he was fine.

29~~~
Didn't do much at all. He better gets in shape we'll need him scoring up front this season.

30~~~
He usually starts slow, I would however make sure he sticks to his position between the two opposition center backs rather than drop deeper too frequently. No reason for him to do that anymore with the midfield we'd be playing with.

31~~~
I think he will score 20+ goals this season with th fecking midfield we have that's almost certain, Charlie Austin would score that.. but really wanna see better striker soon, he's kinda average. Kane next year and I'll be delighted.. Anyway quite harsh to criticize him today, his touch is fecking 5th leagueish but it's jut a first game..

32~~~
He can be a great player but he's so inconsistent its getting annoying. We will get in form Rooney one game then for the next 6 he is like a league 2 player. That isn't good enough for a man that's meant to be leading the line of a team that's challenging for honours. I hope we bring in another top striker that starts scoring and if needs be Rooney will be benched.

33~~~
The thing with Rooney is that he is a very good finisher, however,  I think the other areas of his game are not good enough for him to get the required amount of opportunities to use that finishing to get 25+ goals. The likes of Aguero and Suarez get the numbers not just because they can finish. Their movement, dribbling, speed, quick feet etc will mean they probably have far more shooting opportunities than Rooney. 

I fully trust Rooney to take a good chance if presented, it's just that in the PL today it is getting harder to get more than one or two good chances a game. You need to be able to make those opportunities by working and challenging defenders. That is the department he is behind other top strikers. He has a good strike from outside the box for instance, but more of his shots from 20 yards are blocked than Aguero because he doesn't have that skill, movement,  acceleration or whatever to make that proper half a yard to unleash it. 

I think being able to take a good chance alone may help him get 15 league goals, including one or two special moments he can still produce sporadically. However, to get 25+ you need more. Rooney doesn't get himself enough opportunities for that. You look at the goals Sturridge got a couple of seasons back - they were not just down to him being able to 'finish'. It was more down to him being a handful, and Rooney looks too easy to play against and contain for my liking. Of course,  he will still get chances and still get goals, but I don't think he has enough of a threat other than the finishing to do huge numbers anymore. 

I think you want a top striker in the modern game to have a few similar qualities to a good winger I guess, finishing aside. I think with Rooney, finishing aside, he has the qualities of a good central midfielder - which is typically not going to scare defenders.

34~~~
Well atleast we know he definitely won't be getting played in midfield this year, unless we have another horrendous injury saga. He needs a big year this season, I want to see him getting back to scoring headers and poaching goals in the box as he doesn't seem to score many like that these days. 

Made some decent runs against CA but his lack of pace means he really has to time them perfectly. Hopefully after the pre season he wil be raring to go.

35~~~
Here's all of Rooney's finishes from the 09/10 season..


I see no reason why he can't finish chances like that again. Di Maria is the most likely to provide that sort of service whereas Young is not up to it and Valencia unfortunately isn't anymore either. Memphis looked quality yesterday though, so hopefully he can play like that in the premier league.

36~~~
Think he's still capable of doing a very good job as an out and out striker.

37~~~
Would be amazing.  He played with such fire that season. Still, I don't think it's wise in football to expect a player to play as he played 6 years ago. He has not done it since. Still,  I'd love to see that Rooney next season. I believe we'd be the strongest side in the league if we did.

38~~~
I'm not expecting him to play like that for sure, but he's certainly more than capable of finishing off chances like that. The question is, can we get the right delivery from wide areas? For me, Di Maria can provide it with the game against Arsenal last season being an example. That's why I feel it's important we keep Di Maria. We need more players who have the vision and can play the final ball.

Poll on whether people think Rooney will break the record this season or not?

Edit: Couldn't even spell Damien's name right first time. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

40~~~
I think this might be his last season here.

41~~~
I've never heard that before. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

42~~~
Other than the fact that was 6 years ago, and he's not getting any younger (or sharper)... and we (and by we I mean Fergie) tried to get rid of him twice in that time frame.

43~~~
Try reading what I'm actually saying. I didn't say he's going to perform like he did that season, but are you seriously telling me he can't finish those chances in the present day?

44~~~
yeah... I've read what you are saying and I am fully disagreeing with you.  I think relying on him without suitable back-up would be Van Gaal's undoing... do I think Wilson and Hernandez are that back up... NO... I fully believe we (and by we I mean Van Gaal) are looking to add strength to the striker position.

Rooney's peak (as in his best) season was 9/10 which quite frankly was only 3/4 a season, really ending with his ankle injury vs Bayern... since then he he has played 1 and 1/3 seasons of football which could be describe as "at that level" (the last 3rd of 10/11... and most of 11/ 12 - although he did go shockingly missing in several key games that season).  Other than those windows he has largely played in fits and spurts looking world class at times, very ordinary more often than not.

the present version of Rooney is clearly NOT as good as the 9/10 version.  Funnily enough prior to the 9/10 season finishing was seen as a weakness in Rooney's overall game... now it is being touted as his strength.  While I believe he will be give an chance to prove he can still deliver, I believe LVG will drop him especially if he does sign another name striker who will want his chance... and with our newly fortified midfield Rooney may find himself completely out in the cold if he does not produce.

45~~~
Remember when Valencia and Nani were really, really fecking good? Berbatov with some lovely football in there, too.

Rooney is fine up top. Create chances for him and he'll bag 20-30, comfortably.

46~~~
Clearly you haven't read what I said. I was responding to a post that said something along the lines of how a striker need to beat defenders to get opportunities to score 25+. I displayed a video showing Rooney scoring 34 goals without the need to beat defenders 1 v 1. I'm not saying he will play all round as well as that season, but there's no doubt he can finish chances like that if he gets similar service to that year. Answer this question, is he capable of finishing chances like in that video? That's where my discussion is, not with whatever else you have posted.

Btw what key games did Rooney go missing in 11/12? 3 goals against Arsenal, 3 goals against Chelsea, 2 goals against Man City, 2 goals against Liverpool, 2 goals against Spurs, 2 goals against Everton. He was pretty fecking good in big games that year, ridiculous criticism.

47~~~
The delusion about him is real, he's done very little recently to suggest that he'll be one of the highest goalscorers in Europe.

48~~~
Played upfront every week he will score over 20 goals guaranteed.

49~~~
I'll give you three games where Rooney "went missing" in 11/12 and they were all extremely costly...
0-1 vs Basel as United crashed out of the champions league.
0-1 vs Wigan as United started to let City back in the title race
0-1 vs City where we basically handed the title to City.
and it wasn't that he didn't score in those games, it was that fact that he was utterly dire in what were must win games.

To answer your other question , come on... not nearly as simple as you make it out to be.  You show a video of Rooney's best season in a United shirt, and you make it seem like all he did was put away tap ins.  No chance.  His movement, finding space, his instinct to get in scoring positions and his passion to deliver was world class that season.  You have to be able to be the a position to deal with the service he got that season.  Do I think the present day Rooney operates at the same level to be able to do the things he did in 09/10... NO, I don't. Do I think he will fair as well with the potential of decent service this season, NO again I don't believe he will match what he achieved during that season.  Will his finishing mask the other elements of his game which have gone into decline... NO.  Is his movement and pace what it was 6 seasons ago, come on.  Will he score 30 goals if all he has to do is tap the ball into an open net... sure, yes he will.

You forget that Rooney was our main penalty taker that season as well... now he's probably 3rd -4th choice.  I'd say somewhere between 15-18 league goals, would be a decent expectation for Rooney this season (and quite frankly that's not a bad haul for a premier league striker)...  I believe LVG will give him the opportunity to show us he can deliver the goods, but I don't think he will hesitate to go another route if Rooney is not up for it.

50~~~
Sorry but Wigan does not count as a key game, there were far more important games that season. So basically two games you've picked out, out of how many key games? I think you'll find he performed in the vast majority of the key games that season and was one of the best big game players in Europe that season. Absolutely ridiculous criticism. Thanks for goals and winning us games against Chelsea, Man City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Everton but because you had a couple of bad games, you went missing in key games that season. Right.

We haven't seen Rooney consistently in a striker role for a long time for United but I think it's premature to say his movement and ability to find space have gone. As someone mentioned earlier in the thread, he's managed a good record under Hodgson for England primarily playing as a number 10 or striker.

2012 - 4 goals in 5 games
2013 - 6 goals in 10 games
2014 - 8 goals in 13 games
2015 - 2 goals in 4 games

I'm not saying he's the same player as 6 years ago, but he can still score goals when playing up front. It will be interesting to see how many he does score this season if he does indeed play up front every game.

51~~~
This hero worship is getting boring

Please don't ever confuse playing for United and England... they are not the same thing.

Sorry, but every game does count in April when you are locked in a heated title race with your cross town rivals.  So Wigan absolutely counts as a key game, a draw in that game and we win the league.

And as for "going missing" how about Blackburn H 2-3 in 11/12 when Rooney was suspended by Fergie for getting drunk the night before the previous match... hardly the trait of a leader (or someone to pin your hopes on)... again, this is the year we lost the title on goal difference.

Listen to be honest...  I really hope that we play beautiful attacking football and that Rooney has a great year banging in lots of goals... because it means that Manchester United will win things, which quite frankly is what we should all want.  I'm just not so certain it will work that way.  Lets not forget that in the two seasons Rooney operated as the lone primary striker we didn't win the league.

52~~~
Am I alone in the idea that, Rooney will be sold next year, and Basti is made captain?

Not based on anything...Just a feeling

53~~~
You're missing the point. Rooney hasn't played striker <b>consistently </b>for us for a long time, so from what sample size are you judging Rooney's ability to score for us as a striker? The only team we've seen Rooney consistently play up front for is England and he's managed to score at International level just fine. That doesn't mean United = England obviously but it is a bigger sample size than an assumption based on his performances in various positions. He will also in theory have better team mates and service this year. 

A game against Wigan is not more important than games against Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal etc. If we hadn't won those big games, we may not even be talking about the 'Wigan' game right now. Like I said, Rooney performed in the vast majority of key games that year. I've listed the amount of goals he scored against the big teams, that far out weights whatever poor games you've listed. Unless you'd rather he performed in the few games you listed and didn't score all those goals against the top six. Yeah, I don't think so. 

As for the last part, Rooney only operated as 9 for one season post-Ronaldo and that was 09/10. He played behind Welbeck or Hernandez in the 11/12 season. Yes we didn't win the league in 09/10 season, we lost by a point and he got injured before the Chelsea clash and other players couldn't step up. Let's hold that against him, just because.

54~~~
Its all about context... must win games speak for themselves... even if the opposition isn't all that fashionable.  And yes... I expect ALL of our players (especially our so called talisman) to show up for them... all of them.  We all should.  Games don't get bigger than that City away game in 11/12... everything was on the line.

I notice you didn't want to touch this grenade... I guess it doesn't really work with your narrative.

55~~~
Fergie changed Rooney's role in the City game to lone striker and we brought Park in. We set up defensively, created nothing and everyone played shit. He had a bad game but so did everyone else. Like I said, he performed in the vast majority of key games so there's no need to nit pick a few games and then claim he didn't turn up in key games. 

Second part, that's obviously poor behaviour on his part but it doesn't change the point that he turned up in the vast majority of key games. You stated that he went 'shockingly missing in several key games' which is not true. He turned up in more key games for us than any other player that year and rivalled most in Europe with goals scored in big games. You're just nit picking and criticising unnecessarily. I'll repeat, 3 goals against Arsenal, 3 goals against Chelsea, 2 goals against Man City, 2 goals against Liverpool, 2 goals against Spurs, 2 goals against Everton. Not bad for going shockingly missing in key games.

56~~~
Man, what a player. I expect Golden Balls this season.

57~~~
Becks coming out of retirement is he?

58~~~
Pffft, nah. Valencia going back to his natural place, right winger. Assists galore!

59~~~
Who will buy him? I never heard any rumours about any team interested in him recently. 
And not a good sign if anyone is made captain just after a year in the team, doesn't reflect good on other players.

60~~~
Well, I've always been of the belief that Carrick, if he wasn't injured, would have been made captain.

As for Rooney...He's already making noises about the MLS.


This is just me thinking out loud btw....No substance to it

61~~~
There are no rumours as he recently signed a new contract. Before that, Jose, of Porto fame, wanted to sign him. For some crumbs. Edward literally told him to feck off.

62~~~
More like Moyes....Only one who had his back <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

63~~~
Is there any place which has Rooney's assists broken down into open play and set pieces?

64~~~
<a class="username" data-user="58565, @Varun" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/58565/">@Varun</a>, RedCafe will have it in around 10 days.

65~~~
Entire career?

66~~~
Yeah, but not just him, all the players from around 1987 season.

67~~~
That's a great addition. Nice!

68~~~
The delusion about him 'being shit' or 'mediocre' is just as big. 

The problem about 'recently' is that he hasn't really had the opportunity to feature in a balanced team as the out and out striker - unlike players you'd be comparing him to. The last time he was the #9 of the team was a while ago, so you necessarily have to look at those numbers, which look like those of an elite European striker. Many of you (including yourself, clearly), believe these numbers are too old and he's now past it. Others think he still has it in him to do very well as a center forward in a team which will create chances. 

Neither of those are actually deluded. They're just opinions expressed by people on the basis of the trust they have in Rooney.

69~~~
He isnt mediocre nor shit, but just watch him play. He has declined physically and its very significant. He's lost strength, pace and dynamism. Other than that, his first touch holds himself back a lot. These are attributes a striker at the highest level in modern days has to have, especially in the PL. He scored 4 goals in 14 matches as a striker for is, and has just scored one away goal domestically since March 2014. Its just clear that Rooney isnt the same as he was even under Moyes. 

If you watch him, his link up and hold up play have both just not been the same, he gets shrugged off the ball easily, rarely combinates properly. If we were to build a team where Rooney could score 20 league goals, I think in that team Berahino could score similar too. It's not worth it for me.

70~~~
How on earth are people still debating whether he's good enough? Don't you ever get bored arguing about the same thing every few months?

71~~~
I wonder if Rooney is going to be like Giggs -- I was saying that Giggs was in decline around 2003, played for 11 more years. 

Rooney's case does feel a lot different though.

72~~~
I wouldn't agree with that. I believe Rooney is a massive blind spot for Van Gaal, and as I've said for about two years, the need to have him, somewhere, in any United XI will hold the team back. He is simply not in the group of players (on the field anyway) that warrants such status at a super club.

People speak about Van Gaal's ruthlessness - Evans was terrible last season and is up for sale, Di Maria, our record signing and probably our best player underperformed and was dropped and made to fight for his place. Rafael disappointed and up for sale. Many examples of players getting what they deserved. Can anyone really say Rooney's season warranted no scrutiny at all? Instead, Van Gaal has removed all realistic competition from the squad so as to have nobody in his way. A lot will depend on the level of striker we go for, because if it is a Diafra Sakho level player, then it will confirm the creation of conditions that will allow Rooney to walk into the side unchallenged. 

I read an interview with Persie this morning saying how he wasn't given a fair chance to compete for his place. That is my worry here. I don't think most strikers we could sign will actually be allowed to 'compete' with Rooney. All this talk about how we need a 'back up ' for Rooney? Why on earth would we be searching simply for a backup to a player who got us 12 league goals last season? 

From LVGs time here, I don't see how he could have concluded that the strikers position in his team is settled. Even if he thinks Rooney is good enough for it, it cannot be said that last season has proven this. So given his treatment of others in the squad, I don't think Rooney did enough last season to earn the status he seems to have in the team. Not even close.

73~~~
I think this is a defining season for him. He is now the main man once again after 3 seasons of sharing that with RVP. If he finds form he could score a shedload and everyone's happy. If he doesn't I think we sign a top striker next summer and he has a choice of accepting a lesser role, and hoping to be involved in one last hurrah somewhere down the line a la Giggs, or moving club.

74~~~
Think he will score 20 goals this season but that doesn't stop us acquiring Kane next summer who will be at that time comfortably better imo so we will see then if Van Gaal has balls or not to bench him.. if so it will lead to Rooney's departure which would be a good move for both sides. I think he's off to MLS after next two seasons maximum

75~~~
The fact he is, and has been a permanent fixture under 3 managers, the most recent one known for his 'ruthless streak', might suggest you're slightly mistaken. When you listen to people who really know football, and I'm not talking about shit pundits here but the ones who have a bit of knowledge of the game, they'll always say that Rooney brings a lot more to a team than meets the eye. I also think seeing him live, as opposed to on TV, shows how much he does on a field. As <a class="username" data-user="86698, @Captain Hindsight" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86698/">@Captain Hindsight</a> said, it's a tired debate that's been done hundreds of times on here and I can't really be bothered, but I think it's crazy for people to suggest he's not good enough for a club like ours as if he's getting a free ride just because of his marketing status or something.

76~~~
If he plays up front all season, I'm confident he'll get more than 20.

77~~~
The guy somehow manages to score 14 goals whilst playing in midfield, strike and feckin defence. He's never failed to score less than 10 goals for us, and has only ever had two seasons where he has played upfront, consistently.

For the first time in forever, we have a real midfield with actual mid-fielders, along with bags of creative players. I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get 20 goals this season.

78~~~
He needs to deliver or else we're in trouble.

Hope striker we're after is going to give him some real competition for place up top, rate him but it would be silly going into season with Rooney as only real option for the striker postion.

79~~~
The exact same debate everywhere at the start of every season : what to do with Rooney. 13-14 it was sell him and play welbeck and chich with rvp and we would be fine. At the end of the season : top scorer- Wayne Rooney 

14-15 - after signing falcao, cries of drop Rooney, play rvp falcao and mata. End of season top scorer - Wayne Rooney.

Every year same thing

80~~~
Danny Ings would score 20 for us playing upfront. Rooney is nothing special at all these days.

81~~~
I predict 30 goals for Rooney next season in all comps next season.

82~~~
I think he will score at a ratio of 2 every 3 games. Let's hope he stays fit for most of the campaign.

83~~~
There is only one person to blame for that match and it's Fergie. Playing Park, Scholes and Giggs was moronic.

84~~~
Probably.

85~~~
Rooney is not scoring more than twenty goals in this system we are playing....

86~~~
I think I'd rather see Rooney in behind the front man, that is, if mata is not.

87~~~
Baloney. I have been working for almost a year now to start and cultivate these rumors and get him shipped out. The San Jose Earthquakes need a big star and it would be a good local rivalry with Gerrard in LA. Or Beckham has just agreed a stadium deal so The Miami Beckhams will be playing soon and Rooney would be a perfect fit. He could come the USA with all the fanfare of "Beckham Mk. II" Mister Big Stuff, England record goalscore, and MUFC 2nd best goalscorer.

88~~~
He's lost considerable pace. We need to play him as a number 10. Sorta like Cantona/Sheringham. But we need an Andy Cole in the team.

89~~~
Fecking hell, how many headed goals did he score that season? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

90~~~
He's going to be playing in Big Duncs testimonial on the 2nd of August against Villareal.

91~~~
This sort of number crunching is what lead people to believe that Welbeck was capable of scoring 20 goals upfront in a season, didn't really work out. Strikers need to be playing upfront to gather momentum and sharpness in the final third. If he's being shifted around throughout the season to plug holes he's never going to score goals consistently uptop. I personally don't see any difference in him physically from moyes last season and he got 17 in the league then in a struggling team playing as a second striker. He won't be struggling to get it done this coming season.

92~~~
He's played striker basically every week since RVP got injured, hasnt impressed at all. It isnt even that he's not scoring goals, but his general play has been in massive decline too. You rarely see him combining well with another player, touches of brilliance, speeding up our play as he used tho.

93~~~
Really? In his whole career over a decade here, he has had no more than two seasons where he has scored over 30. Having been on the decline over the last three years, what makes you think he can score 30? Heck even any world class player not named Ronaldo or Messi would be flattered with 30 goals in a season

94~~~
Those two seasons he played as a striker.

95~~~
Mmm remember him in midfield in some games besides Hererra even when RVP was injured. Again, we shipped him from a long spell in midfield mid-season and hope he'll randomly bang them in for fun. Combining well with which player? It takes 2 to tango and every other attacker in the team was having the worst years of their careers. Fellaini isn't some playing you combine with and when he's playing as a 9 that speeding of play stuff is none of his business.

96~~~
Think Rooney started playing up front again vs Preston.

Preston - 1 goal
Sunderland - 2 goals
Newcastle - 0 goals
Arsenal - 1 goal
Tottenham - 1 goal
Liverpool - 0 goals
Villa - 1 goal
City - 0 goals, 1 assist
Chelsea - played midfield alongside Herrera. Fellaini played off Falcao.
West Brom - midfield
Everton - 0 goals, got injured late on
Crystal Palace - 0 goals, got rushed back from injury and injured himself again, didn't last the first half and was subbed off.
Hull - 0 goals, first game back from injury.

6 goals and 1 assist in 10 games, not counting Crystal Palace because he got injured early, the Chelsea game because he started next to Herrera in midfied and West Brom because he played in midfield.

97~~~

98~~~
Combining well with Mata, Young who where in quite good form during that spell? Its not only that he wasnt bangin them in for fun, his much praised general play and him bringing more to the team, was non existent too. Wat is the extra Rooney brings to the team anyway compared to other strikers? The pass wide to Valencia which leads to nothing most of the time? Some few years ago for a striker he had great link up, hold up play and was fairly creative, he really has this no more than strikers as Suarez, Benzema, Lewandowski, Aguero, Ibrahimovic at the moment. And being played in midfield shouldnt stop you from that when you get back in the offence.

99~~~
According to WhoScored he played 14 games as a striker and scored 4 goals.

100~~~
They're wrong then.

Edit: Saw one website put Rooney down as midfield for the West Brom game. So basically 6 goals and 1 assist in 10 games since LVG reinstated Rooney to striker at the end of the season. Not as terrible as people made out stat-wise. Sure to get better service this year and a proper run of games as well. Can't be easy going from midfield one game to number 9 the next.

101~~~
I hope for all us fans that Rooney proves me wrong - but I'm pessimistic about him playing as our loan striker - can't see him consistently scoring for us. I really think he's lost his edge (seems that way since before SAF left), but hope I'm wrong.

102~~~
How's he gonna combine with young who's always on the touchline? Mata was preoccupied with link ups with Herrera.
Have never understood why he gets blamed for Valencia being absolutely useless. 
He still has all that, however Van Gaal likes his strikers not to get all that involved in games. 
Let's just see what happens this season mate.

103~~~
How did he play? Awful?

104~~~
Messi/Ronaldo incarnated with a dash of Edwards with feet of Best.

Stunning!





Was ok, nothing great. Like so many others today.

105~~~
I only saw a bit of the game but he looked a little slow to react...I can't help but think we're all dreaming if we expect Rooney to score more then 20+ this season.

106~~~
I don't know why are people so persistent with mentioning the numbers he will or will not score when he hasn't showed for years that he can actually hold the ball properly as a striker. Even if he scores 30 if he can't put decent all around performances then he is simply not good enough to lead the line. I don't doubt that he will score decent number of goals, my biggest worry is his all around play which is more than average as a lone striker.

107~~~
Worried about him, but when the season starts if we create chances I expect him to put them away.

108~~~
He either plays at 100mph or not at all. 

I think he's been pretty poor in preseason so far, but I don't think that's going to be indicative of his season to come.

109~~~
Bollocks...

With a full pre-season, no injuries, and a full season up front, I fully expect the scouse cnut to break Sir Bobby's record this season, and then some...

110~~~
Don't think he was as bad as people are making out. I mean, his one touch play was pretty good, and played a big part in the first goal, where he played a nice through ball to Young to set off the attack.

111~~~
He hasn't been too good yet, some nice passing though and his touch has been mostly good as well. I'm not worried though, him and quite a few others seem to mostly be taking the first two games as a way to get fit which seems fair enough to me. No point going all out in a preseason friendly.

112~~~
If he plays up top, I just hope he stays up top and doesn't drop deep and faff about.

113~~~
Fitness seems to be in an issue for him. I can see him having a slow start to the season

114~~~
Exactly what we don't need from him.

115~~~
Play him up top without fecking him around in the midfield and he will definitely score 20 + (if there are not injuries) honestly might even score 30.

116~~~
I don't think he's lost "considerable" pace. Maybe not as quick as a young Rooney but he still has a lot of pace. If you're basing this on the friendly then I'd suggest not to. Players try to not injure themselves in games like that.

117~~~
He's not looked sharp so far, hopefully it's just some rust.

118~~~
Still getting into his rhythm but with more pace in the team to support him, all he has to do is get in the positions and I'm sure he'll do well

119~~~
Thought his all round game was on point but he barely looked a goal threat.

120~~~
I think Rooney looked good with his link play yesterday, nice little touches. The issue, is he just doesn't threaten the goal enough anymore. His natural instincts appear to be that of a midfield player. Depay, for instance, who plays deeper, has a greater instinct for scoring it seems. There will be more situations, half chances, scuffed shots etc where he is looking to actually threaten the goal. Rooney seems to do it once or twice a game.

I also think it is wrong for <a class="username" data-user="28799, @AttackingFlair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28799/">@AttackingFlair</a> to show a video of Rooney finishing well 6 years ago and say 'surely he can still finish like that?'. In that case, we don't have to go back nearly as far and we could say the same of RVP.

And will the caf ever dispense of this theory that Rooney has basically spent his entire career in midfield, give or take the odd game, in which he probably scored 4 each time you would think. Rooney has predominantly been a striker for his entire career, sometimes on his own, sometimes with another striker (just as the likes of Suarez, Aguero, Henry have) - and on the grand scheme of things, has played in 'midfield' very, very fleetingly. You can't classify seasons where he played just behind RVN or Saha or Smith or whoever, with 4 actual midfielders behind him as 'playing in midfield', which is what people seem to be trying to do. Now he has apparently played up front for only 2 seasons in his career, which is absolute shite.

Anyway, back to 'performances', there were certainly positives in his game last night, but if we are to insist on playing him centre forward, we could definitely do with a Pedro or Bale to help out, as Rooney spends too much time as a creator. His touch was good against San Jose though. And I'd still back him to take a presentable chance if and when it falls to him. I just don't think the if and when will be frequent enough. It isn't his game for it do so. He isn't in scoring positions/situations often enough.

121~~~
It's early season now. Rooney always take some time to get started. 19 goals this season guaranteed.

122~~~
Wasn't really going on pre-season alone tbh, but point taken.

Around 19 is what I expect from him too. Not convinced that 19 is worth the billing anyway, nor all the shifting around of the striker department and the search for 'back-up' so that the conditions can be right for a 19 goal striker - but it will probably do for us, providing the rest of the team works well.

123~~~
No excuses this time really. He'll be our main CF with little competition, he'll no longer be forced into midfield and will this time have a potent midfield supplying him.

Assuming he stays healthy I don't see why he shouldn't accumulate 25+ goals across all competitions. If he fails to do so then we should seriously a consider a more resourceful forward the season after.

124~~~
25 total should be the bare minimum expected from him, injuries notwithstanding. I think he'll get that, and more, quite comfortably, but if he doesn't we should definitely be looking for another top of the line striker to replace him come next summer.

125~~~
I can see him fail this season and become a big problem for us. His fitness level and form is always a question mark and the main reason he was never closer to Messi or Ronaldo

126~~~
One thing that also should be remembered is that Rooney's coming on for about 14 summers now. He's almost 30 as it is, but is also very high mileage. He's been playing top flight football, largely with a very high-octane style, since he was 16, involved in every summer tournament too.

127~~~
I thought he was meh in the first game, a bit better in this one. Overall his touch was good, his passing was pretty good, but you can tell he's treating the games as a way to get his fitness back (as other players are, and as they should) and not committing too much. Really hard to take much away from these so far, we're not even playing with the set up we'll likely be using for most games.

128~~~
He should aim higher.

129~~~
Well here it is for you, Wayne, a season upfront as our main striker. Amaze us.

130~~~
He needs to be aiming higher than that, else he will find himself on the bench/sold after this season

131~~~
Guess it depends on how the goals around him go.....Lewandowski got away with Robben scoring more than him despite playing 10 less games. Can see Depay going double figures easy depending on his usage, Mata's a scorer though double figures could be a push. That's not including ADM, Young, Wilson, Adnan.....I'd like 50 from the forwards regardless if it's a defensive season in the Premiership or not.

132~~~
It was in a response to someone saying you need to beat players to score 30+ goals, I was just pointing out that you don't need to beat defenders 1 v 1 to score a lot of goals and the clip showed that. Nevertheless, I do feel that Rooney hasn't played number 9 consistently since that season and do feel that he's capable of converting those type of chances that 9s do usually get. The RVP comparison isn't right considering he's played as lead striker all the way throughout his United career, we actually haven't seen Rooney consistently as a 9 since 6 years ago. This year will be good to judge if he can still do it. But I'm not just going to assume that because he scored X amount of goals in a variety of roles that that ratio will be the same for him as a number 9; I don't think that would be a fair assessment. This season will be a fair assessment.

133~~~
So what exactly are we saying on the caf? I actually just want to clarify because I am genuinely confused by a lot of what I've read. Are we basically saying that Rooney has infact barely been a striker, and has played the large majority of his games for us in midfield?

134~~~
Over the last 3 seasons he hasnt had many decent runs as a striker. He has been shifted around by 3 different managers. I think if he gets to play just as a striker for a decent run of games his form will improve and he will score goals for us. Its hard for anyone to be a 30 goals a season player when you are moved around as some sort of utitilty fix it man.

135~~~
How did you come that conclusion from the post you quoted? (or any other in this thread)

136~~~
It has been a common topic of discussion for years of Rooney's 'sacrifice ' - when Ronaldo was here, the reality of Rooney playing a handful, two handfuls of games at best on the left wing has now turned into a 'he was shunted out to the wing for Ronnie' theory. I have read that the only two seasons that are fair to consider his output should be two seasons where he played as a 'number 9' and therefore got good goal returns. I don't think I fully get it tbh. If by that, we mean as a lone striker, then perhaps we mean that Rooney should only play up front in a 4-3-3. However, from my recollection Rooney has played in front of 4 actual midfielders for the majority of his career, so I just don't get the frequency to which his position is used to defend him on the caf. Be it with Ruud, Saha,  Smith, Berbatov, Tevez or Van Persie - Rooney has pretty much always been onew of two strikers in a partnership for us. He has played a few games in actual midfield, but it is a really negligible amount for the amount of times it seems to be referenced.

To answer your question more directly, as I'm pretty sure I'll get a smart remark or whatever if I don't,  the post I quoted said that Rooney hasn't played as a number 9 with any regularity for 6 years. It just causes me to wonder where exactly he's been playing then. Fair enough, he has not been up front on his own (and as someone who has followed his career, again,  that is another myth that that was always some sort of consensus for being his best role, and anything else was a 'sacrifice '), but he has been one of two strikers. So yea, basically my last post was a result of a theme I had detected for years, is all.

I have read his good England record being used as an example a few times of late as to what he can achieve as a 'number 9', whatever that means in this context.  Again,  from my recollection,  he is used no differently for England. He is largely one of two strikers, be it with Sturridge, Defoe, Carroll or whoever. There has always been a question of 'who partners Rooney upfront? '. If that is how he should be used, I see no difference to how he has largely been used for us in his career.

For me, the reality is, the main difference between the Rooney of today and whatever season anyone would choose to reference I'd the fact that he was probably a better footballer then. This notion that the only issue is that he has since been stopped from playing up front I'd bollocks, in my humble opinion. He is no less of a striker than the likes of Suarez, Sturridge, Aguero or Henry who were all one of two strikers in the PL. I just don't by the position argument,  other than the games when he was actually told to line up either in the centre of the park or on the left,  which are very few and far between.

137~~~
Over the last season, he played games as an actual midfielder. Not really sure how that has turned into 3 seasons of him not really playing as a striker. Moyes had him and Persie up front, as did Fergie. Before, it was him and Hernandez.

138~~~
you have a short memory dont you

139~~~
That is perhaps not untrue. Please help to refresh me though, I am genuinely open to reminding of these runs, which have spanned across years, of Rooney not playing as a striker. I may well have just forgotten.

140~~~
Rooney added: ‘Everyone at the club knew that’s where I wanted to play (up front) and that’s why I was disappointed because  I got told to play in midfield and I didn’t want to. But I’d always go in and try to help the team, so I think there had to come a point where for my own career I had to be a bit selfish.

‘In the past I’ve had no problem playing out of position, but I felt I deserved to play in my position, which wasn’t happening. Naturally I was disappointed and maybe that affected some of the games I played. Maybe when I’m a bit older, losing my legs a bit, I can go back there (to midfield).’ 

From 2013, thats just from a quick google.

141~~~
I love the idea that centre mid in the premier league is some kind of easy cruise mode position for those who have lost their legs!

142~~~
I remember those quotes now. I can't much remember the circumstances around them, but I guess he was put in midfield by Fergie around that time, who by all accounts no longer saw him as a top class striker and was open to selling. I don't doubt that Rooney has had games in midfield anyway,  but I do think they are few and far between.  Predominantly, he is one of two strikers for club and country, and has been his entire career.

143~~~
For most of his career yes, the point I am making is that in the last few seasons he has been shifted around. Last season especially so. People on here think he is past it, well I dont know if thats true yet simply because he hasnt been able to have a consistent run up front for a while. You cant tell me that last season he was given a consistent run up front. Even in games where he started up front he sometimes got moved to midfield  to solve problems.

144~~~
The reason he hasn't played more as #9 for United in his career is because he simply isn't one. Oh he can play there and is a pretty good finisher more often than not and all said and done he'll probably rack up a decent goal tally but he just hasn't the instinct nor the game for a proper #9. The whole "Play Rooney up top and only up top" crusade is utterly baffling. Obviously, playing him as an actual midfielder or a DM is a bridge too far but he's quite blatantly a much better player when he plays slightly deeper. There's a reason multiple managers have all preferred to play him deeper despite the fact that he'd get a good goal tally if he played constantly as a striker.

145~~~
Oh I agree about last season.  But I also think the way in which he was used last season stands out quite clearly, even amongst recent seasons. When Moyes came in, his first words (not literally) were about how he had to get Rooney and Persie playing together upfront consistently. 

I do think he is past it, simply because I'm not much into making excuses for players, generally speaking. I can't accept that a player was a great player in 2009, and he hasn't been since then but there's mitigation. It may be slightly unfortunate, but you get judged on what you do, and what you don't do, ultimately. Will Keane has fair excuse for not looking as good as he once did, but that's neither here nor there, the fact is that he doesn't look as good as he once did. Probably not the best example considering the injury actually. Perhaps a better one was how, for years, I read 'we don't need to sign a new Scholes, we can sign X who can 'release Carrick ' who is not just a deep lyer, he can do it further forward etc'. Ultimately, whether or not that I'd true, Carrick will be judged on the career he actually had out on the pitch,  and not a bunch of hypotheticals. If LVG continues to play Memphis up front and he flops, despite the caf insistence that he is a winger, when it's all said and done, he'll be judged on what he does. 

For me, Rooney hasn't been a top class player other than the odd flash for 5 years. Whoever people want to 'blame' for that doesn't really matter to me. The fact is, he was the one out there, not being a top class player, while others have been out there being top  class players. Therefore, when listing top class players, Wayne Rooney would not be included in the top class players, while the top class players would be called the top class players. It is all on him to go out and reclaim that status on the pitch, and if he does that,  great for him and great for us. But for now, I will judge him as I see him, not based upon the unseen. And I don't see a great forward player when I watch him, not for a long while. Please believe me, if and when I do, I will say otherwise.  I don't hate him!

The funny thing is you guys have no idea how I talk in real life to others, especially non supporters. I sound like the posts I read on here, I defend him to the hilt. It's sort of like how you won't criticise your children to outsiders,  but on here, amongst family, I'm simply calling it as I see it.

146~~~
Terrible first touch, constantly destroying our play with it

147~~~
First touch's been all over the place.

148~~~
So many move break down because he has the first touch of a bulldozer. Really limits us when he is the focal point of the attack, this is why I hate that he's captain because he shouldn't be a guaranteed starter. We need to look for better.

149~~~
He's been shocking with the ball anywhere near his feet

150~~~
First touch of a player who has never seen a football before. How poor can one's first touch be? He does not look good enough to lead our attack if we want to win the league.

151~~~
Rooney's first touch and overall technique has become shocking over the past year. He keeps surprising me with every touch he takes. He just takes it on a whole new level.

152~~~
Honestly thinking selling him a few years ago when he asked to leave would have been the best solution, we would have been forced to go out and replace him. 

Now we're stuck with him as captain, starting whenever he's fit when truth be told he is nowhere near a top striker.

153~~~
Sluggish Wayne is back. Let his fitness levels drop too low over the summer again.

If he stays injury free he should be sharp again by late september. In the meantime he will frustrate us all.

154~~~
I sort of agree with you, although I think it also depends on his overall form. When Rooney's playing excellent football, he's a superb attacking midfielder and can be great at linking the attack and midfield. When his overall game is poor though (like tonight so far), and his touch is off, he can be a bit useless in behind the striker. In those cases, it's best to play him as more of an out and out striker, since he can still be a good goalscorer, even if his impact on the game is a bit more minimal.

155~~~
He had that kind of horrible touch for most of last season except for around 8 games.

156~~~
He doesn't look fit and it's still pre-season. I'll judge him vs Spurs.

157~~~
Hindrance aside from the goal.

158~~~
Astonishing goal!

159~~~
Has the first touch of a rapist.

160~~~
I think he's been fine.

161~~~
So what do we think it would take for him to be dropped this season (no, this is not a call for him to be dropped now, since it's the bloody pre-season)?

He seemed undroppable last season, and when we saw RvP and Falcao get the chop so easily this summer (granted, we can't get rid of all our strikers and Rooney was the better of the three) it should give the impression that Rooney isn't safe. However, you just feel that he is untouchable.

162~~~
I'm a Rooney fan, but by now his touch should be sorted. Dreadful.

163~~~
He won't be dropped because there won't be anyone better than him available for the team for that role.

164~~~
I don't think he's really untouchable because of his status at the club as such, but more simply due to the fact that he doesn't really have any genuine competition. We desperately need a new addition up front.

165~~~
To be fair, we have created the conditions for him to have no competition. We have sold all of his competitors, and who knows what will happen with Hernandez. As for a new recruit, it depends on who we buy. If they are not of a certain status, they will not bench Rooney regardless of how they perform I suspect.  At best, we will mask his 'dropping 'as a striker by moving him from that position and dropping someone else who is an easier target and playing Rooney there instead. 

And I don't think he's been as terrible as people are making out first half. Looks quite hungry in fact.

166~~~
True, I don't think LVG would've foreseen last year that we were going to come into the 2015/2016 season without Falcao and RVP. Our striking options looked pretty formidable last season, compared to now, where they look fairly poor and threadbare. Pedro will be a decent attacking addition, but not a top goalscorer that we still need if Rooney doesn't perform. Although he still might, to be fair.

167~~~
I said awhile ago that rooney would struggle to get 15 goals next season and was heavily slated, on this showing I stand by it. 

Laughable the rooney fanboys and rooney himself thinks he has what it takes to be our main man up front. I like Rooney and he's given us great service but no way should he be starting for us at this current time. We need someone to come in a challenge him and make him fight for striker spot. He's got it far too easy at the moment.

168~~~
He does have it too easy, but I think he'll comfortably get 15 next season, if only for the fact that he's penalty and free kick taker.

169~~~
In a nutshell.

170~~~
What will be laughable is this post and the fact you think he'll only get 15. Just had a bad preseason game but he will score at least 20 if he plays up front on his own.

171~~~
He'll do fine just needs to improve on his first touch and he should be able to do what Louis van Gaal wants from his striker, don't forget Louis used Olic at Bayern, Rooney will work hard, move around a lot off the ball to keep the defenders occupied and create space that Memphis can run into, he'll also take his chances when they come.

172~~~
Deserved MOTM. Presented by experts. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

173~~~
To be fair, it's hardly a guarantee, as such, especially if he does have a bad season, which is hardly out of the realm of possibility. Personally, I think he'll probably get somewhere between 15-25 in all competitions, but I don't think suggesting he won't is completely laughable.

174~~~
He'll be ready. I'm expecting him to have a big season.

175~~~
If Rooney continues this poor form from last season and takes it into the new season, I think we should drop him even if it's for Januzaj or some other player. His touch just kills every one of our attacks.

Some are saying it's preseason, you expect him to have this kind of touch but remember that he had this kind of touch for most of last season.

176~~~
He looks heavy, old and technically inept.

177~~~
As much as Rooney should be dropped if he's performing poorly, I'm not sure if swapping him for Januzaj would be advisable, since Januzaj's hardly an out and out striker, which is the position we're expecting Rooney to occupy.

178~~~
Playing for United, any decent/good striker can score 20 goals playing upfront being the main -  that's what I think. I think Rooney is definitely better than just decent/good and he'll easily score more than twenty if he's the main striker.

EDIT: what I found laughable that it's just his fanboys that think he can be United's main striker, as if he's some sort of has been.

179~~~
He hasn't scored more than 20 since 2011/2012, though. I know he's not always been the out and out striker in that time, especially last season, but he's still being played in an advanced role for most of the time. Even in 2013/2014, when we were largely dependent on him during Moyes' year, he didn't manage 20 in all competitions.

I see your point, and I expect Rooney may make 20, but I don't see how it's a guarantee. He's looking particularly sluggish at the moment, and while I'm sure he'll improve, to which level he'll improve to isn't guaranteed. I think Rooney's definitely looking a little bit past his best to an extent, and it's hardly guaranteed that he's going to lead the line for the entire season.

180~~~
I did laugh when he was given the MOTM. I did honestly think this would be his peak as a player. It does worry me it takes him about 4-5 games to get into full flow (when he does, he normally can go on a 5 or so games scoring streak).

Him having no competition is not a good thing though. For him and the team. If however he has games like this next season (where he doesnt do much except score and help the team win) not many will complain.

181~~~
I think he will have a season like 2011/12 where he will score a good few goals but will have a good few very questionable performances - as oppose to a season like 2010/11 where his performances were brilliant (especially in big games) but he doesn't score as many goals.

182~~~
I know I'll get shit for this but if you look at him and you look at the cannibal up top for Barcelona there is a clear gulf in quality, from pace to technique to dynamism to the ability to create something out of nothing.

183~~~
His second touch is basically a tackle 90% of the time.

Great header though.

184~~~
To me, Suarez is the best pure striker in the world right now. Nonetheless, Rooney is still a top player and most importantly, always good for a goal when played up top. That's still the most important quality I want in my striker.

185~~~
I think the fluidity to keep the attacking moves flowing as the focal point is just as important.

186~~~
And it's still a shit opinion.

187~~~
It's not as if he was completely useless in that aspect. Combined with his goal-scoring threat, he's still a good option up front and there aren't too many available alternatives on the transfer market to replace him with.

188~~~
I know, it seems like after the ball bounces off him on his clumsy first touch he has to run it down. I watch the Barcelona players cleanly receive and control the ball again and again, while Rooney is unable to do the same.

189~~~
For 15 goals, he need not even try.

190~~~
So many of our moves stall due to his erratic touch and average short passing game, I know options are thin right now, I just feel he's going to cause us some issues this season with the type of football we are trying to play.

191~~~
You won't get any shit because it is simply the truth and anyone denying should see a doctor regarding high level of bitterness. In every single aspect, Suarez is currently better.

192~~~
Completely agree. Even the most delusional fans of Rooney wouldn't disagree with that statement.

193~~~
Should have trained him to be a battering ram of a striker instead of fannying about as a number 10.

194~~~
Ok then great insight, we will see next season then won't we.

Yeah I've thought something very similar to that too.

His best two goalscoring seasons were 09/10 and 11/12. In 09/10 he scored loads and he played brilliantly, he was a proper inspiring force in the team and up until he injured himself in Munich he was up there with the best players in the world. He was truly the main man at Utd.

In 11/12 he scored loads of goals but I don't think he played particularly well in most of the games. He just seemed to pop up with a goal often. Example being I remember we beat Villa 4-0 near the end of the season and Rooney scored twice so on the face of it he had a good game but if you actually watched it he was fecking awful. There were a few games like that where he'd be shite but come away with a couple of goals.

There's a chance he could replicate the 11/12 season and score loads of goals, but I don't think we'll ever seem him put in 09/10 performances again. He's lost most of that magic.

196~~~
Agree entirely. Rooney is nowhere near what he used to be as a player.

Loads of games like yesterday next year. Scores a goal but horrendous touch and not great performanc. That'll be ok if he can get 20+ in the league, but when was the last time he did that?

197~~~
Oh man, how you'll laugh when proven right. Awaiting glorious day.

198~~~
I just can't see him having a truly great season, even though he'll most certainly get goals playing consistently as a striker.

199~~~
Many players are currently better than Rooney. There are plenty of better players in our team let alone mentioning the likes of Suarez and Aguero! Soon someone will quote me and mention his all time goal record but I don't really care about that. Rooney was a very good player but the Rooney from last season and this preseason so far doesn't deserve to start games.

The commentary on MUTV really pissed me off yesterday. Whenever Rooney has a shockingly bad touch they're like, "unlucky from Rooney there". Just say the truth! Say "How can a football player have such a bad touch?"

200~~~
If he plays as a striker, he'll score 20+ goals.  It's just baffling how bad his first touch is.  And it's been this way for a while now.

201~~~
Rooney will never get criticized on MUTV, they're understandably biased and he's the captain. The problem is that there is currently no other alternatives than to play him and hope he doesn't get injured.

202~~~
Rooney needs competition. I say it over and over, if you give him everything he wants - he becomes complacent. Why has no one noticed this on our coaching team??? Shouldn't Giggs know this already as he's been around him for years? Or maybe as Sir Alex is on tour there, he should say something to LVG. Upcoming season we want to win - no time to be indulging Rooney or anyone else for that matter. 

I want to be wrong, but Rooney has been so inconsistent for several seasons now that I cannot see him being the prolific striker we need this upcoming season.

203~~~
The Villa game is the example I was thinking of. 

I think the World Class Rooney from 2005-2011 is gone. He is now just a good striker, no longer a really good one in terms of performing.

204~~~
Needs to step it up. If not I'd rather watch Chicharito up front. He looked the part last season for Madrid when played.

205~~~
I agree that Wayne needs to step it up, other than the well taken goal last night he wasn't particularly good. He slowed our attack down far to much and his first touch at times was that of a Sunday league player.

BUT to want to replace him with Javier Hernandez, I'm sorry but that's crazy. It's surprising that he will even still be a United player next year, he shouldn't be anywhere near the first team.

206~~~
I honestly don't understand how a 'top' player can have such an appalling first touch. Its not even a particularity difficult part of the game. 

He was our best striker last season almost by default, because Falcao and RVP were so bad, but he seriously needs to step it up this season. Suarez (cnut) gave him a masterclass yesterday.

207~~~
Touch was awful and I'm a big Rooney fan.

I still think he'll have a good season. Takes a while for him to get into full swing. His touch may not improve dramatically as the season goes on, but he'll score goals and he'll continue his productivity for us with assists too.

208~~~
for poaching, chicharito is anytime much a prolific striker than te wazza.  at least the pea can score by using his face, isn't he?

209~~~
Just watched the game, and his first touch is beyond shiteous. It's like his boots have a magnet in them that repels the ball.

210~~~
I said it in the matchday thread, but if Rooney was as hungry to be the best he can be as Ronaldo is, he would've perfected his first touch about eight years ago. Shocking stuff last night.

211~~~
It's a damn shame how good he could actually be and how he truly is.

212~~~
Who do you think are the plenty better in our team?

213~~~
De Gea, Young, Herrera, Carrick and Mata all had a bigger contribution than Rooney over last season. Smalling also had a better contribution towards the end of the season right at the time Rooney became invisible.

I'm not saying Rooney was a bad player, he's been top quality and at times carrying the weight of a deteriorating midfield for quite a while but the Rooney we're seeing over the last year is quite a few levels below his best. I just can't understand why he can't consistently produce the same kind of form he produced during that really good spell of around 6 games he had last season.

From our current squad quite a few more players are added to that list.

214~~~
He truly is a master at papering over a below average to awful performance with a pair of goals.

215~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So many times I've raged at his general play and first touch, only for him to pop up with a goal. It's why he is tolerable nowadays. 

Still can't wait for him to retire or leave the club, which might be a few years away.

216~~~
Rooney nowadays is just a good player, who doesn't deserves the credit he gets to be the first name on the sheet every week as captain. He should have been benched tons of times due his performances over the past seasons, but it will never happen.

217~~~
if van gaal signs pedro, that is the clearest indication rooney is going to be the main number 9 this season. and he needs to get at least 20-25 goals. if not then van gaal will  get a world class CF next summer and rooney's position in the team is under more threat than ever.

218~~~
It's bizarre how his touch has gotten worse as he's gotten older. Most strikers (Drogba and RVP come to mind) it seems like their control improves by their mid 20s or early 30s. 

His movement was good against Barca, but his first touch, my god. I've been writing all summer that we don't need a 9 because Rooney will get 18+ goals if we give him 30-32 starts up front and that's tough to upgrade on in the current market, but if he gets 20 in 35 and there is a healthy number of penalties in there and his touch is this bad, it will be fools gold to some degree.

219~~~
if we rotate Rooney, Chica and perhaps Januzaj/Depay at the top we won't have the best attack in the league but maybe decent enough to fight for the title if all players maintain decent form or don't get injured at the same time. If it's really that bad we can go into market in January.. otherwise next summer we should be all in for Harry Kane..

Charlie Austin would be a good backup player for Rooney who these days isn't anything special himself..

220~~~
this one might be better suited to the "unpopular opinions thread" but what the heck. He'll score 20+ as a striker, 25+ if he'll be taking penalties as well.

221~~~
Really hope he beats Sir Bobby Charlton's record. That'll hopefully shut a few people up.

222~~~
Well it will be his 12th season at the club. His record isn't all that exceptional. He'll get it because he has been here so long, which in fairness is also an achievement in itself.

Just putting in perspective that Van Nistelrooy left with 150 goals in 5 seasons, including one which was essentially halved due to injury.

Rooney of course has not always played up top but just saying that he's the record goalscorer wouldn't exempt him from criticism.

223~~~
You seem to be missing the point somewhat. He's already scored a lot of goals, doesn't change the fact his overall game has gotten much worse. Scoring a few more goals won't shut people up if he continues to play badly.

224~~~
I believe Van Nistelrooy was played up top and not moved here, there, and everywhere. Had Rooney played up top, I'm pretty sure he would have beaten the record years ago.

225~~~
Just as I edited <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Of course, but when he breaks the record, it doesn't mean that he's been playing brilliantly to do so. It won't and shouldn't stop critcising him when he plays one of his increasing common clumsy, lethargic games.

226~~~
Didn't know there was a point that was made. I just think for a player that has given us 11 very good seasons, the amount of disrespect he gets is laughable, hence why I'd love it if he'd beat Sir Bobby's record.

227~~~
That's fine, but lets make sure its not just for Rooney then, eh? I say that because when some of the Spanish lads have a bad game you can't even say anything before people jump down your fecking throat.

228~~~
Of course. For example, I think Mata was let off lightly after the winning run and thought his level dropped a lot in a few matches at the end of the season. But I think a few people are worried with the way Rooney has performed so far in pre-season which might be unfair as the games mean nothing, but we will be relying on him massively to score and perform at a high level if we don't get another striker.

229~~~
I'm not worried about him getting 15-20 league goals, Charlie Austin managed 18 for QPR. It's the deterioration of the rest of his game that is the big problem.

230~~~
His overall play has declined heavily. Compared to a younger Rooney, it's very disappointing

231~~~
His overall game got better with the years, not worse.

What a pro.

232~~~
Just for the record, it is quotes like this that I was referring to during our last communication on this matter <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>

233~~~
Please do not compare van Nistelrooy's ability in front of goal or consitency to Rooney's. It's on a completely different level.

234~~~
With Rooney you can expect goals and productivity but you can no longer expect him to be a game changer, he hasn't been that for a while and frankly I don't see how he's going to become one suddenly because he moves to a striker position.

Also, the thing with him is that when he's not in form he's a pretty terrible player aside from workrate which he always puts. His touch is abysmal when he's off his game.

235~~~
Well, if that were true and he could be a consistent goal scorer for the whole season, then we wouldn't have that argument here. But the most common thought is that after a few good games he's suddenly rather shit, so zero consistency, and that's what makes me worry and doubt that we can be a top team with him as a main striker. Consistency over most of 38 games is key.

236~~~
How many will he miss?

237~~~
I think that given the penalty taking, he'll certainly get between 15 and 20. Tat isn't an embarrasing number by any means, but I'm not sure it's good enough for Manchester United either. Surely our undisputed #1 striker should be better value than 15-20 league goals. There is certainly room to improve there, and I don't get why we have gone through a whole summer upgrading every position we can, while selling off all of the other strikers and doing all sorts of interviews about how Rooney is now 'the main striker' to create the perfect conditions for him to get his 18 goals. It is not that special, especially given spot kicks. I mean, Yaya is first choice pk taker for City, and Gerrard was for Liverpool when they managed to have not one, but two strikers get over 20 league goals.

I was reading a journo debate on twitter about him yesterday, one of them proposed that 2005/6 was Rooney's best season. Of course, there was also argument for 2009/10, but the debate was that he had become a poacher by then, but was a better player in 2006. It saddened me that there is a debate that our main striker, who is still in his 20s - was either at his best 10 or 6 years ago.

We need competition up top, although I think Adnan may well step up and start (well, resume) his journey towards superstardom.

238~~~
Zero, or one.

239~~~
Its not disrespect, its fact, for a long time his first touch has been piss poor and whilst he still scores, he is also responsible for a lot of our moves breaking down due to poor first touch and inconsistent short passing.  Scoring a feck load of goals over the years doesn't exempt him from valid criticism. 
And he hasnt been played here there and everywhere, he has played a handful of games in midfield and the rest of his time somewhere across the front line, lets not make out he's John O'Shea.

240~~~
Your wums in this thread are very boring. You make yourself look like an idiot with posts like that, I am surprised you aren't thread banned by now, you are just ruin the thread for no reason.

241~~~
Well, apart from the fact that he has a penalty conversion rate (in the PL) of 69% (so scores 7 out of 10, will miss at least 1 for every 3/4 penalties taken... however you want to dress it up)...

242~~~
With van Gaal's penalty rotations I don't see any other way.

Wow, that's rude as hell, and I do believe his overall game got better.

243~~~
Oh, I was just asking if he exclusively took penalties - which the orignal poster was suggesting he do.

LVG's penalty system is really fecking dumb though... I mean, is it too much to ask for the club to have a professional footballer who can score consistantly from 12 yards so I don't have to shit myself everytime we get a penalty?

244~~~
No Irwins or Cantonas in the club any more. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

245~~~
It's actually fine. You take them until you've failed, it's fair.

246~~~
From late 2012:

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Penalty kings</b></span>
Louis Saha 4 out of 4 - 100%
David Beckham 2 out of 2 - 100%
Dimitar Berbatov 2 out of 2 - 100%
Ryan Giggs 2 out of 2 - 100% 
Eric Cantona 14 out of 16 - 88%
Cristiano Ronaldo 11 out of 13 - 84%
Ruud van Nistelrooy 18 out of 22 - 82%
Denis Irwin 8 out of 10 - 80%
Wayne Rooney 13 out of 20 - 65%
Javier Hernandez 1 out of 2 - 50%
Robin van Persie 1 out of 2 - 50%
Paul Scholes 1 out of 3 - 33%
Teddy Sheringham 1 out of 3 - 33%
Michael Carrick 0 out of 1 - 0%
Nani 0 out of 1 - 0%
Dwight Yorke 0 out of 1 - 0%

Rooney improved since then though. 4 out of 5 I believe.

247~~~
It's been discussed to death (pros & cons and whatnot) but ultimately, it puts a needless added layer of pressure on the taker.

Plus, even the greatest penalty takers miss some. I mean, if we had Irwin himself reincarnated at the club, should we take him off penalty duties if he misses one? Now obviously we don't have an Irwin around... but, considering the talent we have in our squad, we bloody well should.

248~~~
I wonder if Sir Bobby has a section of veteran fans that are still trying in desperation to paint his legacy in a more humbling light?

249~~~
Van Persie only took 2 penalties? I thought he had more than that

250~~~
He did. That table above is from end of 2012 year.

251~~~
Berbatov also took a terrible penalty against Everton in the Cup, although it was a shoot out so it might not count.

252~~~
Yeah, everyone should bow down to the wisdom and intellect of your terrible posts on Rooney instead.

253~~~
Mine's just an opinion, which I explain every time, and which as you can see many agree with. (S)He just posts ridiculous stuff like this:




There were also far worse posts last season from him/her last season too in Rooney thread.

254~~~
In a sea of moaning, it's just a bit of lightheartedness. But whatever, guy. If you have a problem and think mod should intervene, report them. Far better than calling people idiots.

"Ridiculous", hah.

255~~~
It was just a cocky penalty that failed.

From what I remember he had a pretty good record at Spurs.

256~~~
Well his pace is gone, no engine and he hasn't played well for us in decades. I'd object to him being undroppable too.

257~~~
Didn't Rooney air two attempts in the last two games.  One was a low cross from the left, and the other a Darmian cross from the right.

I really hope he bangs them in this season, or else we aren't going to be challenging much!

258~~~
His movement is fine.

But his all round play and hold up of the ball is terrible. And he tries to do fancy flicks too many times, when a simple pass would do.

259~~~
Really can't see him scoring anywhere near 20 goals. Unfortunately he's completely undroppable.

260~~~
20 goals my ass.

261~~~
I agree his movement is decent and there were some good link up with Memphis at times in the first half.

However his first touch is shocking (so loose). I do worry that we will rely on him, hes captain and he never gets subbed (and will start every game). He basically has no competition and tbh, he plays best when he has something to prove and has hunger for the game.

262~~~
His first touch lets him down but the one thing that could instantly make him a better player is not trying to back heel it. I think he could do with being more selfish too and taking more opportunities for himself.

263~~~
I see Rooney has added a lot of consistency to his game.

264~~~
I actually thought his first touch, especially in the first half, was okay. However, he needs to put far more pressure on the back line if he's playing as a 9 and the constant roaming about the pitch is unnecessary. His link play in the second half was awful.

265~~~
Overall his tour has been underwhelming. Tried to combine with Memphis but they haven't managed to create a great deal.

266~~~
We sold the wrong striker.

267~~~
You could do a video of that performance to the Benny Hill theme tune.

268~~~
We need a striker that have a presence and can link-up with our attacking players, unfortunately they are rare and the ones good enough are not available.

Maybe Januzaj can impress if given a chance.

Rooney isn't good enough anymore and that is not based on this pre-season.

269~~~
He's a 'poor' footballer, and we are beyond fecker if we are sentenced to 3 more years or whatever is left on his deal with him as undisputed 9. He will get some goals, but overall, the amount of strikers who can replace what he offers us is worryingly big, to the point where it includes Charlie fecking Austin, who would probably at least match his output in our side. Seeing as his all round game has gone to site,  we can't even argue that Rooney offers much more than Austin elsewhere.  He's basically in the team to get goals alone, and he probably doesn't get enough of them for that anyway.

270~~~
Just put Adnan up top and be done with it regardless of the outcome. At least he will play with more hunger if he's given his chance. 
We're in trouble if Rooney doesn't sharpen up immediately. Continuing to choose him regardless of his performances is really pissing me off. Make him fight for his place ffs.

271~~~
I see of people bemoaning his touch always after games, but I raised this concern in another thread - does Rooney actually play like a centre forward? All his instincts to me look like those of a number 10. The desire for possession retention, the dropping deep and playing a safe pass, even when he finds himself in space in attack he looks like a number 10 whose landed up in an attacking position. Now, I know last season he had some good moments in attack but my question is more to do with style. I don't see the physicality nor that instinct of a centre forward where they light up in the box to do something impactful.

272~~~
He already became a problem some years ago. I genuinely thought RVP was better than him even last season. Rooney doesn't seem to have any particular strenghts in his game to play with. Even the most criticized players like Valencia, and all the players we've let go, had something they're very good at. 

"First touch" is definitely not the only problem he has. It will yet again be very frustrating to watch him start game after game next season.

273~~~
He's done. Struggling to see why people keep making excuses for him when all the signs point to him being done as a footballer of the highest calibre. Always with the "his touch/movement/passing was ok/not bad", "but he needs to to do this and that etc." and "he needs better players around him, not his fault he's playing shit".

He's has played at the top level for close to fifteen years now which surely has put a strain on his body. I would love to be proven wrong as he is a legend but it's infuriating to watch him continuing to deliver perfomances not even close to be worthy of his status and standard (not a knee-jerk reaction based on pre-season alone, but the fact that he's continuing from where he let off last season).

274~~~
Position wise he's a number 10. And that's as far as his "number 10-ness" extends. His first touch, vision, control, dribbling and overall technical ability are severely lacking; all of which are number 10 attributes. 

He isn't a playmaker, nor is he a good enough striker. He's a master of nothing.

275~~~
That wasn't my point. I'm not talking about his qualities nor his current position. I'm talking about his instinct. Rooney has never been a great number 10. His goals have always been the overriding factor that has made it work regardless. But he's got a number 10's instinct for me which isn't aided by his real lack of physicality, which is funnily enough a common and harmless trait among number 10's but not one you want as a centre forward, particularly if you aren't extremely quick.

276~~~
Rooney may think he can get United 20 goals plus ,but on today's showing he has a lot of convincing to do.

277~~~
I'm officially annoyed if we're going to be solely dependent on Rooney to come up with the goals and keeping the team shape as it is.  It's so obvious he's not a #10.  Neither is Memphis.  If LVG is adamant that Rooney is our striker, then Memphis needs to be shifted out to the wing and Mata needs to be our main creative force behind Rooney.  We'd have been better off keeping Kagawa playing behind Rooney ffs.  Very tough to judge our strikers on the amount of service they're currently given.  Seeing the way Zlatan drops back and play the midfield in comparison to Rooney makes me wanna cry.

278~~~
There is a stage which a player eventually reaches and he needs to go. That time has come for Rooney like it did for both Scholes and Giggs. We're Manchester United, we need players who can perform at their best every week.

279~~~
The glorious day is getting closer!!! 

every "performance" (if it can be called that) he puts in just reiterates my point, yet we've still got some clueless muppets that reckon he can lead the line and bag us 25 goals. Talk about delusional, brings me back to my original post when I said he won't even get 15 goals, can I reduce that to 10 goals now? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

280~~~
Similarly, I really don't see Rooney getting anywhere near 25 goals. The spine of the team lacks at least one top class central defender and a central striker who will stay in position and not try to do everyone else's job for them.

This being the case I don't see great things for us this season, 3rd at best.

281~~~
Didn't watch the game, I bet he played exactly how Van Gaal wants his striker to play.

282~~~
Could be his last season as a starting player if he doesnt deliver. Unfortunately, we dont have a player who could push him or steal his place

283~~~
I am just waiting for the realisation of what I have been saying for two years to slowly dawn on the rest of you. He's not good enough anymore.

284~~~
He may cost us big this season if he doesn't step up. LvG HAS to drop him if he doesn't start scoring soon.

285~~~
But where's that silent domination???

286~~~
Save for that silly cross attempt at the end of the half, what did he do that was so wrong? Fine touch today, good link up play with others, especially Memphis (but vice versa wasn't that good)...

We looked worse in other areas.

287~~~
He will be better in the official games. But only for 2-3 months. And then he will be average again as it was the case in previous seasons. Still a good player but not good enough to be the main striker for a top top club. I thought that LVG made the right call when he made him captain. Now I think that was a mistake and it could cost LVG the managerial post at United. Our attack is worse than Liverpool's. I hope I'm wrong though.

288~~~
we sold RVP but if we dont buy a striker we're in trouble.

289~~~
It's a pretty big elephant in the room.

290~~~
I bet that he won't pass the 15 goals this season. Slow in his movements, doesn't fight enough the defenders and look lonely so many times on the field.

291~~~
I said at the time Moyes giving him that 5 year contract was stupid. Rooney isn't going to age well at all, that much is abundant.

292~~~
You mean not being capable of making the simplest of passes and playing 10 yard through balls out for a goal kick and going out wide when we don't even have a striker inside the box?

293~~~
No, I mean he follows orders well and he's playing exactly how Van Gaal wants him to play.

294~~~
It is funny how some seem to happy to be "right" about Rooney possibly not being good enough anymore. Like proving a point is so important on these boards.

295~~~
I thought he was good against PSG, his touch was very good and his link up play with Memphis was excellent. Tired towards the end though. 

People on here are mental; my PSG supporting friends who watched the game thought he was one of our best players (were also impressed by Memphis and Darmian), and the 'shit touch' is becoming a ridiculous trope that is just rolled out even if he's having an excellent game.

296~~~
Agree with all of that.

297~~~
Forget proving a point on forums. Why is LVG even taking such a risk. It's crazy to think that we will be challenging for the title with just one top striker. It takes crazy to another level.

298~~~
I don't understand what games people watch when it comes to Rooney. Why does every little bad touch need to be exaggerated to gigantic proportions while all the good things are completely ignored? Not that he was great but if you hadn't watched the game you'd think he played like he was Ali Dia reincarnated.

Indeed. He's not a #9, never has been. Posted this a few days back:

299~~~
Seem to be in the minority but I actually thought Rooney played pretty well today, he had good movement and played a couple of nice passes like the lay off to Memphis. I think there are a lot of posters just jumping in the Rooney hate train because it's become the 'thing to do'. Our biggest problem today was that Young had a poor game by his usual standards and mata just doesn't convince me that he's a natural winger. I honestly think people don't realise just how much we lack creativity, I think any striker in the world would struggle with our current play and it's not a coincidence that 3 world class strikers have failed since LVG came in, it's an impossible job and Rooney is doing as well as he can do.

300~~~
Most definitely.

301~~~
Really, really don't like the idea of us starting the season with him as our only first team striker.

I know he's captain, but LVG shouldn't exempt him from being dropped if he's adamant that no one's place is guaranteed everywhere else on the pitch.

302~~~
This 100%, some gross exaggeration taking place as usual

303~~~
This, completely. He had a few very neat touches throughout the game (stuff that we drool over when Mata does it), and was pretty consistent overall. He has some bad touches, of course, but the majority of players do throughout a game when they're under pressure, when they receive a bad pass, etc. There are some players who can kill a ball dead whatever the circumstances, but not many. Rooney doesn't have a 'shit touch' in any case. 

Welcome to the sensible gang.

304~~~
He's meant to be the talisman, the captain and the highest earner in the team yet he can't stand out between the youngsters. Doesn't offer any goal threat either. That's a problem. Something others were shot down for. This silent domination can't go on forever. Why are people satisfied with what he delivers on the pitch these days? It certainly won't lead us to improvement. Some are just blind towards his decline I guess and can't admit it.

Any run of the mill striker can do the things he does nowadays.

305~~~
I've not seen the match, I'll probably watch it later.

306~~~
Because it's pre-season and it's meaningless? 

It's often the case that younger players are going to be much better in pre season as they're trying to catch the manager's eye, whereas the more senior players treat it as warm up games where it's important to get back fitness and not get injured. A few of our players have been meh in this pre season, yet I'm sure they'll turn out to be very important performers for us during the season.

307~~~
Do you really think I'm only basing it on these 4 games? He was the same last season bar a few games. He need competition and this captain must always play needs to stop. Far too comfortable in this side and it's causing problems. He offers literally no goal threat.

308~~~
So is Rooney this years bashing target?. Just want to know so i can prepare to slag him off.

309~~~
Isn't he every year?

310~~~
Criticising a players performance = slagging him off. Renders message boards meaningless.

311~~~
Every year that he's a bit shit, so yeah, probably.

I haven't seen the game, so won't comment on last night. But after starting last season saying he was let down by LVG moving him deeper when striker is his best position he's done absolutely nothing to confirm it. 

I don't remember his last MOTM performance, or even just match winning performance - upfront or otherwise, but particularly upfront there's been nothing.  

Lack of goals, lack of presence - lack of quality.

312~~~
So Rooney's been shit every year eh? This place...

Looking at the last 3 seasons, he was our 2nd best attacking player player in '12-13 but that got lost amidst the transfer request. The following season he was our best attacking player but that got lost amidst all the "Moyes is sucking him off" posts. And last season he was up there with Young as one of our better attacking players for most of last season. This was after every man and his dog was dead certain that Van Gaal would fall out with the fat scouse prick the moment he laid his eyes on him only for him to be named captain.

If Wayne Rooney has been shite, then that doesn't say much for every other attacking player in the squad.

Although, I do agree he's declining and I'm shocked we haven't brought in someone capable of challenging Rooney on a regular basis.

313~~~
Let's be honest here, Van Gaal's position as United manager will be decided ultimately this season by his allegiance to Rooney. If that fails and we cannot score the goals required, Could easily see him out of the door. If it succeeds then he has made a great decision.

Guess time will tell, Although i'm not holding my breath as I think Rooney is well past his peak now.

314~~~
It was somewhat tongue in cheek. Though I do think the last 3 years Rooney has been 'a bit shit'. Compared to the average footballer? Obviously not. But compared to supposedly world-class 300k per week; soon to be goal scoring record holders; to the standards and expectations he set for himself previously - then yes, he's been a bit shit.

Was he really our second best attacking player in 2012/13? Does that really mean much even if true? You should compare him to players of his supposed quality, of his pay packet - and he was nowhere near the best players in our own league nevermind other European ones.

315~~~
I think everyone is quite normal with the thought that our attacking players are bit shit for almost three seasons, with Rooney leading the bunch by being given more chances than anyone else.

So even to you who want to praise him think that he wasn't clearly our best <i>attacking player</i>(let alone overall<i>)</i> in either of our last 3 seasons, even while our attacking players were mostly shit during that time and yet you wonder how people think he was bit shit during that time.
All that while he is pretty much only player who is undroppable and still considered as one of our best players by many, our best paid player, and again you and few others are amazed why are people criticizeing him. 

He was always going to be criticized, especially if he keeps playing average as he is for the past few seasons, and rightfully so.

316~~~
Aston Villa. But that fixture is usually a turkey shoot for him.

317~~~
He scored a quality and important goal admittedly, but he was still otherwise bang average that game.

318~~~
Left wing, right wing, up top, behind the striker and centre midfield. As I said, here, there, and everywhere.

319~~~
And please do not compare Rooney's position with Van Nistelrooy's.

320~~~
Wake up and read the match thread but end up getting pissed off when you see 20 comments in a row with FFS Rooney.

He will come good and go on his usual goalscoring run before Christmas, also is it just post Fergie where we have been so intense about pre season? 
I don't remember it being like this a few years back..

321~~~
Rated a 7.2 by the Caf a whole +0.6 clear of the average. Revisionism on your part most likely. I am pretty sure Herrera was the official MOTM in any case.

322~~~
Not revisionism. I went to the game and saw a recorded version again later on. Then on the podcast the 3 of us doing that episode all said the same thing. Good goal, good harrowing for the 3rd but generally fairly poor.

Maybe I just disagree with the rest of the Cafe's assessment, but 7.2 is hardly some great score. That's just good. If that's Rooneys best game in memory then it says everything you need to know.

323~~~
I agree, even if I think that Rooney can do some good matches up front, it is madness not to have signed another striker to properly put him under pressure. Rooney is in a big comfort zone at Utd, he doesn't have to give his best in every match since he knows he'll always start.

324~~~
There's a significant difference between being world class and being shit. And Rooney has quite clearly not been shit. Not by a long way.

And yes, he was by some distance at that although it's now fashionable to pretend that he was uber shit that season and Fergie repeatedly dropped him. He must have contributed close to 80 goals in those 2 seasons alone but yeah shit...<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

The rest of your post doesn't even make sense. Am I amazed that people are amazed that he's undroppable and call him shit when he's been one of our best players in the time period? Yeah, I definitely am because it's plain gibberish! Keep your strawman's to yourself.

And I really couldn't give two shits how much he earns and I have zero interest is classifying whether a performance was a 50k one or a 300k one.

325~~~
Of course, but in that case no one is ever shit. And every player to come through United's academy is amazing. Because compared to the average footballer, they totally are.

It's all relative, surely it makes sense to rate Rooney by his pay bracket and by the reputation he's built for himself, and his status in what is one of the world's biggest teams? By those standards, I'd say he's been a bit shit. He hasn't been winning us many games, showing moments of quality, winning us matches single handedly and as such hasn't been nominated for awards. 

Rating Rooney by the average United player seems weird to me. He's on 3 times more (atleast) than most of the team. Why should it be relative to them?

326~~~
Just one poster suggested that he was shit, I don't think anyone else really agrees with that, probably not even him if thinks about it. But the thing is that he was definitely not delivering half of what he is expected, so he will receive the criticisim. 

He wasn't shit as some other players, and when you are not shit as Valencia, Hernandez, and few others during that time that doesn't mean you were good. Sure, you can make it sound like he was one of our best attacking players but if you got bit into a detail it means feck all when they were all shit. He didn't even stand out in bad bunch.


Well, people do and people think that players should perform at least close that how they are paid to perform, which is fine, as clubs expect them to do that to, that's why they reward them with better contract when they do. He is obviously not even close as good as his wages suggest, so that's why his bad performances will raise more eyebrows than someone's like Blind's for example.

327~~~
What a weird comparison. Falcao was shit. Rooney wasn't. When someone's shit it's quite obvious they are shit whether that's playing for Luton Town or Manchester United. Rooney contributed to 40 goals in '13-14 for instance. That's not shit relative to anything.

I'm not sure how it makes sense. For a start, we don't even know how much the players are paid. It's all hearsay from a bunch of unreliable newspapers. Even if we did assume the papers got it right we have no idea of what the break up is. How much is the basic pay? How much is performance or appearance related? How much of it is image rights? We don't know. Basing something on what you have no idea about is a rather pointless pointless. In addition, wages are not entirely dependent or based on performances. Specifically to Rooney, his wages will no doubt take into account his marketability and the fact that he's been at United for a long time.

I'm happy to leave the accounting bit to people who have intimate knowledge of all details and judge players on they perform for the club. 

And my reply was to that one person.


The criticism is well over the top, which is my point. Most of our other top players get a bunch of excuses made for them. "Di Maria couldn't make a 5 yard pass because his house was burgled". "Falcao has fantastic movement and finishing. He's only shit because he doesn't get chances". "Mata is the most creative player in the squad and the only reason he doesn't create anything is because our strikers are shit". Not Rooney though. When he has a bad game or god forbid a bad touch, it's generally because he's shit and in decline and is root of everything that is wrong with United. Seems he's been in decline since he joined us. When a team is playing shit, you look at the players who are not playing well, not the one's who are.

328~~~
It is unnecessary pressure which both the team and Rooney can avoid. Let's not forget the shit sandwich LVG has to eat when He sees Rooney is no longer consistent up front. Just spulrge another 20mill extra and take a well informed risk, instead of a crazy one.

329~~~
I hope he does asap so the chances he will go to US will increase imo.

330~~~
We really should be after a striker. Rooney up front for majority of the season won't win us anything.

Rooney still has a role to play but not as our regular number 9. I hope LVG has noticed how Rooney stops a lot of attacking transitions by either a poor touch or a poor pass.

331~~~
Well, its obvious to me but the majority on here seem to think that we just get a back up striker for Wayne and we are sorted!

332~~~
If we going to play him and Depay up front, we better off switching them imo. 

Rooneys best strike partner was Saha, who was running in behind. I don't get why we haven't let them switch rather than having Depay as always behind Rooney.

333~~~
The issue with Rooney isn't that he still couldn't serve the squad, it's that we pay and treat him like an elite talent on the Ronaldo, Messi, Suarez, Neymar, Aguero etc.....level, and he's nowhere near that these days.

334~~~
If Rooney is our main striker for the season there is absolutely no way we will challenge for the title.

335~~~
Not me, he does not play the striker role well IMO. I would prefer a replacement, rather than a backup. Rooney is a talented player, but I can't think of one position in the United team where I would rather have him than another player. We have better wide players, better No. 10s, better midfield players. So that only leaves striker, and he doesn't do it for me. Not too impressed with the alternatives, hence, a replacement.

336~~~
I am beginning to wish SAF had stayed on and kicked his arse out of the door. Moyes giving him the captaincy and that contract is going to haunt us.

337~~~
I agree with the part that we treat him like an elite talent and he is probably one level below those players you mentioned. but nevertheless from a marketing point of view he deserves this kind of payment and that's what makes football difficult these days ...

338~~~
I still think his best position is the second striker. But obviously, our best front man

339~~~
Yeah but we would still be fecked to be honest, because we would have Welbeck up front if SAF had stayed. The market is looking very weak in terms of available strikers, so I cant see how SAF (who was as stingy as it gets in his latter years) would have adequately replaced Rooney. That being said, Moyes has indeed fecked us over by bending over for Rooney and we are stuck with a past it player on a superstars contract.

340~~~
Skipping over all the negative comments that might or might not be right, anyone thought that he is starting to forge a good understanding with Memphis? I like that they are looking for each other and their styles seem to be complementary.

341~~~
I've said the same thing many times, although in my observation, he is more a number 8 playing up front than a number 10. That doesn't mean I'm saying he belongs in central midfield, but he does seem like a centre midfielder playing 15/20 yards further forward. He doesn't have the quick change of pace/direction or dribbling of an archetypal 10, he is a worker, tries to hit long passes, can create, but not the most intricate creating like a 10.

He's like a CM who can finish well playing up top. Basically, if you played Lampard at centre forward, he'd look like the Rooney of today.

342~~~
Forums can get like that I guess, as it is always one extreme against the other. Can you imagine, on a United forum, for instance, the response people would generally be getting for saying Rooney is poor, rubbish, average, just 'good' or whatever?

343~~~
never thought of it that way, but that seems entirely accurate. good comparison.

he wasn't great yesterday, but it's early days. he always takes time getting into match rhythm. no reason to think he won't have an excellent year.

344~~~
Was fine today and its not like our other attacking players have been in breath taking form in the pre season or creating chances for fun. Rooney if played up top all season is definitely capable of getting 20+ goals and a half a dozen assists all season.
With that being said , I'm surprised we've not bought a striker yet or a young players who can challenge/eventually replace him once he gets older. Sometimes tough competition brings the best out of you.

345~~~
Yep, some lovely linking between the two. Rooney > Depay a bit more successful for the moment.

346~~~
Off the field, he is, and I reckon that shouldn't be overlooked. As much as I think Rooney is shit (relatively speaking of course), I do kind of understand his last two contracts. Timing is everything, and Stretford has done brilliantly by him.

During the whole 'he wants to go to City' saga, as a club, we were under threat. We had just sold Ronaldo, and brought in the likes of Valencia, Obertan etc - players at least a few brackets below Ronaldo. Rooney then went on to have his best season ever. He was then, the undisputed star in the team, and as a club, we were under pressure to put on a show of strength and show that we were still the same draw. The message that losing Rooney at that point would have sent would have been one of real weakness. We can't attract the best, and we can't hold on to our best. City were just emerging, and Rooney going there would have been too big off the field. It just so happened that his contract was up for review at the perfect time. A couple of years before, Ronaldo would have been here, and his chipswould not have been as high.

In the time that followed, we again signed a better attacking player than Rooney (Persie), and he went on to win the league for us. Fergie was in charge, and Rooney's influence on the team lessening. Again, if the timing were a bit different, Rooney would have held far less chips in renegotiation, as shown by the fact that he was almost out the door. However, fast forward a bit, and the club's image/reputation was again under pressure. Fergie had gone, and everone was waiting to see if the wheels would fall off. Moyes came in, and was shite. People were writing articles again about whether we could not only attract the best players, but even hold on to ours, especially if we didn't make the CL. Again, conveniently, Rooney's contract was up for renewal at a point where it would have sent far too negative a message off the field to lose our most recognisable name. It would have frther underlined the fears about us crumbling, and the club had to keep him, for stability's sake if nothing else. He was in a position once again to dictate his terms, despite the fact that around those two contracts, he had been often underwhelming.

347~~~
Fergie was never stingy when it came to strikers. He would have got Ronaldo back if he stayed. There was talk.

348~~~
It's true that he has had some very fortuitous timing in his career and his "street footballer" gimmick has been mined into a brand that has been a global success. However the scales have since tipped where that leverage is affecting the footballing side of things and that should never allowed to be the case.

349~~~
I agree. Although, as sad as it is, protecting the United brand is probably - probably, a bit more important than the success of the team short term. I imagine we aim for both, but allowing our image to slip is probably something the suits will not risk, and Rooney therefore had to stay while there were so many question marks off the field.

For a long time, Rooney has been in the top 3 most marketable footballers in the world (according to these lists they publish) along with Messi and Ronaldo. If you have one of those in that bracket, you maintain them. We couldn't be wheeling Fletcher out to sponsors worldwide, just because the caf seemed to think he was the best midfielder of his type in the world whenever it was when they thought that.

350~~~
The brand of United is much more about successfully competing for trophies than it is about having Wayne Rooney though. We got rid of Beckham at the height of his marketability and he was much more so than Rooney, because the manager felt it was the right time for the club. The main issue though isn't getting rid of Rooney, it's removing his safety net of guaranteed starter that is the bigger problem right now.

351~~~
We did get rid of Beckham, but the point is, there were no question marks about our status at the time. Becks had a great brand, but we were established as a super club. If it so happened that our obituaries were being written at the same time Fergie had a fall out with Becks, a conversation may well have been had and the decision not taken so easily. As it was, Fergie being there himself guaranteed a certain level of stability. Moyes, coupled with sub-par signings, added to rivals looking super strong paints a very different picture.

I also agree with you about Rooney not being a starter. He doesn't need to be sold as a player, although I think he may need to be sold to not be a starter in reality. If he's here, he'll play. I also have a suspicion that his captaincy and status were included in his last deal, which included him being an ambassador after he retires. It was just paper talk, but nobody expected LVG to even take to him let alone make him captain, and I just have a suspicion that those things were agreed before Louis even came. He was poor last season, and we have seen how he has treated others, even big names, that have been poor. There has been a notably different attitude towards Rooney. He was big enough to drop his own record signing for Young, sell his favourite in Van Persie, let go of Falcao - but not even a hint of discontent towards Rooney or threat to his place. I suspect that as long as he's here, he will play.

352~~~
It's a fair point that our last 2 seasons have weakened us in regards to the issue in comparison to the Beckham sale, but the more worrying part is the 2nd paragraph. Like I said he could still offer a couple more seasons as an option, but while it's only speculation there is a pervading air of our hands being tied regarding his power at the club, even to the point that no matter how poor he plays he's rarely ever the one subbed off, it's always someone else that is sacrificed if we are trying to freshen up the attack, even if the person coming off has been doing their part well enough.

353~~~
So Manchester United agreed a deal where in Rooney was guaranteed to be captain and starter no matter what? Do some of you actually read what you write? Because that's the biggest load of bollocks I've read. It's like people are determined to make Rooney the scapegoat no matter what. After the ridiculous predictions of Van Gaal and Rooney falling out with each turned out be just wishful thinking, the conspiracy has now shifted to how Rooney has magically negotiated a contract where he's to be first choice. Christ. Maybe...just maybe you can admit that he wasn't actually poor last season but nah that would too much I guess

354~~~
I think people generally underrate just how many potential goals those poor touches and poor passes cost us. Yes everyone does it, but Rooney on a much more consistent basis than any other top player i can think of. My main problem with Rooney is not whether he is capable to score enough goals next season as I'm sure he is. My problem with him is that he prevents our attacking force from operating at full potential. All those poor touches, passes, and times where he tends to hold on to the ball for far too long cost us a lot of goals whether people see it or not. Get a striker who hasn't completely lost other aspects of their game and can score goals at the same time, and we'll see a big difference. That might seem a lot to ask, just look at the other top teams out there and their current striker/main man and you'll have your answer. For me, he just doesn't do nearly enough for the team when he is not scoring.

I'd say two seasons back perhaps he was in the bracket under Ronaldo and Messi alongside other world class players such as Neymar, Suarez, Aguero, Lewandowski, Benzema, Sanchez etc. but when you look at these players and what they do for the team, even when they're not scoring, Rooney doesn't compare. Only his goal scoring abilities remain comparable to these players. Also, most of the mentioned are the players who their respective teams rely on to score goals before people tell me that it's hard to have both.

355~~~
Yes he has always formed his best partnerships with this kind of forward.

356~~~
He's getting a rough ride of late, and I'm not exactly his biggest fan. He makes good runs, will seek to get in behind defenders and, if presented, will take his chances.

Could we do better? Probably, yes. But viable alternatives don't exist right now, and Rooney playing at #9 is guaranteed goals. He's the least of our problems.

357~~~
But he was poor last season. Not as poor as say, Bale telling,  if that is your point. 

And it isn't unheard of for certain conditions on percentage of games played being in a contract, and I don't see why it is ridiculous for Rooney to have been promised the captaincy that was clearly about to change hands with Vidic going, in his negotiations. I'm not going to bang on about that, as I said, it is pure hypothesis, but you should take your tone down if you think money is the only thing negotiated in contract talks. It's all brinkmanship, and whoever holds the biggest cards, which always seems to be Rooney for reasons I have already mentioned, hold the biggest cards. 

If Rooney had been treated in accord with others, then I would not speculate as such. My speculation is based upon actual events, and trying to understand why a manager who can rightfully drop and subsequently sell big names for playing poorly has not even once, for one game, dropped Rooney, to the extent where Herrera is even  dropped so that he can play in an unnatural position instead. In case you missed it, Rooney didn't actually have a Kane-like season himself, so at a club with such competition as Falcao, Persie, Wilson, Di Maria - it shouldn't be unfathomable that a player who got 12 goals could be dropped/rotated out of the line up, at least once. Especially when considering the treatment of another striker who only got 2 less in Persie.

Van Gaal himself said on more than one occasion that nobody is guaranteed a place except Rooney. Do you honestly think k he performed at a level where he is the one player beyond question?  In a team where performers like Smalling, Herrera or Mata are not guaranteed to play, despite what they offered last season,  but Rooney deserves his position to not be questioned?

358~~~
You make some interesting points. I know some of it is based on hypothesis, however I have been wondering about the privileges that Rooney has. But I do wonder what would possess United to make such a deal. I understand things were starting to look bad already for us under Moyes and Woodward would not have wanted Rooney going at that stage from a status/marketing point. This though would have given Rooney and his agent a lot of leverage (<i>if </i>that was what Woodward was focusing on at the time), therefore it's not out of the realms of possibility that he would have tried to negotiate getting the armband. The always starting thing though I refuse to believe could have happened because that would mean Moyes and Woodward have created a huge huge stumbling block for the club.

359~~~
Yea, probably not an 'I must always start' clause per se. That said, an agreement to become next captain almost guarantees the same thing. 

I don't think a captaincy clause is that far fetched though, especially given that Moyes/Woodward probably wouldn't have known there would be a managerial change coming, so all it would have taken was for Moyes to okay it, and he probably planned to make Rooney his captain anyway and had no problem with it.

Again, all hypothesis of course. That said, knowing Van Gaal and his tactical fetishism,  Carrick seems his extension on the pitch, and is more a Van Gaal captain to me. He's Strootman /Van Bommel like.

360~~~
Oh for sure I suspect he did have a 'captaincy' clause. And yes Carrick is more LVG's type of player. But if Rooney has another meh season, the club would be mad not to rethink his position.

361~~~
But how can they, he signed a long term contract! Face it, Rooney is undroppable captain for years.

Hypothetically speaking, of course.

362~~~
And it's bizarre how easy you can hypothesize that someone like van Gaal would've agreed to something like that. And basically tell a lie for more than a year now. Though, maybe we'll hear interesting stuff from him once he retires, just like Fergie told all those stories about Glazers.

Facts are that four players that have often wear an armband left in the same year. That Rooney is easily the longest serving player of the club today, noone else comes close. And he become a captain after an excellent season under Moyes. Well, that one might be more of a facht.

363~~~
I do think Rooney takes a little while to get into his stride. The pre-season, regardless of his performances overall, will be really good for him, plus he has to get used to new players. He should be given the chance to be continuously playing in his preferred position, especially since he seems to have been taking one of for the team for a long time in terms of playing in other positions. LVG isn't daft, if he isn't delivering things have to be done. Remember, LVG and RVP had a love in, but that didn't stop the demise of the relationship when the later was ambling along not delivering.

364~~~
It's ridiculous because your initial presumption is wrong and that colours your judgment. You think he has been poor and should be dropped. He wasn't. So rather than rethinking your thought process you come up with farfetched conspiracy theories and a whole load of nonsense besides to explain something that needs no explaining.

As to why Rooney wasn't dropped, his worst run of form last season coincided at points where the whole team was shite (The start and end of the season). He was quite good for large part of the season although its now fashionable to presume that every single game he played in midfield he was shite in. He was (again) our most productive player despite playing all over the place. Second, Di Maria was only dropped after he got suspended and LVG magically hit upon a something that worked. Same with RVP except he got injured. Had that not happened neither would have probably have been dropped. In fact RVP walked straight back in as I recall in the WBA game.

People are doing a complete 360 on Van Gaal. When he came in he was supposed to be this control freak who didn't give a shit for reputation and his record backed that up. Not less than a year ago people were lapping up shit from the Daily Mail that Rooney didn't want Van Gaal as manager because he would be dropped for Christs sake. Now, people would have you believe that someone as outspoken and volatile as Van Gaal would say nothing about his hands being tied on team selections. Sorry, but that's complete bullshit. But whatever paints Rooney in the worse possible light I guess....If Van Gaal wants to drop Rooney then he'll drop Rooney. Being captain didn't stop Van Bommel from being dumped did it?

365~~~
If that is your story then by all means, stick to it. I didn't say 7.2 was a great score, I said 7.2 was +0.6 above the average for that game, put into perspective when David De Gea is the highest rated player for the season with 6.7 then it has to mean at least something. Colm was full of praise, not much more was said about his all-round game other than he had very few touches and was not that great. Don't think anyone on the pod was saying he was poor at all.

366~~~
We would've had Van Persie. With Welbeck and Hernandez as backups or wide forward, in Welbeck's case. And Kagawa in the hole, with possibly Herrera coming in.

There's no bigger what ifs for me than a what if of Fergie just staying on for a year.

367~~~
Rooney was not good last season. Again, he was not as bad as Balotelli, if this is basically what you are trying to say. However, he was far, far away from the Premier League football players that came out of the season considered 'good'. I don't even think there is a need to name those players, I think we all know them. Perhaps you have mitigating circumstances for Rooney not being as good as them, after all, there always is. There is a section of posters who seem to imply that Rooney is in fact, Aguero, but stupid managers have not realised they have that level of player on their hands and misuse him. Can Aguero play centre-mid? Can Suarez? My guess is we will never know, because they are actually too good in their preferred roles to be moved.

I can almost guarantee you that if Rooney was a consistent 30-goal a season striker, he wouldn't play a single game in midfield, we'd start Ben Pearson there before we played him there.

368~~~
Not Rooneys biggest fan recently but I thought against PSG he looked better. He made a few nice runs forward and his touch was pretty good for once, didn't lose possession much that I can remember. Needs to build on that performance though.

369~~~
If I didn't say it I should have! Not poor, decent, just not great.

370~~~
If Wayne Rooney being top scorer for United scoring 14 goals is considered <i>not good </i>then him having a great season is going absolutely blow every fans cock off. Somewhere in the middle of that likes the truth, probably a little closer to<i> you know what, to score 14 goals in that kind of season probably deserves a bit of praise..</i> but not to much!

I can absolutely guarantee you that Wayne Rooney won't score an absolute swag full of goals this season. Not because he is in decline, not because he's turned into a rubbish footballer (which will definitely be the running theme this season no doubt). It is simply because in this system of possession and methodical buildup, unless the numer 9 is an absolute powerhouse striker like Mario Gomez then he's not going to score a tonne of goals. Rooney however, at this great club of ours is probably the most adaptable player in the squad, the least likely to fuss, the captain and the talisman player. He's been the one to kick up the least of a fuss when asked to perform a job for the team, he'll play anywhere, he'll do anything. He is basically one of the best at following orders. So he's played wherever Van Gaal wants him to play and he won't be dropped because of it, no matter how bad we think he is. He's the perfect Van Gaal system player.

I can also guarantee you that no matter how bad we think he's playing, if he's still in the team come Christmas and still up front, it won't change and he's doing exactly what Van Gaal wants and the fault lies with Van Gaal.

I think there is a big gap between Poor and Decent when it comes to Rooney. Something like 0 and 7.. with Fine and fantastic being in triple figures. Haha.

You are changing the goalposts now and resorting to strawman arguments. No one has claimed Rooney is better than Aguero (I certainly haven't). Your main point was that because Rooney wasn't dropped it must mean he must be because Van Gaal couldn't drop him which is a bit ridiculous. He wasn't dropped because for a lot of the season he was better than most of the players you mentioned.

Consistent 30-goal a season strikers don't grow on trees you know. If you're looking at the big 4 leagues, Aguero has only done it twice. Suarez has only done it twice, Lewandowski has done it twice, RVP did it twice, Falcao has done it twice, Ibra only did it once and Rooney has also done it twice.

Besides, the two times Rooney has scored 30 a season he spent the following season in more withdrawn roles. It's not because he's shit up top, it's because a succession of United managers have all realized that despite his potential goal tally he's just a much better player in a more withdrawn role. Like I've repeatedly said, despite the widespread clamor for him to only play up top he's quite simply not a #9.

373~~~
Fair points, well made.

I still think that Rooney's performances would not have made him 'undroppable' last season if it were someone else. You're post implies that he performed better than Smalling and Herrera whose places have always been made to feel at risk under LVG, when that is not true.

I also think that, by rule, a team's main offensive weapon shouldn't, if not wouldn't, be played in midfield. The team is set up to HIS strengths, as the loss is too significant. In no planet does what Rooney offers us in midfield or as a winger is of a level where it should be prioritised over anything.

As for him being a 'number 9', I've never gone with that either. I think it's a theory that his apologists use, personally. I can accept if he is not being used as a striker, but so long as he is one of two strikers, which he has been for the vast majority of his United career, then it is nonsense to say he's being played 'out of position'. It is basically a way of saying that if Rooney got all of our chances, he'd score x amount. It's nonsense. And all of the other players who do put up huge numbers in the Prem often do it as part of a pair anyway. Suarez and Sturridge both did it in the same season. This whole 'if he's played as a 9'. What's wrong with him getting 25 league goals up front with Van Persie, or Hernandez, or Berbatov, or Saha, or Ruud?

Overall, I think your points are fair. All of this is probably futile anyway, as it all probably stems from your belief that Rooney is a top player, pitted against mine that he is average (as in Mandzukic average, not Lambert average). 'Good', is perhaps more fair.

374~~~
Because he plays a different role when he's paired with another striker and plays around 50 passes per match as a number 10 whereas he has less of the ball at 9 and is less involved in build up play. The way Suarez and Sturridge played together is different to how Rooney and Hernandez played together in 10/11 for example.


^ Are you telling me that you expect him to hit 30 goals playing from there positionally? Are you telling me that's where Suarez/Sturridge played for Liverpool?

He did get over 25 league goals playing with Berbabtov btw, it was in 09/10 and that's when (surprise) he was the furthest forward striker and Berbatov was the 10 playing deeper. Also (surprise), Berbatov scored more the following season when he played further forward. And Rooney scored less playing a deeper role behind Hernandez. See the pattern here? It would be absolutely foolish to have the same goal expectations of Rooney in the 09/10 season and the 10/11 season based on position.

375~~~
I can't watch that video at work, but if you are one of two strikers, with 4 actual midfielders behind you, you can score 25 goals. Whether Rooney plays with Berbatov or Hernandez, he will continue to drop deep. He has done it all pre-season. Aguero plays with Dzeko, Bony, or Negredo recently, and scores goals, and I'm pretty sure they are not 10s.

376~~~
Smalling was only dropped on a couple of occasions and I'm not sure that's wholly relevant given he's not competing with Rooney. Dropping Herrera was a bit weird admittedly but at any rate I don't think Rooney was ever playing in a way that would have had him dropped.

I don't think think the team is set up to his strength at all. I don't think it's set up to anyone's strength right now. It's just plodding around aimlessly for 90 minutes.

When Rooney plays as a pair, he does it completely differently and it's very rarely a flat out 4-4-2. Fully agreed with <a class="username" data-user="28799, @AttackingFlair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28799/">@AttackingFlair</a> . There's a huge difference in the way Rooney played with Hernandez compared to when he played with Berbatov. I suspect that as the season goes by we'll see Depay playing more as a #9 than and Rooney playing deeper.

I think Rooney was a top player. He's not as good as he was (Although still one of our best players) and LVG should have either kept RVP or signed Benteke or someone to provide competition and eventually replace Rooney.

377~~~
Fair enough. And I think it's just in Rooney's nature to drop deep. But yea, I agree that we are not set up to his strengths, but I wouldn't know what strengths those are anyway tbh, other than the ability to score goals, which is a basic strategy of 'create chances for Rooney'. I think Van Gaal would create the conditions if he had an individual player with enough ability, as he did with Arjen Robben. I think he ultimately sees Depay having a similar impact.

I also agree with your last paragraph. But this is the sort of thing that has raised concerns for me. The quite obvious fact that Rooney is not this top level player anymore that you and I can see, seems to be lost on Van Gaal. It appears that he has actively looked for proper competiton for everyone except him, and is seemingly guaranteeing that he will be the main striker. My main point has always been that surely, even if he wasn't Balotelli bad last season, he was definitely not good enough to warrant <i>that</i>. From where I'm stood, nobody is guaranteed to play except Rooney. On what basis? What he did x amount of years ago? Surely nothing he's done in the last few? And regarding Smalling, I included him more on the basis of what seems to be happeningin pre-season, likeweise Herrera. Of course, the Spurs lineup is not revealed, but so far, Van Gaal seems to have pushed him out of the team. Rooney has done less than Smalling and Herrera under LVG to have earned the status he has, or seems to have anyway.

378~~~
He's said his captain is undroppable not Rooney himself and he has a previous for dropping captains and selling them so I wouldn't look too much into that. If he doesn't step up I expect Van Gaal to drop him. I think a lack of competition is probably more down to availability and the likes of Wilson/Depay (LVG seems to rate them both highly). Most of the available strikers were grossly expensive and overpriced (Kane, benteke etc).

I'm not sure any striker would score goals for us the way we play these days.

379~~~
You're being ignorant to tactics. Yeah Rooney COULD play right up next to his strike partner like Aguero does but that's not been his role. You don't see Aguero playing 50 passes a match and helping out the midfield. That's not Aguero's skill set and I wouldn't expect him to (not saying Rooney is a better player).

City have struggled in Europe with 442. We reached a CL final with Rooney and Hernandez in 10/11 because Rooney wasn't right up there with Hernandez, his role isn't the same as Aguero's. Rooney's role in 09/10 is far more comparable to Aguero's. You can't just say because Aguero scores X amount of goals paired with another striker that Rooney should also, without looking at their roles.

380~~~
I guess so, although I don't know how much of it is 'role' and some is just Rooney's natural instincts.

381~~~
(i)Rooney has managed more than 20 league goals twice in a season in his whole career.

(ii)He has managed more than 20 goals (all comps) in a season four times in his whole career. 29 years old.

Rooney - (i) 2, (ii) 4.

Some other players:

Aguero - (i)3 times, and (ii)6 times. 27 years old.

Ibra - (i)4 times, and (ii)9 times. 33 years old.

Benzema - (i) 2, (ii)7. 27 years old.

Lewandowski - (i) 4, (ii) 7. 25 years old.

RvP - (i) 2, (ii) 4. 31 years old. (This one is a bit of a strange one as his average games played per season is a lot less in comparison to the other strikers listed).

Falcao - (i) 3, (ii) 4. 29 years old.

Luis Suarez - (i) 4, (ii) 6. 28 years old.

Cavani - (i) 3, (ii) 5. 28 years old.

Torres - (i) 1, (ii) 5. 31 years old.

382~~~
You honestly think for example that it was instinct that Rooney didn't play right up top with Hernandez in the CL final against Barcelona? 

There's a reason Rooney has been well liked by LVG and Moyes and that's because he listens to instructions, he doesn't just do whatever the hell he wants, contrary to your belief.

383~~~
I find it strange reading through this thread and seeing next to no analysis of what's happening on the pitch during pre-season but so many posts absolutely slaughtering Rooney.

I don't think Depay has done him many favours with his youthful naivete and greed at key times in attacks. Rooney's made a number of runs off of his marker whilst Depay is carrying the ball only to then see Depay run into traffic, or choose the wrong option thus spurning the well worked opening Rooney has created. A proper #10 would play his front-man in on a number of those occasions and that's when the #9 would be judged on what he's done from that point onward. Unless Depay improves his decision making, or Van Gaal actually puts a proper #10 in the hole, a lot of Rooney's off the ball work is going to be for naught, and eventually, he'll stop making those runs.

Another issue is that our balls in from the wide position have been poor for the most part during the whole pre-season, and unless you put a Drogba-esque, battering ram up there to contest those balls, they're going to make the striker look poorer.

We've lacked creativity and cutting edge all throughout pre-season and given Rooney scraps to feed on. Granted, he hasn't turned water into wine as his first touch has been poor, but the best time to scrutinise a #9, and bear in mind Rooney is being played as a #9 now, is off his conversion rate and aptitude going towards goal, and on that score, those behind him haven't given him the best platform to shine.

There's more than one way to play the #9, and it's pretty obvious Rooney's forte is more running off his man and working space for himself than it is in holding up the ball and bringing others into play, so as long as he proves adequate with basic lay offs, whilst foraging for space on the other side of the play, there's ample opportunity for a good #10 to come to the fore and enable Rooney to do what he's best, or, better at.

I've thought the cohesiveness of our actual attacking line has been a bigger problem this tour than any one individual, personally - if we were playing great football up to the point where Rooney got on the ball, and then it all went to shit, fair enough, but it hasn't been anything of the sort. If we're to continue with the same attacking personnel, it'll take a while before the daggers should be out for any of them. There's just no way Rooney's our biggest problem of all in attack at the minute, and I think what's gone on last season should be put to the side as this is a new team with different problems, strengths and weaknesses.

It's unfair to just suppose Rooney can come alive in an incohesive team; his first touch has been bad, but there's far more to #9 play than that, and until we get the full picture and can tick or cross off the other boxes Rooney is failing/succeeding in, it's just too early for all of this furore about his play.

384~~~
I do wonder what role he'll have in tomorrow's testimonial of Big Dunc. Apparently, it's just Ferguson and him that will feature of past Everton players, rest, current squad? They do have a match today as well.

Just don't get hurt. On your way to Liverpool I mean.

385~~~
I've seen a few "full highlights" of the pre-season games and I watched the first half of United-PSG, and I thought that he's been alright. His touch at times has been dire, and I'm a big Rooney fan. No point beating around the bush, it's astonishing how bad it can be at times. But I do feel he gets unfair stick for the rest of the play. I can definitely see a partnership clicking between him and Memphis. A few times he's played some delicious touches to Memphis, but the latter didn't read it properly so he didn't expect it. With time and games, that will come. It's great seeing Memphis making runs past Rooney - gives a great option of Rooney being able to slip someone through with pace from midfield. Something we've lacked for a while. ADM showed it a few times, but not enough unfortunately. 

Rooney will score 15+goals next season I'm sure. Is that a good target? No of course not. But I feel he'll create a lot more for Memphis and I expect an increase in his assists stats next season. Should we have competition for him? Absolutely. I really hope he breaks the record but it's obvious he can get a bit complacent at times and not having RVP/Falcao competing with him (as if they did last season!) may make him put the gas off the pedal a bit - or it may even drive him to higher levels knowing that there is a feck load more responsibility on him given he's the only world renowned striker that's at Manchester United at the moment. No one can deny his determination and leadership (not in my eyes anyway) so I'm hoping it's the latter that'll happen.

A good start to the season will give us all confidence I'm sure. Will ease the pressure off our new signings to settle in too. Hoping he'll get off to a good start vs Spurs with a goal or two.

386~~~
Last year at the club IMO.

No breaking records, the usual good month of form followed by amateur bullshit, when his first touch makes a Rhino look good. 

Him as our leading striker is utter suicide imo. That's unless LVG gets someone who can play with him. Which will be a challenge as, Saha, RVN. Berbatov, Tevez and even Welbeck couldn't 

And I know people will say that "Oh look at his record".....Yeah, if RVN and Ronaldo stayed they would have wiped their arse with the record at least 3 or 4 years ago. 

Happy to be proved wrong but, I think he's done. 

More then  happy to be quoted at the end of the season when the fecker scores 40 goals <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

387~~~
Wishful thinking, the guy has play through until retirement written into his contract. Ambassador role and all of that. As much as it is a personal attack on a lot of fans it is pointless to even think that he'll be moving on or he's not good enough. His stature at the club is as of a legend already. 
You won't be proven wrong. He'll be a construct player this season however, playing on the shoulder and basically playing for his team mates. LVG's strikers don't usually have a free goal scoring role. (Save Gomez but he was a physical beast and a good poacher). He's not going to score a lot of goals but if he keeps starting then he's doing exactly what LVG want's him to do contrary to the moaning fans wanting him dropped. If he should be dropped in LVG's eyes he'll be dropped.

In essence, his unstoppable status comes from the fact that he's the most adaptable player in the team. Basically LVG trusts him because he does exactly what he tells him to do and not kick up a fuss. If it were the opposite, Rooney would be gone.

388~~~
Well, a few weeks ago he said if he's a striker he'll get 25 or 30 goals.

I honestly don't believe that for a split second. 

So what happens when he doesn't?

389~~~
Basically another silent domination post.

390~~~
No idea what that means, but no worries. Thanks.
Of course he's going to say that? It is what the fans want to hear. I don't believe that for a second either. I think he'll net about the same amount of goals as last season again. You have to factor in that if Van Gaal thinks he's playing the role exactly the way he wants then what do you think is going to happen?

391~~~
What?

392~~~
IF he scores again another 12 goals, then we won't get into UCL zone and LVG will be rightfully sacked. Liverpool won't be as shit as last season this time.

Even for midtable teams it is unacceptable that the main striker would score 12 goals.

If Rooney doesn't manage to score at least 20 goals (assuming that he'll play as main striker) then I think this will be his last season as a starter.

393~~~
It is all speculative. Even scoring 14 in a season and being the club's top goal scorer in your scenario would mean being replaced. I don't think it is that easy.

Van Gaal's strikers have never been goal machines. I don't think he's going to magically be able to conjure up a goal machine and insert him into the team and reap the rewards straight away. Especially if it is Wayne Rooney. If he was changing the entire system to accommodate Rooney then by all means I'd be a lot more optimistic. But in this rigid system he's created at the club if the striker is performing correctly then he's not going to be a goal machine. 

Time will tell through the season, who knows what will transpire.

394~~~
20 goals is far from goal machine. Any good striker should be able to score 20 goals.

His strikers weren't Ronaldo or Messi levels, but they scored a ton of goals.

Rivaldo scored 28 goals in 97/98, 29 goals in 98/99 while 23 in the following season (Kluivert scored 23 too). 
Kluivert scored 20+ goals in two seasons for Ajax under LVG. 
Litmanen did so 3 times, one of those times scoring 36 goals (that is what I would consider a goal machine).
Bergkamp scored twice 30+ goals for LVG. 
Muller scored 19 goals in each of the two seasons he played for LVG.
Olic scored 19 goals in his first season for LVG.
Mario Gomez scored 39 goals in his second season for him (that is an another goal machine).
El Hamdaoui scored 25 goals in his last season for LVG.

Point is, LVG's strikers always scored a ton of goals. If Rooney cannot manage that (especially if he leads the attack), then I think he'll be benched. You cannot afford your top striker, playins as a No.9 to score 15 goals or so and also to challenge for trophies (unless you're Fabio Capello, obviously). Rooney while creative has a quite bad all round game currently, so it isn't that you have to play him if he doesn't score.

Rooney said that he can score 25 goals and LVG seems to believe so. I think that 20+ goals for Rooney is definitely possible. If it isn't, then next summer we will upgrade that position.

395~~~
20 goals is really the minimum for a top striker having an excellent season. Good strikers score 10+, any striker having a 20+ goal season is having an excellent season.

Only a few in that list have had epic goal scoring seasons. Rivaldo and Bergkamp who are undoubtedly some of the games greatest goal scorers, Litmanen and Gomez (out of a lot of players) are the other two. That list paints (to me) more hit and miss than a system designed for forward players to thrive. But we can agree to disagree.

I am not buying into the whole <i>Rooney must score loads for us to be successful, </i>in my eyes you can't put a figure on the goals he scores and directly related it to how successful we will be. He was top scorer last season and we barely limped into 4th place. One would like to think that with the bar raised and the conditions made more favourable the amount of goals will go up to accommodate these conditions. I don't really see that just because he's going to play up front consistently that he's going to score a lot of goals.

Rooney and Van Gaal will of course say that. Why would they not? It would be stupid to come out at the start of the season and say<i> I think I'll struggle, I've been a bit hit and miss lately.. my touch is a bit off as well.. </i>Van Gaal is not thinking purely at an output level. If he is playing the role properly and to his liking and he's scoring some goals (not a lot of goals) then I think he'll stick with him.

The bottom line is, possession football in England doesn't work. A lot of this clubs ethos is built on high energy, risk taking, entertaining football. To get the best out of most of the past and present (in the LVG era) players the football needs to be played a certain way. When you change something that big you can't expect every player to thrive in the system. I don't think Rooney is going to thrive in this system, the build up is way to slow and he gets lost between the lines playing up front in a tactical role. But I also don't think it means he's a poor footballer.

396~~~
I think this is quite canny of LVG: he's, at once, shown faith in Wayne and also made sure - very publicly - that there's pressure on Rooney to deliver on his promise.

397~~~
Yep. He keeps mentioning how the media said how he should play striker.

If Rooney doesn't play well then the same media will be on his back.

398~~~
I doubt it, mate - instead, it'll probably be 'Dutch Blockhead Van Flop ruins Our Wayne'.

399~~~
Nah that'll be the Rooney fan club making excuses for him on here.

400~~~
Our Wayne is on the bench for Everton today against Villarreal for Duncan Ferguson's testimonial. Doubt he'll get more than 30 minutes but hopefully his appearance will be appreciated by the Everton fans.

401~~~
Seems that Evertonians aren't that vindictive. Multiple occasions of cheering, and just now they've gone chanting "Rooney! Rooney! ROONEY!" to end it with yet another cheer.


Though, maybe it was "Kone! Kone! KONE!"?

Rooney's coming on for the last 15 minutes + stoppage with Everton 2-0 down, coming on for Cleverley. He gets a great reception.

Don't. Get. Injured.

Lots of boocheers.

405~~~
Inevitable in...3-4 seasons? 15 goals or less in this campaign, and we'll see him in blue next season?

406~~~
Probably cheering Clevz coming off.

407~~~
Rooney continues his shameful record of not scoring against Everton. Tut tut.

408~~~
How did he get on?

409~~~
I'm torn. He seemed like a big fan of Everton still but he could easily try and find his last pay-day in America.

410~~~
If he is played as an out and out Striker, he will score more than 25 goals for us.

411~~~
Think he'll end up in the MLS. He'd be the biggest name since Becks no?

412~~~
He looks better in blue than red, I think. I'd rather he finish his career at Everton than in the MLS.

413~~~
Jogged, almost broke into a canter.

414~~~
People have said over the last page that LVGs strikers are not there to score tons of goals or something. He has said a few times that he needs a 20 goal striker, so I don't think he'll be content with Rooney not getting at least that on the basis that he does other things well.

He will need to get goals for LVG to be satisfied I think.

415~~~
25 minimum, as LVG has already said Rooney has commited to

416~~~
Was watching the season review DVD over the weekend. Admittedly watching a season again in a condensed manner like that does make players look better


But I was reminded he did have some good spells last season and scored some very important goals


If he stays fit and no messing about, he stays up top I am certain he will hit 20 league goals

417~~~
RVP found that out the hard way . Van Gaal will play him in his preferred position and Rooney as been trusted with getting 25 plus goals.So it is all set up for Rooney .If he fails .Can see him going the way of RVP.

418~~~
Perhaps worthy of a separate thread

419~~~
Nice breakdown here of Rooney playing as CF

If he stays fit he'll get 20-25 goals no bother!

420~~~
Very skewed, stats can show you what you want, he hasn't got a bad return rate, but we aren't guaranteed by sticking him up top

421~~~
He will be fine, he's been scoring a min of ten goals almost every season and that's even when he is messed about playing no.10/CM/on the wing, also see his England record where for the majority of the time he does play upfront. A whole season as striker i'm confident he will do well for us.

422~~~
To be fair he doesn't play much differently for England than he does for us, bar the few times he does ACTUALLY play in midfield or out wide. He plays as one of two strikers for England (hence the great 'who will partner Rooney?' debate), and he plays as one of two strikers for us. He has 4 midfielders behind him both times. And with England, it's not as if he's stuck up top with Adam Lallana, it's usually a Sturridge, Defoe, Carroll, Lambert etc. Basically, other 'number 9s'.

Anyway, I've been reflecting a lot of late and have become more positive about Rooney, perhaps because I have no choice. I really hope he can get us the goals this season, because if he does, we are right in there with a title fight.

423~~~
Here's a simple test.  1000 pounds of your hard earn cash,  odds are double or nothing,  which one it is :

A. Costa scoring 25 goals
B.  Aguero scoring 25 goals
C. Sturidge scoring 25 goals
D.  Kane scoring 25 goals
E.  Rooney scoring 20 goals

Edit.  You can only place one bet. Assume rooney will be played as striker and every name will play 38 games. 

Even at 20 against 25 im keen to believe people will bet on aguero more than rooney

424~~~
B then A then E then D then C

EDIT: If Sturrdige was fully fit:

B then A then C then E then D

425~~~
That's where rooney ranks.  Even our fans arent so sure he'll score 20 against other strikers 25

426~~~
TBF those other strikers have been scoring at that sort of rate for the past 2/3 years whilst Rooney hasn't. However Rooney hasn't been playing in the best of teams and also has been playing in midfield too

427~~~
Still.  You dare betting on him? At the end of the days the bookies odds reflects expectations of the masses

428~~~
I wouldn't bet on him over Costa and Aguero no, even with their injury records.

429~~~
Rooney is as clinical as any striker in the world.

His first touch seems to be getting worse by year though, which is, in my opinion, the most concerning thing when comparing him to world's best stikers.

430~~~
Hes is a top class finisher, but that is not correct.

431~~~
With the midfield we now have, I expect Rooney will get a lot better service.

I expect him to score 25 or more.

432~~~
BEDAC.

433~~~
I disagree.

434~~~
Number of times those strikers have hit those goal tallies in a season during their career:

A. 1
B. 5
C. 0
D. 1
E. 4

Anybody with sense would pick Aguero every day of the week but then he's quite clearly the best striker in the league. Rooney is far more likely to hit 20 goals than the other lot are of hitting 25 judging from history.

435~~~
In pl alone?

Its only a contest on 20 vs 25, make it 25 vs 25 and it wont be a contest

436~~~
course, no such thing as guarantees in football. 

But he has a history of doing well up front once he is settled, I don't recall him every being particularly wasteful up front, like Andy Cole for instance.

437~~~
If it were 25 vs 25 then Rooney would only have two but would still be the most prolific after Aguero. 

Counting only 25+ league goals:

Aguero: 1 season (also has seasons of 23 and 20 plus 4 seasons of 17-19)
Costa: 1 season (last season's 20 was his only other season above 10)
Sturridge: 0 seasons (best season is 21, second best league total is 11)
Kane: 1 season (second best season is 11... in the Championship)
Rooney: 2 seasons (has two standout season of 26 and 27 in league after that he has 9 season ranging from 11-17 which is as good/better than anything else from others not named Aguero outside of their best 1-2 seasons)

There's no way you'll be able to use stats to back up a claim that any of those players are better goalscorers than Rooney other than Aguero.

438~~~
What happened 5 years ago isn't very relavent. Take the stats from the last 3 seasons.

439~~~
Why? It's very relevant, especially as that's when Rooney predominantly played further forward..

440~~~
Today I think Rooney will score more than 20 goals.

Basically, I'm pining for the season to start so my expectations are all over the fecking place! I just hope we use him correctly and give him the best chance to do well up front. If we do I'm confident that he'll step up, because though don't particularly like him these days he does like to win.

441~~~
Its irrelavent, especially when the issue people label at Rooney is that he is past his best or is in decline.
The mitigating circumstances however is that he has spent quite a lot of time being played out of position.

EDIT: Another thing to add to that is that if Rooney was as prolific as someone like Aguero we wouldn't have when and got RVP and moved Rooney further back.

EDIT: Also Diego Costa wasn't playing as a striker for many of those season either, Falcao was up top and Costa maily played wide or behind.

442~~~
Wish we still has the 2009/2010 Rooney on our hands. None of us would be worrying about our striker situation then. He was lethal that season.

443~~~
It's not relevant for him as it doesn't suit his argument, basically

444~~~
He is and it's as clear as day.

445~~~
League goals in last 3 seasons:

Costa: 57
Aguero: 55
Rooney: 41
Sturridge: 36
Kane: 26

Considering Rooney spend one of those seasons in midfield it's really not that big a gap. Although it's really moot anyway, I'm not claiming that Rooney is a world class player who will score for fun but refuting the claim that those other players are more likely to have a great goalscoring season than he is. Rooney is held to a far higher standard than most players.

At the time we signed RVP, Rooney had hit 34 goals in 2 of his previous 3 seasons.

446~~~
People have been saying Rooney is in decline since he joined us, he isn't. He just never hit the heights some of us wished or hoped for, and is forever hampered by that. 

When I asked why it isn't relevant, your response is "Its irrelavent".. Can you explain why? As case in point for me is your last sentance, admitting he has played out of position recently, but then you used this as your stats range, while ignore his time as a CF..

447~~~
I didn't ignore his time as a CF, hes played as a CF during that time too. The stats also includes time where Costa wasn't a CF for instance (wide for athletico) or Sturridge (wide for chelsea) or Kane wasn't even kicking a ball in the EPL.

Take the last 3 years (because we can all talk about what a player did 5 years ago but is it really relevant to today?) I mean would you want us to sign Berbatov or Ronaldinho based on their history.

We need to look at recent history which is why I said 5 years ago is irrelavent, football moves on quickly.
I wouldn't advocate signing Xavi based on what he was doing 5 years ago.

So take the last 3 years, calculate the minutes played as a CF for each, and then count the goals scored during that period. Then do goals per minute played, that will give you a more accurate and relevant rating.

448~~~
Rooney not hitting the heights we all hoped he'd hit has nothing to do with saying he's been in decline for a number of seasons now, regardless of him being played out of position. He's just not got the same threat in front of goal and you rarely to never get excited when he's on the ball. Could you really say those two things about the Rooney of 5 years ago? he was a different animal. A much better one.

449~~~
We should have our most...balanced...side since at least 2010. Hopefully that means he gets good service and can stay in his position. Don't see why he'd struggle to get 1 goal every 2 games in that case. Also, with how we've moved on other underperforming stars, wouldn't be surprised to see Rooney get dropped if needed this year, captain or not.

450~~~
Dropped for who? fecking Wilson... hopefully we don't sell the pea...

451~~~
Is untrue. 6-10 games last season I'm guessing, perhaps a handful in 12/13 too. You should also consider that Costa, Aguero and Sturridge seem to miss at least a quarter of every season injured too.

452~~~
Knowing LVG's penchance for random moves no one understands, t could be for anyone. Fellaini, Januzaj, hell maybe even Phil Jones.

453~~~
Nah it was definitely way more than 6-10, I'd be shocked if he didn't play at least half of last season in midfield. That's without considering that switching positions is going to make it very hard to maintain any sort of form. Injuries are irrelevant, you can't score if you're not fit.

454~~~
Did my thread inspire you to take a look back through the annals <a class="username" data-user="43784, @Randall Flagg" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/43784/">@Randall Flagg</a> ? Perhaps my suggestion was a bit to subtle.
I basically feel this way also, the season reviews going back even further remind us how good a finisher he is. (Even with the cliché of highlights making a player look better.)

Honestly I am only new to redcafe and maybe I missed out on the anti-Rooney kool aid but this is some next level hatred going on in here. It is so unnecessary.

Even as a social experiment I'd love to sit some of these users down and show them the season reviews from the last five seasons. I really do think it would change a lot of the desperate narrative going on in this thread.
Some of it is genuine apprehension at the new season and their expectations, I understand that much of course but it is almost an obsession that I've seen where we must put him down endlessly for whatever purpose.

I hope he has a really good season and scores lots of goals, but I don't really think it will happen in this system. His role is far to passive and he lacks the physicality to hold up the ball in the system. 
I fear the fans will be all over him like shit to a blanket over the tiniest things and it is completely undeserved. If Falcao and Van Persie couldn't play the role sufficiently then I really doubt that Rooney can without tweaking it to his strengths. I don't think Van Gaal will be doing that.

That doesn't mean any of them are rubbish footballers.

455~~~
I thought we started off playing Blind, Herrera and Di Maria in the midfield, then at some stage Herrera was dropped for Fellaini. I thought Rooney moved in to midfield later on. I guess it is about inrepretations of formation, as you could say he started 'in midfield' behind Persie and Falcao for a few games, although I saw that more of a front three, but fair enough. There was a clear move back into actual midfield, where people were disappointed Herrera was not playing instead - that was when he was a central midfielder, and surely didn't last longer than 2 months, because we played with two for the most part, and Persie was injured, then Falcao dropped.

I don't think he started more than 10 games (at a stretch) as part of the midfield two, although I suppose he did start more early on the season behind a front two so it's fair.

456~~~
Even if he wasn't playing as the anchor, he regularly started games in the Fellaini and Herrera 10/8 position, it wasn't until the new year when Herrera came back into the fold was he playing regularly up front.

457~~~
This just smacks of common narrative of making excuses for the players not delivering, not just Rooney. Talk us through this perfect equilibrium that is required for Rooney to be a top player, where anything else is excusable, down to the 'system'.

Don't get me wrong, I can accept excusing poor performance in midfield, but up top, with two wingers and Memphis in behind? At some stage, surely we have to just say it is a round ball, and players need to just go out and do the business.

My optimism is increasing that he will deliver this season, partly because, well what would we have if were not hopeful? But the sense of inevitability, or expectation, in your post, and many other's posts that he will not deliver is largely down to an acknowledgement of the fact that he is not Luis Suarez, as opposed to the fact that it's all everyone else's fault.

I am hopeful. Perhaps also because I know what he could once do, and who knows, he may really have the urge to show that he is a proper top player again and do it big for us. But it is down to him, no excuses (unless of course he replaces Carrick or something).

458~~~
Agree, and he wasn't starting in that midfield role when the season started either. So it was a period in the middle. 2 months of a season is not that many games when you are only in one tournament. Certainly not more than 10, if that.

459~~~
If he wants to be our go to guy and leading star he needs to step it up this season and show that he still got it. I hope he can have a good season as we need back a Rooney in top form to have a shot at the title.

460~~~
When have I ever said Rooney has not delivered? I don't, nor have I ever needed to make excuses for him - he was top scorer last season. End of story, in my eyes.

Tell that to Van Persie and Falcao who are gone. Tell that to Di Maria who is now gone, tell that to Ander Herrera who has said on multiple occasions he's had to remodel his game under Van Gaal just to perform correctly in the system. If you want to just ignore that Van Gaal has completely over complicated almost every aspect of every tactical position these past seasons then go ahead. Players need to adapt as well as utilize their own talents. That is pretty much why a wide variety of players from the top quality to the seemingly poor have moved on.

Or in fact, it is due to the intepretation of the masses or the few that he has never really been a top quality shoulder striker. Especially not in a 4-3-3 with inverted wingers, you can cite the back end of last season to see the facts that support this argument. Whether or not Van Gaal follows through with his slight tweak of the system with Memphis in behind will remain to be seen, that is probably the first place to start when factoring whether or not he is accommodating Rooney up front. If he reverts back to the point forwards 4-3-3 from the back end of last season then he's not really playing a system that is built around the ability of Rooney. (Who I think is more of a natural 10 in the role that Memphis is going to play anyway).
I'll give you an example, if you tell a player like Hernandez to drop deep and get involved in the buildup then he's probably going to struggle. If you push the entire system up behind him and win the ball high and let him get into space and get tap-ins then you're playing to his strengths. It is the same with Rooney. If you put him in a system where his main aim is the hold the ball up and bring players into play then by the arguments presented in the past, he's going to struggle. It isn't making excuses, it is stating the fact that if you change everyone into an uncomfortable role then only the ones who can adapt to it will flourish. That has been plainly obvious with the man-management of most of the squad since Van Gaal arrived.

The Stoke game on NYD was still 3-5-2 with Rooney behind the strikers and that was 20 games in. I think your radar is askew on that one.

edit; Actually I think Mata was in the hole and Rooney beside Carrick.

461~~~
That tap in from Falcao's ball was definitely my favourite. Against Newcastle, involved in the buildup and his entire run takes him into the box for the tap in. Beautiful.

462~~~
He started the first couple of games up front then moved to a 10 behind RVP and Falcao, after he came back from suspension he started playing as a proper midfielder which was against City at the start of November. He stayed there until we played Newcastle at the start of March which was when RVP and Falcao were both injured. That's the best part of 4 months as an out and out CM with another couple months as a 10. He definitely played the bulk of his football outside of the CF position.

After that it's as you say, down to interpretation of the formation, but I personally would count the 10 more as a midfield position than a forward one when there are two forwards playing in front of the 10, which is often what we played at the start of the season. As far as I can tell Rooney played 20 games in midfield out of 33 in the league if we stick by that definition.

463~~~
So slow that he needed the defender to finish for him.

464~~~
I still don't understand why he took the touch, he got very lucky.

465~~~
Just said in th match day day thread

He looked good to me apart from dropping too deep at times

Thought it a decent half from him, as always he gets more scrutinised then every player

466~~~
He didnt score that one,  awarded as own goal

467~~~
Has held the ball up quite good. Few sightings of the dreaded first touch.

468~~~
Has cinder blocks for feet.

469~~~
He's been quite good, but he isnt really a goalthreat for me. He gets the easiest chance and manages to ruin that.

470~~~
playing good but he needs to score that chance, lucky Walker is a brainless idiot.....

471~~~
He's been fine so far, anyone who says otherwise is just nitpicking.

472~~~
Did he want to take a selfie with the ball? He stood their for a good minute until walker showed him how to shoot the ball into the net. I have not been impressed with him, but at least he got me some point on fantasy team <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

473~~~
To be fair, even I've had the ball more often than he has.

474~~~
He's not been that good really, he's not the player he was 4 or 5 years ago but him being our main striker is not the disaster some make it out to be. He'll surely get a good number of goals and put in numerous quality performances. The issue is that we have absolutely no competition if he gets injured or goes through a spell of bad form, which he usually does within a season.

475~~~
He must bury chances like the one Walker tucked away from him, to be fair. That's a sitter.

476~~~
A bit off the pace at times (Walker let him off the hook on the goal) but a reasonably solid first half.

477~~~
Ball bounces off his feet in penalty area. He comes to a complete stop, standing still. The ball drops. He stands up straight right there threateningly close to the goal, waiting for the moment to ripen. Shall I strike this? Perhaps. Or maybe I will invite Kyle Walker to clear the ball into his own net.

478~~~
Well calculated .If you can't score goal, let's someone else does it. That's what 20 goals a season striker would do.

479~~~
Let the shitstorm begin..

480~~~
Poor showing today but the result is all that matters. Onwards and upwards from here let's hope.

481~~~
Worried about relying on Rooney. Just hope it's just opening game blues and he improves...

482~~~
Armband>Coconut

483~~~
Got a "Rooney Rooney!!" for taking the ball to the corner, his best contribution in 94 minutes. World class.

484~~~
Yeah, something like that. But that's also a charm of the Rooney thread. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

485~~~
The previous seasons he played upfront, he seemed stronger on the ball and was scaring CBs. Nowadays they deal with him easier.

486~~~
Most of the players in both sides looked unfit and rusty I thought. Quite bizarre. I thought we were under cooked in pre-season, whilst Spurs have been overcooked.

He did the tactical side of his game OK but he was very poor on the goal.

487~~~
Matchday fans opinions > Everyone else.

488~~~
Literally no service. His first touch wasn't bad today.

489~~~
Decent on the build up, but needs ti push higher if he is our loan striker.

490~~~
He looked absolutely shattered today.

491~~~
Well, they do see a lot more than "everyone else". (well, save for neutrals and other team fans on stadium!)

492~~~
Decent all around game(finally) but whoever thinks he is quick needs to check his eyes.

In before someone posts the stats.

493~~~
Haters gonna hate. He wasn't outstanding but some making out as if he's useless. He was fine.

494~~~
Have to say i would have expected any top striker to hit that chance first time into the net. Rooney definitely bottled it and did not act on instinct like he should have in that situation. I really hope he gets out of he's head and starts putting those away or we have a huge problem. Luckily it did not cost us today!

495~~~
Sluggish. Very average game.

496~~~
He looked slow and a bit laboured, but then again 'Wayne Rooney in having a slow start shocker'.

Im sure he'll be up to speed soon enough.

497~~~
We created two chances for him, all day (I think) and we managed to get a goal from one. We need to up our creativity and speed up our play when going forwards; otherwise, Rooney will suffer the most.

498~~~
Did sweet f*ck all really, but the service wasn't good.

499~~~
Looks and moves like 40. Got absolutely no balls form our wings though.

500~~~
Patchy performance. Not terrible. Some flashes of good link up play. We just created very little.

501~~~
poor service to him today but when he did get it he took too long to shoot. drifted into midfield a lot too to help out. as always he does whatever it takes.

502~~~
If running the ball into the corner is all our supposed best player can offer then we're in trouble. I don't think he played badly or anything, but he didn't really do anything positive either.

503~~~
Has it been considered that Rooney's body just isn't up to it now? 

He has already played a careers worth of top flight football, I'm sure it's taken it's toll. 

He is my biggest worry for the season, that LVG will believe the hype and rely on him as our main striker.

504~~~
Whilst I thought our build up and supply was shit, Rooney was part of that. 

I thought his movement and passing was shocking at times. Hoping its just a slow start to the season rather than him being a bit shit.

505~~~
Fergie was right to try to ship him out a few years back. I honestly think he's been on the decline for a few years now.

506~~~
He has done for a couple of seasons.

507~~~
He was OK. We struggled immensely, just like last season, in the build up. There's just too much space between our defensive unit and our attacking unit, the striker in particular. We hardly ever have possession in the final third, which means it's always going to be difficult for the striker to impose on the game much.

That said, it was extremely poor of him not to finish that chance, but thankfully Walker came to his aid.

508~~~
When was that?

509~~~
he was average in the first half and slightly worst in the second, the corner flag world class piece of play was simply world class, still world class player

510~~~
It's the sort of game people wanted Falcao and RVP shipped out for, ultimately.

511~~~
Don't know if it's the lack of service or not, but he was awful.

512~~~
When he brought in RVP and Kagawa.

513~~~
Worrying performance. As things stand, our season depends big time on him having a great season, and he just looked average today. Nothing stood out about him. Hoping for a lot more in the coming games. He needs to match the likes of Costa and co.

514~~~
He can't take on one deffender ,can't dribble and bad first touch and that is not title contender striker

515~~~
I know it sounds bitter and small-time but I still haven't forgiven him for his acting in that wine advert.
Apart from that, he now looks like Wilson from <i>Cast Away</i> with a lump of straw on top. To be fair though, he remains the best at evacuating snot from his nostrils and onto the hallowed turf...although RVP was better at it.

516~~~
Walker saved his blushes. There's not much to say really, these performances are just something you get in return for the in-form Rooney.

517~~~
Prior to Moyes taking over SAF had decided that Rooney was surplus to requirements.  It was Moyes who convinced Rooney to sign a new contract.  He looks like he's done at this level. Would not be CF for any of the top clubs not Europe.

518~~~
Falcao esq today.

519~~~
He is never going to match the level of the other elite strikers in Europe, let alone the league such as Costa and Aguero. People (and more importantly LVG) need to accept that he is past his peak and on a decline, world class is out the equation and its questionable to whether he is even a consistent top class player. Whether or not he gets back into form, we all know that he will drop out of form and have the touch of a pub striker for another 3 or 4 games down the line and this will repeat throughout the season. Personally I don't even predict him to get over 20 goals this season , like a lot on this forum are. The worrying thing is there are a lack of top class strikers to choose from in Europe, so we are stuck with him for the next few years

520~~~
That is not title contender striker indeed <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

521~~~
Costa would badly struggle in this team which creates absolutely nothing.

522~~~
Costa actually made his name in a team that wasn't actually that creative, more than us, but less than the top teams. There's more to being a striker than waiting for things to fall in your lap.

But I do agree that better quality out wide would help Rooney. Young isn't ideal at all.

523~~~
He should stop dropping deep.  He's the solo striker,  staying up front would give hotspur defender things to worry.  By dropping down and contesting the field we have no focal point

524~~~
Both Rooney and Depay had nothing to play with really. Carrick, Morgan, Young and Mata didn't really feed the two of them. Aguero has Silva, Nasri and Yaya behind him, Costa has Hazard and we have...no one. Rooney was yet involved and decent today and certainly better than Memphis and Young

525~~~
A bit ironic as I think Rooney has been one of the most creative forwards in the premier league. Costa atm is clearly better than Wayne is but to fault Rooney as a  no#9 for the shortcomings of the midfield/wingers with the lack of chances created is a bit misinformed imo. For what its worth, this performance does feel better than his ones in the US tour.

526~~~
Looked knackered in the end was panting even during the post match interview, think he needs to get a few more games under his belt.

527~~~
And I'm sure our midfielders will say they have Costa, Aguero etc to provide quality forward play and we have.. no one.

Like I said, it works both ways. The blame doesn't lie with one or the other, but both. Not when both areas underperform. Hopefully we see us add the likes of pedro <i>and</i> Rooney perform better

528~~~
I'm faulting all of them. Not faulting Rooney <i>for</i> them. He wasn't up to the mark just like a Young wasn't.

Anyways, just one game in, hopefully he raises his level and has a cracking season.

529~~~
Not ant good today unfortunately.  Still hopeful that he can get it together and be a good goalscorer this year.  We will need to start creating chances more though.  A good example is the fact that Depay should have played him in for our goal and not passed to Young.  Rooney would have been straight in, although he really should have done better with the chance anyway.  

Can't help but feel that our players aren't great at spotting the movement from him and Depay and aren't technical enough to play the passes anyway.

Anyway here's hoping Rooney can pick up his form because we don't exactly have much back up.

530~~~
He seriously needs to move up a gear. He's far too good to be fecking around in the box like he did for the goal. Hit it.

531~~~
I wonder if he can still beat defenders 1 on 1. He always seems to wait for someone to arrive before making the next move. Also, I dont see the point in scrutinizing his performance too much. He is always average at the start of the season.

532~~~
I think Rooney isnt what he used to be and is in terminal decline..BUT, our tactics are also playing a part in this.If you dont create chances, then we will struggle . I think this team needs more creativity in it, and with the current formation , there isnt much.

However where Rooney really struggles and where the blame lies with him, is that he  needs to make the defenders lives more difficult than he does now.Think of Suarez's perfomance against in pre-season.He didnt score, but my goodness he was everywhere. Id love a player like Suarez in our lineup...

533~~~
He almost fecked up that chance if it wasn't for the defender. Quite amazing really.

534~~~
Nice dummy for OG to make a telling return to our attack! 

Our lack of creativity, especially from the two wide players make his job even harder to be fair, he is not Aguero or Suarez where you can just play it up to him and he'll make something happen.

535~~~
We should sell him next summer when his market value still high.This is not a knee-jerk reaction.He has been too hot and cold for a first choice striker of a top club and nobody gonna bench him.

536~~~
What in the world was he doing on our goal? That was terrible.

537~~~
It felt like he just showed up to OT for kick about.

I'm not expecting anything extra from him then what we have seen in the last few seasons. Some good games but mostly, him not delivering.

538~~~
Awful just awful.

539~~~
He's not got any high value anymore we would struggle to get £20 million for him.

We should have sold him the second time he spit his dummy instead the ever thoughtful Moyes gave him a big fat completely undeserved contract.

So know we are stuck with him and his consistently bad performances and paying him an absolute fortune for it too

540~~~
Hopefully LvG will get rid at the end of the season. Lewandowski in!

541~~~
Very little to work with but when he got a chance he clearly wasn't sharp enough. Walker spared his blushes and hopefully Wayne gets in to the swing of things in the next few games. The team do need to figure out a way to find him in the box if we want him or anyone else to score regularly.

Not great but not all his fault.

542~~~
Prolonging his top-level career at our expense.

543~~~
Nothing new here. I love Wayne but I know we are not winning anything meaningful with him as the main man. For one reason or another we've never done that and I don't see things changing.

544~~~
I think anyone would. 

Yeah he wasn't good today but people are delusional if they think they could just swap him out with *big name striker* and see an instant difference in this system. 

For the first 20 minutes him and Depay saw nothing of the ball. That's when they started dropping deep. Hopefully it's just early season rust from the whole team but tbh I don't think this is a system where we're ever gonna see free flowing attacking football which makes it important that he's clinical when he gets a chance. 

I'll concede he made a right pigs ear of the one Walker buried. Probably finished it better than Wayne could tbh. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

545~~~
Teams are gettng better these days,  we surely cant dominate and create chances for fun these days compared to pre roman, nowdays even midtable teams have a very good defender,  and top 6 definetely are not a walk in park we can create chances after chances. 

World class striker plays in the highest level tough opponent,  it's the half chances they score that sets them apart,  if we're creating chances like we do in the early 00s we can do with andy carrol

546~~~
How can you find someone in the box when he's not in the box? He should play like a striker,  be selfish and stay in front, the lack of service imo is due to him dropping deep,  which allows the cb to close down further, he didnt create enough movement to disrupt their defence,  they know he's not capable of dribling past them, and they know that his first touch is too shit to make a flick. Just stand off him and block him.

547~~~
Was awful today yet again. If Walker hadn't bailed us out, there would be a lot more people heaping the criticism on him. I really want him to do well and hope I am proved wrong but he just doesn't look up to scratch IMO.

548~~~
I agree that he lacks some positional discipline and drops off far too often, this has been a hallmark of his game for over a decade. I'm actually very critical of Rooney in general but the nature of our team play has not provided any striker with regular service in the box during the LVG reign. This is in itself a disincentive to stay put upfront (Even Falcao was dropping deep just to get a touch). Rooney doesn't typically play on the shoulder of the last man but does tend to locate himself in the box for crosses when the ball goes wide, which seems to be our primary means of getting the ball in the box at the moment, and none of them are finding him (Young cross aside, this afternoon). I'd look elsewhere for a solution if it were up to me but as things stand we can only assess things on what the team has at its disposal. With that in mind, neither Rooney nor those tasked with supplying him are performing to the desired level. 

Alas Rooney is here to stay and it appears will be in the team come what may, we need to make it work one way or another.

549~~~
I'm not too mad at him today. Our wingers did feck all

550~~~
Never really got in a chance today (apart from the goal of course, no idea why he took a touch) but I thought his overall game was better then it was in pre season so that's encouraging. Touch was fine and held on to the ball well. Wingers were just shite creatively speaking and gave him nothing to feed off of.

551~~~
Rooney is Rooney, bang average player for the last few years, but i'm hoping that he does not get the same treatment that RvP and Falcao got last year. A striker is only as good as the service they get.

552~~~
Neither got much service, not made aby decent runs to receive through balls. Drops too deep. I am sure Chicha will get at least 20+ mins against Villa, if fit.

553~~~
Pretty much unless he makes some big changes.  The biggest thing he needs  is to change his game to account for his declining acceleration and agility.  While he is still quite fast over long distance, he isn't quick enough in short distances to get away with drifting deep/wide and using his speed to get back into the right position.  Also needs to build up more strength to hold up the ball better, because he can't consistently beat defenders with pace anymore.  Essentially he needs to do like Alan Shearer did the last years of his career and accept that he isn't the same player he once was and find a way to contribute.

554~~~
He's just not <i>that </i>good anymore really is he?

555~~~
ive been reading the criticism on here for a while, and thinking it was a bit harsh.

but now I've captained him in my fantasy team, and watched him tug around, not getting near the goal, and not getting much service, I am a  little worried.
Showed the sharpness of a ball of wool when he had his one chance.

However did Kane look any better?  Same story, but even less influence on th ball.

556~~~
He'll still get 15-20 goals, wasn't particularly surprised by his performance. His best position is not a no9, doesn't have the right movement and doesn't stretch the play.
Still a very good player, him in behind a 9 would be good. Memphis back out wide.

557~~~
Why did he feel the need to take an extra touch and how on Earth did he think he had so much time on his hands? I'm not a big fan of his, but I can only assume he's playing within himself slightly and not feeling nearly as sharp as he can be.

558~~~
The biggest thing for me is that defenders don't seem to fear him anymore. Noticed this from last season and I think it's very telling. It's not like having Suarez or Aguero on the pitch. Seems so easy for defenders to anticipate what Rooney will do and also for them to push him off the ball.

Couple times today I wondered when he had the ball with some space, he didn't even try to run at their defenders - if even to do something different. I dunno what's going on with him, but he needs to improve right away. Then again, it's up to our coaching staff to realise we might have a problem here. It doesn't matter what we do in defence and midfield - goals win games and we need goalscorers or we won't be winning anything.

559~~~
He needs to play with more discipline if he's going to be the lone striker. He can't drop off into the channel then walk around aimlessly after passing the ball. Especially given the inexperience of Memphis and lack of physical presence from Mata - there's got to be an outlet for both of them.

560~~~
Always takes him several games before he starts to look anything resembling the Rooney of old, needs to stop trying to do everything and just concentrate on doing the one thing he was good at, scoring goals.

561~~~
Seems to get a free pass as long as others aren't creating chances for him. The very top strikers have the ability to make things happen on their own - you beat a man, create an opening for a shot, run down channels etc. Don't think he can do much of that anymore because he's lost all his pace and the quality of his touch changes from month to month. There's excitement when the likes of Aguero or Suarez received the ball in the final third because they can turn and run. Rooney on the other hand, typically just passes it sideways/backwards and then strolls towards the box.

562~~~
The whole attack is a million miles away from being good enough in reality. Other than almost screwing up a sitter, I don't think he did anything wrong today. Of course, a title contending team would like to think their main striker can do better than simply not doing anything wrong. 

It's early days, and Rooney would certainly be better with a more dangerous attack around him, and I think the manager is ultimately responsible, but I think Rooney should do better too. He simply isn't really much of a goal threat. It's all well and good saying he can finish, and will do so if an endless supply of sitters are supplied, but he also needs to be more threatening. 

Van Gaal is mainly at fault though,  for all his reputation, he is a negative and defensive manager, and we are terrible to watch under him. We may not have the best players, but of the ones we do have, he doesn't set us up to go out and beat teams.

563~~~
He was sharp as a razor today. A lot of the front players were, touch was great again. 

Problem is, I'll keep saying it over and over every game that we create absolutely sod all chances. He's not an off the shoulder/line leading striker. He's a 10SS who is best arriving late in the box in a fluid system. 
On the plus side he's basically a sorcerer, instead of gambling on a one touch finish he traps the ball on a dime and someone from the opposition as if under a charm comes and spikes the ball into his own net.

564~~~
Amen

565~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

566~~~
There were a couple of moments in the first half when Rooney's touch let him down, besides that I can't feel criticism of him is uncalled for. We could have had Suarez or Aguero up front today and it would not have made any difference. The gap between our number 10 and our holding players is massive, so massive that we never even looked like building any kind of move going forward. Rooney was left to run around after hoofs or hope that we'd nick the ball high up the pitch and play him in. Once again, a striker is not the issue for this team. If we actually gave Rooney two or three clear cut chances I'm sure he'd score them. I genuinely feel even Messi would have issues playing in the shape and system we use.

567~~~
I disagree. Suarez and Aguero are great at creating something for themselves, they have the skillset to be unpredictable and beat a man.

568~~~
I think Messi could create a bit more..he's a decent midfielder too with an ability to beat his man or 4..but yes, for the rest of the human players..our system isnt helping at all..

569~~~
How do you create something for yourself if you don't see the ball? Its like the 2009 Champions League final. Yeah we had Ronaldo but after the first 10 minutes we couldn't really get the ball to him. On his day Ronaldo, shown more often for Portugal these days than a club level, can literally destroy sides on his own. Only if he can get the ball though. 

I lost count of the amount of times in the second half we just went for the hoof forward. We barely used midfield, mostly cos there was nobody in midfield. Two sitters screening defence and a black hole between them and Memphis/Herrera. Even prime Drogba would have struggled to actually do anything in today's system. Even if he did bring down one of the hoof balls, there would be so much space between him and a supporting team mate he'd probably lose it before the cavalry arrived.

570~~~
Sharp as a razor today ??  We should thank god for Walker , cuz Rooney was sleepwalking .

571~~~
If Walker wasn't there he just passes the ball into the corner of the net past a rushing Vorm. Six of one and half a dozen of the other really.

572~~~
You can argue that he wasn't anywhere near as bad as some, including myself, are making him out to be but the bit in bold is complete nonsense any way you look at it. I was genuinely surprised to see no white text following such a statement. A sharp Rooney would have bagged that chance with no problem/hesitation.

573~~~
Really? If Smalling wasn't there today we would have witnessed a massacre. Such statements don't make any sense.

574~~~
Someone bagged it for him? Like I said, he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. I see no problems here, his touch was great, he layed on a couple of good passes in the attacking third and received absolutely no critical ball off the back at all to score or received no pushed up players to create quality touches around the area. This isn't a problem with Rooney, it is a problem with possession football and the Van Gaal system and the way Young and Mata work as inverted wingers. I have said this before, he won't score many in this system but if he plays like he did today then he will keep his place because this is exactly how Van Gaal forwards operate.
Yes. He's one on one in the area with the keeper who's rushing and has a signature instep curler into the near corner and he definitely would have buried it, hands down. Someone put it in for him, end of story.

575~~~
That's true, but he was there. If Walker put his foot in front of the ball instead of pass it back into his own goal, Rooney would have missed.
He took very long to react, which isn't good. He should be tapping those in with one touch. 
He was very poor today, really hope he's dropped if he keeps this up.. Enough with the "captain is never dropped" rule

576~~~
And stuck the ball in the net. Not anything else.
Sure.

577~~~
You're missing the point. It was by chance that the own goal happened. A lot of the time the defender/keeper would have simply disposessed Rooney which was relatively easy considering he took the extra unnecessary touch and the goal was a result of being dispossessed. You're telling me that Van gaal forwards operate based off luck and chance and that just because Rooney's mistake happened to lead to a goal means that he was razor sharp? 9 times out of 10 he would have simply been tackled without any own goal. Once again, Rooney should have buried it first time, without the touch, and if he was in top form I have no doubt of him doing that. I doubt a lot of aspects of his game but finishing is not one of them.

He was not exactly one on one with the keeper, Walker did very well until that point to make Rooney's life difficult but then made the very costly mistake of deflecting it into the net. You said it yourself, someone put the ball in the net for him which wouldn't have been necessary had he made the right decision in the first place.

Either you're on the wind up here or just are not capable of seeing past your love for Rooney. There are many on here who are big fans of him who would admit he messed up in this particular occasion.

There was another moment where he ruined one of our counterattacks by mishitting a very simple short pass into Memphis. Any player worth mentioning, would have not made such a mistake if they were in 'razor sharp' form. Most of our attacking players were just as bad today. It's not like I'm singling out Rooney here but frankly what you're saying is just not true.

578~~~
I'm not missing the point at all, we could argue any scenario we like. Twist it any which way to make out that Rooney is a championship level striker. I'm not doing that. We scored, regardless of what happened. End of.

Yes. He was. I think you need to watch it again. Walker is at full speed on the edge of the area when he is instinctively setting himself for the touch, look at the distance of the keeper and how out of position he is. He'd have tapped it in, or Walker scrambled to do it for him. End of story.

We can go on all day making up stupid arguments to bash Rooney with. It has to stop. It is completely and utterly ridiculous, not worth anyone's time including yours or mine.

579~~~
I praise his hold up ability but that's as far as it goes and that's not a dig at him, just not enough service for him to do anything more.

580~~~
thought  he did pretty well. You can see he is still a little rusty. give him 3 or 4 games. He will be there. He does lack service. I blame the way van Gaal has the team set up. Still experiemnting I feel.

581~~~
Unfortunately he's not a natural hold up player and when your wide forwards are Young and Mata there is little you can do in any case. I'd be surprised to hear Van Gaal speak poorly of him after that performance. (Have not seen his comments)

582~~~
That mindset is very backwards.

Yeah sure, he was by definition, one on one and managed to get dispossessed by an outfield player within a second of receiving the ball. Would you listen to yourself? Whether it resulted in a goal or not is purely based on luck at that stage and if we are going to hinge our season on a 'razor sharp' Rooney who relies on luck to deliver the goods then that's very worrisome. I'm not even bashing Rooney here. I have repeatedly stated that if he was up to his usual standard in this particular game, he would have buried the chance before Walker reached the ball in the first place. What you're saying actually benefits my argument more than yours. I have also continued to say none of our attackers were up to their usual standard today and  were just as bad if not worsethan Rooney. You are the one with an obvious agenda here, not me.

We can go on all day making stupid arguments to defend a relatively poor performance which a few players beside Rooney were also guilty of. Frankly, your unwarranted defense of him in this particular instance is what is 'utterly ridiculous'.

Even if you are still adamant that his performance was not poor, to say it was 'razor sharp' is completely unjustified.

583~~~
Club captain and leading striker on the same money as Ronaldo and messi, it is a joke, he has been atrocious the past couple of seasons, I have a few issues with the current setup at the club, but he is without doubt the biggest one given the status he has been given, it is not highlighted because he is protected by the English media, Fergie seen it and had him gone, unfortunately he retired and golum fecked up, by what we are paying him, if he is our answer to Ronaldo, messi, neymar etc is at any wonder we not at the races.

584~~~
The ball went into the net and it ended up being the single goal that gained the three points. I don't know what you want me to do other than state the facts of what happened? Rather than fabricating some illustrious breakdown of what could have, should have, may have, might have, possibly have happened.
I never said it wasn't based on luck, again, he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.
I've not even talked about other players in this instance. If simply stating the facts of what happened and being happy with his performance and in the notion that if he is not credited with the goal it is not the end of the world, then call me agenda driven. I'm not here to invent a multitude of scenario's that involve a desperation to paint Rooney as some shite championship striker. I'll call his game as I see it, today his game was decent playing a role he's clearly not suited to. It culminated in forcing an error and own goal which went on to be the match winner.

585~~~
Like someone here said, he didn't do much wrong today.

Which isn't nearly good enough. Depay and Mata will have to score 25 goals each if we are to challenge for the title, if Rooney is to play up front like this for the rest of the season.

586~~~
All Rooney had to do was be there and he is capable of far more than what he showed in that moment. If you're going to credit anyone, credit carrick who made the vital interception that led to the counter attack from such a dangerous position in the first place. He contributed a lot more to that goal than anyone else in the attack but of course you will shower Rooney with praise simply for being in the position he should be as a striker, despite not scoring a fairly easy goal by his standards. If we're talking about a defender would you praise him simply for being in the right position despite getting dribbled/muscled off the ball? Because that's the equivelant of what you're saying from a defensive point of view Furthermore, if that was Falcao or RVP they would be getting absolutely and rightly hammered on here but it's ok becacuse we're talking about Rooney? . We are paying far too much for a player of his capabilities to do just that don't you think? As for playing a role he's clearly not suited to; what are you talking about?

I have complete faith in Rooneys goal scoring abilities, it's his other attributes that slightly worry me but thats for another discussion. Whether you consider him world class or not, this was a poor game by his standards, as it was for all our attacking players.

587~~~
Player who can produce world class moments rather than a world class player. 
Though its less and less recently.

588~~~
He needs to sort it sharpish. LvG is putting a lot of faith in him.

589~~~
I think you're hurting your own brain. It was a 1-0 win and Rooney played well, there is no need to tangle yourself up in a desperate attempt to find something to bash Rooney with. I don't particularly care if anyone else thinks he's crap, or was crap against Tottenham, I stated my opinion and now I am walking away.

590~~~
Hope Chicha will get some minutes in next games..

591~~~
What I was surprised to see is, how he was always in a wrong position, when the midfielders were pressing and knocked the ball from the opposition. He was just never near enough to get to the ball first.

Not sure if it's just bad luck or bad positioning. But the repeating occurrence of it makes me think it's the later.

592~~~
Watching depay play in the middle behind rooney its clear that not only depay will play on the left but Rooney will be playing where depay is once we get a striker. 

An attacking midfielder who makes runs past the central striker is what rooney has been doing all his life. 

Rekon we are in for a striker that will go straight to the first team.

593~~~
Why would Rooney be so deep as to be playing near the midfielders? Can you explain what you mean by that?

594~~~
I am not bashing Rooney whatsoever unless you consider that to be fair criticism for what was a generally underwhelming performance by his standards. My initial qualm with what you said is that you implied he was 'razor sharp', which even the most avid Rooney supporters would agree he was no where near today. I would have the same objections if the same was said about any of our attacking players today for that matter. If Rooney was in his supposed top form today as you suggest then there is no way in hell he should be leading the line for a title challenging team. Goodbye

595~~~
thought he was sub par and contributed next to nothing if I am being honest.  He even tried not to score when gifted a shot at point blank requiring a trap and had to have Walker help him.  We need a proper striker again.

596~~~
No, I mean near the opposition's own box. He was there trying to interfere, but never close enough to actually get the ball.

597~~~
Saw him at the cinema today.

598~~~
Did he also miss the film?

599~~~
Apparently Walker went in and watched it for him.

600~~~
was awful anyway

601~~~
we might greatly differ in opinion, but that was a good one. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

602~~~
Haha, nothing wrong with a difference of opinion mate.

603~~~
He needs to stop being so shit. A good season from Rooney could make all the difference in making a title challenge. 

How he failed to score that chance was incredibly dumb. He's lucky walkers touch rolled into the net and not wide

604~~~
I'll say it again. He's a bit shit.

Obviously not compared to your average player. But relative to the reputation, the goal record, the money and other leading players - he's a bit shit.

605~~~
He likes to run towards our own goal when he gets the ball. It's like the opposite of what you want him to do

606~~~
I'm hoping its Rooney's usual needs a few games to get into the swing of things kind of start. But if we're going to be relying on him to get our goals in all 4 competitions this year, I think we're going to be in trouble. He's good, but I'm not sure he can be relied upon to last out the entire season, as he always a gets a few niggles, misses some games, then plays shite for a while before coming back into form.

607~~~
I honestly would have felt more comfortable if Chicharito had been on the end of that pass. Again, Rooney was incredibly lucky that Walker let him off the hook.

608~~~
A younger Rooney would have first time the ball. Seems off the pace and with the winger not creating, he couldn't offer anything.

609~~~
Rooney has always been a player who needs several games to get into the rhythm. Will get 20 plus goals this season though, not sure why he's being judged after 1 game. He does however need some decent competition for his starting spot.

610~~~
Because if we didnt lost the first few games last season we could have been champion

This kind of leeway is a luxury a title contenders team couldn't afford.  Every game counts

611~~~
Rooney won't thrive as a main striker in the system we are playing. He needs to play where Memphis is playing and a striker with excellent hold up play should be bought to play as the main striker. Playing with his back to the goal has never been Rooney's strength, and it is not going to become his strength now. 

I won't blame Rooney for the performances we have seen from him thus far.

612~~~
I can't believe he's getting defended for the "miss." He took an unnecessary touch, and was lucky Walker was gormless enough not to clear that for a corner.

613~~~
He made a pigs ear of that opportunity alright. 

What I can't believe is that this is being used as evidence of him being no longer able to convert a chance like that first time. I mean, come on, that's just fecking mental. He converted a bunch of opportunities last season far more difficult than that one. Did a magician wave a magic wand and remove all his finishing ability over the summer?

614~~~
That's almost as daft as defending him. I expected him to bury the chance when Young played him in. I may have a few problems with Rooney, but his finishing is not one of them.

615~~~
Yeah I agree. Finishing is the least of my concerns regarding Rooney despite the cock up yesterday.

616~~~
He's regressed massively to what he was before

But it's really hard to make judgements on games like yesterday when there is not much service. 

I was watching a few of our old games and the crossing from Beckham, Giggs, Neville and Silvestre was fantastic. They were putting the crosses right on our players head or feet. 

Where as with Young, he just aims it at a certain area rather than aiming where the players are.

617~~~
We've been witnessing this for the past 2/3 seasons. Still a very good player, but we really do need to invest in a striker very soon.

618~~~
Well Rooney was at his best, when really the last time we had a winger at his peak in a full season which was Valencia. Who was providing assist after assist in 2010.

619~~~
We had a player producing assists last season (Di Maria) even though it was only for half a season really. RVP, Falcao AND Rooney were missing chances for fun.
Just go and watch Chelsea game at the bridge, an in form Rooney wins us that game, missing 2 great chances. A top level no9 wins us that game. Spurs game at WHL also springs to mind (although that was more the other 2, Rooney was also a culprit) we drew 0-0

620~~~
I wouldn't say they were missing chances for fun. Those two games stick out. But I recall most of the other games especially the away games where we literally created nothing.

621~~~
We did have that problem too, usually after the ADM injury and his form went to shit.
However if people on here think that us not creating chances is solely down to the midfield, and nothing to do with the ability of the striker to make runs and stretch the play, then ok. One thing actually is that for a little while when Rooney went back up top last season, he started to stretch the play a little and created more space and we looked better. Then he reverted to type and kept coming deep and basically didn't play his position.

622~~~
The same magician who went for Torres and Falcao.

He got lucky Walker is gash and put it in his own net. Should be hitting that first time. Not sure why he even needed the touch, the ball wasn't exactly punted at him.

Rooney won't score enough in open play to win us the league. His stats might be boosted by pens/free kicks, but I'd still be surprised if he hit 15 league goals.

623~~~
To me the problem isn't that he missed the control, it's that he controlled it in the first place, he should have smashed it spontaneously. He could have missed it, but it worries me more that our main striker doesn't react like a striker, that he doesn't take his chance at the first occasion.

624~~~
Odd how Rooney has several premier league medals?

625~~~
If that's the counter then lindegard have a few, and oshea is better than ronaldo

Anderson have a couple, so does tom cleverly,  we are fine then? All of our starting line up have lots of medals between them

626~~~
I don't like how LVG is using Rooney. Half the time , Rooney is always away from the box and taking the positions of other players in the build up play, thus leaving us with no striker up front.

627~~~
So was Falcao and look at what he did last season. Horrendous. I think it is the way Van Gaal is using identifiers and the specific instructions he has for them.

628~~~
Never had the pace of those 2 and after his injury, ability to beat a man can be crossed off the list completely.

629~~~
So strange he didn't take it first time. He's about as instinctual as they come. He probably just over-thought it.

630~~~
Just because he never had the pace of those two present mean he didn't have pace. Besides, Falcon  was known to have very good dribbling ability and footwork to put himself in goal scoring positions especially during his days at Atletico Madrid.

631~~~
Yes, I repeat, post injury you can cross that off the list. So it has ZERO bearing to his time at united. It wasn't just United too, watch the copa America, and Chelsea in pre-season. He has lost that ability it seems

632~~~
Perhaps, for me I think he has lost every shred of confidence.

633~~~
It was strange alright. To give him the benefit of any doubt it was a fraction behind him and he may have thought he had more time than he did. Walker was absolutely flying back at him, from directly behind. When Young released the pass it looked like Rooney had all the time in the world. His first touch was weird though. Didn't get it out from his body at all (luckily, as it turned out!)

634~~~
He should take Walker out for a dinner.

635~~~
Then Kyle could finish his meal for him.

636~~~
You's a bad bad man.

Although I feel a slight bit of a stretch there, mind.

637~~~
That was a really terrible joke of mine. Still, I'm always slow to start each season; hopefully I'll make at least 20 good ones by May 2016.

638~~~
He was seemingly in acres of space, so i dont think taking a touch was that bad a decision.  Fair play to Walker for closing the space down so well.

639~~~
It was a bad decision, because he squandered the chance. 

Normally Rooney would just side foot that into the bottom corner first time. 

I hold no serious doubts about his finishing ability though, he'll be fine when he's gotten rid of the ring rust.

What worries me more is the lack of competition and his overall game as a lone striker.

640~~~
Hey I'm not the one stating teams that have certain players who take a few games to get up to speed can't be title contenders. Simply stating that isn't the case! 
League Titles are not won by one player! Nor are they lost by one player.

641~~~
In hindsight yes, but theres no way he couldve seen Walker coming. Hopefully he burries the next one.

642~~~
<i>Insert joke about Rooney always finishing his food quickly.</i>

643~~~
His mother was a hamster, and his father smelled of elderberries.

644~~~
Currently on the same amount of goals as Costa, Giroud, Benteke, Ozil, Kane, Hazard, etc, so i'm not worrying yet. If after 5 games he's only scored once, and after ten games has only scored three times, then maybe we can start to question whether he's still capable of being a 20+ goals a season striker.

But after one appearance? No.

645~~~
You know he played striker almost every week since RVP got injured, with just a few midfield performances.

646~~~
And as I said, if he still isn't looking like scoring after 10 games this season, then maybe we can question.

647~~~
There is also no proper play around him. With that system, most strikers would be lost.

648~~~
After that spurs game, will he get 20+ goals this season? too early to say i know but that own goal by walker has showed that goal instinct, that hunger for goals isn't there at the moment. Like i said, too early to judge him just yet if he can fill as the main striker as he used to back in 11/12 season. But at the moment i'm not convinced.

649~~~
A bit longer than 10 days, but here it is...out of 135 assists Rooney made, 13 came from set pieces. I expected more actually.

Beckham is the King of set piece assists, Cantona of non-set piece ones, while Giggs is a CEO of every fekin' type of assist! More <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/manchester-united-goals-and-assists-1987-88-today.396084/page-5#post-17924264">here</a>.

650~~~
I'm shocked tbh. Expected a much higher % to come from set pieces.

651~~~
He was poor, but then so was Mata, Young and Depay. You do wonder where the creativity is going to come from with what we have at the moment.

652~~~
Going to make a bold prediction here: Rooney peaked a long time and we've seen the best from him a long time ago. In his early twenties he was an absolute force of nature and would just wreck defenders for fun, but it's a long time since we've seen that from him

I don't question his goal scoring ability, and if he does get chances he will convert them, but if that is the only demand we make then we might as well have Hernandez up there. All the best teams out there have strikers that not only convert chances, but also make chances for themselves and that ability seem to get worse and worse with Rooney. 

I really hope he proves me wrong, but i have a sneaky suspicion that we will struggle this year unless we get a new top quality striker.

653~~~
Personal plaudits in this thread for you <a class="username" data-user="61812, @Mrs Smoker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61812/">@Mrs Smoker</a> absolutely incredible work. Rivalling Giggs' assisting ability.

654~~~
Average performance from him . Maybe it will take him a few games to get up to speed.

655~~~
Average performance but far from being as bad as some are making out. His hold up play was alright. I think the main problem was the weakness behind him in the Young-Memphis-Mata line and we just didn't create enough chances for him. Mata was really good with his passing (but he is not a winger) and Young and Memphis didn't provide enough creativity and width. Hard to fault the striker. I doubt any other striker would have made a big difference.
For the goal he should have done better, no doubt. I think he didn't see Walker and played safe with the extra touch. However Rooney has scored plenty of similar goals over the years with first touch so I would take it as a one-off for the time being unless he starts missing a few from close range. And lets not forget he was at least in the right place with plenty of space.

656~~~
I've said this for years mate. Rooney has always been a good few years ahead of his actual age in terms of his development, and hence his peak was probably 23-24 rather than 28-29 like most players. Look at him when he burst onto the scene at 16 - there was no way he was a typical 16 year old. We benefitted from that when we first had him but now it's the opposite. He's still a good player, but it's like having a 33 year old up front these days. That explosiveness is long gone.  He's certainly not a player who you would expect to play well into his 30's.

657~~~
Don't think that's a bold prediction, I think that sums up about 80% of the fanbase.

658~~~
Not great, but when Ashley Young is the most creative player in the trio behind you, you're never going to get chances galore. Rooney's no Aguero or Suarez, but our creativity is shocking.

659~~~
I think because over the last few years we've been used to seeing Rooney behind the striker, he's been involved in games a lot more and has seen a lot more of the ball. 

The way Van Gaal likes his strikers to play means Rooney will see a lot less of the ball, and because of that, people will automatically say he hasn't done anything, but to me, he played like any other striker would play up top on their own and did what he had to do. When the ball came to him, he held it up, linked up well, he pressed and ran in behind, although no one, other than Bastian in the 63rd minute, found him, which resulted in a shot on goal by Young. 

I think in order to get the best out of Rooney, and I've said it before, is to get wingers, who are willing to keep the width and run in behind. At the moment, with Mata on the wing, when he cuts in, which is often, he closes the space for both, Rooney and Memphis. Rooney is also a player who is great inside the box, and strives off crosses from wide, but we didn't get in nowhere near enough the other day. The crosses I can remember is the one which resulted in an own goal and Rooney's attempt of a bicycle kick.

660~~~
it could help if they were played in their postions and had a box to box cm to support them.

661~~~
I think part of the problem with Rooney is he has had it far too easy at United over the past few years and he's been playing every week regardless of the quality of his performances. He's also a player for me who needs regular game time, and I think he's someone who could have benefited from another friendly before the start of the season.

To be fair to him even if he didn't actually score the goal on Saturday, he was in the right place at the right time.

Part of me is really curious to see if a switch between Memphis and Rooney's current positions would work any better, albeit even slightly.

662~~~
Honestly, having him in the team is bugging. Maybe i am nitpicking but it is very frustrating for me to watch him earn his fitness at the start of every season and he has one of the worst first touches for a footballer. 

Plus the best striker we had was sold to play in the Turkish league for not being in top form. This makes me bitter. For me it should have been Rooney who should have been sold.

Why can Rooney never hit the ground running from the start of the season? Why is he afforded to play himself in to form every season? Why can he not take players on anymore (haven't seen him do this consistently since the 06-07 season)? Why can he not stop taking stupid free kicks that are always the same?

I would actually like to see Hernandez given a fair amount of time if Rooney fails to contribute to the team in a meaningful way. He promised 20 goals this season playing upfront.

I know that only 1 game has finished but i feel that we are lightweight with him as the main striker and he won't score 20. I hope he gets in to form for the sake of United's season.

663~~~
i think he actually was right on form at the start of the last two seasons personally. Agree with most of what you say though

664~~~
Been awful this half

665~~~
His touch is embarrassing.

666~~~
Not at the races at all.

667~~~
Has he had a skinful with Paul McGrath before the game? Pub Rooney was out in force in that 45 mins.

Keep it simple, actually control and pass the football and turn it around please! My FF needs it already!

668~~~
He is playing like he is 50. I do not understand how he keeps getting away with this type of below par performances.

669~~~
Undeniably shit so far

670~~~
"Can Rooney be our No.2 striker?"

671~~~
He is so fecking bad. He's not even premier league material right now. Villa would bench him the way he's playing.

In this form Rooney is just a liability.

672~~~
Appalling thus far.

673~~~
He's been shocking.

674~~~
Offers nothing whatsoever. Touch is awful and his movement is non-existent.

675~~~
And people think he will score more than 15 goals haha he's actually rubbish 

Rooney off Hernandez on at halftime 

Or Rooney off and januzaj at ST and Herrera at 10 would be an option

Either way take the liability off

676~~~
Right. I'm gonna take him out of my FF team.

You can thank me for the hattrick next weekend.

677~~~
Should be dropped if he keeps playing this poorly, he's just not good enough to lead the line on a consistent basis.

678~~~
Not only that, a couple of times he was extremely slow to close villa defenders down. Same vs Spurs

679~~~
20 goals my ass

680~~~
Terrible

681~~~
Just like the first game, looks off pace.

682~~~
He's not alone in performing badly tonight but by god, he's a shadow of his former self.

If I ever read about his 'ability to play anywhere' one more time I'll crack up. Currently his ability can barely justify being a limited target man, never mind a no.10, second striker, midfielder or whatever the hell position some people wish to see him in.

Some of the touches in this first half have been absolutely criminal. I mean it's ridiculous to think of the wages he gets and he's playing like a pub-player.

683~~~
Played like he's still on holiday. His touch is heavier than an elephant too.

684~~~
I don't think he's been anywhere near the ball to be judged as bad.

Depay looks like some guy plucked from the park rather than a top division league.

falls over, physically weak, and that horrible sight of putting them on their weaker foot wing.hate that

685~~~
Take him off for Hernandez, he's just holding us back.

Oh come on. He's slowing everything that goes through him. He's terrible!

686~~~
Worst player on the pitch.

687~~~
Wake up Wayne

688~~~
He is a handicap, specially when he doesn't stay up front and wants to touch the ball.

689~~~
The idea of playing with ten men instead of having Rooney on the pitch is something we should entertain.

<span style="color: #ffffff">; )</span>

690~~~
He's been absolutely rubbish.

691~~~
Passenger. He doesn't look match fit.

692~~~
He's a liability in this team now.

693~~~
What an absolute waste of space. Yet he can't possibly be dropped. Hernandez would offer more. RVP, despite being poor last season, at least could control the ball and pass it to the right man.

He's a bench striker at best. He breaks down all the attacks when you pass to him. Sick of the sight of him.

694~~~
Space jam'd

695~~~
Dropping deep. No pressure on the defence. Non existent touch. fecking awful.

696~~~
20 goals <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what an absolute dire performance. Van Gaal should have the balls to drop him and send him to the reserves.

He is deteriorating very very fast. Has no first touch, no awareness of what Memphis is doing, just chugging along. Do not want him at United anymore.

697~~~
I'm normally a Rooney fan, but since pre season started he has been absolutely terrible.

There is zero to praise him for.

698~~~
Is it a confidence thing or a fitness thing or both?

He's been awful so far

699~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

700~~~
If we have serious ambitions to win stuff we can't be having performances like that, ofcourse its early season and Rooney notoriously takes a while to get going but that was dire stuff.

701~~~
swap him for Robbie Keane..<span style="color: #ffffff">pretty sure even woody cant sell that</span>

702~~~
I think he's got a thankless task upfront. But my gosh, he's not getting his basics right.

703~~~
What's the betting he scores this half and nothing gets said in the press about that 45 mins tomorrow though...

EVEN G Nev pulled him up on it <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

704~~~
His technique has never been consistent so it's not a surprise to see him miscontrolling the ball but physically he looks to have gotten worse than ever.

705~~~
Overpaid fat shit.

706~~~
So bad. That is all.

707~~~
Lool. This guy will never win us the league as the main man. Never has never will.

708~~~
His one man war against the art of the first touch continues apace.

709~~~
The funny thing is people will still keep defending him week after week because he's close to Bobby's record. feck records, I want a consistent goalscorer.

710~~~
Who would think that this is a man who is going to be our all time leading scorer. Some great respect being shown for him.

711~~~
The thought of Wayne Rooney as being the pivot point for our goals tally this season is worrying to say the least. We'll be relying on goals from midfield again this season.

712~~~
He's dreadful, he always bloody is. He puts in five great performances all season and fans start going on about how he's world class.

713~~~
The pressure is seriously on him this season. He should and probably will improve but so far he's been absolutely wank.

714~~~
Both. He looks off pace but his touch always turns to shit when he goes through lean patches. He needs a goal. We need another striker.

715~~~
It's alright he'll put in a great performance in a few weeks and score 2-3 and everyone will be saying he's back and was just lacking the service. Either that or saying obviously he's playing poorly he's been playing out of position; he's a *insert any other position he isn't currently occupying*.

If there's one thing guaranteed with Rooney is that he'll have 20 terrible games a season. That's been the case for 4~ years now, let's just hope he'll get them out of the way early and he won't cost us.

716~~~
We are going to have to carry him over that Bobby Charlton line.. At this rate he wont get there anytime soon.

717~~~
This. I wish he just stayed up front.

718~~~
Like the guys are saying, Juan Mata is much more of a threat when centrally. Sooner we sign Pedro the better.

719~~~
I reckon it would be a pretty important if he can score today

Get him up and running

He was very poor indeed

720~~~
That tells you he isn't a natural striker sadly. He wants to be involved way too much, if only he had the touch to match that will.

721~~~
Depay is playing his first ever league game away from home at a tough stadium. Rooney has no such excuse.

722~~~
20 goals <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what an absolute dire performance. Van Gaal should have the balls to drop him and send him to the reserves.

He is deteriorating very very fast. Has no first touch, no awareness of what Memphis is doing, just chugging along. Do not want him at United anymore.

He is really that bad. So who gives a damn if he is going to be an all time leading scorer.  He is the main striker for United and currently he is pathetic. He deserves no respect. Earning almost 300K per week and having a first touch worst that the players from sunday league.

723~~~
He looks so inept. It's alarming really. 

We're relying heavily on the likes of Mata, Depay and I suppose Januzaj to an extent to provide everything he doesn't at the moment until he decides to show up. 

Very disappointing from him. And this isn't an opportunity to dig the knife, I just expect our main striker and captain to be better than this.

724~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

725~~~
Pre-season, everyone was telling me we just need a back up for Rooney.  I still stand by my opinion that he is finished at the very top level and not as good as what our top European rivals have

726~~~
Let's say he never scores a goal for us again (which isn't going to happen) the amount of abuse he gets is absolutely absurd. Even Diego Forlan gets more praise than him.

727~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

728~~~
It hurts to see Wayne playing like this.
He's a legend. One of my favourite players and probably going to be our record scorer of all time.
But LVG has no time for sentiment and if he plays like this for much longer he will be going the same way as Falcao, RVP et al.
LVG has zero real loyalty to him. If he can bin RVP he can bin anyone.
Needs to up his game sharpish. 

Also, when I see people saying Benteke or Lukaku wouldn't be good enough to play upfront for us and then I see the man who is...

729~~~
20 goals?You must be kidding me.Adnan and Memphis looked far more likely to be our leading goalscorers if we keep playing this way.

730~~~
He looks totally lost out there. I don't know what van Gaal wants from him but does he?

731~~~
And they won't score enough for us to challenge for the title / UCL

732~~~
Brightside is that he's been so shite we might decide to try and buy a replacement at some point in the next year

733~~~
Worst decision Moyes made was to keep him at United... Ok maybe not but when hes bad hes terrible

734~~~
what makes it a tough stadium out of interest?

We've a terrific record there, their fans aren't as vociferous as many, many away teams, and the pitch is lovely this time of year <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Rooney's game reminds me of many games when I played up front, not getting enough of the ball, playing up front on your own, and you end up wasting most of your efforts chasing the ball, from defenders with acres of space to play with.

735~~~
That is really poor

736~~~
In all honesty I used to defend Rooney when he played shit in the past because when he was crap he still used to contribute and look dangerous -- he was a threat, even if he didn't score he could assist, make things happen, etc. Lately he's just anonymous.

737~~~
doesn't even get in his 10 worst decisions <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

738~~~
Rooney in TGIF mode.

739~~~
Under a minute into the second half, misses the ball from a Romero kick and goes offside.

740~~~
That is the modern day striker though. Rvp was the same and wanted to be more involved in the build up. Even with his desire to be involved in creating chances and dropping back, he has kinda managed to keep scoring goals at a decent rate.

741~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if he got around 20 goals and put in a fair few good performances, he's still a good player, but the status he has as the only senior striker and as being basically untouchable is completely wrong. Given the money we've spent and our supposed expectations, you would think he would be under pressure for his place but he seems to have a standing at the club that is disproportionate to his ability. It's not a new thing, he's never been quite the same since about 2012.

742~~~
I wonder if he has some sort of accelerated aging disease?

He genuinely looks like that 45 year old geezer who's always smoking a fag outside the door of every Weatherspoons in the country.

743~~~
Is there a 'top' footballer out there that's this bad when he's bad? And as often too.

744~~~
I think he can still play into form, but even his good form isn't that special these days. I don't necessarily want him gone, but just from watching Memphis and Januzaj run around you can see how different we could look with a pacey young striker instead of him

745~~~
When is Fellaini coming back? I hope Van Gaal will consider swapping Rooney for Fellaini. Afro #9 as our primary striker would not be much worse than having this Rooney upfront.

746~~~
A modern day striker still needs to have a decent touch in order to link up and hold the ball, Rooney is just shit at it.

747~~~
He's in a role that he sees himself as, a striker. He is always dropping deep looking for the ball and I know its early in the season but he does look rather poor.

748~~~
He's always been a player with a huge difference between his best form and his worst. Bizarrely so. Koscielny is, or perhaps was, kind of the CB equivalent. Massive difference between their best and worst.

749~~~
What does he bring to the team at the moment? I'd prefer to see hernandez up there right now.

750~~~
My grandad has a better first touch.

751~~~
Probably better hair as well.

752~~~
100%. He does.

753~~~
Get him off! He isn't fit AT ALL.

Such an awful slow display from him the past 2 games. Shocking performances.

754~~~
I thought your post was about Rooney just staying up front and not dropping back too often. Enough has been said about his first poor touch, not sure if I can add anything else.

755~~~
We are playing 10 vs 11 for the whole game. Just sub him off, it's getting embarrassing.

756~~~
And he gets 90 minutes

757~~~
Nothing game from him. Even when you notice him he doesn't offer anything to our play. I can't believe we're going into a season with him as our main man, captain and primary goal scorer. Mind-boggling.

758~~~
20 goals a season ? Im really concerned that Van Gaal has brought off Memphis and Janzuaj before Rooney, done absolutely nothing, its been 10 vs 11 all game, we desperately need to sign a striker before the window closes.

759~~~
Who was it that was telling me the other day that Wayne is a world class footballer?

760~~~
SAF was right all along, we should of fazed Rooney out ages ago and not offered him this massive ludicrous contract

761~~~
When you see the type of performances other world class players are doing in his role it does become more embarrasing the longer it goes on. He's literally showing nothing. Can't help but wonder if we will ever see the Rooney of old again.

762~~~
Like a drunk out there.

763~~~
Shambolic

764~~~
That's horrible.

765~~~
He's been absolutely shocking. And I'm the biggest Rooney fan out there.

766~~~
Two awful pass attempts in the space of 20 seconds there. Gave the ball away twice.

767~~~
He needs dropping, permanently.

768~~~
This is the problem with him being captain. He plays all game every game. He should have been taken off half an hour ago but he's instead ruined every attack he's been involved in.

769~~~
He's a busted flush. Can't pass the ball more than 5 yards without giving it away and has no close control.

770~~~
Fecking shite, as per. Becoming far too regular now.

771~~~
Rooney has always been this bad. It is just that his performance get covered up by the goals he would score. Similiar to Javier Hernandez.

At the moment, I feel it is becoming anti-football for United to continue playing him, which is ironic as Afro #9 as a possible replacement can be seen to some as also anti-football. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

772~~~
That was a joke. genuinely awful performance.

773~~~
He's being shocking. Ridiculous how bad he's been the past two games.

774~~~
Awful, just terrible

775~~~
I really don't think it's hyperbolic to say that's as bad as he has ever been.

776~~~
100% true. His performance used to get masked due to his goals. But he is being found out. Hope he gets dropped on tuesday.

777~~~
He's been shot for a long time now and I have been saying just this.

778~~~
Very probably the worst game he's ever played for the club. Laughably shite.

779~~~
That's down to LVG, I thought he should been subbed at the hour mark for Chico but it's hard to do that when he's your captain.

780~~~
He's done and Ferguson called it two years ago.

781~~~
Past it. End of.

782~~~
My father called me especially to express his disgust at this performance. He never calls me anymore. I guess I that's the only positive I can draw from this ''performance''

783~~~
Did you see Bastian there? He demanded an explanation of why Rooney went out wide with that through ball.

784~~~
I'm beginning to have doubts.

785~~~
Absolutely horrendous performance from our captain. No influence at all. Cant remember a thing he did that didnt look like he was struggling all game.

786~~~
Moronic post. Rooney was class in the past. Hes not started this season well though....

787~~~
Wasn't quite at pre-spring 2011 levels but his first touch, short passing, decision making, and anticipation weren't great.

His game was summed up at the end where he chased the ball over the top and just couldn't make anything of it.

Still, we've seen it all before with Wayne. He'll go some games being absolutely cak, score and then turn it around.

788~~~
gave him a 5 on match ratings, think I was being way too generous though

789~~~
I thought this thread was meant to only be bumped when he actually makes an appearance for us?

790~~~
He was awful, but you know there's going to be that poster(along with people agreeing) who'll come in and say "I just watched the same match, and I didn't even think he was anywhere near as bad as people are saying, player xxxx was much worse"

791~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

792~~~
He is comical bad. He looks slow with a shite first touch. Can't hold on to the ball up front, can't make runs into space as he is too slow for that. Not sure what he is actually good at atm.

793~~~
Blaming Herrera when it was his own crap pass that lost the ball. He's got some nerve. Then when Schweinsteiger set him up ends up putting the ball out for a throwing...

Like a competition winner out there. Undroppable though.

794~~~
I've been a Rooney-defender for a long time, and I often think the flack he gets is incredibly harsh, but that performance was a 90 minute cringe.

795~~~
Seriously, how long is he going to get away with this shit? He's getting a guaranteed start because he's the captain, so he doesn't need to try and secure a starting spot.

With so much contention for places in the other positions, everyone else has to play at their best to keep their place. Not Rooney though. What a horrible performance from him today.

796~~~
Yes, he was but that past was a long time ago.

797~~~
I've felt he's been shit for ages. Noticed against Spurs he was particularly slower than everyone else in our attacks, hindering the speed and opportunities going forward. Give Little Pea a chance against Brugge.

798~~~
He was brutal

799~~~
Horrible performance. Needs to step it up next game.

800~~~
Couldn't even shield the ball in the corner with his big arse.

801~~~
I don't normally slate individuals that bad and have always been on Rooneys side no matter what he does but that was fecking embarrassing. A joke of a performance

802~~~
One of the worst individual displays I've seen in a long time. I backed him to have a good season up front, but he's worse than Falcao at the moment. Abysmal.

803~~~
Where are all the posters who believed he would score 20 goals for us? He was awful for the second half of last season as well and has carried on from there.

804~~~
His best piece of play today was salvaging an opposition throw-in rather than an opposition goal kick after being through one on one with the keeper.

805~~~
Go and get a striker so he has competition, Hernandez is good but he's really only going to be a supersub under LVG. 

Rooney needs a gigantic kick up his arse.

806~~~
is it me, or should he have at least got a shot away in that final few seconds?
instead if ran away from him and all he could do was stick it our for a throw to waste time.

not sharp at the moment, but history has shown he's a streak scorer, and takes  awhile to get up to it

807~~~
No longer good enough as a striker, number 10, midfielder. He's only starting because he is captain and there are no better strikers.

808~~~
He's just out of shape. It will take maybe 1-2 months before he's back to his best.

809~~~
He cant lead the line because he is too erratic.  This is why that we are playing him upfront until we get a striker.  Rooney then will have to rotate with januzaj in the middle.

810~~~
I thought I had seen it all with this performance tonight and then I see him mouthing off at everyone near the end.

Reminded me of him giving shit to the players in the Leicester melt-down last season, despite him being one of the primary reasons our play went to shit.

Atrocious performance tonight. Our rivals will be pissing themselves if we persist with him. I'd love him to get our goalscoring record but he has no chance at this rate.

811~~~
Never seen him play so badly

812~~~
Meh always been a purple patch player, nothing new to see here.

813~~~
Said that in the match day thread. He was so bad I was getting embarrassed for him.

814~~~
Starved of chances but even the most partisan Rooney fan would be hard pushed to find anything positive to say about his start to the season. Touch is totally gone. He's been some player but he looks like a guy in the middle of a steep decline right now. And, judging by his body language, he knows it.

815~~~
That last touch, I felt bad for him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That was horrible

816~~~
Name anyone who was worse than him today from both teams.

817~~~
hopefully he gets a bollocking

818~~~
Shame you have to choose from 1-10 in the player ratings section. 0 seemed a suitable rating after that performance.

819~~~
He's fecking shit. There are probably better strikers in the Championship.

820~~~
He's completely pointless these days. He contributes very little and looks like he could play all day and not even get in a position to score.

821~~~
He ish my captain 

He ish undroppable

He ish bigger than the club 

Yesh!!!!

822~~~
Would've been nice if we'd just taken the money from Chelsea.

We're stuck with him, now, though. Can't sell because of his wages. Just have to hope he comes good... He can still finish. It's not impossible that he could score twenty league goals whilst generally being rather crap.

823~~~
Said it 3 years ago already, he is the problem and hes becomming a bigger problem week after week.

Absolute disgrace to have him in his current form represent united.

Just plain embarassing to watch.

824~~~
This was the worst performances I've ever seen from Rooney.

825~~~
Face facts... we all know he will start on Tuesday.

But how long will this go on before there is a realistic chance of him getting dropped.

And how can LVG not be looking for another striker while the window is still open.

826~~~
Diabolical performance. No effort, no graft and generally strolled around the pitch today. Didn't even get in a possession to have a scruffy shot. Really needs to work his bollocks off as a leading striker, just not good enough at all.

827~~~
Of course he should have. It was an atrocious first touch.

828~~~
Hes not a player who should be playing with his back to goal for the majority of the game. Im surprised so many here seem shocked at his performances whereas its been clear for quite a while that rooney is a CF/SS and not a ST. He gets dominated physically and doesnt have turn of pace to bother a CB. He needs to influence the game more. He needs a proper no.9 playing next to him.

829~~~
Waste of space. 'But the thing with Rooney, is even when he doesn't play well, he still contributes.' He's rubbish. He'll get some tap ins, he'll score one from range or whatever, but he's rubbish. That wasn't too far off how he generally has played for years now, give or take a goal or two..

830~~~
It'll go on for ages. The captain is undroppable in Van Gaal's eyes. I do wonder if that's part of the issue. His place isn't under any threat whatsoever.

831~~~
Biggest mistake was to make him captain. All this Rooney is undroppable bs has to stop. Get a striker and sit the fecker on the bench as long as he can't control a football.

832~~~
As bad as he was. Doesn't beat his Swansea performance.

We need to get a pacey striker.

833~~~
The thought of him leading our line for the rest of the season actually angers me

834~~~
Shocking tonight. Terrible. 

Whats even worse is that Hernandez didn't even get a chance because there's no way he should have played 90 minutes. Captain privileges is such a cop out on LvG's part too. This could be an achilles heal for us this season.

835~~~
Against Swansea in 2012/2013, it was that bad.

836~~~
Does he ever get criticized in the british media ?

837~~~
Is this some kind of apology on his behalf?

838~~~
Needs to be replaced, asap. 

Those last 10 minutes were hilarious. Couldn't control the ball, couldn't pass it 5 yards, horrible touch, go outmuscled by fecking Richards. Amazing!

839~~~
Never mind that, I'd find it hard to find the last time any player for us has had a worse game than that. Absolutely woeful... Hopefully Van Gaal shows his ruthlessness and drops him now. He needs a dose of reality that he won't start if he keeps playing like that. And it compounds how desperately we need another striker.

840~~~
Apparently, his first touch in the box all game was when he was put through late on and just about managed to kick the ball out of play.

841~~~
It's like John Terry all over again. Could do no wrong.

842~~~
I wouldn't be surprised to see him still do that. He can be average in a match and then score 1-2. Especially against lower sides.

843~~~
The worst 'world class' footballer in the world. Schweinsteiger was bemused with how he put his throughball to waste like the nothing footballer he is. At least he got another round of "rooney rooney" when he took it to the corner again like in the last match... need to waste some time and see some great corner shielding skills? Rooney's the man for that. 

What a neanderthaler of a footballer. A disgusting disgrace.

844~~~
Horrendous. I feel he's is the reason why we struggle to carve teams open. He's just there but he's neither able to play the football himself, nor make the moves to receive the ball and score goals.

It's bleak looking at our forward line.

845~~~
Tbh Richards is a tank.

846~~~
No, you really aren't. Watch this place.

847~~~
No shame in that to be fair. He's a tank.

848~~~
LVG is a very strict guy and doesn't care for big names or personal relationships.
So, at what point will LVG put Rooney on the bench?

849~~~
That's comforting.

850~~~
Horrific. Should head off to either the MLS or the glue factory.

851~~~
This

852~~~
I think it's hard to sign a decent striker when you can't guarantee them a place in the starting 11, If we sign anyone during this window they will be playing second fiddle to Rooney. The kind of players we have been linked with won't agree to those terms.

853~~~
What do you mean? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

854~~~
Laughing at the assist on the stats on here

855~~~
Souness dared to suggest that Rooney was poor. Immediately the presenter was on his case with "Rooney was poor or the way United set up was poor????!!".

856~~~
30 in October. Looked about 36 out there tonight.

857~~~
I'd give him a zero for that. Nothing worked for him.

858~~~
Was terrible tonight.

859~~~
Not really

Seriously disgraceful performance from the club captain and highest earner. Need a new striker for sure..

860~~~
Go out and spend I don't care how much and bring an actually dangerous striker into the club please Ed.
I know he didn't have a great deal of support tonight but he just couldn't stay upfront. His dropping into midfield all night was one of the main reasons they were able to press us so well at the start of each half. Their defenders could push right up knowing Wayne wasn't going to be running in behind them.

861~~~
An absolutely horrific performance...

862~~~
Bit harsh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I like your style though.

863~~~
I'm right here.

I don't understand the consternation about Rooney. He needs service.

I think he's just obeying his strict tactical instructions, and that looks wrong to you lot.

But time will tell.

864~~~
I thought it was the Villa fans chanting Rudy, Rudy?

865~~~
Not sure how people can Carry on defending Wayne. We give him every chance and he has been in a massive slump for almost a year. Fergie saw this coming but unfortunately we've not given him strong young competition so far.

866~~~
not at all. just saying hes not a ST imo. He will improve as the season goes on but in the big games, he will get dominated by CBs like Komapny if hes played as the lone striker.

867~~~
Come on guys. Second game of the season, in a role he hasn't played consistently since 2010. He's always been a supporting striker 2011+. Give him time, he'll lead the line again and get his touch back after a couple of games.

868~~~
We could get a "potential" type player with no bother I reckon. Berahino would be the obvious choice.

869~~~
He might not get 20 goals this season but he'll get the golden boot for offsides.

870~~~
Rooney has been below par for a while. We need a striker even more than Arsenal.

871~~~
Horrifying performance. Been saying it for a while; unless he scores goals he is absolutely useless. Even when he does, that doesn't stop him from ruining half our attacks and the goals just help to cover the rest of his horrible game.

872~~~
Even when it comes to headers, there is just so little effort to win the ball.

873~~~
Another really poor pass. It's not just that he can't get into the game and get on the ball, it's also that once he has it he's terrible with it! We really should invest in a top striker and bench him if necessary

874~~~
We just might sign another striker if his performances continue.

875~~~
Sir Alex fell out with lots of players, but its amazing how he always fell out mostly with those he knew were past it for him..Other than Stam, most were justified years later..This is another, we should have done that years ago imo..I dont think Rooney is a bad player..but we are too big and ambitious as a club to accept this kind of perfomances..LVG seems ruthless enough, at the end of this season , he may need to show that, or it could be him that may out of job

876~~~
He was shocking tonight. The problem for us is that even if we sign someone better we'll just play Rooney as an attacking midfielder anyway. He's undroppable, unfortunately.

877~~~
The Sun Dream Team has just given Rooney Star man!

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

878~~~
Feck me he was shit today. On days like this you can just sub him off after 20 minutes, because you just know he is in his pub player mode and won't do anything of note. van Gaal won't drop him already, but I am sure it will happen it he continues like that. It's a shame that we haven't really someone on the bench who can put pressure on him or take his place.

879~~~
I have no problems with strikers scoring tap-ins.
If he can get 30 (league) tap-ins a season, I'd rate him as one of the best in the league.
But the problem is, he isn't getting into a position where he can score tap-ins.

880~~~
Wanted Chicharito to replace him at half time, but wasn't sure if he was on the bench.

881~~~
342 league games, 170 goals. 481 total games, 230 goals. What a disgrace this lad is.

882~~~
he holds us back majorly, and we should of got rid when ferguson wanted too.

how can anyone defend him? do the people who thought he'd score 20 goals in the league honestly still think that?

883~~~
Agreed. Pippo Inzaghi springs to mind as a modern day Gary Lineker. Nobody cares where you score from as long as you score.

884~~~
You say that about Richards as if he's a flimsy pussyhole.

He's a man mountain!

I get what you're saying though!

885~~~
Means f all. That was then, this is now. He's been like this for the last few seasons.

886~~~
how many goals do you think Lineker would get in these performances?

we had 3 shots on goal!

we have the handbrake on at the moment though.

887~~~
I think this answer your question <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

888~~~
I hope he does improve, very disappointing performance tonight and it's in danger of forming a pattern. He can't get away with this for long or we're fecked

889~~~
Nobody is questioning his career; people are (rightly) questioning the wisdom of relying on him as our primary attacking threat this season.

890~~~
If you want to bring up records, we might as well bring out Sir Bobby out of retirement..He isnt up to much either this days, and would give us the same quality of perfomances..perhaps even more heart

891~~~
Villa's best player

We wouldn't be after Pedro if we really thought he'd get 20 + goals this season

892~~~
I'm actually beginning to agree with the posters, as ridiculous as it is, who say there may be a certain clause in his contract that makes him undroppable in some sense. How was he not subbed today after comfortably being the worst player on the pitch?

893~~~
Poor performance. Needs to get going asap.

894~~~
But LvG does say his captain shall always play... I fear that it would take another 3 months of complete garbage performances before LvG goes back on those words.. So far, it's looking like LvG really shot himself in the foot by making Rooney his captain.

895~~~
What on earth does that have to do with how he's playing now?

896~~~
Going by stats, Liverpool are still one of the best clubs in the League.

You see how that works?

897~~~
It is weird that he doesn't criticized. Better players get it with less horrible performances.

898~~~
Silent domination

899~~~
I see your point. Van Gaal is obviously telling him to misplace those passes and lose possession constantly because of a poor first touch. Silly me.

900~~~
Personally, I'm not someone who uses that term too often because no one can seem to agree what it actually means, but it does annoy me when I hear people like Ian Wright on 606 telling us Rooney is 'world class' because he's been at United for 10 years. So what? Would he get into the best teams in Europe? Not a chance these days, whereas 5 years ago he would have for sure.

901~~~
I gave him 4 and that's generous.

902~~~
I Know. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Bring back RvN ffs.

903~~~
Of course it means nothing. Just like Charlton's goals mean nothing, Law's goals mean nothing..... In fact, who cares that we've won this, that and the other - let's all just call him a fat cnut and not show our respect to someone who has contributed greatly to our history. Of course all that history means nothing as it is in the past and not today.

904~~~
As I said in an earlier post, we need him to stay up top when he is our main striker but he is too used to coming into midfield to get involved in play, but it's detrimental to the team right now. If we have someone up top stretching their defence then there is more room for our wingers and midfielders to play.

905~~~
x2. 

If he had been subbed off at HT he could have no complaints, absolutely terrible.

906~~~
Only player I've got nothing to say about tonight. Mainly because I can't remember a single thing he did.

907~~~
Hopefully we will go all out for a top striker now - inept.  Could be a blessing in disguise.

908~~~
No defending him tonight, although I'll try with this. We've still yet to see any striker play well under LvG. There's probably better times to rip into your forward than after two consecutive 1-0 wins as well.

909~~~
Well, yeah. But Rooney is supposed to be the leading striker here.

910~~~
You reckon Newcastle fans would still want Shearer starting for them?

911~~~
Liverpool are still one of the best clubs in the league though. Are they not? If Liverpool are not one of the best clubs in the league then the entire pyramid of English football is nothing at all.

912~~~
Does not deserve to start the next game. Simple as that. Captain or not, he's a liability.

913~~~
They currently aren't.

914~~~
Finished at the top level, finished.

915~~~
Barring one 2nd place finish, they have ended the season outside of Top 4 in the last 7-8 years.

916~~~
Sign Lewandowski.

917~~~
Sell him.

918~~~
Are you serious? There is no post that better proves that his fan boys are simply confirming the fact that he is a player living off reputation. Don't care how many goals he's got in the past. He's been utter shit for a while now and people just keep repeatedly posting his goal stats. Even when he's in scoring form, it doesn't change the fact the rest of his game has fallen to shit. There's more to the modern striker than getting goals, believe it or not and Rooney is not doing either right now.

919~~~
Is it Rooney or the system that is preventing him from playing well? He looked just like Falcao did last season today.

920~~~
You reckon he deserves all the shit he is getting? He will still be our top scorer this season, Shearer won't be Newcastle's top scorer if he was playing, would he? Your argument doesn't quite work.

921~~~
What can we do about that problem? Would Bayern take 50 millions and him for Müller?

922~~~
Hm... Erm... No they aren't really.

923~~~
because it is<i> that </i>easy?

924~~~
He dropped van Bommel at Bayern and got rid of him. If Rooney continues like that he will be dropped, but he will give him some games before that.

925~~~
Which actually makes me consider the fact there is some sort of clause in his contract. He gets away with murder when every other player is met with ruthlessness despite big names, relationships or even captaincy as has been shown in the past when he dropped Van Bommel.

926~~~
Oh my..this is a player perfomance thread..where players perfomances are dissected..even Bobby Charlton moved on when the time was up..Gary Neville himself told Fergie that it was time up..

927~~~
He was appalling tonight. I don't think I've ever criticised Rooney on here but that was dreadful. If we stick as him as our primary / main striker this season, we are in big trouble.

It's true that he's a notoriously slow starter, but it looks more than that. He looks to have lost so much of his pace and even his overall play and movement are piss poor at the minute. I'm worried. It's also worrying that LvG blatantly won't sub him off.

928~~~
To be honest, I do not mind him staying up front if he would not mess up building up the attacks.

Everything he tried did not work, his touch was non-existent, his passing inaccurate, his positioning suspect and his demeanour uninspiring.

He needs to find his feet soon or I think he is going to be permanently dropped.

929~~~
Fan boy? I can see you don't care and many others don't care about what he has done and will continue to do so as we as a club don't embrace our traditions, do we?

930~~~
Not necessarily at the top level but it isn't working for us at the moment.

931~~~
There is no defence for that tonight. Fail to see how anyone can rationally defend that. 

He's supposed to be our captain....Lead by example. If that's the example then....

You're only as good as your last match. Ronaldo and Messi have amazing stats but, if they go a few games without producing the goods, the screw is turned on them. Why is Rooney any different?! 

Correct me if I'm wrong but, he hasn't scored since March.....

932~~~
Of course does. He's playing crap.

You don't excuse poor performances because of what someone has done in the past. 

Of course he will be our top goal scorer this season, he's the only striker who's going to play every week! His lack of goals will be what holds us back. He won't get 15 in the league.

933~~~
Meanwhile in London...

Radamel Falcao is rewatching the game tape, studying what was, for him, a marvelous centre forward performance from Wayne Rooney.

934~~~
Will he though? He seems to be undroppable after being made captain.

935~~~
Drop him, it has to be done. Might be the kick up the arse he needs.

936~~~
So that means they aren't a big club? What planet are you from? I seriously mean that!

937~~~
On this he won't beat Sir Bobby's record, and that might be for this best tbh.

938~~~
What are you talking about? How does what he has done have anything to do with what he will do? His declining game is clear as day.

939~~~
Falcao looks like that for Colombia too..I think we have just had the unfortunate experience of having three over the hill strikers on our books for massive wages..We need to solve this soon.

940~~~
You've a sense of reality. Some of his fans live in another world. That guy Major Tom is hilarious.

941~~~
Its mental that we sold Van Persie yet keep playing Rooney, RvP was much more talented on so many levels and at least linked up play better too

942~~~
So, let's see, is the English league the biggest league in the world? Let's name the biggest clubs in England.......

Of course all this is going off tandem but just proves what is and what was considered a great player/club.

943~~~
WTF?? - stats at the top says he got an assist for the Spurs game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

944~~~
I'd kill for a Lewandowski up front.

945~~~
Tonight's the first time I've truly thought "he's finished". Looks like SAF may have been absolutely correct to try and sell him two years ago. Hopefully he can prove us all wrong.

946~~~
I'm one to try and defend everyone. But Wayne Rooney tonight was dog shit

947~~~
Yeah great thinking. Lets keep playing a heavily under performing player out of respect for what he has done. Genius. Let's re sign up Cantona

948~~~
Very poor performance from Rooney. We need some competition for his position to keep him sharp.

949~~~
I see, thanks for the info. How long did it take for Van Bommel to get dropped? Hopefully our general performances will pick up to cover for any potential slack from Rooney in the meanwhile...

950~~~
Thought exactly the same today.

951~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

952~~~
His concentration needs to improve, offside so many times and a fraction late when controlling a pass or making a run too often. Van Gaal was ruthless with Falcao and RVP and needs to be the same with Rooney.

953~~~
We will see who is our top scorer and the end of the season and our record scorer in our entire history. But go ahead, call him all the names under the sun and show just how much you embrace our club and players. Rock on Tommy.

954~~~
Again you're talking about something no one is denying but currently in terms of performances, history means feck all. What Rooney and Liverpool did in the past means feck all.

955~~~
Silent domination....

Havent watched the game but why are you lot so surprised, he's been average at best for months, and that's being very generous. Looks like it was another showing that the 20 goals expectations came from total delusion.

956~~~
Oh I have no doubt he will.

in 2011 Van Gaal kicked Mark Van Bommel, his captain at the time, out of Bayern Munich halfway through the season after he fell out with him. Last year he openly told RvP and Falcao that they were shit and not impacting the game enough.

if Rooney goes a few more games like this, I'm sure Van Gaal will start changing things.

957~~~
Do you think he played well tonight?

958~~~
Yeah, I'm not sure what is he on about.

959~~~
BBC saying his one and only touch in the penalty area came in stoppage time, when he blootered that through-ball out for a throw-in.

Shambolic.

960~~~
To be fair as already posted, SAF called this 2 years ago. And his real proper decline started last season, where he was pretty ineffectual, touch and passing especialy

Only thing that saves his some race are those long balls to Valencia that commentators oooo and aaa over. Whats also funny is commentators never slate him when he makes mistakes, must be some injunction to criticize him or something

961~~~
When did he last have a good game? Seriously?

962~~~
He wasn't even average. He was crap. Stinking crap. You know the one that comes after not shitting for 2 or 3 days.

963~~~
He's been bloody awful for a good while. Our main striker is supposed to pose a threat and give the opposition problems. He did none of that. His touch and movement were of a pub player.

He may get a few more games to wake up from this rut then he needs to be benched because he's contributing very little right now.

964~~~
He needs 20 goals to beat Sir Bobby record, if he fails to beat it then I think it will be end of him. You just can't carry on paying someone £200K if that's all they're bringing, regardless of many goals they have scored in the past or the amount of shirts they sell, players need to be jugged on their current performance.

965~~~
Some chappie called Muller scored twice tonight <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

966~~~
No, but do I think he deserves respect? Yes!

967~~~
Looks like he's lost his passion a long time ago. Seems to be riding his reputation now.. He knows he can just put in his 9-5 everyday and collect his pay check without having to really impress anyone. He also knows we really have no choice other than him upfront. Success doesn't come from your comfort zone. Van gaal making him 'undroppable' doesn't help.

968~~~
Cavani anyone? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

969~~~
Bench him and make him earn his place again. Just a shame we have no one on our bench who could play well upfront

970~~~
Maybe just the convenient history means something. If you want to bring up his past actions then why not mention his bending the club over a barrel for more money twice, threatening to leave us for Manchester City? There's a reason Charlton and Law have statues outside OT when Wayne Rooney never will, no matter how many goals he ends up scoring for the club.
Can you honestly remember the last time the fans of opposing teams were scared of playing against him? I'm thinking probably 2010.

971~~~
Utterly fecking useless.

A total donkey.

972~~~
So you're using both the past and a future that hasn't happened yet to defend him demanding £250k a week while performing woefully and being a liability to the team?

973~~~
He was a great servant for the club. Now I hope he scores again. In the MLS.

974~~~
His first touch was never consistent but it was shambolic today.

975~~~
Which has nothing to do with what anyone is talking about. 

He played like a drunkard tonight, which is all anyone is saying. Nobody is playing down his historic record.

976~~~
Just going back to that Barca preseason game when Luis Suarez didnt score but was everywhere, hitting the post twice..thats the kind of striker this team needs..Its what we deserve ...Rooney is past it, but lets be honest, he has been for a while..Its just that  a lot of people are coming around to the idea.

977~~~
I called it two years ago too, but of course I have significantly less credits than Fergie <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

This is the league's best player, and one of the highest paid in the world. Persie is a better player.

978~~~
Oh come on, why is it disrespectful to say he played shite?

979~~~
The curious case of Benjamin Rooney. 
From a boy that played like a man, to a man who plays like a boy.
I gave him a 2 because his shirt was on right.

980~~~
Hernandez couldn't do a worse job surely. Let him start up front for a few games and see how he does. Might aswell because rooney is just a big slightly moving lump currently.

981~~~
By your logic, Liverpool are still the best club in England. Oh wait.

982~~~
He was comically bad tonight, we're fecked if we don't bring a striker in.

983~~~
I dont rate Cavani..but even I might be a little tempted now

984~~~
They had a good first season together, where he said the same like he did at United. ("My captain will always play.").
In the second season van Bommel didn't perform good anymore and he fell out with van Gaal, lost his place and he got rid of him in the January window.

He tried Rooney in several positions and this season he made him the main striker, I think he will give him at least a few games as a striker, but if it doesn't get better, he will be dropped imo. It's his last chance, he wasn't really good enough for LvG as a 10 and we don't need him in midfield anymore, if he can't perform as our striker, there is no need for him.

985~~~
Honestly, I'm not a fan of Hernandez at all. He's too limited for me and with our current system the completely wrong type of striker

986~~~
He was awful tonight but we literally have no one to take his place at the moment. Where has Wilson gone? 

We need to get a striker in before the deadline, I have no idea who but we need someone.

987~~~
hernadez is a better option atm.

988~~~
It's only the 2nd game but I'm really worried. If most people can see his decline, why doesn't the coaching staff?! The way he's been playing it's like he's not there at all, so we may as well give his place to someone else. Plus I've said it many times, he's too comfortable in his position. 
I know we've had the crazy speculation about what we agreed to in his last contract, but I'm beginning to wonder if it's not so far fetched. He loses the ball like crazy yet the perfectionist LVG never drops him and never criticises him. How on earth do you explain that?<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

989~~~
RVP always better than him, just couldnt stay injury free, RVP`s touch and link up play where top class, especially his left foot had a rocket shot

The thing about Rooney is his pay packet is far far above what he deserves for type of player he has regressed to today

990~~~
I suppose through sheer lack of options up front he could get the goals required to beat it, but it'll be a hard watch seeing him doing it, not sure I want him to tbh.

991~~~
I reckon he's gone at the end of the season, so doubt he'll do it.

992~~~
Is there one position on the pitch where we can play him where he actually won't hold us down? Because, he obviously has to play for some reason that has nothing to do with his performances on the pitch.

I'd rather have a 3rd midfielder occupy that role like Herrer or even Mata, players who are technically sound.Rooney occupying that deeper role exposes the obvious weaknesses  in his game. His erratic first touch, poor short passing and his inability to spot a pass. If he cannot hack it as a number 9 United should be spending big on someone who can.

994~~~
You can probably count on one hand the number of players in the world who get paid more than he does. We need a top class striker who can genuinely challenge him for his place instead of watching more performances like tonight.

995~~~
He won't break Charltons record this season.

When was the last time Rooney had a 8/10, 9/10 performance?

996~~~
Cavani for a decent fee would be a good signing. 

Rooney just isn't a lone striker for me now. He was in 2009/10, but that Rooney was much more mobile. Was much more aggressive also.

Every bit of his game including his aggression seems to gone. I loved it when he was angry and played. Maybe he'd pick up the odd card, but his performances were good. 

If we not signing a CB then we should go for a striker. We lack goals. It's big ask telling Depay to get you 20 goals in his first season.

997~~~
It's all been said, I just don't ever recall every aspect of his game looking as lackluster as it does right now, he looks like he has the same disease as Falcao last season.

998~~~
Rooney scored 12 league goals last season, which is 3 under his average for his entire career with us. That 12 matches 3 other seasons and beats 2 others in 11 seasons in total. So, that means he is right where he should be, add in the fact he never played up-front for a great deal of games. He will get more than 12 this season but somehow that isn't good enough anymore and never has been. What are you expecting from him? He is continuing what he always has done. What really bugs me though is people calling him a drunkard, a donkey, a cnut and various other names under the sun. I mean, do those words reflect his stature as a player as of today and show any respect at all to him as a player?

Like it or not, he is going to be our all time record scorer and I think it would be nice if we could use terms to refer to him other than those that are currently being banded about. It looks bad on you as individuals, you as fans rather than Rooney himself, no matter how many times you continue to use them.

I'm glad he is still here, that he is still our main striker and that he will be our record scorer. As a fan of our club, it is nice to watch him play and to watch him eventually break that record. Next time I'm at OT, on Tuesday, I'll be singing "Rooney! Rooney! Rooney!" along with the rest of the stadium.

999~~~
That's great, but he was still worse than dog shit tonight.

1000~~~
We won't win anything with rooney as no. 9

1001~~~
I have never seen such a bad Wayne Rooney performance. Was shocked to be fair as I'm a massive Rooney fan, but even his work-rate lacked today (could be instructions to stay upfront). Dire.

1002~~~
He's struggling to get involved and I can't fault him for that. The way we are so reluctant to move the ball forward will render most 9s frustrated.

1003~~~
Literally just said the same to my missus. Bad to the point of strangely bad.

1004~~~
Just like your words, and mine - here today, gone tomorrow. Rooney on the other hand will be on those records for a long, long time.

1005~~~
That was bloody disappointing but hey, at least it's all uphill from here on, right? Do think, he needs to be subbed/dropped to give him the necessary kick up his butt and make him fight for his place.

Probably his worst ever game for United...

1006~~~
On form he'll do damage. 

To the opposition.

1007~~~
I can't see him getting the record this season like you say. Whether you like it or not, he's well past his best and is not the striker that will land us the title. I can not see him getting 20 plus league goals for us and that is exactly what you need in a title winning side.

1008~~~
I was thinking this. Don't remember one in the last 3 or 4 years where I'd call him great.

1009~~~
Interesting! It's good to know. Thing is, though, who will come in for Rooney? Or is it a case of anything's got to be better than this!?

1010~~~
Yeah its hard to see anyone wanting him considering the wages he's on..

We really need a new striker...at least Rooney is showing off his ability while the window is still open so he deserves respect for that.

1011~~~
That's how a player that knows that he is never getting dropped plays.

1012~~~
Tbf to Rooney, even in his best seasons he was still always capable of putting in strangely terrible performances. Looking as bad as he did today doesn't necessarily mean that much, it's nothing we haven't seen before.

1013~~~
He was very poor today, but I think he'll manage to play himself into form. He usually does.

1014~~~
Yeah, leave Wayne Rooney alone.

We should also bring Scholesy and Giggsy out of retirement and play them full 90 minutes every week because they deserved it.

1015~~~
He always starts the season off slow. He'll be fine.

1016~~~
You need to stop popping the tramadols and rewatch the game.

1017~~~
He was abysmal last season when he got moved to striker...except for probably the Spurs game when the rest of the team was playing well..even with that silent domination nonsense being spouted..Equally for England he has been poor for years now..We cant afford to carry a passenger like him, the club should come first

Question is if he's truly still up to the standard we should strive for. Compared to Aguero, Suarez, Lewandowski he seems to have lost quite a bit

1020~~~
Go to sleep Kai

1021~~~
Rooney is going to be a big problem for us if he can't pick up some form sooner rather then later.

1022~~~
MajorTom is having a mare here.

1023~~~
He's been poor for the last three seasons as a striker. Even Fergies last year he was moved to CM at times because he was not effective as a striker.

1024~~~
Past it. Fergie had him sussed. 600 top flight games since 16 has taken its toll on him. Been a great servant (on the pitch) but time to put him out to pasture.

But seeing as he's signed up on 300k a week for the next 3 seasons I look forward to seeing him huff and puff while balls bounce off of his shin to the nearest defender.

1025~~~
First he starts the season slow. That's about two months, right? Then he has this excuse of 4 games against Liverpool and Everton, even though I have no idea why is that excuse at all, he should be fined for his performances against those clubs. Then he has this one or two injuries that set him back for about 4 or 5 games after when he is returning to his form(which he never picked up btw). Then he plays in midfield for few games and it's not his fault. Then it's the end of the season where there is nothing left to play for and he has played every game so it's understandable that he is tired from the season behind him. Then comes the summer and everyone forgets his year and say that it wasn't hos fault that his teammate couldn't creat for him. Then comes the new season where people find new position where he is best at. Year in Wayne Rooney's career. Rinse and repeat.

1026~~~
That basically sums him up. At the moment, there's no point keeping him even until the end of the season. Fergie must have sold him when he left.

1027~~~
Is this not a bit of a myth? His two highest scoring seasons were 09/10 and 11/12. In 09/10, he scored 5 in the first 5 league games as well as scoring in the Community Shield while in 2011/12, he got 9 in the first 5 league games. I've seen people say he always starts the season slowly but is it not the case for at least 3 seasons that he's started quite slowly and gone on to have pretty ordinary campaigns?

1028~~~
Can't understand why people defend his performances.  Has he been great for us?  Yes.  Is he STILL great for us?  No.  Looks slow and stuffed full of beer, fish and chips.  Having a laugh on his wages.

1029~~~
I usually defend him but he was awful today. He may not have had a great deal of service (only having one touch in the opposition box says a lot) but he couldn't control a slug today. Completely astonishing how his touch has just left him. He seems a lot better when he drops back - I'm sure he'd be a lot more effective as a number 10. 

I hope LVG "rests" him for a few games soon, just to give him the idea that he isn't undroppable.

1030~~~
He had an awful game today (don't think anyone can dispute that), but there's plenty of time for improvement. Stranger things have happened.

1031~~~
Thing is he's been slow since the start of last season.

1032~~~
Rooney has not scored an away goal in the Premier League since November 2014.

1033~~~
Ergh, wish we'd fecked him off to Chelsea.

1034~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1035~~~
That was against Arsenal..I think that was his only away goal last season too..so that means you have to go at least 6 months back for another one..or possibly even more..

1036~~~
That moment when he was nearly one on one with the keeper, and his touch was sooo bad he had to stop it from going for a goalkick and concede a throwin <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1037~~~
There was the one from near the halfway line at West Ham in March of Moyes' season but I can't think of one after that until the Arsenal one.

£300k a week!

1038~~~
He was terrible tonight, he cut a rather frustrated figure at times, I'm not sure whether that was the lack of service he was getting or just the fact he knew himself he was having a mare.

1039~~~
The second one where he tries to blame Herrera <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1040~~~
Nope he can't even use the old Falcao excuse, the service into him was pretty decent by our recent standards.

1041~~~
Have faith. We still have more than two weeks to sell him to MLS.

1042~~~
It's not the service. 

It's his all round play. No duels won against Richards, who is the same height is shocking.

1043~~~
I'm a big Rooney fan over the years and part of me thinks the role he's being asked to play (i.e. in holding the CBs together to allow us to get two on ones out wide) that is affecting his game. On the other hand I wonder if he'll ever be suited to the lone striker role in a 4-2-3-1 system when he's most comfortable operating as the deeper striker of a pair.

RVP was more suited to that lone striker role because of his ability to create something from nothing as well as being a lethal finisher. Unfortunately his injury record was not the best and I'm sure that has contributed to LVG's decision to let him go.

1044~~~
Not a single person can defend him today. Last time he was this bad was Swansea away. Not sure if he can be classed as one of the world's elite footballers when he's so inconsistent, even at 30.

1045~~~
The people who run this forum must be serious Rooney fans.
In that Spurs game, Rooney was dawdling, taking touches and thinking about shooting when Walker ran in at pace and kicked the ball into the net.
There is absolutely no way that he can be given an assist for that.

1046~~~
Can't even understand what he's attempting on the first one.

1047~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> @ the vine reminders, they were just brilliant.

The man is being paid £300,000 a week.. To play like that. He will most likely become our top goalscorer, but that will come next year, and I imagine we will look to shift him on.

Worst performance I have seen from him ever, but I do know he will pick it up. van Gaal will not allow his captain to bring that to the table the entire season if he wants to get somewhere with this team.

1048~~~
To me it's incredible how he's lost his ability in decision making, he was doing things by intuition (like that overhead against City) and now he looks like he's about to shit himself when he's left with acres of space and some very easy options to pick. His first touch has always been abysmal but today he couldn't control his sphincter if his life depended on it.

1049~~~
He was absolutely terrible, I think he's been generally poor to average for a long time now so I never really have high hopes with anymore and yet I was still shocked at how awful he was.

Going into this season with him as our main striker is suicidal.

1050~~~
I'm sorry, but anyone who thinks Wayne Rooney is anywhere near good enough anymore needs to slap themselves in the face.

1051~~~
Really saddens me to see Rooney play like that. Doesn't make it easy for himself. Critics must be having a field day.

Seriously, though, he needs to step it up. I thought he was fine against Spurs (although most said he was awful. They should watch the game again) but today he was really bad. Hopefully a goal, whether it be off the shins, a deflection, etc, will kick start his season.

1052~~~
He hasn't been on form in years.

1053~~~
His worst game in ages, i think he's done as a top club regular, but to get more out of him we at least need to give him competition.

The situation we've left ourselves with is ridiculous.

1054~~~
I've been on the fence until now, thinking the negative views of him were rooted to his contact complaints and poor service from midfield.  

But I'm starting to get worried.

1055~~~
What could the club policy actually be regarding transfers? Who in their right mind would leave us with Rooney as the main striker when a) he can't control the ball, b) he can't run, c) he's incredibly slow, and d) he is really pretty shit. How can it be left like that?

1056~~~
Not overly worried so far but we need an insurance policy in case this loss of form turns out to be the start of his decline. Most top strikers are already settled at big clubs and it's highly unlikely that those who aren't would want to come in and play second fiddle to him. Maybe Berahino will do for now, good enough to start in Rooney's place (he can certainly match Rooney's output of the last few seasons) but will be too happy to have got a move to club this big to throw his toys out of the pram when Rooney plays for prolonged period.

1057~~~
I supported him for years because he was producing, including through the contract wranglings. I can't anymore.

1058~~~
Maybe it's a too simple way to look at things, but if he wasn't so shit today, we'd have definitely won by more than 1

1059~~~
Imagine if we had a top striker like Aguero or Suarez playing there.

1060~~~
Wow, that was a really bad performance. Even his staunchiest supporters are saying he was bad. Here's hoping Hernandez is up to the job if Van Gaal decides to "Van Bommel" his captain.

Ferguson misjudged the centre midfield situation in his last couple of years but I reckon he still knew when to get rid of players in a timely manner when he paved the way for a Rooney exit a few years ago.

1061~~~
Man, that is horrible. I would gladly sign a petition to have him dropped and the captaincy given to another player.

1062~~~
But that's the thing; even if we had an average striker it would be 10 times better than the dross he's producing right now. I don't get why he's turned to shit.

1063~~~
Fergie saw a ticking time bomb in Rooney. He'll eventually put us into the situation where we can't  just bench him nor replace him with a quality striker. Louis probably has regconized this  but too bad, at this point he has no choice but sticking with Rooney

1064~~~
feck me, he was bad tonight. Cant remember the last time he was that shit, and that for quite some time now.

1065~~~
Usual trend with Rooney - 5/6 games at the beginning of the season to get fit, another 5/6 game streak of woeful performances at some point but in-between he'll grab 15-20 goals and have a few incredible games.

Until we sign someone better, it'll do.

1066~~~
He needs games and fitness more than most players, yes, but I also think he needs more involvement in matches, and playing as the lone striker he isn't getting that. He needs more touches on the ball, and he needs more pace in and around him. I just feel with have two great no.10's and neither have been played there. We have seen some excellent runs from Depay without the service required, and hopefully Pedro on the opposite flank will give us pace and movement on the right, but unless Mata or Rooney play in the hole, it won't make a jot of difference.

1067~~~
Man, that was an unacceptable performance. You can be shit sometimes, but not <i>that</i> shit.

1068~~~
Rooney is absolutely robbing United. Hasn't played well consistently for a long long time, probably won't ever again, but he'll continue to pocket a whopping £300k p/w while he's at it.

1069~~~
Mind-boggling. He must be making loads of money for United with his name, otherwise I can't see why he's on that kind of wages.

1070~~~
It does feel like it's coming to that time to move him on . So many aspects of his game are lacking these days. It's hard to even pinpoint what his strengths are anymore. He came through the ranks very early so it stands to reason that he may fade early too.

1071~~~
He was terrible tonight. I don't know how you can have such a poor touch and get paid £300,000 and be the undroppable United captain.
I was quite pissed off that Van Gaal pointed out Adnan & Memphis gave the ball away and didn't even acknowledge the shower of shit I witnessed from Rooney. Those two have excuses he most certainly does not. If anyone else in the squad played that badly we wouldn't see them again for months.

1072~~~
Two were getting constructive criticism in public to motivate them, one will be getting a bollocking in private. You have to be pretty dense not to see that.

1073~~~
He usually has to play his way into form - often from a slow start to the season - so we pretty much have to get through this and hope he does find his form again soon.

That said, I want him subbed in games rather than playing every minute without threat of being replaced - Hernandez is sat on the bench waiting for a chance; the least he deserves is a sub appearance, particularly when Rooney is playing like that <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1074~~~
Totally agree. Rooney might be in line for some dutch ball tonight.

1075~~~
I don't think so I think he's wary of upsetting the 'star man' & it's been noticeable since SAF has left that Rooney gets special treatment at the club. I can't remember the last time he played well and he starts every game no questions asked. 

Personally I would rather he focused on the positives with young players tbh especially Adnan who needs confidence.

p.s if you can't disagree or debate without adding an insult don't bother replying.

1076~~~
Van Gaal wary of upsetting a player? Is this actually being suggested?

1077~~~
Said it before the start of the season, in this role he won't score a swag of goals this season. At best he'll attempt to knit it all together with an inside left forward who never gets forward or inside, an inside right forward who always goes down the outside and doesn't have a left peg and a couple of different green 10's who've never played the role before (Janu in the first team). I didn't think the level of abuse would be this comical though.

The whole forward line is a mess, Wayne takes his share of blame of course but he has some little piece of magic that turns grown men into emotional teenagers while striding around a football pitch for 90 minutes.

Wouldn't make a difference, neither of them are hold up 9's. Suarez would not be a Van Gaal player anyway, to risk taking and adventurous. He'd have been out on his arse.

1078~~~
I think you have forgotten who our manager is. If you can't stop being so touchy maybe stay off the internet.

1079~~~
Agree.

1080~~~
Truly horrible from him tonight. Just horrible.

I had good feelings about him this season, and I thought he'd be good for 20 league goals. Still think he'll come good, or at the very least better, but displays like that make you wonder.

1081~~~
I actually believe he's crippling the team as it stands.  Let's look at the facts:

- He's United Captain
- He's our Main Striker
- He's the highest earner

With this said, younger players and new players are looking to him for inspiration, leadership and game changing moments.  So when Rooney is playing and Rooney doesn't perform, and Rooney doesn't get dropped...how would you feel?  When you're playing badly, you get dropped for the next player in line.  When you play badly, you get called out on it.  But Rooney doesn't.

No player is bigger than the team.  As a lone striker, Rooney is way past it, simple as.

1082~~~
LvG "we only buy players who are better than what we have". Think I can name a few.

1083~~~
Agreed.

1084~~~
Another shocking performance really. His position was so deep and was atrocious throughout. His touch and goalscoring have been off for a while now but it's crazy since he only has Hernandez as competition, yet we can't drop him  since he's captain. I'm willing to try Hernandez now.

1085~~~
Lol okay, this was a bit funny.

1086~~~
Looking more and more like a Gerrard liability type of situation. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>
Wonder if push comes to shove, will Louis have the stones to boot him? I know he did it with van Bommel, but van Bommel wasn't also the league's national team captain with a huge personal brand behind him.

1087~~~
It's his worst performance for us to date imo.

1088~~~
Rooney is valuable to the club as well, with Charlton's record in his sight and Linekar's international record almost equalled. I hope he can sort himself out and start scoring because I think we're a prolific goal scorer away from challenging on all fronts -- we should really get Pedro in asap to at least spread the burden. I have a feeling this is a make or break season for Rooney.

1089~~~
Goals will come. Even when his all around game is sporadic he still tends to chip in with some goals.

1090~~~
I'd argue he was in very good form for a run of 6-7 games last season and this is coming from someone who wanted rid of him since the early stages of 2013/14. These flashes of form are coming far too short lived and rare however and his quality when out of form has dropped to a new level of awful. To be the worst player on the pitch against a relatively poor villa side is embarassing. Isn't the only time in recent memory he has been the worst player on the pitch, either.

1091~~~
I'm actually happy he's not scoring right now because it's his lack of goals recently that are now exposing how bad of a player he is in pretty much every other department except for dinking the ball to the right side of the pitch and his work rate. His ability to pop up with goals did miracles in covering/blinding people to such weaknesses that have been evident for a while. It's just a matter of time before he's dropped IMO and that would make me a very happy man. Our attacking play would greatly benefit.

1092~~~
Could anyone see Van Gaal dropping him if he performs like this for the next 2/3 games?

More likely to be shipped to another position me-thinks.

1093~~~
Im one of his biggest supporters, but he's not doing himself any favours.

1094~~~
Struggling to figure out what he's trying to achieve. Spent half his time behind the AM's and wingers trying to get involved but offering zero input. When he was leading the line he didn't have anything in him to beat very average defenders in either strength, brains or pace. 

It's probably too early to call it with it being very early in the season but looking back over his last year I think he's finished as a top player. Van Gaal played him in midfield last year because he was given untouchable status via a contract by Moyes and he's got to figure out what to do with him as he's not good enough to lead the line anymore for Manchester United.

1095~~~
He's playing horribly but he does deserve our patience and our respect. A lot of people showing no respect for a guy who is one of our best of all time. Give him plenty more games to get back to form and if he doesn't by let's say mid November then maybe drop him. But yeah show a bit of love for him

1096~~~
I can't remember the last time he played as poorly as he did tonight. He needs to step it up because without a goalscoring striker we'll really struggle.

1097~~~
Was an invisible lump of turd. Did nothing to impact the game. Totally missed a couple of dangerous forward passes, messed up his own passing, caught offside. Meh. 

So what's the excuse for him this time?

1098~~~
I thought he'd be like Charlie Austin was last year, not contributing much but banging in goals, but we don't seem to be getting close enough to the other team's net to justify playing a poacher whose mobility looks terrible and whose first touch isn't much better. Rough start to the season.

1099~~~
You're wasting your breath, there be no shelter here.

1100~~~
Think its a confidence thing with Rooney. If he tends to start the game well, i.e. nice touch, good pass, etc, he'll build from there, but if he starts bad, i.e. bad touch, bad pass, etc, everything just goes downhill.

1101~~~
People do the same about every player, not just him. Hate seeing it too and after two games there isn't much to talk about, especially as it is Rooney who always struggles with form over the course of a season. We have to accept he's the captain and LVG's first choice and he will let Rooney play himself in to form. 

When he's out of form he is absolutely terrible though, luckily he never is out of form for too long.

1102~~~
People go on about stats and records but, he should have smashed that record by now...

Some people are saying that, "Oh it's only after 2 games"....Well....

We sent him off to a fat camp in 2010 and he only gave us 8 weeks of good form that season.
11/12 season he had a great season.
12/13 He was absolute cack 
13/14 He had a few bright spells but, he was mostly average.
14/15 As a captain and leader, he was average.

And so far, granted it's only two games, he has been embarrassing...The Kyle Walker own goal was ridiculous. That tonight was even worse.

I remember back in 2013, Messi went a number of games without scoring or assisting...A few pundits in the papers were all over him, yet this Rooney performance will be brushed under the carpet as always

1103~~~
He'll get some respect when he starts putting in some respectable performances instead of the crap he came up with today

1104~~~
I would like to try:
Januzaj
Memphis - Herrera/Pereira - Mata

Against Club Brugge.

Hernandez wouldn't make things better as everyone knows he's shocking on holding up the ball..

1105~~~
Nope. He made a point of saying Memphis and Januzaj lost the ball too often and need to do a bit better, but has said nothing on Rooney. If one of the journos had the balls to ask him at the presser before Brugge then we might here something from him but it's quite telling in my opinion.

1106~~~
Still torn over whether Rooney is ineffective or the team as a whole is toothless but I think Hernandez would love playing with Mata. His movement with Mata threading the passes would be a lot more dangerous than what we've seen so far.

1107~~~
Probably a bit of both, but you also have to consider that the team may be toothless because the striker isn't doing what they need him to do. I feel like Hernandez does deserve a chance, and he will certainly give us something different to what Rooney gives. Mata played some beautiful passes against Villa, and I too would like to see Hernandez making runs for him

1108~~~
He's had poor days at the office in the past, but Fergie used to let him run wild and get it out of his system. 

Under van Gaal, Rooney has a much more restricted purview, so there's little scope for him mask a poor performance with a bit of dogged closing down or by covering at right back. 

He'll get better, but I also think we're gonna see more terrible games like this as the season progresses. Feast or famine.

1109~~~
He was absolutely terrible. Really he should be dropped but he probably won't be because he is captain and because Hernandez would only be a decent upgrade. Couldn't do anything right and actually hindered us going forward. Doesn't look like he has the ability to play as a loan striker. Would probably be better playing off Hernandez or even Fellaini.

1110~~~
Its plain laziness. What made Rooney was his desire and that angry man type personality. He just seemed lazy yesterday. I know he might have run around a lot, but it wasn't with any purpose. I rarely ever slag our players on here but last night was a tipping point for me. I hope that he gets benched soon.

1111~~~
How is his average rating on this forum still 5.4 ?

1112~~~
Woeful.

1113~~~
I gave him a 4 but I feel that was too generous.

1114~~~
Why did LVG criticise Januzaj, but did he even mention anything at all about Rooney?

1115~~~
He's been a problem for so long and it's only getting worse. Fergie was right, as always. Apparently no one at Manchester United has had any balls since then.

1116~~~
As much as I love LVG's honesty when it comes to performances, this really did infuriate me. Everyone is hung out to dry/sold/dropped as a consequence of their performances/actions except for our captain. He did mention Rooney and Depay also lost the ball a a lot but the comment he made about Januzaj and there being a lot more to football than goals was a bit OTT considering he got us the winning goal in this case and the fact that a much more experienced and highly rated Rooney has been consistently guilty of the same thing for the past 3 years or so. By that I mean, being productive but generally playing like shit. Now that he's not scoring either, you would expect harsher judgment considering he is so keen to dish it out on and punish anybody else.

I am usually the first to stick up for and defend LVG but his preferential treatment of Rooney is really beginning to tire me, and most other supporters by the look of it. There's no way a man with such attention to detail and ability to harshly judge players cannot see his shortcomings. I'm beginning to feel there is more to it than meets the eye and have laughed at posters for suggesting such a thing in the past. Hopefully he is dropped soon if this continues and my suspicions turn out to be as ridiculous as they sound.

1117~~~
We created 2 chances in the box, so the problem wasn't Rooney's movement in the penalty area. It was his link-up play. I'm not sure Hernandez would be much better when you consider how deep teams sit against us. It's even worse now than it was under Fergie or Moyes.

1118~~~
Should we hire another plane as well?!

1119~~~
He had a shocker today, touch was off, was dropping too deep at times and lacked fluidity.

1120~~~
Why is his bottom level so awful? For an elite player its too shocking. He suddenly becomes a complete amateur.

1121~~~
Shocking peformance. His all round game was just unbelievably bad. And if top it off when he got in behind them, his touch forced him to kick the ball out for a throw in. 

If he keeps this form up he'll serioudly hold us back. Only so long a team can win games without a centre forward. 

Hopefully he bags a couple in his next game and it elevates his entire game because the current level is simply nowhere near being decent forget what United need.

1122~~~
The Januzaj stuff was classic man management. You hear it all the time. Managers try to put a damper on the hype, to keep a young player grounded. 

There was no need or point to criticising Rooney. Anyone who watched the game knew he was awful, as did Rooney himself. So what's the point in criticising him in public?

1123~~~
I have a feeling that lvg is kinda like me, when he comments and critize means he still care and expect improvement.  I think he...  Like last season simply gives rvp all the time to prove him wrong, and when he fails ship him out. 

Besides,  rooney is 30 and senior player,  nothing needs to be said,, i dont think he handles critic well.  It could havr been just me,  but i believe the team arent giving him feck all,  he looks like those nerd boys nobody would want to pass to. He's just cruising around clogging the central mid allowing the cb to push up and congested the mid while imho he should be lurking behind for a break and occupy the cb with nonstop movement. 

And his performance last night was utter shit.  Even championship player dont make that schoolboy error,  i dont even think a good passionate schoolboy would make that mistake, let alone captain of Manchester United on 300k wage

1124~~~
Give him time. He's played as a support striker for 4 seasons now. Give him some time to reshape his game to lead the line. He hasn't had this role since 2010.

1125~~~
It's not about time or adjusting to new positions and all that, he fails at the basic

1126~~~
To be fair His problem is his bottom level,  Not a postion change. When off form its shocking how his entire football ability deserts him.

1127~~~
Well and truly. I've seen some deluded folks on here but he might actually top the list. In fact iv came to the conclusion that MajorTom is Paddy Crerand in disguise.

1128~~~
Although I'm buzzing with a win and another solid performance I agree with this completely. Rooney is not the same player he was and I'd imagine doesn't scare defenders the way he used to. I'd rather see Hernandez or Wilson using their pace as opposed to seeing Rooney plodding around contributing nothing again. We need to be able to make the decision to drop Rooney if his form doesn't improve - shouldn't the captain (and highest earner) be our best player every week and not just after he's got back in the swing of things over a month after everyone else has already finished pre season.

1129~~~
This is Rooneys 12th season with us. In that time hes only scored more than 20 goals twice: 09/10(scored 26) and 11/12(scored 27)
And hes only scored more than 15 goals , four times( that includes the above 20 also)

So in 8 seasons hes scored less than 15 goals, So I dont understand where people ae getting this notion he`ll get into form and bang in 15-20 goals as always

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/profile.career-history.html/wayne-rooney" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/profile.career-history.html/wayne-rooney</a>

1130~~~
Wayne is not in any way good enough to play as a number 9. Not sure if he's ever been a centre forward. His form has been worrying for some time and, he has little competition for his position. Our striker situation will hamper us this season and if LVG refuses to buy a top class CF we'll win nothing.

1131~~~
Even if he did sign a new CF, would he drop his captain?

1132~~~
As others have said, his bottom level basically makes us play with 10 men.

Not good enough for a Manchester United striker.

As our captain and probably highest earner he's a complete joke, though.

1133~~~
This is the issue Van G. He won't although he should.That said, there is currently no no alternative to Rooney. Hernandez is not an option for that role and neither is Wilson.

1134~~~
This all day long. He won't get 15 goals this season. He's regressing at an alarming rate.

1135~~~
He was absolutely shite last night and only slightly better against Spurs but the some of the catastrophisation in this thread is laughable. Typical redcafe. Everything is so fecking extreme.

1136~~~
Rooney's bottom level is fecking extreme.

He's not been consistently good for us since 11/12. And he's not good enough to be our solitary hope as a striker.

Also, what's annoying is that he's not going to be dropped no matter how lacklustre his performances are because of LVG's captain thing.

1137~~~
Yeah, as I was saying...

1138~~~
Id love for someone to make a video of all his touches/contribution in the game yesterday and you watch it, then explain it.

1139~~~
Do you honestly think Rooney's current level is good enough for a team trying to win the title? Because that's the bar at United. Always will be.

Can we afford a striker effectively reducing us to 10 men for large portions of the season? Because that's what we're getting with Rooney.

Of course, I'm holding him to a higher standard than most when judging him - he's supposed to be our captain and is our highest earner, he's the go to-guy, our spearhead - and he's not lived up to that role since he blackmailed his way to a new contract.

1140~~~
Explain what? The meaning of the word "shite"?

1141~~~
He's not played really well since boxing day against Newcastle. When he was in midfield oddly enough.

Even during our great
 run last season, he was fecking rubbish at Anfield and in the Derby. A supposed top class player shouldn't be having 6 months of poor to average performances.

1142~~~
He really needs to buck up now. The best thing that can happen to him is competition for places. Right now he knows that he will feature even if he turns up completely sloshed. 

Looking at the ruthlessness with which RVP was shipped off, I have a feeling that it wouldn't take a lot to get into the "not up to the mark" category.

1143~~~
It would be interesting to see how Hernandez did with all the creativity behind him and Wilson and Januzaj would probably link up quite well considering the amount of games they have already played in together although it would make our team much more lightweight up top.

I'll be buzzing to see one of Hernandez or Wilson lining up against Brugge but I'd be surprised if Rooney doesn't play the Newcastle game, we should have let Rooney go when we had the chance and brought in Zlatan for a few years - I'd still do this now being honest.

1144~~~
Right now I'd throw in Hernandez. He was good when he got a run for Madrid last season. He stretches defences, got pace and can finish.

Also, the way Rooney's playing right now, it's not like we're in for a huge loss in overall contribution to our build up.

1145~~~
It's like playing against 12, he broke down our play every time he touches the ball, literally giving away possession

1146~~~
Might give Rooney a kick up the arse too especially if Hernandez bags a few goals, as you say it doesn't appear as though we would lose much for now.

1147~~~
It'll be ugly, like real ugly, on top of my head he has around 10-15 touches and 90% is failed basic

1148~~~
I actually want to see this. 

My mate who didn't see the game, looked at his stats and it had a 77.8% pass completion out of 36 actual passes and refused to believe that it was up there with one of his worst days at the office.

1149~~~
Rooney needs a goal really. It always boosts his confidence. He always takes time to get into the swing of it. No, he isn't playing well, but he will be the first to hold up his hand on that. He knows his own standards. He's one of those players over the years who has more good periods of playing than bad, so he deserves a bit of patience.

1150~~~
He did play a bunch of passes backwards at the end of the game.

I don't think being dispossessed or failing to control the ball counts as a bad pass though.

1151~~~
He's only ever had two seasons as an out and out striker - 09/10 and 11/12. The rest have been somewhere between number 10, wide forward and midfield. He has always been good for a 20+ goals if played in the right position, as he is now. He is also always a slow starter as <a class="username" data-user="21552, @izzydiggler" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21552/">@izzydiggler</a> says. Give him at least 5 games before we really see if he's past it or not.

Besides, I don't see any Van Nistelrooy's out there at the moment who will guarantee 20+ goals, so we're stuck with him.

1152~~~
He's not taking to leading the line very well at the moment.Didn't see much of the ball and when he did recieve it does nothing with it.

1153~~~
"some of the catastrophisation in this thread is laughable. Typical redcafe. Everything is so fecking extreme."

1154~~~
Seems like most people have found their scapegoat for the season.

1155~~~
He's not refusing, it is well documented that we've been interested in both Kane and Müller. However, a top class CF is difficult to acquire today.

1156~~~
Hernandez's touch is far better than Rooney's at his bottom level

1157~~~
Agree on that. Rooney is one of our most important players when on form

1158~~~
It's not so much the fact he hasn't had a shot on goal, that's disappinting of course but given we are not really creating much for him atm it's forgivable, for me it's his ball control and passing that is so alarming, a lot of the time he wasn't even under any pressure yet much of his passing was way off and the ball just often bounces off him, ok he's a player that needs to play to find his form, but everything is wrong with him just now.

Sheer lack of options will likely keep him in the team, but would love to Wilson given a chance if this continues much longer though.

1159~~~
One touch in the opposition's box the entire game!? If we don't score goals we won't win games, simple as. We need to fix this somehow. Either Rooney stops coming so deep or we let someone else have a chance. Rooney shouldn't be a automatic starter and I hope LvG drops him eventually if he doesn't turn up next game.

1160~~~
You think I was talking about the comments on last night's performance? I wasn't.

1161~~~
Never understand posts like this. Why is he a "scapegoat" because people (quite rightly) are calling him out on his poor form?.

If Rooney played at his top level we would probably of won 3/4-0 yesterday, but the fact is everytime he got the ball he either took a heavy touch, played a poor pass, or just stood there facing the ball wanting it to feet. As the lead striker you need to make runs in behind a defence, and he barely did that in the first half. the 2nd half he attempted it a few times only to be offside pretty much every time. The 1 time he did get through his donkey like touch took it away from goal and into the corner <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It really is sad to see as Rooney should rightly be remembered as a club legend, but I fear we are stuck playing him as our captain and club calisman. At 1 stage in his career the team just didn't play well without Rooney, now it almost seems the opposite.

1162~~~
Disappointing last night. Still don't know why we haven't bought a young striker to be a back up or eventually replace him once he gets older. Sometimes top players need competition to keep them on their toes. The thing is that his place in the team is so certain that it is leading up to a bit of complacency. Hernandez hasn't played a lot of football for us and Wilson is still young so striking positions are a bit of a worry.

1163~~~
Nah not copping that. When he performs that poorly he should (and will) be rightly criticised.

1164~~~
Was awful last night and looked well off the pace, I am sure he will improve as his form fluctuates up and down massively.

I really cant understand why we were so eager to sell RVP though, he is now our only genuine option in that role and  it really doesn't look like a striker will be joining.

1165~~~
feck off with this scapegoat bullshit. If a player plays like the biggest mong on this earth then the supporters have every right to point this out.

1166~~~
It's crazy when you think we pay him in the same bracket as Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar, Ibrahimovic, Aguero, Hazard, Bale etc. How long has it been since he performed at that level or had their sort of impact.

1167~~~
He's never reached the heights of at least four of those players, but probably 2011/12 season.

1168~~~
In your opinion did he play well?

1169~~~
Awaits answer with some popcorn....

1170~~~
No far from it, he's been off the boil all pre season. But I've got confidence that give him a few games to get into his stride and he'll come good.
Other players had spells where their touch was awful and passes went astray, like Mata, Memphis and Schneiderlin but they're not getting scrutinised on here.
We all know Rooney is the sort of player that comes deep and always wants the ball but he can't do that as he's leading the line. We also play a style of football that means the striker doesn't always see the ball and we keep possession in midfield and defence, so his sharpness is certainly off.

1171~~~
And that is basically what people are saying. He was shit, there are no two ways about it, no one is using him as a scapegoat ffs.

1172~~~
Reminded me of his performance at Swansea a few years back. Nothing he did all night worked.

Hope he can play his way into form quickly. Starting Tuesday.

I do think van Gaal will be watching this closely though. If a decent striker comes available in the next fortnight, I'm sure we'll move for them.

1173~~~
I'd take the captaincy off him and see how he reacts. He's too comfortable and he needs a kick up the arse.

1174~~~
Yeah that was a joke.

1175~~~
Rooney was poor but he's not really been playing as a striker like strikers should. Most of his touches last night were on our half.
I don't know if the system is wrong or why he drops so deep to participate in the build-up, but he shouldnt have to do that at all. At least not when we're playing only one striker.

1176~~~
Only five of our players performed last night most were guff (Rooney included) Memphis was shockingly bad, Januzaj was terrible apart from the goal, Herrara was awful when he came on.  Lets put things into perspective..Yes Rooney was bad last night but some players were just as worse, he's the lone striker, where was the service?  The game as a whole was awful to watch and the performance was mind numbingly bad apart from our defence/DF midfield, the lone striker expects chances to be created for him which just wasn't happening!  I'm just happy we were solid at the back and we have the three points, I'm staying positive though as it may take a few games for the team to click.  Rooney was bad and people have the right to question his performance but I don't see the same people giving the other handful of players the same treatment.

1177~~~
People single Wayne out because he's our captain, at his peak age, gets paid more than all our other players and is the only player in the squad who is guranteed a place in the starting XI no matter what. At least Memphis can say he's new to the league and he and Januzaj are still really young.

1178~~~
Rooney reminds me of that one guy who sees others playing the ball well to eachother, everything connects and then wants to get involved while it's not his job to do so. Does it anyway and screws it up. 
The tweet posted by <a class="username" data-user="56128, @Baxter" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56128/">@Baxter</a> on page 26 illustrates it.

1179~~~
Has anyone made a compilation of last night's performance yet?

1180~~~
That's fine I understand much <b>much </b>more is expected of Rooney, but he still needs service and other players have a responsibility to supply that service to the striker. Van Nistlerooy came from the Dutch league to a new league and blew us all away because the team created chances for him.  Januzaj is now in his third season with the firsts but I still see no improvement in his all round game, When I see Januzaj on the ball I instantly think of McGeady because he's just as fustrating.  How many chances were created last night?  It doesn't matter who was up front for us be it Muller, Lewandowski etc.. they would have been just as ineffective as Rooney!

1181~~~
No, the leading striker holds up, like Nistelrooy did, brings the creative players into the game high up the pitch and reaps the rewards afterwards. The striker is a part of the service you could say. Rooney's ability to make the play ticking around him is highly suspect to say the least. And just look at that time he had a decent opportunity to be through on goal in the latter stages. His pace, touch, technique all were wrong so he eventually put it out for a throw-in.

1182~~~
People single him out because he was the worst of them all. His technique was hilariously bad and even when he had time to pick a pass he managed to clown it up.

1183~~~
Fergie knew 3 years ago his time was up.

1184~~~
Fanboyism at its finest

1185~~~
No need to thank me.

1186~~~
if we can build up our team around rooney, buying messi, ronaldo & bale to provide service to him, rooney will shine

1187~~~
No I think that is going way to easy on Wayne, there were a few times he was in acres of space with the ball and messed up our attacks or a ball was played to him and his control let him down and the chance was gone, it's not fair to say that would have happened with any other striker. Rooney at his best is much better than we saw last night.

1188~~~
Wouldn't be surprised if him and Louis fall out at some point this season.

1189~~~
Completely rubbish yesterday, that was one of his worst ever performances for me. 

We desperately need a striker, having to rely on Rooney in this type of form will feck us over in the long run.

1190~~~
Sticking him on the bench for a game and giving the armband to Schweinsteiger for a few games would probably be the kick up the arse he needs.

He'll score a hattrick on Tuesday though after all this.

1191~~~
Post of the year right here!  Well done

1192~~~
Every time. Fecking brilliant gif <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1193~~~
Yesterday was especially bad but I honestly think he's been average to poor for a good few years.

It's only now the goals have dried up that more and more people seem to be noticing it. Unless he pops up with a goal he offers very little and last night he offered nothing.

Think he's scored 4 goals from open play in 2015 for Utd.

1194~~~
Watching last nights game, I'd have just given him an early bath! he played awful but it happens and there is no harm subbing him just after an hour.

But i'm not sure if Wilson or Hernandez are fit. So the reshuffle without those might have looked a bit crazy on paper.

1195~~~
That chance at the end, when he was clean through after Schweini found him - how the feck did he even manage to not get a chance out of that? He was all clear, the ball was bouncing perfectly for him and then that touch with his head. I mean fecking hell.

1196~~~
Rooney looks to me as though he is playing with the weight of the world on his shoulders. I think we are looking at a man who feels like the goalscoring burden is on his shoulders and he doesn't like it. 

Despite what he may claim Rooney has almost always suffered when he is concious of the expectations on him. He is at his best when he just doesn't think too much about his game and plays off the cuff. In short, when he doesn't think. Has the look to me of someone who is playing preoccupied. There was a moment where I think Blind fizzed a nice pass forward to his feet, and instead of trapping it Rooney unintentionally let the ball run under his foot. He's not playing his natural game, he's tense. You could see that by how he hesitated when clean through against Spurs. Fortunately Walker helped him out that day.

Had he not played at #9 for Van Gaal last season I'd suggest it was the tactical demands that had messed with his head, but I actually think he's troubled by the headlines. He knows that people are measuring him up next to Suarez, Aguero and Costa and thinking 'you're not that' and I think it bothers him. You could see the frustration starting to boil over late last night when he started needlessly ranting at the other players.

Bruges will be a big match for Rooney. If he can hit the back of the net he might loosen up and start playing with a bit of freedom. The longer he goes without scoring a goal, the more it will weigh on him though.

1197~~~
Seems like it .In the forward position at least.

1198~~~
This is rooneys level now and has been for a while.
People tried to make excuses for him, "oh he needs 5/6 games to hit form".. "Oh he's out of position"... Why not just accept he's finished at the top level? 
The problem we have is we have to play him due to his wages , the captaincy, and the fact he's Rooney. 
It's ultimately up to Lvg and the question of does he have balls the size of fergie to drop or either get rid of this guy? So far id say not at  all. Rooney doesn't even get subbed even though week in week out he's the worse performer on the pitch.

1199~~~
He looked lost last night, almost like he wasn't playing the same game as the players around him. Like some have said already, I don't think he is playing in a system or position that suits his natural game but that is no excuse for getting the basics consistently wrong. It was hard to even see/imagine what he was trying at times.

I seem to remember he did have a decent moment on the left touchline in the second half but none of his team mates, in expectation of him cocking it up I suppose, bothered to support him. If he continues to play in a similar vein and still gets selected week in week out then it will cause more than on-field problems for the team.

Things don't look good for Hernandez if he isn't brought on when our Rooney is so clearly "off-form". Even on his worst link-up day Hernandez is at least a nuisance with his movement and occupies defenders.

1200~~~
Playing without thinking might be a problem, because Van Gaal specifically said he doesn't like his players doing that.

1201~~~
Things looking suddenly a bit worrying with Rooney now. 2 games in and has done feck all.

1202~~~
Indeed.


He should be back at Everton as soon as possible for the benefit of everyone involved.

1203~~~
I'm not seeing how that benefits him. He'd have to cut most of his wages.

1204~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Like many said Fergie knew.

1205~~~
For those who think LVG won't do anything because he's captain, he had no problems selling Van Bommel half way through a season despite making him captain.

1206~~~
<i>Football365</i>: <b><i>Rooney is teh Rubbish, just like Steve said back in 2011; but would people listen? Nooooo. The smelly Twits...</i></b>*

*Might not be actual article title.

1207~~~
Other players aren't the club's highest paid players, the most experienced attacker at the club nor do they have an airtight guarantee to be first choice no matter what and they do not get 'angry and confused' when they are not treated like the club's crown prince. Basically Rooney has to justify his contract and the status we've given to him at the club on the pitch. The way he has gotten about getting his contracts over the last five years means he has lost the leeway we could give players like Scholes, Neville and Rio. If his standards drop ( which appears to be the case albeit a bit premature now) we dump him, isn't it how a club with 'ambition' ought to behave?

1208~~~
Yeah, the 'captaincy issue' isn't one of the bigger problems when it comes to dropping/selling him.

1209~~~
Why on earth don't people like Rooney in the 'hole' behind the striker? Always been best there IMHO.
Rooney/Mata should fight it out.

1210~~~
I think his most consistent performances have come when out wide, and serving as a bit of a workhorse for Ronaldo. Similar to Di Maria in that sense.

1211~~~
Good shout.
I remember when he was wide on the left that season (when we won the CL in 2008) - he was immense then - and it was working for the team. Why we (fans, media and now it seems the management too) have this fantasy of playing him some position where, according to the cold stats, he's average at best, is beyond me. Greater good for the team please...

1212~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1213~~~
What?  The club hasn't dumped him and it's absolutley not the way the club has to behave nor has the club behaved like that!

1214~~~
Read some comments that are trying to soften the blow on his performance, dont bother.  Like:

<i>- Rooney had a bad performance but what about others? (Hererra/Depay/Etc)</i>
Other players aren't our captain, other players aren't on the same wages as messi/ronaldo etc.  Other players WILL NOT play next game if they're that bad.  If he gets more criticism, it's only because he has higher expectations and deservedly so.

- <i>Where was the service?</i>
Biggest load of sh*t I've heard if you watched the game.  The service behind the back lines never existed because he never made any runs behind.  And the times where he got the service with a chance to turn/run, he buggered it up.

<i>- He'll come good.</i>
I hope he does but if these performances continue, he needs a kick up the arse and a good sitting down on the bench.

Every part of his game against Spurs lacked any edge.  The game against Villa you'll struggle to find something he did well, or did.

1215~~~
He's not even trying anymore.   Terrible performance,  if Hernandez isn't getting any minutes with Rooney in that form he might aswell just leave. Worst performance by any united player for a long time.

1216~~~
We have not dumped him but his behavior during 2010 allows us to treat him in a shite way when his performances no longer warrant the status and wage he demanded. We could do what we did to Robin and few around here could have any qualms about it - to me he is just an employee who you cast aside when he consistently fails to deliver or justify his purpose. But then, like I said, I am not yet convinced that the time has come.

1217~~~
True that. I doubt these people even watched the match at all.
I'm not using his wage  as a stick to beat him but his all around game was just terrible. misplaced passes, horrible first touch, always at the wrong place, he slowed us down every time he touched the ball. It's not about the lack of service anymore.
Other players were bad but nowhere near Rooney level bad last night. As our captain and main man, Rooney seriously need to step up his game or else we'll be in a lot f trouble.

1218~~~
This. He lost my respect a long time ago and unless he is performing as expected of his ridiculous contract, will definitely be the first person I criticise after such bad performances

1219~~~
Seriously, Lukaku could do a better job for us up top.

1220~~~
I remember us being linked with him during the summer and scoffing at the rumour. But now I think you're right.

Still, early days.

1221~~~
I don`t buy into this he is not trying shite , one thing Rooney always gives is effort and commitment . His drive and will to win have been a huge part of our success since he`s been at the club . It`s more that he is in shit form which is a problem cos to regain form Rooney has to play . He has done it throughout his career but in the past seemed to recover his form quicker . There is no middle ground with him really , he is either involved in everything and scoring fairly consistently or he is absolute dogshit . He`s had a funny couple of years really where he`s been played in several positions in a team in transition trying to take on board the philosophy and bed in new players but to say he is not trying is a bit weird , as he obviously is . Hopefully a couple of goals against Bruges to get him going next week .

1222~~~
Biggest concern is we don't actually have a viable alternative to play the lone striker role and there is no indication that we will be bringing anyone in either.

1223~~~
The thing with Rooney is that it used to be that even when he was playing badly he was a physical nuisance, he'd harass defenders and could protect the ball, now he looks short of energy and loses out on most of the shoulder to shoulder contests for the ball.

1224~~~

1225~~~
You ignored the most important parts of his post and focused on arguing a point he didn't make. Is that how desperate defending Rooney has gotten?

Quite simply he dragged the club through the mud while demanding to be treated like one of the best players in the world. Moyes caved and gave in to these ridiculous demands. Rooney has never once justified this wage hike nor his behaviour to get it. He put himself in a position to be judged more harshly than everyone else and has seemingly wilted under the pressure. He's been absolutely dire and seems to be getting worse. 

The closest he's come to showing the predatory instinct and hunger we need was when he went after that contract while the club was temporarily weakened. He's seemingly now content to lumber around the pitch to the detriment of the team. He doesn't even seem to offer any leadership.

1226~~~
He ignored the most important parts of my posts too, as have a lot of the responses I have received in here.

1227~~~
He addressed your points about why other players aren't getting as harshly judged as Rooney. Other players have been dropped when they haven't played well, Rooney simply gets moved position while someone else takes the fall. That's part of why people are so frustrated with his awful performances, they have no negative effect on him. They only affect the team.

You can't give him service because his movement isn't good enough and he can't do anything with the ball when he gets it.

1228~~~
He reminded me of watching Dwight Yorke in 2001/02, when he'd get the odd game and do absolutely nothing. I've loved Rooney all his tenure here. Always thought he got a lot more stick than was justified at certain times, but there's no excuse for how lack luster his performances are. Unless, of course, he cant help it and he really is as past it as some on here think he is.

1229~~~
Tit for tat,  he got undeserved praise at times.  It goes both ways

1230~~~
He normally scores for fun vs Newcastle if I remember correctly,  if he doesn't put in a top performance vs them I would be very worried. What's the media reaction to his performances so far?

1231~~~
Van Gaal is the type of manager who will drop a player regardless of their reputation. Let's hope he does it with Rooney. I'm a big Rooney fan, but he needs to realise his space in the team isn't a given anymore. Hopefully Pedro can offer him that competition.

1232~~~
He has said that he wants to play as striker..its not the fans demands..

1233~~~
Well for me, his best season (by a country mile,) was 2009-10, when he played up front on his own (if I remember correctly.) So I can understand why people want to see him playing there again. However, he just hasn't put in the performances. Unfortunately, I don't see him performing any better in the hole or out on the wing. Sadly, I think a great career is beginning it's inevitable wind-down.

1234~~~
None of last night changes that he <i>is </i>playing in his best position. He isn't a midfielder and he isn't a #10, and calls for the latter are forgetful of just how bland and predictable he is in that position. He can't roll a defender and break beyond the defensive lines the way Coutinho did for last week's winner against Stoke, or what Januzaj did to initiate our goalscoring move yesterday. He can't do that anymore.

Rooney is a striker. He's a brilliant, brilliant finisher and he will score goals this season. The rest of his game has been largely poor for years now so the sudden surprise at what we seen last night is bemusing. Albeit I accept that last night was particularly woeful.

He won't be <i>that </i>bad ever again. He can't be...

1235~~~
Didn't have the chance to see the match live, but just saw it. 

By the gods, was he bad. Fair enough, he is our captain and a club legend, but these kinds of performances are just unacceptable for a PL striker, not to mention for the "star player" of a team aspiring to win the league. 

He should be dropped, not only because of his dire form, but also because of the signals it sends to the rest of the squad. If he plays next match LVG basically says "The rest of you lot have to perform to start, except Rooney, he can play as shite as possible and still get games"

1236~~~
What has the position he is playing got to do with his shit touch and overall game? 

Rooney gets an amazingly easy ride from the Pundits too. Al I heard yesterday was, we need to sign another striker to take the burden off Rooney. Burden? He s the captain of the team, probably in the top 10 of the highest paid footballers in the world and its a burden to expect him to be our main man?

1237~~~
Or the message could be: as a manager, I have faith in my players, and unlike some fans, I won't turn on them after a handful of bad games.

Don't get me wrong: I think Rooney is on the downside, but he's no stranger to slumps in form (which are often followed by extreme upticks in form,) so it's hardly surprising that LVG would persist with him, particularly when we don't exactly have a like-for-like replacement (I wouldn't mind seeing Hernandez get a run, but it's hardly controversial to field even an off-form Rooney over Hernandez.) Once this season is finished, I imagine a ruthless appraisal of Rooney's worth will be carried out. Until then, I'd expect to see him start the majority of games, and end up with 15-20 goals.

1238~~~
Rooney being great at no. 10 position has become a bit of a myth now. He does not have the pace and dribbling to drive the attack from there anymore. His passing is above average at best for what you require from your normal number 10.

The only reason why he looks better as a number 10 is because that allows him to have a free role, where he can go about chasing the ball. As a number 9, he seems lacks the positioning discipline to hold the line and stretch the play.

As it is now when he is played as number 10, half the posters start saying that he should play as a pure forward since he banged in so many goals playing up top 3-4 years ago. When he plays as number 9, the other half say put him behind the striker and let him dictate the play.

1239~~~
There's a lot of assumption and revisionism in this post. Rooney has been a fantastic player for us. He's moved around the field and played just about everywhere in the last 5 years. Even in defensive midfield. So to say that 'the rest of his game has been largely poor' is very wide of the mark in my opinion, and defies the evidence on display.

For me, Rooney has exceptional game intelligence. It's what has allowed him to play as a 6, 8, 10, 9 and 11 over recent years. Because of his profile, salary etc, people are so quick to jump on his poor performances but I think it's very unfair. Yes, he was terrible yesterday. But, unlike you, I don't think this is because he can't roll a defender, beat a man, or lacks already game qualities; I think it's because he is yet again adjusting to a new position. A position in which he is on the fringes of the game. Something he finds more difficult because he's always liked to be heavily involved in the build up.

Rooney still had a lot of pace, and exceptional all round qualities. He deserves a run up front and I believe that LVG is the right man to coach him through this transition.

There has to be some consistency. Dropping him might seem like the easy and logical approach, but you can also destroy his confidence. I think he deserves more than two games to adjust to his new role. I am confident he will come good.

1240~~~
You've definitely got a point. Rooney's at his best as a number 10 when his overall game is superb, but it's his overall game which is largely very poor and disappointing at the moment. The main contribution he can give in that role is his workrate, but when he's on form he can offer a lot more behind the striker: his drive, long passing, control etc. He's not really got that at the moment, which is why he'll probably work better as an out and out striker where he can hopefully still score goals.

People will often want to drop him back because he can occasionally become a bit isolated from the play when he's a number 9, since he typically likes to be involved, but at the moment he's not offering too much when he's heavily involved because his overall game is obviously lacking.

1241~~~
The problem is that these "slumps in form" tend to last for months, and the last couple of years, they seem to come more often. We all know Rooney has a high ceiling, but his bottom level is just incredibly bad. Hernandez might not have the talent that Rooney has(had), but at least he will look like a footballer on a bad day, not a drunken leper. LVG is supposed to be a "hard man" that does not bend over backwards to accommodate star players (like Ribery), so why Rooney gets a free pass is just bemusing

Also: Rooney gets a free pass with the fans because he still is relatively young and we all think "he'll come good". Remember he broke through at 16, so it's not preposterous to suggest he peaked a long time ago and is now on the decline that most players see at 33-34. Remember Scholes and Giggs on their older days? They could serve up some real stinkers at times (not this bad though) and end up getting axed the next game, despite their status.

Getting axed is the kick up the arse he needs. Feck "he needs games to improve". He can prove himself in training like everyone else. A club aspiring to win the league can't accommodate passengers so they might find their form

1242~~~
The media will always love him - especially Sky

Compare him to the best No10s and strikers in the world at the moment and he's been well short for the last 4 years

People need to stop going on about what he has done in the past and look at what he does now - he's burnt out

1243~~~
New role? He has played as a striker for the majority of his career. Being told to stay up front instead of drop down into midfield should not be a huge problem for a pro player.

Destroy his confidence? Feck that too. Hes a grown ass man, not a toddler. Part of being a pro footballer is that you have to perform too stay in the team.

1244~~~
Still no compilation of that performance yet?

1245~~~
It would be revisionism had I not been stressing the same argument for a long time. I'm merely maintaining my previous stance on Rooney. I think he's predictable at #10. I also think he's an excellent centre forward from a goalscoring perspective, with incredibly understated finishing ability.

His all round game, however, lets him down. His first touch borders on reckless and he seldom creates any sort of inspiration when on the ball. He hasn't for a long time.

His new position isn't all that new, really. He plays there for England and has played there at club level since March. Generally, he plays this role well and I still expect him to.

But let's be honest with ourselves, Rooney isn't beating players anymore. That part of his game died a long time ago, and that isn't revisionism or wide of the mark, because it isn't in evidence anywhere on the field.

Rooney needs to buck his ideas up. Bad games are part and parcel of football, but yesterday was genuinely something else. There are lads in the Ryman that would have put in a more credible performance than that up top and that just isn't right. Like it or not, his profile and salary do merit that little bit extra. He's being paid a lot of money to play like that, it's natural that he is subject to more attention.

1246~~~
He's only played as a number 9 for one season of his career. So you are a little misinformed there.

As for the second point; that is indicative of a very poor approach to leadership. Understanding the human element and being able to effectively manage and motivate individuals, is what makes great managers. Your approach is more in sync with football manager than reality.

1247~~~
We can agree that he certainly isn't playing well at the moment. But again I disagree with the argument about his all round game. Rooney consistently posts up excellent numbers for goals and assists when playing in deep positions, i.e. As a 10. This is not indicative of someone who is devoid of creative inspiration.

Rooney gets way too much flak.

1248~~~
For me, Rooney is exactly why statistics can sometimes be deceiving. He puts up the numbers, which is why I like him furthest forward, but he leaves a lot to be desired from deep. His passing is predictable, his touch inconsistent and there are better players in these positions I would be selecting ahead of Rooney, both at the club and elsewhere. 

When was the last time Rooney bamboozled a defender with a first touch, or shimmied past two oncoming players? When did he last burst past a player in midfield? I don't think it's there anymore. I appreciate you'll probably disagree, which is fair enough. 

Our saving grace is that I think Rooney will still score plenty of goals for us this season, and last night wasn't the norm. Ideally, he'll get one against Brugge.

1249~~~
Can't argue with too much of that.

1250~~~
Don't want to judge him after just 2 matches, but he's been really bad, LVG should look for another striker and drop him if he doesn't raise level of play.

1251~~~
His time is gone and his peak has been reached about 2 seasons ago. It is all downhill from here. Sir Alex seen it. Time to ship out.

1252~~~
ESPN dares to criticize the captain, labelling him "embarrassing".

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.us/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2564591/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-form" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.us/club/mancheste...t/2564591/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-form</a>

1253~~~
Phil Thompson described it well, saying Rooney has no real threat to his position in the team as Hernandez and Wilson aren't going to dislodge him long term so perhaps he isn't on his edge as if RVP or Falcao were on the bench ready to take his place. I think he isn't suited to be the main focus of the attack due to the seasons being played out of position. He tends to drop back into midfield too much for my liking. Against Spurs and Villa he was awful, his first touch reminded me of Falcao last season, bouncing off him and going to the opposition team, he is a liability this season so far. In his defence he hasn't been given much chances but this shouldn't be an excuse, Spurs game he stopped for a cup of tea and only good luck we got the goal. Its embarrassing that a club of our stature is solely reliant on Rooney to provide 20+ goals a season. Early days and I hope he comes good but I don't believe it will happen.

1254~~~
Fact is if Rooney continues to not score/assist, then he will be dropped. No two ways about it. Van Gaal will notice that and he will be forced to change things up. If he does feck all in the next couple of games, then I can see him being dropped or at least substituted around 60 minutes more often. 

I haven't given up on him yet - I just think he's having a really bad start. I think he'll kick into gear in a few games time.

1255~~~
His only touch in the box was that ball from Schweinsteiger... In the 92nd min!

1256~~~
First person I have seen in the media actually writing Rooney off for the first time as a striker. Ian Wright thinks Rooney is finished as a number 9, and should only ever be used as a 10.

1257~~~
It is Wayne Rooney? I don't know what you expect really. The fans have found all manner of vitriolic abuse to hurl at him. On the pitch and off it. Sometimes I sit here reading the posts and I can feel almost the foam gathering at the corner of their mouth. It is on another planet in terms of being over the top, some of these guys really just need to take a step outside and soak up some rays and remember we won 1-0 away from home.
Really? You mean Lukaku who is 6'3 and 94kg and has essentially played holdup9 for his entire career due to his size and natural athletic affinity of the role would do a better job playing holdup9 than the 5'9" 85kg jack of all trades striker who has plaudits in a number of roles and positions bar the one we are playing at the moment?

Well feck me, I'm sold.

1258~~~
Instead of focusing on his best position, i'd like an explanation as to why sometimes he completely loses his touch and vision.

Fergie made it clear in the past that rooney was always going to struggle with age, he even pointed out how his father looked with age and how it runs in the family. Based on that i've always felt that rooney had enough technique and football intelligence to alter his game with age, i expected his to lose some pace and fitness, but he's losing things he shouldn't lose with time, suddenly he can't control the ball or make a simple pass, that tells me that there's more to it than getting older, i think something isn't ok in his head.

1259~~~
"Won't judge him yet...." Judges him next sentence....

1260~~~
many of the abusive comments about Rooney is either agenda driven or displays lack of football knowledge.

Rooney will end his playing days in midfield for us. For now he still has a lot to offer as a striker. He had very poor service Friday and was isolated.

Yes he had some poor touches and a couple of bad passes. But he also made some very good passes that was not taken advantage of or not read.

He can still play as an out and out striker for at least two more seasons.

1261~~~
Very strange that isn't it.  I kind of remember the first time I noticed his touch was absolutely dogshit a few years ago.  Before that I kind of hero-worshipped him.  It was like like Space Jam and the Monstars had stolen his talent or something.  Then he went on a streak and scored loads of goals and did some ridiculously good things for a few weeks....

I think its fitness.  You wouldn't think it could have such an impact but I think it does.   I know that when I was not match fit my touch would completely desert me - its like your whole body is slightly unbalanced.  Then the confidence goes a bit because you made such a pigs ear of a skill that is pretty fundamental to a footballer.  On Rooney's history his touch and his eye for goal will come back after 4 or 5 games where he's played week in week out as soon as he really gets match sharp.  As he gets older the time it takes for him to do that becomes longer and longer.

Add to that the entirely natural change that happens to any footballer once they make shed-loads of money and he realises its just a job he's doing week in week out.  The hunger goes just a little bit.

1262~~~
Some were saying he is not good enough to play for us. If Rooney is good enough to play as a lone forward, Lukaku certainly is. And you've also actually just pointed that out and why to those who didn't think he could do the job.

1263~~~
And the fact that he's been playing out of position for essentially 3 years or so and hasn't had enough chances to keep his striker skills up.  When you haven't been playing in your regular role for long periods of time, that time away erodes those skills.  It may take a long time for him to get those abilities back or he may never get them back.

1264~~~
woosh

1265~~~
I'm lost.

1266~~~
After the upgrade in quality of midfielders in the last couple of summer transfer windows, that really is a depressing thought.

1267~~~
he can replace any of them.

1268~~~
Absolutely no chance.

1269~~~
Lack of sevice my ass.

1270~~~
You're not the only one...

I think it was just a really bad use of woosh

1271~~~
He can replace Schweinsteiger or Schneiderlin? What exactly does he offer more than them?

1272~~~
Perfect example of an over hyped English player with no work ethic who in the off season drinks beer, smokes cigs and eats fish and chips and thinks he is world class.  England won't win anything as a footballing nation until they get some disciplined players in their ranks.  I have been saying for a few years now that Rooney is past it and I am as convinced as ever.  A waste of natural talent.

1273~~~
How..I don't understand the extremities people have with Rooney. Positive or negative. How can Rooney replace the midfielders we have now? What role? He isn't mobile enough anymore, his short passing isn't great. He can spray passes around so you'd think his best role in midfield could be as a holding mid but he doesn't have the defensive positioning for that. But by that time I am sure we would have much better options.

I'm seriously baffled by that comment.

1274~~~
You are seriously deluded. He doesnt offer a lot for a striker, he actually barely offers something. No goals, no hold up nor link up play, he doesnt create space for others. The only reason Rooney plays, is that Chicha and Wilson are no world beaters either. In every other top team, he'd be seriously benched a long time ago.

And no, he can barely playbas a out an out lone striker now, never mind in 2 year.

You just ask yourself, hoe many good games has Rooney actually had in 2015, it's really far less than the poor-average-non existent he's had.

1275~~~
How does he have a rating of 5.4? He should be around 1 or 2 for the first two games of the season.

1276~~~
I hope van Gaal doesn't think the answer is to fit him in the midfield somewhere. He still doesn't do enough in the #10 role for me.

1277~~~
There is no way he is going to play in midfield. There isn't even enough places to play the actual midfielders.

1278~~~
Unless he moves Rooney to #10 and plays Januzaj up front?

1279~~~
#10 is the pinnacle of football. That's where maradonna,  zidane, kaka and other maestro of the game played,  and you think a guy who can't trap a ball nor making a clean 5 yards pass will excel at number #10?

1280~~~
I never said he would excel in that position I just said LVG could move him back there and allow Januzaj to go up front. Mata should be #10 he has the skill and vision for it.

1281~~~
Yup,  and shifts the problem to the midfield. At this rate he's hazardous on the pitch.  Whatever position he plays

1282~~~
So someone else takes the fall for the Captain's failure once again. Wasn't he saying he will score goals for us uptop throughout the summer? If he continues playing this Sunday League standard then Wilson/Chich get their chance and he sits out until he gets back to the standard we demand here, if he can't then axe him next summer. No point in shifting the problem to midfield and we've just spent a bucketload to ensure we never have to play him there again.

1283~~~
I'm confident he will score 20+ goals this season. Just give him time. Yeah he's lost his touch etc. Everyone knows Rooney needs a good run of games to be at his best. He's never been good at the start of a season. Eventually his touch will come back and he'll be banging them in.

1284~~~
Only if he takes our penalties and if we get about 5 or 6 he will reach that number.

1285~~~
Rooney will get better than this, the only way is up from that performance. Still, I think what will happen is he will succeed in the trick of lowering the bar/expectations to such a ridiculously low level, where any performance that falls into the bracket of 'average' will be praised as 'he had a good game, you haters this you haters that', when the fact is, it will probably still be far from good enough.


I've been saying this shit about Rooney for ages. It is no vendetta. I'm just saying it as I see. He's not my cousin, while I understand it takes forever for some to criticise a United player, I will if I see fit, at least to other United fans, not so much outside.

The making of excuses is tiring though. There is no legislation for basic football inability. The Rooney situation is clear as day. Television coverage of footy from the PL and beyond is so good now, there are more than enough very good footballers to easily see what a not very good one looks like. Such paragraphs of mitigation are not used in defending other 'top' players by the same football fans, and the same people name calling will be quick to say Cavani is rubbish, for example. I don't read the 'new league, he needs to play through the middle not wide, he can't play with Zlatan' or whatever other story his mother and the good folk from his Church would use in analysing a poor performance from him. And even still, he is a better striker than Wayne Rooney.

Rooney is too easy to defend against for your average PL centre half with a bit of pace and or strength. He has absolutely no tools that will make it uncomfortable for a defender
defender. He can finish but will not get enough opportunities to show it, due partly to us not being a buccaneering force, and the same reasons Jordan Rhodes is unlikely to be a top forward, despite being an excellent finisher.

Rooney is like a centre midfielder playing centre forward. What I would expect from Lampard upfront, so this even giving the benefit of the doubt that he will at least control the ball and pass. The issue is no incision to hurt defenders, even in games where he actually does do the basics of football right. After that, what else? No turn, no dribble, no pace. Just a Lampard who will play a pass out wide and finish a chance if it falls.

1286~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> True that, didn't finish first sentence properly so sounds wrong. Meant to say won't judge him as finished player yet, since most of people here consider him past it. But being stoned as f... while writing did it's share, thanks for pointing that out <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1287~~~
Just noticed the Sun Dream Team gave him a rating of 7... 

Ridiculous, I'm convinced these guys don't watch matches and just handout scores based on reputation.

1288~~~
If Rooney is ever playing in midfield for us again then something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. He isn't a midfielder. Never has been and never will be. Surely that was settled last season in a position that emphasises just how sloppy and predictable his football now is.

Rooney made one good pass out wide to Memphis on Friday, that was all.

There is zero excuse for his atrocious performance and I'm baffled that the odd person is still defending it.

1289~~~
The Mirror gave him and Depay a 6 each. All they said about Depay was that he put a corner straight out of play. So I wouldn't take them serious at all.

1290~~~
Excellent post right here.

1291~~~
I've long been a critic of Wayne's but there's no mileage for a United fan in wanting him to fail, as that would be bloody ridiculous, self-defeating and pathetic; I just hope he recovers his form...

One thing puzzles me though: he still sprints about on occasion - so he's obviously fit - so why doesn't he use those bursts to make space & get off a shot? I'm honestly mystified by this. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will offer a possible explanation beyond "he's lost it" or "it's the tactics, stupid."

1292~~~
He isn't escaping any criticism (and rightly so),  some people just don't share the same views as the majority in this thread.

1293~~~
he wouldn't get 7 for both games together.. some of site's ratings are simply ridiculous

1294~~~
Then so should at least five other players.

1295~~~
Bollocks.  Not one player was as bad as Rooney, nevermind at least 5.  Seriously I've read your posts and it just looks like you never even watched the match.

A 'few' players had bad performances, but Rooney has been by far the worst in his position.

1296~~~
If the British media start to actually realise that he is playing poorly it might snap him out of it. They are way too soft with him. He is probably too comfortable for a number of reasons, lack of scrutiny being one of them.

1297~~~
Bollocks to you too, I've read some of your posts also..There was a comment that started off with something like anyone saying this then don't bother, meaning you aren't willing to accept that some people will have a different opinion and we must take yours as gospel.  Well I'm not having that.

1298~~~
He's the Captain of England and Manchester United. Despite the fact that should bring more scrutiny, in reality it makes him quite a powerful person as various journalists will buddy up to him to make sure they get their exclusives with him. This naturally means he gets favourable coverage. Don't expect journalists to be objective they only ever look for two things: job security and clicks.

1299~~~
It pisses me off to see him roaming around, trying to get involved and eventually breaking up the play. He needs to stay up front and drag defenders to create space for wide attackers. That’s the best contribution we can get from him on current form.

1300~~~
That's true, fair point.

1301~~~
Perhaps former players moreso than 'journalists' then. Of course ex-United players (especially those that played with him e.g. Neville) are not going to really criticise him either.

1302~~~
It's all too comfortable, they spend years building up relationships, they're not going to piss him off by doing something as trivial as giving him a 4 (still generous) in a dream team rating.

1303~~~
I dont think anyone here wants him to fail(i certainly hope so ) and we would all be happy to be proven wrong...but the evidence  shows that is just more wishful thinking than any realistic expectation...he's just not as good as the caliber of striker we need to get back us to the top, both domestically and in Europe

1304~~~
He's getting the david moyes treatment, where the press will blame everyone else but him...thats why you cant take of the press seriously at all

1305~~~
There you go.  Not 'anyone thinking this'.  People trying to sugarcoat things rather than see them as they are.  Trying to turn this on me by judging my character from 2 words 'dont bother' just shows more what your mindset is.  I've yet to see someone actually defend his performances and bring a good point forward.  So far it's been:

- other players played bad as well
(Just deflecting the situation away from him on to other players, he's our captain ffs, he sets the standards)
- hes a slow starter
(Probably the argument I'm hoping will prove just)
- not getting the service
(Completely laughable considering he was never in the position to receive the service, no runs made at all)

You can talk about me thinking my word is gospel, but the statements being put forward on here defending rooney are farts in the wind.  Because the majority of the forum believe he has played awful,  you just see it as a witch hunt and are keen to jump on the minority side to be different.

1306~~~
He's had a lot more than two games to adjust to this role - it's exactly the same position he played in for most of the second half of last season. He was generally crap there too with no goals in his last 6 appearances.

1307~~~
Exactly, and throughout pre season.

1308~~~
What to do with him is the question though? I think most would agree that he has been pretty crap for quite some time now. LvG surely sees this as well. Will be interesting to see what will happen. The thought of him leading our line for the rest of this season give me a bit of a headache, that's for sure.
I'm not sure it's only a matter of poor form. He looks physically done. Not fat or unfit. But he doesn't seem to have a lot of energy left.

1309~~~
I am not one of those who believes Rooney is past it but I think some of the excuses being made for his poor performance are laughable.

Let's not pretend that Rooney hasn't played up front for years. Rooney is England's first choice centre forward, every international break he plays as a central striker, and he has scored a lot of goals from that position in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. Rooney also finished last season as Van Gaal's first choice #9, was Moyes' preferred option as a centre forward and even Sir Alex gave him games up front until he started questioning his value in spring 2013.

Also, Rooney was given the ball a decent amount and could have had more chances had he not messed up so many moves. The service to Rooney was not <i>that</i> bad. Our passing was not brilliant, and did not really stabilise until Basti and Ander came on. Still, Rooney was played the ball to feet with just the Villa back line to beat several times. As Match of the Day highlighted last night, Rooney pretty much lost the ball on every single occasion. His touch was abysmal. Had attacks not broken down with him four or five times he might have been played in more. Pretty much every time Rooney messed up there was someone available to play a give and go with, most comically with Ander Herrera where the ball literally just bounced off Rooney's instep. Had those players received the ball Rooney would've been able to run off the shoulder into space and get it back. Although, given how he messed up Basti's ball over the top in stoppage time, he may well have screwed that up too.

There are no excuses for how Rooney played. If Hernandez had played like that, to a man, the CAF would be using it as an example of how he has terrible link up and shouldn't be playing. Rooney had a terrible game. Lets not sugar coat it.

The key thing is that Rooney, I think, will turn it around. We have seen this from him before. He goes through spells where nothing seems to come off for him, then he whacks in a wonder goal and regains his self-belief e.g. City (H) 2010/11, Hull (A) 2013/14. Rooney was dire on Friday night but he's not regressed to where he was in the autumn and winter of 2010 after the transfer request business. Wouldn't be surprised if he smashes one in from 20 yards on Tuesday night.

1310~~~
All you Rooney haters. Just think. Will van Gaal keep him or any player who does not contribute to the team? 
He got rid of the most expensive player we bought after one season. Think of how much we would save in wages alone if we got rid of Rooney if he was crap.

The fact is Van Gaal does not have the players he wants in place...yet playing the system he has decided is the best.

If we went to 4-3-3 Rooney would very quickly be a lot more effective.

He had a poor game Friday. So did most of our other players except for our defenders. Says it all really.

1311~~~
Ah, so it's the formation to blame this time. Never the player playing poor no matter where we play him.

1312~~~
first answer the question. Do you think van Gaal will keep a player who he think does not contribute?

1313~~~
If anything, I think Rooney is a lot better in a 4-2-3-1 with someone helping him in behind rather then being too isolated. But he just had a bad game, no need to blame other things. Everything about his game was off and if he was on top form, we would have looked way better going forward. There were like 3 balls over the top from schweinsteiger in the last 20 minutes alone that he just ruined but if he was on form, he could have turned into a great chance.

He'll come good I think, but he needs to have a look at himself because that was woeful from him.

1314~~~
He doesn't even get subbed, so yes it seems Van Gaal will keep a player that's not contributing and people will continue making excuses for him. Formation, position, time of the match, he doesn't have Messi playing next to him. It's irrelevant anyway, we can't sell him as no one would be mad enough to throw away £250k a week on someone who can't control a football.

1315~~~
what I saw Friday was our midfield had no clue how to make that final lethal ball. We were quick getting up to the final ball. Then slowed down. It was like watching Valencia before last season.

Yes. Rooney had poor touches. But he made several passes that were not taken advantage of at all.

1316~~~
Which passes?

1317~~~
Yep, that's the key thing for me. Rooney always goes through extended periods of poor form but this is different to the rest because he's never looked this lethargic before. Everything he's doing is so feeble. The intensity's just not there any more.

From a footballing perspective the decision is pretty simple for me. Get rid of him and bring in someone who's a more natural fit for the role and is in better shape - neither of which are difficult. 

From a financial/commercial perspective I suspect it's much more difficult. I can't remember what it was but when he signed his last contract there was something in there about Rooney having more commercial influence than any player in the club's history. I think Gill spent more time talking about his commercial value than his value on the pitch after that contract was signed in fact.

1318~~~
that is a ridiculous analysis.

van Gaal and the board will not keep a player that is not contributing. 

and lets be clear. I support Manchester United...not Wayne Rooney. Its  just that we have over the board shallow analysis from a number on here.

anyway..I hope whichever team van Gaal picks, play like United should. I dont want us turning into Chelsea.

1319~~~
go back and watch the match.

1320~~~
Nah, the vast majority of his passes were poorly hit and he didn't create anything really. His touch was off all night, and his runs were poor. I defend rooney almost always, but that was probably as bad as I've ever seen him. We were slow going forward as we always are, but Memphis looked way more dangerous with his runs, he just lacked the finish. Rooney just didn't even look like he'd get in a chance.

1321~~~
I have seen the match on german sky today a second time, something I normally don't do but today... well, forget it.

However, Rooney really had a nightmare evening. Really. Nothing worked out. No - thing. But still he was fighting, he was running, he was cursing (himself and some teammates). I know plenty of players who just stop doing anything when nothing works out, but not Rooney. That's the only positive thing to say about his Friday's performance. (However, if he does not improve he has to be on the bench sooner or later.)

1322~~~
I rather not. That's why I'm asking you. I'm curious because I don't recall him making any passes like that. Although he did misplace a pass that wasn't his fault.

1323~~~
What do you propose they do with him then? Sack him? Who is actually going to pay the money to buy him and his massive wages? Moyes lumbered us with him and we are stuck with him until he decides to take a pay cut to leave or his contract runs out.

You're living in a fantasy land if you think that he contributed anything the other night and that we can actually get rid of him.

1324~~~
It will be a harder decision with Rooney as he's the captain, any other player would be benched on Tuesday night but he will be first name of the team sheet. Going off topic here but Brenton did a good job with Steven Gerrard by phasing him out and moving on. It sounds harsh but we will have to do the same with the Rooney at some point.

1325~~~
With most United legends I always feel comfortable critizing them. But when others do I'm just as easily offended. Bit like ones children.
I feel we shouldn't write off someone who's had such a record at United. The guy deserves more respect. At the same time he claimed the CF position, and he knows he needs to make goals in that position. Pretty sure Rooney isn't satisfied when he doesn't. He's still a great captain though. Imagine RvP had retained it last year,, have you seen him play with Feher lately? He's got no first touch left, seldom saw such a great player deteriorate that fast. And Rooneys got a great mentality, seems only United fans have trouble acknowledging that. He always plays on the edge and seldom gets a red card, unlike Gerrard.
We shouldn't give Rooney a new multi million pund contract, just like RvP didn't get one. But if he's willing to take a cut, I'd love to have him end his career at United.

1326~~~
Yeah where as Smalling and Shaw got a 6 in my team??

Rooney got better rating than Mata <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1327~~~
I was just coming to post this. Those ratings weren't from The Sun. Rather they were from Opta. I thought they were reliable. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Also, Young got a 6 after playing about 11 minutes. Herrera, having played around 63 got a 5. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1328~~~
<i>O rly?!</i> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1329~~~
Fanboy alert there...There spring up here after a few days after the game has been played..

1330~~~
And then act as if he really wasnt that bad.

1331~~~
Exactly..or say that everyone was bad as well..and then bring up stats from years ago..and then talk about respect..But never talk about  the actual performance being discussed.

1332~~~
Spot on, the fanboys really make me cringe. Then go on about haters etc as if we are 12 year olds.

1333~~~
How on earth has Rooney got 1 assist?! (According to stats above) for that god awful touch against spurs?

1334~~~
Shows how misleading stats can be.

1335~~~
He really was terrible the other day, no excuses for that.

1336~~~
Hasn't scored away from home since November 2014....It's almost September 2015..........

1337~~~
Watching City now and the sad truth is he's miles behind Agüero. We could really do with a striker like him.

1338~~~
Rooney is such an odd player. Really just can't think of another player who can be as good as he can be but also be be so bizarrely erratic in the basics of his game. I'd get if he's not quite found that killer instinct in front of goal yet (although the amount of time he wanted against spurs was alarming), but just controlling the ball, playing a simple pass should be something that he can do coming off a full pre-season even if it's not at it's best. The difference between him and Scweinsteiger for instance is pretty big atm given the latter has a broken pre-season and hasn't bee starting yet. 

I still think though that when he does find his form he will be good there, I thought there were flashes of good interplay against Spurs but it is a worry as it makes a massive difference to our build up play when he is off his game. It would be one thing if he just didn't have his shooting boots on as you can hope others step up but when he's one of the main reason attacks break down it's an issue. It's not like it's a case of match sharpness i.e. taking a bit too long on the ball it's very simple things he got wrong against Villa for a professional player.

I do think though that he clearly doesn't have as much to his game as some of the other top strikers in the league let alone europe. When he's isolated and running the channels he just doesn't have that turn of speed/dribbling on the ball, regardless of how impressive his top speed is when running without it and that's a trait we could use.

I don't want to see him dropping of to a number 10 role though. Whilst he tends to drop deep as a a striker I think we can live with that when his form picks up and the other attackers like Depay settle in. But as a number 10 I just don't think his style suits the players we have, his game there being so much about dropping of and switching the play rather than playing people in from wide which in Depay,Mata,Januzaj and likely Pedro we'd want. Rooney as a number ten needs players like Valencia/Young who will stick out wide and are want to stay there and I'd think we'd be even more one dimensional.

Hopefully he gets a goal on Tuesday as that always seems to help him, ideally he'll be asked to stay on the defenders a bit more as whilst he's not the quickest he does have the pace to get in and if he pushes them back a bit it will open some space for the others and Rooney can concentrate on finishing the moves rather than getting too involved in the build up.

1339~~~
Imagine how good we'd be if we had a decent centre forward. It's a real concern that he's captain and beyond dropping and he's even apparently exempt from being substituted. He's always blown hot and cold but his better performances are few and far between these days. Fergie tried to do Moyes a favour by getting Rooney out of the way, but he only went and cocked that up along with everything else. I'm worried for the season ahead that we have to rely on him in every game.

1340~~~
Look at Aguero today compared to what Rooney currently offers. Amazingly, there are still fans arguing that Rooney is the better player.

1341~~~
Its mental, that anyone can think Rooney is the better player. Mental

1342~~~
Aguero had no pre season and only played 30 mins last week. Look how good he looks.

1343~~~
don't think many would argue Aguero isn't the better striker.

But look how many chances his team mates get him. He wouldn't look half as good in our current setup

1344~~~
It is embarrassing to compare the two. Rooney was not even better than aguero two season ago, so I do not understand the point of comparing them right now when even a monkey could pick the better of the two. 

This might be harsh, but lets all just hope Rooney can turns it around and he can at least be as good as Torres(Chelsea) for us.

1345~~~
They might have better service but just look at the way Aguero handles himself in the box, had three Chelsea player around but he still manages to stick it in the back of the net. Put Rooney in the same situation and he forgets how to score.

1346~~~
I think Rooney's main problem is his physique. I don't practice any sport but I look much fitter than Rooney ever did. I mean if you look at pics with his shirt off, he's like my dad whereas most footballers look like proper athletes.

1347~~~
It's a bit of a vicious cycle though. You put Aguero in our team and all of a sudden the opposition will likely drop of a bit as there's a player who will and can run on behind them. That create's space for our creators. Additionally how many attacks breakdown because Rooney takes a poor touch, again add Aguero and maybe those attacks go somewhere. Likewise how many times does a move breakdown because Rooney can't beat players frequently on the ball and has to check and wait for support? 

Although I think when Rooney does find his form he could lead the line fine for us I think that if you switched Rooney for Aguero/Costa I don't think those players would lose as much from their performance and their respective teams would lose replacing them with Rooney. Sounds harsh but I think Rooney's problems are very individualistic rather than the team although there's plenty to improve there as well but personally I think with a lot of that it's about how we're using them then real problems in their quality.

1348~~~
At least Aguero knows how to trap the ball and hold the ball. If Rooney is asked to play higher up the pitch then he should play there. He keeps dropping deep every time and finds himself in a bad position.

1349~~~
Still, people make those claims. Obviously, Aguero is world class and Rooney is some distance from being that. Aguero's movements, close control and finishing are levels above that of Rooney. Rooney's long range passing is arguably better, to the right that is.

1350~~~
Both are lead strikers playing for two of the best clubs in the league. Comparisons will be made throughout the season. Unfortunately for us, Aguero is by far the superior player.

1351~~~
[QUOTE="Kill 'em all, post: 17957197], member: 68809"..if you look at pics with his shirt off[/QUOTE]
thats just wrong

1352~~~
Rooney could get chances if his control and anticipation were better. How he didn't get at least a shot on Friday at the end of the game when Schweinsteiger put him through, any of the top strikers would have but Rooney managed only to put it out for a Villa throw.

1353~~~
Stop making it sounds like they're playing fifa at carrington,  rooney will ve prepared by the coach to play whereever he's planned to play,  it's not park football.

1354~~~
Exactly. When there aren't many chances, he at least has to take advantage of the few that come his way. Against Villa, as you point out, he heads it away from goal instead of believing in his abilities and directing it towards the goal - very, very poor.

1355~~~
Don't forget 'hidden agendas' as well.

1356~~~
Just shows how expectation levels have dropped.
A lot here bang on about Rooney  needing at least a half of dozen games to get into some kind of form as if this is an acceptable standard at club like United in such a competitive league.

1357~~~
What irks me is the argument of him being close to our all time goalscoring record when someone questions his goalscoring ability. Now the problem isn't just lack of goals, his all round play is very bad. The current Rooney doesn't even come close to the standard required at a club that aims at being at the top. If Rooney keeps this kind of form which he carried throughout most of last season, we will be in big trouble. To think we used to make fun of Torres.

1358~~~
Rooney has always been a striker who plays well in spurts....with the exception of that one year he banged in 30+

when he gets his first a few more will follow

1359~~~
And then there will be barren periods where he does absolute nothing (like he does now) and injuries. Which isn't the worst thing. What's actually worse is what follows - people calling him world class and arguing he's still got it. And you know what will happen next - he will continue to be the mainstay when he should be benched every now and then like every other player is. I really hope LvG sees this and realizes that Rooney isn't half the player he was.

1360~~~
I remember that last season and during the summer I had actually argued with another poster on a few occasions who believed Rooney is better than Aguero, which is fecking moronic, and frankly, I wouldn't trust a human being around me who can examine both and claim such.

1361~~~
I don't think it's his <i>main</i> problem at all but after you've groaned at his atrocious first touch, ponderous dribbling and indecisiveness, his physique is certainly a bit of a joke for an supposed athlete. At least Messi, while not looking like an athlete keeps his weight down (although he's probably one of those types that couldn't gain weight if he tried).

Then again, Rooney is not the only footballer who looks like a lad down the park. It's just most of the players who look like that aren't described as elite level players.

1362~~~
Who knows.....

Van Gaal can be extremely stubborn as we know

Van Gaal can also be ruthless as Van Persie can testify

the other thing to consider is that there isn't a wealth of talent available - you could almost count the top strikers in the world on a hand these days 

I just hope Rooney gets his sharpness back quickly and with his power and he isn't slow he should be giving defences a harder time....

1363~~~
that's a surprisingly sensible post on here.

poor Rooney, nothing will be good enough this season!

I hope Brugges and Newcastle see him get off the mark.

City have shown what we're up against this season. 2 thumping wins from a team a lot of idiots had written off. seemingly just because we pumped them in our hot streak, on their low form period.

1364~~~
It's not acceptable for Manchester United's main striker to take 5 or more games playing like shit until he gets into some kind of form, scores 5 and goes back to being shit again. A Manchester United striker has to bang them in from day 1.

1365~~~
Yep. I criticise players all the time however when it's Rooney I'm criticising I'm a disrespectful hater with an agenda. In current form, he's even worse than Cleverley or Young were under Moyes, and by current I mean since April 2015..

1366~~~
One away goal in the League since March 2014, no more than a single shot on target in a game this year...

Yeah he might bag a couple against Brugge and Newcastle but then he'll probably go 6-8 games without a goal. He told Van Gaal he can be our main man and get the goals this season so he has to deliver, no long streaks with no goals, not only scoring at home etc. He is at his peak and gets paid a fortune, there can be no excuses for him.

1367~~~
He's played here for so many years, no wonder he's close. Scoring 15 goals per year as a striker of the biggest club in the country isnt some extraordinary stat that makes you an unquestionable world beater even though you've deflined.

1368~~~
this is Rooney's first season as main striker since 2009/2010 though? Berbatov, Hernandez, Van Persie and Falcao have played as our main striker invariably since then with Rooney deeper 

lets be 'supporters' eh and give him a chance to regain confidence and form - its been a long time since Rooney was playing as our most advanced striker

1369~~~
That's pretty damning if true.

1370~~~
Rooney played as our most advanced striker in the last months of the previous season.

1371~~~
He managed how many? 4 in 14? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1372~~~
I'll give him time to adjust to the positional and tactical demands of a "new" position (one he got a run in for the last few months of last season and has had all pre-season to adjust to) but won't be so sympathetic about his distinct lack of control, passing and general game awareness. The two different aspects of his game are in no way interdependent.

1373~~~
yeah that's fair enough....

In the poll I think he will score 15-20 in the league...if our defence is tight and if Hernandez, Wilson, Depay, Pedro (hopefully), Mata, Adnan and Young can chip in with 50 or so between them it could be enough to cement our top 4 place and make a challenge this year

His form has been awful since Spurs at home last season and his performance the other night was as bad as I've seen - I think he can turn it around though....here's hoping

1374~~~
Surely he can. But only for 2-3 months and then he will be bang average again. The performance against Villa won't be his worst this season.

1375~~~
I don't think it's a confidence thing with Rooney, it's not like he has been unlucky with anything in pre season or these first two games, he has just been off with everything, passing, first touch, pace, etc, this is before we even know if he still has the killer instinct in front of goal because he hasn't managed a single shot yet.

Yes of course we should support him, but I think we need to realistic, the guy is the number one striker with no real competition for his place, at a club with ambition of winning everything, and that for me is very alarming.

1376~~~
fr
that's a bold statement (literally) - I can't remember him being that poor in years

1377~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcXpKNM3xFc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

His movement, energy levels, technique, awareness and power. I want that Rooney back. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

He had something special, his first touch always took him away from his marker. He could set up the ball perfectly for a shot with just his first touch.

1378~~~
Rooney was awful the other night but the other thing we need to consider is our build up play

we rarely created chances for Falcao, RVP or Rooney last season....we haven't been a team that creates lots of chances for a long time

last season Falcao, RVP and Rooney struggled to get involved in games and were anonymous on many occasions.

Rooney's form has been poor for a while granted (and his control and passing was dire the other night) but as a team we haven't provided good service or created lots of chances for our strikers in a long time

1379~~~
I think that Rooney is declining and only his biggest fans refuse to see it. Seriously though. He can't be that bad. It's impossible for an elite footballer to be as bad as he was against Villa. I think that the reason is psychological. Rooney knows that he doesn't deserve the fat contract he has and that he can't live up to the expectations. This makes him playing worse than his actual ability. That contract is bad not only for United. It is bad for Rooney himself and, IMO, this will become obvious over the next months and seasons.

1380~~~
It's quite natural actually if you take into account that he's declining and that we are going to play with far better teams than Villa.

1381~~~
One thing should be clear though. He has had a fantastic career at United. It's far from easy to play so many seasons at top level. That's an achievment in itself.

1382~~~
He came on to the scene in the League and International level at such a young age and has played non-stop since he'll probably burn out sooner than most players, he should be at his peak now but I think we'll look back and realise that was his mid-20s. He is definitely better than we saw at Villa though. It's interesting that he hasn't posted anything to his instagram since the Villa game, he generally posts something after every game and all the other players have done, I'm sure he knows he played poorly.

1383~~~
Just bringing up some old interesting Fergie quotes about Rooney.

"When the game gets to that casual bit, he is worse than the rest of them.

"He gets really casual about it. It is better when he is on the edge. Then he is a marvellous player."

We really do need another striker to have any hope of him reaching any kind of dangerous form

1384~~~
So basically we need a second "world class" striker in order to get our first reputedly "world class" striker firing?

Seems to be an awful lot of trouble to go to just to get a player motivated. If we sign another striker it should be to replace him rather than anything else IMO. If Wayne has trouble motivating himself then he really shouldn't be in the team, let alone its captain.

For what its worth I always took Fergies quote to mean that he doesn't show up for meaningless games, like the ones after you have already qualified from the CL group or secured the PL or when the team have already got a comfortable lead in a game and decide to sit on it.

1385~~~
I don't even think another striker would have to be a "replacement", as such, but more so just the extra top quality that we're currently lacking up front. When we signed RVP, he wasn't intended as a replacement for Rooney, and nor was Falcao.

We don't have to get rid of him, as such, but we do definitely need to be looking at adding quality to our group of strikers, and you'd hope we'll eventually get a top class addition who can improve on Rooney.

1386~~~
Well this is a new low. New excuse for Rooney; striker is a new position for him. What a laugh.

1387~~~
The problem for me was against Villa, he isn't making any runs behind the defense. Even then if he comes to get the ball to feet he can't turn sharply or take his marker on, instead he just looks to play it to a wide man. That just gets predictable and easy to defend against. The best strikers like Suarez/Aguero can do all of that, which makes them so unpredictable. Rooney used to be able too, but now his only form of scoring is either tapping in crosses or shooting from the edge of the box if he has room.

1388~~~
Shocking performance, needs to up his game.

1389~~~
That didn't seem to stop Messi, Ronaldo, Giggs and Scholes.

1390~~~
He's spent his career as either a winger or midfielder if you listen to some. We are basically 'converting ' Rooney to a striker now, at least for the first time in 6 years or whatever.

1391~~~
By that logic we should excuse Blind of any screw ups or mistakes in defence because it's new to him too! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1392~~~
Bad day in office for Rooney. Lets move on. If he continues to be crap, then he should make way for Chicha or Wilson.
More importantly, now would be a good time to buy a decent striker.

Watching Aguero score like that y'day had me almost in tears.

1393~~~
You do know there are several different striker roles? He's played as a number 10 since 2011. Hasn't lead the line since 2010.

1394~~~
You HAVE read the posts defending him right? They defend him by saying that he's an intelligent player who has excellent game sense and can score 20+ goals. Number 10 isn't a striking role, it's a playmaking role. Your instincts as a striker don't magically disappear. Your basics don't magically become shit. 

You're saying his crap passing, reactions, control and speed of thought are a product of his not leading the line since 2011 and the fact that there are subtle differences between striking roles that he has not been employed in for awhile? What a joke.  

ps. yes I do know that there are differences in striking roles but the fact that you're stooping to splitting such hairs shows how deluded people have become when defending him.

1395~~~
We dont need rooney if top 4 is all we aim,  benteke will do

1396~~~
Give him a good run of games and see how he regains his senses. You are seriously underestimating him.

What you described in the second paragraph has nothing to do with strikers and positioning, it can be applied to any outfield player. It's mental. Everyone knows Rooney never starts the season on fire. Give him a good run and games and see how the "crap" you described will change.

1397~~~
We don't give him a good run? He never dropped all these years. That's not enough of a run?

1398~~~
I thought it was obvious I was talking about the beginning of the season.

1399~~~
Ever since he got more hair, he's been shit. 

If he allows his baldness to reappear, he'll rediscover his form.

1400~~~
We need to start managing him more wisely. His enthusiasm/insistence on playing every game is coming back to haunt him; he's played a silly amount of games with barely a break for someone his age.

1401~~~
Had a decent break over the summer though.  I thought that would rejuvenate him. Seems to have had the opposite effect. 

Although it does fit with Fergie's comments about him needing to play football to be at his best.

1402~~~
How is that acceptable, you turn up to work for the next month and be really poor at your job, then when your boss pulls you up on it try "Ill be better in a month or two" as an excuse and see what happens. 

No player should be undroppable, and the team should be picked on form, nothing else.

1403~~~
This isn't normal work though. This is football.

It's not like I'm telling you you work perfect on Friday and become shite on Monday. You've got a 3 month layoff and a bit of rust.

1404~~~
I'd be quite worried about Rooney.

1405~~~
Even Yaya is starting the season well and we all know he probably ate cake and slept through his holidays.

1406~~~
Are you comparing a job where form & fitness are major factors, over a standard 9-5 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1407~~~
Think he'll start scoring these next few. All the criticism and focus is on his form right now, and he has often responded to criticism well. Also home games to Brugges and Newcastle you'd expect the striker to score a few. Here's hoping he gets his confidence back. No player can go from looking like complete shit to world class like Rooney, and he always goes on these runs every season where everything is off. He's only 29, so I'd say any talk of him being done is premature to say the least, but let's hope he gets back into form and has a consistent season, because we'll definitely need it.

1408~~~
I've backed Rooney in these situations before but it gets to a point where you've got to ask whether this is acceptable or not. He is our supposed star player, untouchable according to Van Gaal. Yet he goes through these periods where you genuinely wonder whether he is completely finished as a top level footballer. And these blips aren't always just a one or two game problem. Then when he does hit top form, he's still not producing absolute world class performances like other top players around Europe. For me, he's a total enigma these days.

1409~~~
Ronaldo has played more career games than Rooney. 

Rooney's problem is not physical it's psychological. As soon as he scores he'll relax and start smashing goals in.

Let's not chalk up an admittedly terrible performance to problems that don't exist. Rooney is not burned out, he's just in one of his slumps.

1410~~~
If Rooney had even half of the dedication Ronaldo has to staying in top shape, maybe you could make that comparison.

1411~~~
Glad Rooney got the criticism from some of the press today - he usually likes to prove people wrong so I'm hoping that helps with Brugges and Newcastle. Also don't think he's completely safe with LVG. Louis will give him a fair chance to get his form up and his confidence going. If he continues like this though - I can see LVG dropping him because he would have no choice. Never mind what LVG says about 'the captain always plays' - what I suspect he means is the captain will always play provided he's helping and not hindering the team. The moment LVG thinks otherwise, that will be Rooney done imo.

1412~~~
Rooney is more clever than you think.....

he knows we are short of goals up top and he's sacrificed himself, playing badly on purpose to convince us to bring in Pedro....

the White Pele has you all fooled!

1413~~~
I have?

1414~~~
Yes Wayne

1415~~~
At least the critisism became widespread very quickly, so LVG will be forced to do something about it if Rooney stays shite.

1416~~~
Yep. At least Rooney had the decency to show his ability while the transfer window is still open

1417~~~
Play him behind the striker.

Cue hordes of feckwits crying...something.

1418~~~
The reason why I described all those factors in the second paragraph is because it's precisely what he's showing at the moment; crap control, reactions, speed of though, passing.

Why should Rooney be afforded the time to get back into form at the expense of the team? No other player gets preferential treatment like he does. You either perform or you get benched and that's what needs to happen with him.

1419~~~
Im comparing a job where you get paid a kings ransom yet constantly get excuses made for not being able to do the most basic of things.Being able to pass the ball five yards to someone in the same colored shirt or control a ball are feck all to do with form, its a basic fundamental of the job. Its like me turning up and forgetting how to turn my pc on or use a pen.

1420~~~
People don't seem to realise this.

1421~~~
Falcao and RVP played loads of games last season despite being horribly out of form. Basically, the only way to play your way into form is to push through a slump. This is a really silly argument, this isn't even close to being preferential treatment.

1422~~~
Anyone who's played any sport, ever, knows that on a very bad day even the fundamentals go to shite. That's no less true for a pub footballer who kicks air instead of the ball than it is for elite PL footballers who let a pass roll under their foot.

1423~~~
While that is true it does seem like Rooney's bottom level is a bit worse than other elite players. It also seem to occur more often, sadly. That said, I still think he can find his feet and do a <i>decent </i>job this season.

1424~~~
Not necessarily. When you're out of form, and your confidence is shot, you do the basics i.e the absolute minimum and rebuild from there. I'm not saying I'm a footballer to any high level, but playing for my uni team, one my worst days as a midfielder, I'd then just do the basics and do nothing else. Rooney seems incapable of even doing the basics. Even when I used to play cricket and my batting was shot (Middlesex U15s represent), I'd force myself to be able to defend well and play with soft hands and a full blade. It's the absolute minimum, if you can't guarantee yourself that, don't get on the pitch. Rooney against Villa did <b>nothing</b>. It was an abysmal, shambolic performance.

1425~~~
The problem now is that Rooney's top level isn't worth waiting for. If he was going through patches of poor form interspersed with Messi, Ronaldo, Aguero type performances then fair enough, but he isn't capable of it any more.

1426~~~
Comparing the two is just plain silly. Doing something incredibly technical that 99.9% of the population can't do isn't in anyway akin to turning on a computer.
But in your world, carry on...

1427~~~
That's the theory. In practice it's very difficult to play so conservatively, if you're used to everything coming naturally.

1428~~~
I know it sounds silly. But if you look at how long Rooney's slump has gone on for, and his famous track record for taking a long time to come good with a decent performance, we really should be on the move for a more consistent performer. No other top striker takes that long to get into form.

1429~~~
And thats why he is paid more than 99% of the population, if he cant do what the job entails he should be dropped until he can.

1430~~~
lol what? I don't see any other player in the top flight who is supposed to be in Rooney's class play like a pub player as often as Rooney does.

1431~~~
Well he has two matches this week to prove he is still top striker. Give him chance against Brugge and Newcastle but if he doesn't deliver in this two matches, against arguably not the best teams we will play this season, then we can start to doubt about his ability.

And just for a comparison, Diego Costa didn't looked any better than Rooney in his last two matches....

1432~~~
Where shall I look for how long his slump has gone on for? This is your point to make, not mine. Show me this fabled slump. I think Van Gaal's comment was absolutely spot on, the media howled for him to be selected as a striker and then after two games they are saying he should be dropped. 

Again my entire argument is still encompassed by the fact that Rooney has never played this type of hold up striker role in a possession system, I still maintain that if you turn the wingers back out and give them free reign and take away their defensive opportunities we will get much better real estate in the opposition third. Two touches in two games in the box, I am not exactly sure how to quantify that without taking into account that no ball is reaching him. Both equations have little to do with his all round game, I mean he can't get the ball and try to run into the box every time? I have no idea how he is supposed to spin gold from cow dung here.

1433~~~
Speechless

1434~~~
Yeah, that's not what I said. Re-read my post.

1435~~~
Agree with this. His in form games these last couple of years aren't of the highest quality and simply cannot justify his selection when he's slumping like this.

1436~~~
This conversation is going the Falcao way

People who believe that this is a slump in form after playing all around the field in last few seasons and that he could be good with consistent games as striker

People who believe that he is beyond repair and gone for good.

As of now, I still think he is capable of a good season (not Aguero type of season though) if played up front more often.

1437~~~
Really no point in keeping Chico because the only time he'll get any minutes is if Rooney is injured or suspended - as he is undroppable and apparently unsubbable now however badly he plays

1438~~~
Sorry Pogue, was in a hurry and couldn't type much. What I was trying to get across is that shouldn't pro players have a far higher minimum standard? I know they have off days when they struggle but you don't see any other player mishit passes and miscontrol balls as much as he does in a single game for a stretch of time.

1439~~~
2nd game in lads

1440~~~
As mentioned repeatedly through this thread this is about more than those two games and the preseason. His poor performances span much longer than that.

1441~~~
Dunno about his passing but yes, when he's not playing well his touch is terrible. I'm not sure how it compares with other players, though, because I don't pay as much attention to them. Although touch does seem to be the first thing to go for strikers like Lukaku, Benteke and Costa when they're having a shocker.

1442~~~
Yep but it's a new season and any poor football his played before is irrelevant to now

1443~~~
Not if it's a genuine decline which it seems to be

1444~~~
Hmm perhaps perhaps.. Hopefully he scores 4 against Brugge

1445~~~
Missed the game at the weekend due to holidays so just catching up on it now, I'm 52 minutes in and I'm not sure he's placed one pass that reached its target, his touch is awful and he's doing little or no running whatsoever.. embarrassing performance.

1446~~~
I wouldn't bother with the last 38 <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1447~~~
I hope he scores today, it would surely help his confidence. Judgmental eyes will be on him so I hope he can raise his game. Its over to you Roo to turn it around.

1448~~~
If he does not score tonight even if he has a great game I think more pressure will be on him, hope he does it will help him and us in the long run.

1449~~~
Really hope he scores.

1450~~~
Hoping for a stormer from him today, he needs to start getting used to this role already.

1451~~~
Don't get some of the criticism he got in the match thread. Easily his best performance of the season so far. Has got his touch back and has looked lively. Lovely ball to Memphis for the chance which he should have finished.

1452~~~
Better from him in comparison to previous matches but still so shit in general.

1453~~~
Looks better than he has so far this season, not that that would be particulary hard.

Think he's got a goal in him this game though and hope he shows he's good enough to lead the line for us this season.

1454~~~
He's just so negative. Don't know why Michael Owen is so far up his ass either. Always has his back to goal and looks to play it backwards, but I guess his pass success rate can stay high if he does that. His take on in the end with the lack of finesse and heavy touch sums him up really. Sluggish

1455~~~
He's really starting to look finished

1456~~~
His pass to Memphis making it one on one was magnificent. Memphis should have finish this one rather than trying a pass, that would give Wayne an assist and boost of confidence.

1457~~~
Not that it's difficult to improve on how poor he's been all season but he doesn't look woeful tonight. Good ball to Memphis where he should have sored.

1458~~~
Nothing shit about his performance tonight. He's been good albeit not exceptional. Should have had an assist too.

1459~~~
Emile Heskey had the odd good game - right now I'd sign him

1460~~~
He's been shit. No point dressing it up just because he's been marginally better than in previous games.

1461~~~
Much better, but he drops so ridiculously deep at times when we're in possession in Brugge's half for someone who's supposed to be leading the line.

1462~~~
Much better than Villa and Spurs. Not saying much, but I believe he'll be back on track soon enough

1463~~~
Good <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Memphis has been good. Rooney's been well, average. Useless as a striker.

1464~~~
I'm sorry but I cannot agree with this, he's sluggish. One good pass in an entire half doesn't satisfy me. This guy used to be and is supposed to be the team's heartbeat.

1465~~~
He's been better than he was at Villa to be fair to him. I agree with <a class="username" data-user="77755, @Jed I. Knight" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77755/">@Jed I. Knight</a> that he's dropping deep far too deep for my liking, but maybe that's an instruction? Also, that foul throw. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1466~~~
He has been ordinary.

He should be standing out in this attack really

1467~~~
Yeah Januzaj and him are too close.

1468~~~
You have very high standards if Memphis has been just "good" so your average seems to be my good. 

He looked very sluggish to me in both the league games but hasn't looked sluggish tonight. His touch for instance looks much better. Should stay higher up ideally. 

He isn't good enough anymore to be our heartbeat imo btw.

1469~~~
Also whoever said he drops too deep is spot on, his instincts are that of a 10. He wants to be involved too much when we may need a focal point up front.

1470~~~
Playing well, his movement is creating space for when Memphis wants to cut inside, made a couple of good runs that weren't picked out.
Having a good game thus far

1471~~~
Been shit once again and this is vs a team happy to play a high line and leave ridiculous amounts of space. He's ready for the MLS.

1472~~~
He's gone from 1/10 (Spurs), to 0/10 (Villa), to 3/10 (Bruge) so I suppose that's improvement.

1473~~~
I agree with this. I think there's a good chance he will get a goal in the second half, and hopefully kick on from there. Rooney's not quite a player that deserves his 300k per week and undroppable captain stature nowadays but I'd take him scoring 20-25 goals for us this season while keeping things simple in our build up plays.

1474~~~
Definitely. He needs to watch old videos of how Van Nistelrooy used to play for us. Simple lay off, turn and immediately run towards the opposition goal.

1475~~~
Yup, I said so in my post too. Should be staying higher up.

1476~~~
You can't really level that at Rooney though if that's what LVG wants him to do.

1477~~~
I still wished Manchester United had signed Benteke last summer. Beside Rooney needing proper competition, his hold up play and intelligent flicks would have been so beneficial to our team overall play. Some can argue that Fellaini can be a target man upfront in a somewhat similar manner, but he is not a natural striker nor does he have the proper footballing ability to fit in that role. Anyway, since that is in the past, hopefully eventually we will find a striker like that plus more. Or a striker that excels in a different facet of his game like pace and greater technical ability.

1478~~~
Touch has been so much better tonight

1479~~~
He's much improved tonight but badly needs to get into better positions in and around the box, specifically in the box.

1480~~~
Improving.

1481~~~
Could've been a class assist right there. Memphis has ruined Rooney's night

1482~~~
Yep.

1483~~~
That pass to Depay was magical <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1484~~~
Better today, still doesn't look like a threat in his own right but at least he is contributing for others.

1485~~~
Rooney is a CF not a striker.  His movement everywhere makes out attack not have a focal point.  Was really the media who influenced van gaal at all then i really hope we put him back where he belongs behind the central striker. 

Hernandez has given us that centrality in a heartbeat.

1486~~~
I kind of think he's at his best when he has high tempo, intelligent attackers by his side, could see Pedro and Depay potentially bringing the best out of him honestly.

1487~~~
Januzaj 2 games, 1 goal
Depay 3 games, 2 goals
Fellaini 1 game, 1 goal
Rooney 3 games, no goals

No point dressing it up. We're not a worse team without him at the moment. I'd rather see Chicha given a chance up front even if it means dropping Mata to accommodate Rooney.

1488~~~
Much better but still a complete weak link. 

We really need to be looking at other options.

1489~~~
He's garbage. Hernandez with his pace and movement is a better option than him.

1490~~~
So fecking hard to understand this guy. Can't control ball for shit and then you've got that layoff to Depay which is pure masterclass when it comes to first touch or that fantastic cross-field pass to Mata I think.

1491~~~
9 games now without a goal I think.

1492~~~
Much better in the second half. That touch to set up Depay was absolute class.

1493~~~
Much improved over Villa and Spurs. Started slowly, but then became increasingly influential, and was linking well with Depay.

A bit more fitness to build up perhaps, but I think there's life in the old dog yet.

1494~~~
Fellaini will get the best out of Rooney. Rooney plays better next to another forward who has good hold up play. However, that will only hid his apparent decline.

1495~~~
He will score against N'castle and you can quote me on that

1496~~~
Some moments of sheer class to be fair, those bad passes and touches do annoy me. But this was better.

1497~~~
Very good in that second half and should have had a beautiful assist. The only one in our attack who should be dropped after tonight is Januzaj.

1498~~~
If he can't score against these muppets....

I'd honestly prefer we give Fellaini a go up front if we don't manage to sign a new striker

1499~~~
He was only semi-gash tonight

1500~~~
Looked better as the game went on.

1501~~~
He was better of course, but the big fan that I am I realise that he's best days are behind him.

1502~~~
And then go another 5+ games without a goal.

1503~~~
He's earnt a stay of execution after that performance, he was decent enough and could've bagged himself some assists to be fair. Deserves another start on the back of that game.

1504~~~
Vast improvement over the last few games.

That said, he has that “no threat” aura all over him.

1505~~~
Better than against Villa, still pretty shit. He does 2 things right and 10 things wrong at the moment. Fellaini needs 10 minutes to score, Chicha also looked more dangerous than him.

1506~~~
Better than against Villa, still pretty shit. He does 2 things right and 10 things wrong at the moment. Fellaini needs 10 minutes to score, Chicha also looked more dangerous than him.

1507~~~
Slightly better today.. his flick to Depay was brilliant but overall he wasn't that good. We really need to bring in another striker. If not to put him on the bench then at least pushing him. He's probably past his peak but he's still got more then this to give I'm sure. I do think we are looking for a striker, I just can't see a reason for letting van Persie go otherwise.

1508~~~
He wasn't good today. Gave the ball away ample times and wasn't a threat at all.

1509~~~
Rooney will find his form...I've no doubt...He's been utter piss but he always takes much longer than any other players in the team to find his fitness and sharpness

1510~~~
Getting better

Was far from shit

1511~~~
Thought he did well actually. Good passing throughout, looked fitter then the last game, and linked well with others. Still far from his best but definitely not shit either. Hopefully he bags a few vs Newcastle to get his confidence back

1512~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1513~~~
A more encouraging display. The ball actually stuck to him a few times, some of his passing was good and he genuinely seemed to try his hardest. You could tell he wanted a goal tonight and it would have been interesting to see what effect that would have had on his game.

Still anathema to a lot of our build up and interplay but he actually contributed to the creation of a few good moves/moments unlike the first two games.

I think the openness of the match made it much more his sort of game in the second half.

1514~~~
I thought he was decent overall. Miles better than the Villa display.

1515~~~
That's the thing though. One performance where he wasn't as shit as he was in the last match shouldn't be earning him another chance when he's been consistently crap. We can't let his woeful performances lower the bar for what we expect of a striker.

1516~~~
Like I wrote in the matchday thread; if you judge a performance solely on end product then Rooney was by all accounts poor again. Bar his beautiful flick not much came off for him tonight. However, instead of being pissed at his performance I actually felt sorry for him. Because you cannot fault his effort tonight. He was heavily involved at times which was pleasing. 

I think he really appreciated that standing ovation.

1517~~~
We sold RVP and Falcao and haven't brought in a new striker on the back of Rooney telling LVG he can be the main man and get us the goals this season. Captain, highest paid player, undroppable. He has to start showing it, and consistently.

1518~~~
He's coming back to form, poor first half but good 2nd.

1519~~~
Looked much better tonight compared to the other games this season. We all know he's a slow starter and needs some games before he gets into his best he has been like this as long as hes been at United so I don't understand why people want him to be dropped only after a few games.

1520~~~
He's getting there, slowly and steadily. Better performance today than Villa away. Unlucky not to have an assist for the Memphis chance in the second half.

He's getting better.

1521~~~
Much better tonight. Still a bit inconsistent but set up some great chances . Hopefully he bags a goal or two against Newcastle to ease off the pressure.

1522~~~
He just slows things down too much.

1523~~~
Looks like he needs to take a sabbatical.

1524~~~
Usually takes him four or fives games after a break from football, as Fergie <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/manchester-united/story/1590585/sir-alex-ferguson-says-wayne-rooney-has-fitness-issues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">once said</a>.

At nearly 30, this might be the time when he does actually start to decline - that's just natural for 99% of footballers (and the people who've been saying he's 'in decline' since he was 24 will be like 'Told ya!').

But i'm not yet convinced that he's currently as far gone as some think.

1525~~~
Massive improvement tonight, but he still doesn't even look close to ever scoring. As our main striker I don't care how decent he looks, if he's not scoring or looking like scoring something needs to be done

1526~~~
He was decent and improved from last performance but that was always going to happen. Few good moments and few bad moments, but the most important things are still not there even against weak opponents - his hold up play was average again(not bad but not great either), and he barely showed any goal threat.

1527~~~
Looked better tonight. Hope he can find a goal as soon as possible to get some confidence. It helped though that Bruges at least tried to have a go at us and didn't park the bus for 90 minutes. The extra space was good for him but I'm afraid he won't get that in the PL a lot.

1528~~~
I posted this the other day, and feel it may be relevant after tonight. Rooney was much better tonight, and credit to him for that. His touch for Memphis was a worldy, he did a similar one against PSG in pre-season, but Memphis wasn't up to speed. Overall, I'd say he was a 6 tonight, and I'm not sure if he will play too much better than he did tonight, although to be fair to him, that same performance with a goal would be considered a very good one.

He's clearly lost a lot, and is not perfect,  but if he absolutely must play, then I guess I can take performances like that, littered with the odd goal here and there. The attack will move up a level next summer hopefully if we can  add a better striker though.

1529~~~
meh

1530~~~
Much better tonight, hope he gets his goals on Saturday.

1531~~~
Was better tonight. Played some nice passes, more notably the two to Memphis (back heel, outside foot pass), and touches were better. Still looks a bit low on confidence, but hopefully a goal against Newcastle will change that.

1532~~~
Less bad. Not good, but at least made progressive today and didn't look quite so rusty. Still looks like the speed/quickness decline is terminal.

1533~~~
Better but still not good enough. 

When Memphis runs at defenders you feel something is going to happen, at the moment when Rooney does it you don't. He has no threat about him.

1534~~~
He was indeed better, no denying that. He was still not good enough though, however the improvement is promising. A goal on Saturday and a fully flying Rooney along with Pedro and we could mount a serious title challenge

1535~~~
Ok in the first half, very good in the second half. Hope he builds on from this.

The pass to Memphis <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1536~~~
No shots on target.  The flick was good, but he doesn't even look like a threat, let alone score.

1537~~~
I agree. His tank hasn't dried out, it just needs a bit of time to get started. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1538~~~
Knowing Rooney, the moment he finally comes good he will get injured shortly after and we will be back at square one.

Signs of life at times tonight, still not good enough though.

1539~~~
300k a week. He should go on runs of 6-7 goals in 8 games but all we get us oh that flick to Memphis is the 57th minute was nice I suppose.

1540~~~
Rubbish in the first half, a lot better in the second

1541~~~
Had some sloppy moments and some good ones so a step up from the last two games even if the opposition was a couple of steps down.

1542~~~
He made a good effort tonight I thought with a few good moments. Obviously needs to score but no complaints with his effort tonight. Let's hope he scores against Newcastle.

1543~~~
I'm one of his biggest critics and I agree he shouldn't be playing for us if I had my way but in the situation we are in, he was at least creative today so he lives to fight another day in my book.

1544~~~
needs a goal...the weight of pressure is firmly on his shoulders..

1545~~~
Typically on this forum, he'd have received less abuse had Memphis scored after Rooney' lovely touch. 

It was an improvement, which I guess wasn't a hard task in the first place. Still people are making out as if he did nothing at all. Some better touches tonight and held the ball up a lot more. Think it will do him wonders if Memphis suddenly becomes "THE" player to watch.

1546~~~
Much improved performance, his touch was far more assured and wasn't sloppy with the ball. Didn't get any shots on target but, was making the right runs, just ball wasn't getting to him. Good effort with his left, needs a bit more of that.

Think most of us have to start getting used to the fact that our striker is not going to have that many chances in this system - that he actually got on the ball that much is a good thing, especially if you think about how little RVP/Falcao saw the ball last year. Hopefully will see an even better game from him Saturday with a goal, that might calm things down a bit.

1547~~~
He will score against Newcastle..

1548~~~
Much better than Villa. Unfortunately, still not good enough. Chicharito showed much more in his cameo than Rooney's done in any 15 minute spell during the season.

1549~~~
Surely that volley that the guy on the line cleared for a corner has to count as a shot on goal?

1550~~~
Cant be bother to look for my post in match thread but in short,i find Rooney being bored to death in this way of play,if he does not drop deep to touch a ball,he goes in sleep walking mode.

1551~~~
I think that too..the pressure on him to be the man and provides the goals wears down on him..see some of his England perfomances..if he is less of the focus..it would help him a lot.

1552~~~
I wonder if an injury would be a blessing in disguise... you can't wish for that, but it would make things really interesting.

1553~~~
Interestingly we've never won the league when Rooney has ended up our top goal scorer, it's always been someone else that has been "the man" in those seasons.

1554~~~
Just subbed him out of my ff team so pretty much nailed on for a hat trick at weekend

1555~~~
Probably a sign of how bad he's been both this season and the final part of last season,  that today was his best game for Utd in a long long time. Even then it was no better than average really.

The backheel was lovely though. Shame Memphis missed that, would have been a goal replayed for years.

1556~~~
That backheel is up there with *THAT* touch against Sunderland from Falcao....

1557~~~
Another bad game from him, one moment of genius though

1558~~~
He could have been subbed off with 3 assists today had his teammates finished his chances that he created. His hold up play improved as well as his touch. Still had some pretty bad moments but at least he is getting better. I think we may get a goal from him when we play Newcastle.

1559~~~
I won't lie. I really do dislike him as a person and as a player and currently cannot wait for the day he is gone from this club.

He was alright tonight though and a big improvement on his Villa performance. Hopefully the road uphill continues without the now regular dips in form where he performs like a 'drunken leper' (Credit to a poster above <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>). More consistency, flicks/link up play like the one today plus a steady steam of goals and I might just open my mind to him deserving his place in the team. It's really not that much to ask from someone on 300k a week and the leading striker of a team challenging on all fronts, is it? I'd much rather him have a cracker of a season and be proved wrong than him having a stinker and affecting our chances at silverware. There's no 'agenda' to it, as some of here love to call out people for apparently possessing.

1560~~~
Remember that mate who said he saw a white Pele? He should get his glasses sorted out.

1561~~~
I concur. *thumbs up*

1562~~~
Much better last night. Still has to improve a lot if he is to lead the line, though.

1563~~~
It's only a matter of time now and he'll start firing on all cylinders. The signs were there last night.

1564~~~
Playing much better last night., marvelous touch for memphis, but still not involved much.  Seems the teams are still reluctant to pass to him or was it just me. 

Hope he can keep this up now that he knows his position is not safe with januzaj and memphis in the team

1565~~~
Thought we was pretty good overall. Played Memphis through in the first half and that lovely backheel in the 2nd half. Also, played an absurdly good long pass to Mata in the 2nd half. Needs a goal though for his own confidence if nothing else.

1566~~~
Wouldn't say much better. It was slightly better but doesn't look like an attacking threat what so ever. We need a top class striker in if we are to win trophies.

1567~~~
We could just make memphis one, and put young. Couldn't be much worse in the net output department

1568~~~
Almost got as good as average last night, which given the wankery that has been served up lately is a vast improvement. 

Ive said it before and Ill say it again, I honestly think he is mentally weak, when the pressure or focus is entirely on him his play suffers. He is not a becks, Keane Ronaldo or Cantona who thrives under pressure.

1569~~~
If you guys signed a top class striker, and maybe a CB to partner Smalling, you could challenge for the title again.

1570~~~
He was better last night, but I have to agree with the general consensus, he still wasn't great.

Don't think playing him in different positions last season has helped. He seems to be all over the pitch at the moment trying to get involved. Given that he's operating as our lone striker, I'd like to see him camp out up top and be in the box whenever the ball is out wide. He needs to go back to the goal-poaching, header-scoring, always-looking-to-score Rooney of old.

1571~~~
Ofcourse.

1572~~~
I just think it is hard playing as a lone striker in Van Gaal's system because you don't get a lot of time on the ball. RVP and Falcao struggled with it as well.

Rooney has been down this road before when Queiroz had him sticking to a disciplined role up top after Ronaldo left.

He scored over 30 goals that season if my memory serves, but he was campaigning to have a second striker role and unhappy despite the goal tally.

This system is a bit different in that there isn't the approach of wingers barraging the penalty area with crosses to get onto.

Memphis and Mata have been more about build up play.

As I see it, Rooney's discipline will find space for the others to exploit. 

If Depay, Januzaj and Mata start scoring enough goals, then the opposition will have to use their CBs to deal with that threat instead of suffocating the lone striker. When that happens Rooney will have the space to get goals and operate freely again.

It's a process as Van Gaal would say. For now Rooney is occupying defenders which should open things up for the rest of our attackers.

1573~~~
Hes always been that way, at left back one minute, upfront the next, in previous systems it was a strength, in this one he needs to be more positionally disciplined

1574~~~
Querioz? 

Strange as you must have been there at training. Because he was gone a year before Ronaldo left. 

So I don't know what he had to do with Rooney as striker in 09/10.

1575~~~
Seemed to have license to drop deeper and get involved more. He is best as a #10 and his best moments were playing there

1576~~~

1577~~~
He's not getting as many touches as he likes, because when he does get it he's been really sloppy. 

Hoping its just his usual early season dodgy form but I can't help feel its more than that. Hope he proves me wrong.

1578~~~
Can't help falling back on a supporting role ,where he looked more comfortable.

1579~~~
Grew into the game I thought, was better in the second half.

1580~~~
Beautiful touch for the Memphis chance but still just decent overall, and a poor team. He's fine generally helping the team out here and there but he simply doesn't look a Manchester United centre forward at all, right now. Either he bucks up or were in trouble this season. In fact Hernandez's movement impressed me more when he came on. Rooney plays more like a supporting number 10 to me.

Hope he bags a couple against Newcastle which elevates his whole game.

1581~~~
I think Rooney may end up with 15-20  assists instead of goals ...

1582~~~
A bad start to the season and people on the Caf are saying ''Play Hernandez can't be much worse'' or such things like ''Gash as usual"

Are people bored of him or something? Seeing him up there again do people just want someone new now? Let's be honest last Summer if we had signed a proven international to play in the 10 role or even deeper (as Rooney did) and this player scored 14 goals and made many more (as Rooney did) they would be getting wanked dry by people on here. It's just because it's Rooney and we are so used to his quality and he isn't as good as he once was (which was one of the top Footballers in the world) that he gets such little praise.

Maybe people on here still haven't forgiven his two transfer requests.

1583~~~
He played striker at the beginning at end of the season.  The ending for even a decent while.

1584~~~
You know i might be wrong but Rooney looks so bored in that role,that if Berbatov was in his place,he would be "Is this how heaven looks like?"

1585~~~
Ok we know Rooney is going to have no serious competition and will not be dropped by LVG, basically stinking the place up with his pathetic first touches and scoring a couple of goals here and there to keep the "Rooney is great" bandwagon chugging along.

1586~~~
'I've had one bad game this season and every ones all over it' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I really don't like this attitude. He's been bad ever since the Tottenham game last season and thought there were some good signs last night but it disappoints me that he doesn't have the balls to just accept he's been bad for a while hence the maybe slightly OTT criticism against Villa because that was just about as bad as it could get. Instead of downplaying his wank performances; I would have much rather seen a more honest reflection of himself and slightly more 'fight' and motivation to overcome this bad patch in form. It's just like he's trying to get everyone off his back. To be honest I don't care as long as he really does step up his game but if he carries on playing with such inconsistency and makes excuses like the one above, he should be gone.

1587~~~

1588~~~
Some interesting quotes in the article <a class="username" data-user="56404, @#07" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56404/">@#07</a> 

Rooney directly addresses the criticism.

1589~~~
Seems quite poor self reflection, he has been average at best since Tottenham home (last season), it isnt just goals, his whole play has just been below standard most of the time.

1590~~~
I find this quote fitting

1591~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wayne-rooney-confident-can-still-9886864" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wayne-rooney-confident-can-still-9886864</a>

1592~~~
Don't get the excessive Rooney criticism. 

He may not have not started well enough, and putting aside any fan grievances for off the pitch antics from yesteryear,  his career record and talents deserve our faith and support?

1593~~~
The problem with Rooney goes beyond just scoring goals.

1594~~~
He's not had "one bad game." True, that Villa game is why Twitter was all over him, and also why even some of his staunchiest supporters have admitted he was terrible, but people who have been critical of him in the past  have been questioning his awful bottom level and why he always seem to struggle with form more than any top player should. With a contract like his, and the captaincy to go along with it, some of us who grew up watching players like Keane, Beckham, Ronaldo etc expect a certain sort of standard.

1595~~~
Never mind them. Compare him to other strikers in the league. None of them play like pub players as often as he does on their off days.

1596~~~
On his bottom level, he is actually one of the worst players in the league. On his top level, he is world class but that top level has come far too short lived and far inbetween in the last two seasons. As you said, there is literally no other striker, playing for a top team, out there who suffers from such inconsistency as does Rooney. It is simply not acceptable for someone of his calibre to go missing for 6 or so games at a time and negatively affect our attacking play to the point he does when in those patches of form. It wouldn't be that bad if he wasn't untouchable in both seasons either.

1597~~~
a bit of an improvement but he desperately needs to score to get his game and confidence back.

newcastle at home, if he can't get a goal in this game then...<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1598~~~
I remember god awful performances from the three players you mentioned over their career, Ronaldo especially, its as if people forget the first three years of him falling over his own tricks and giving the ball away.  Keano was as liable to be sent off as much as having an inspiring performance and after his hip surgery was practically a passenger to the rest of the team from 2003 onwards.

1599~~~
No where near as frequent as Rooneys god awful performances and his bottom level is also a lot further down than any of them. As for your bit on Ronaldo; well go figure! He was 8 years younger than Rooney and in the stage where most players haven't developed their game yet. You're really going to use the performances of an 18-21 year old ronaldo to jusify Rooneys recently frequent bad performances at the age of 29 where he should be in the peak of his career? That's not even to mention Ronaldo wasn't captain of the team and earning no where near 300k a week.

1600~~~
I have problems with people who launch that statement, on a very good day everyone can be world class. Kevin Phillips once scored 30 goals with Sunderland, O'Shea once nutmegs Figo, and Gibson scores a screamer, but it's what you do week in week out that counts, one good game or one good run of 5 good games is not enough to label someone world class.

1601~~~
I agree mate, I was just trying to appease the Rooney fanboys by admitting that he is capable of world class moments. Maybe a better explanation would have been 'On his top level, which comes around once every 10 games or so in the previous two seasons or when close to a possible contract renewal, he is world class.

1602~~~
<i>'I've had one bad game this season and every ones all over it</i>' <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>
What a disappointing statement. He's got no self-awareness I don't think...and still he will be shoehorned into the team if he can't cut it in his current position. 

Just think about this - Memphis scores 2 goals and gets an assist, yet he's disappointed as hell not to have done better. Compare that attitude to what Rooney is saying here. 

Rooney<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1603~~~
well he got subsituted when we needed a goal....ill take that as some sort of progress on lvg's part

1604~~~
He hasn't had one good game. Hopefully he does on Saturday.

1605~~~

1606~~~
So Rooney is critisized for understanding the criticism he's received an admitted he's been below par. 

I'm done.

1607~~~
basically he will be critized continuosly while he's playing bad. That's fair and square. 

We give extra leeway and patience to players who knuckle down and keep their head down and work hard, I personally believe if Wayne didn't critized us for wanting of a better contract he deserves that extra loyalty and patience from the fans, but the day he crossed the line he's just a well paid players in my eyes, and he better perform or out.

He didn't hesitate using that line with us before "match my ambition or i'm gone", time to return the favor, and it's not even vengeful, it's just how professional work. You perform we pay, you no perform we no pay

1608~~~
LOL. This thread is quite hilarious, it has almost become a fashion statement to veil the credit for Rooney with just the right amount of negativity so as not to be hunted down and hung as some sort of Rooney lover. Jesus christ he had a pretty good game and we still have people trying in desperation to paint him as eternally shit. I don't think I will ever understand it, fans of your own club who have more desire to hope a player is shit than enjoy when a player is not.

I now have no idea what it will be like if Rooney returns to some sort of vein of form. People won't know what to do with themselves.
And with that, goes your credibility in this thread.

1609~~~
That isn't what I'm referring to though. People are critisizing THE WAY he discussed how low standards this season. 

The guy can't win.

1610~~~
He can win if he wants, just perform and there's nothing to critize him. That's all he can do. 

He critized us for not even a bad season don't he?

1611~~~
And all he can do right now is accept the critisizm, while he can't play (the game is Saturday, can't show himself until then). Which he has done. 

Fine, critisize his performances so far. That's perfectly fine. But surely you see what I'm saying here. People are being negative at Rooney FOR his quotes about accepting critisizm. 

It's like a dog grabbing the newspaper off the floor, carrying it in his mouth, bringing it to his owner to read, and then gets a bollocking for getting slobber all over the paper.

1612~~~
I wouldn't say there's no personal bias against Rooney, there's absolutely some sort of bias taking part. But he's at a point where there's little defence left, he is playing that bad, and bias or no bias there's no denying that he has been shit in that 2 games. 

Football fans are just humans, there are players like Anderson that people love and they keep on having that favoritism (up to a point) in judging him, ditto with almost every one of our players, Rooney just take more flak because of the contract fiasco. Right or wrong is another debate, but yeah... i supposed none of us can be 100% non-bias in judging his performance.

1613~~~
He was poor against Spurs (like everyone else was) and was awful against Villa - wasn't great against Brugge, but I didn't think he was bad either. I'm glad he has admitted that he was poor - if he knows this can works harder to make things happens, that's all that I want. We've all seen what he can do - so if he can turn it around, I'd be delighted. As many have said, it's not always easy playing as a lone striker.

1614~~~
"One bad game?" he's been wank since the 3-0 Tottenham win, that's like 15 games and at least 3-4 of those performances would embarrass even a Sunday league player. Yet the fanbois will tell you that he gets criticized only because he's Wayne Rooney...

The funny thing is that people don't even have high expectations of him, just look at Tuesday's game, his performance was average at best but people were generally pleased, or at least they were not displeased.

1615~~~
He hasn't scored in 8 games, and not an away goal in like 16? If that's the striker who's supposed to fire us to titles then I do worry. He's obviously been a legend for us over the years but it really is a big season for him. If he's average again this season we definitely need to move him on I think.

1616~~~
At least the myth he's undropable has been busted.

1617~~~
Don't you know we haven't created enough for him? Wish our midfield was better. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1618~~~
Yeah, that great touch, just like Falcao's great touch against Sunderland <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

He's been below par for ages, good to see he's acknowledged some of it. except it's been a lot more than just 1 game Wayne.

1619~~~
He was really poor towards the end of last season too, even when we went on that great run he was pretty awful for most of it. Especially at Anfield where he put in his typical shite Anfield performance.

It's definitely more than just one bad game. I'd hope privately he knows that.

1620~~~
You're really going to compare 29 year old Rooney performances to an 18-21 year old kid and an aged 34 year old who underwent hip surgery to defend Rooney here?

From 27-29 Roy Keane was putting up constant 8s and 9s in performances and I don't need to tell you what Ronaldo has done recently either.

Also, Keane held the club up to ransom over his wages over that time period, and you didn't see many complain because we all thought he was worth every penny for what he brought to the team. Personally for me, there's no vendetta against Rooney for his contract dispute. Or there wouldn't be, if he wasn't so bloody inconsistent and below par.

1621~~~
Good post.
The English fans and press are way too easy on him.

1622~~~
ala Valencia

1623~~~
No one would bring up his wages if he was playing well..Messi and Ronaldo are on ridiculous wages too..but no one hardly ever mentions that..its the wage relative to the perfomance that brings up the complaint

1624~~~
You must be kidding, mate. I pretty much gave up posting any serious criticism of Rooney because of the utterly inevitable backlash, ranging from 'You <i>obviously</i> know nothing about football' to 'How dare you disrespect our captain, talisman, hero etc etc!' Until very recently, the 'hunt' has been directed towards Rooney's critics, <i>not</i> his defenders.

1625~~~
Its gotten better now..but you still get the random poster bringing up stats from 5 years ago on why his perfomance in the last game isnt so bad..

1626~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11810286/Manchester-United-vs-Club-Brugge-Five-things-we-learned.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ed-vs-Club-Brugge-Five-things-we-learned.html</a>

Think this article nails it for me, he just doesn't have the intelligence to be able to play a specific position and too often is too far from where he should be when a cross or pass comes into the box.

1627~~~
Which game was he dropped for?

1628~~~
He was subbed vs Brugge, that's what I meant.

1629~~~
Those are obviously not the same thing <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> It is a positive sign though that Van Gaal will at least bring him off. When he actually doesn't start because of his form then that myth is busted.

1630~~~
He wasn't great for most of SAF's last season. He was poor during Moyes' reign. He was mediocre to poor (mainly poor) in LvG's first season. We've had 3 years of his apathetic performances. It's time to move him on, the sooner the better, and reinvest that money in a Lewandowski, or Benzema.

He is like Gerrard in his last couple of seasons for Liverpool.

1631~~~
Ok but I think people seriously thought LVG will never sub Rooney even if he's playing poorly.

1632~~~
Credit to him for fronting up to his critics. I think he knew that the Villa performance had crossed a line as a new level of poor, and had to be acknowledged.

It is perhaps a bit concerning that he feels that other than the Villa game, his performances have generally been up to standard though. If he feels the way he played at the back end of last season was fine, or so far this season, I struggle to see how he expects that to be good enough to deliver on his target of 20+ goals. It is a period that has not only yielded no goals, but very, very few attempts either. Some of that could be put down to creativity perhaps, but this period also coincided with our much talked about return to form and attacking zest, so he could perhaps have done better.

He'll get his 16 or so this season, I have little doubt. He's no 25 goal striker though.

1633~~~
Ok, fair points.  So Rooney being 19 goals off being United's all time goal scorer at 29, in potentially 200+ games quicker than Charlton doesn't buy him any sympathy / patience?  Staying at the club when Ferguson simply had no intent of improving the squad with any signings of substance doesn't buy him a little bit of understanding?  We all know he's capable, its two games into the season, he was our top scorer last year and played anywhere the manager asked him.  To jump on his back for not playing at 100% every game is unfair.  And I'd say that for any of United's players.

1634~~~
Definitely. I think the difference this season is his perceived lack of goals (i say perceived because the season is only a few games old) means he's more vulnerable to criticism now. 

Those of us who have been critical of him in the past have often bemoaned his all round plays, even with the goals he's scored. An Arsenal supporting friend of mine who doesn't watch United often wondered why I was complaining about Rooney when he was on the score sheets every other week. 

I still think he'll score his minimum share of goals and that's good enough for me until he leaves the club.

1635~~~
I know I said I didn't have a vendetta against Rooney for his contract dispute, but after that first contract dispute, sentimentality plays no part in my views on him as a Manchester United player. We pay him top dollar so he has to provide top performances, as far as I'm concerned. 

He scored that wonder goal vs City just after the contract dispute was settled and all I thought of when celebrating was "yeah, for questioning Fergie's and the club's ambitions and earning how much you're earning, that's the least you can do you cnut." 

It's taken a bit of enjoyment out for me personally to be honest, and I quite resent him for that.

People might say I'm being precious and so on, but I grew up watching people like the Nevilles and Scholes etc, players who are United through and through, who have no agents, etc so I'm inclined to feel a certain way about the club.

So no, sentimentality doesn't play a part in how I'm judging Wayne Rooney.

1636~~~
Charlton was a midfielder though..so the 200 games thing is contentious at best..a fairer comparison would be perhaps RVN in the modern era, who had 150 goals in 219 games ..His goal tally is very good though, but we arent judging him on that here..we are judging him on the here and now..Rooney has perfomed like what one would expect from a United striker in the past, and that has been appreciated..He is not performing at all like one now..and for that is not good for the club...I think the club's ambition should come first..and thats what most people's concern will rightly be...

1637~~~
I think a while back there was a fairly similar article about him under Moyes. They also critiqued that Rooney was always getting in the way while trying to do the job of everyone else on the field. Another thing is that I remember RvP not too long ago was complaining about the fact that there was always someone getting into the space that he was used to playing and while he didn't name Rooney I'm pretty sure he was meant, considering that they had to form some sort of striker partnership. That btw was another thing I saw pointed out in a very good article, that Rooney was incapable of forming a good partnership with any of the strikers on the team, not with RvP, not with Chicharito and not with Falcao.

I know Rooney has been a long time servant here and deserves a lot of respect for it but if he is the one holding us back from having some fluid attacking play again because he is constantly getting in the way of things and trying to do everything by himself we need to consider dropping him even though he is our captain.

1638~~~
Rooney is a hinder to us. Simple as that.

The fact that he is "captain" and is undroppable will stop us playing the formation(s) we NEED to be playing.

He isn't good enough as a striker and he isn't good enough in the #10 role, yet he will definitely be in one of those positions for the forthcoming future.

I don't mean to be harsh, but a long-term injury would be a blessing in disguise. It's practically the only way he will be out the team as Van Gaal is too stubborn to go back on his word.

1639~~~
I dont really rate him, but it remains to be seen if Chicha (looked lively) or Wilson are any better.

1640~~~
One bad game ? Probably just a political statement but if he really believe that, he's fecked .

1641~~~
If Rooney was poor during the Moyes' reign then I dread to think what other players were considering he was our best outfield player.

And yeah, just go and take Lewandowski or Benzema, like it's that easy. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1642~~~
By that logic, so does yours if you really like him as a person and a footballer, which you evidently do. feck off. An opinion is an opinion, and I stated within the post of mine you quoted, that I would much rather him have a cracker of a season and be proved wrong than the other way round. Quite convenient of you to leave out the bulk of the post and focus on that line.

He's been crap since Tottenham last season and constantly in and out of form for two seasons. The problem is when he is out of form, he is atrocious, and he is out of form more than any other top footballer out there. Not many people would argue with that fact or that his 'top level' when he does play to it, is world class. The problem is we are seeing far less of that top level in recent years. Obviously I have my concerns. As people have said, there seems to be really low standards of Rooney recently. There was definitely an improvement on the Villa game against Brugge but the flick aside, it was another generally under par performance. With the level of the opponent and their defensive injuries considered, you would have expected our attackers to have a field day against them. Depay certainly did, but Rooney was average except for one or two good moments.

That flick sums up Rooney as a footballer for the past two seasons. Capable of moments of brilliance but they distract from the rest of his declining game and are becoming rarer and rarer.

1643~~~
He wasn't our best outfield player. RvP was (when not injured).

Reinvest - this means money/proceeds/cash freed up from Rooney leaving should be put to a bid for either one of those outlined. It's not that hard to understand that.

1644~~~
Rooney had a decent match v Spurs.

Poor against Villa.

The best of three Tuesday.

1645~~~
This

1646~~~

1647~~~
Headline makes it sound like there are people  within the club who fear Rooney's in permanent decline, but the article says nothing of the sort.

As I said in a previous post - Rooney will soon be 30, and has played an awful lot of football. It's not beyond the realms of possibility that he is starting to decline to the point where he's no longer good enough to be a regular starter for a club with league and Champions League ambitions.

But I still take articles like this with a pinch of salt. They're always based on romanticizing the young Rooney, forgetting that he had plenty of periods of indifferent form (relative to his best standards) in his teens and early 20s; and you see them every time he's not scoring.

In 2006 when he was a <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/james-lawton-whats-wrong-with-wayne-rooney-416589.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mere 20 years</a> old; in 2010 when he was the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/oct/30/javier-hernandez-manchester-united-wayne-rooney" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">grand old age</a> of 25; and in 2012 when he was <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/sep/05/wayne-rooney-best-days-behind-him" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a decrepit</a> 27.

He's been written off more times than George Michael's Range Rover, and always come back to defy the critics. I wouldn't be surprised if he does it this season as well.

1648~~~
Playing him as per his shirt number would be his best position atm. 
For this to work we need a solid # 9. Chicho perhaps. But I think he will be gone.
Wilson..probably a year away.
The fact we are on the lookout for a striker says we will (hope) to be bringing one in this window.

1649~~~
He asked to be played as the striker though and has always maintained that is the position he prefers..We also have far too many players that can play 10, and he's the main no9 in the squad..

I think 10 should be Fellaini when he comes back, he adds an extra dimension both in defence( Will compensate massively for Blind's height) and in attack..plus he has fantastic energy in midfield too..and provides consistent goal scoring ability( Was top scorer at Everton the season before he got here) , things Rooney wont really offer us...that is not to say that Fellaini is better than Rooney, but in this current setup he would offer us more.

1650~~~
and he may well get us the goals from playing as an out and out striker.

If Memphis keeps up what he showed in the last match, Rooney may find more space.
A great player like Rooney does not become crap over a few matches.
I have never measured him based solely on the goals he has scored. He brings a lot more to the team.

1651~~~
He really needs to step up though..for a few years now, I think the goals have masked other issues in his game which without the goals have become highly magnified..Luis Suarez'perfomance against us during the preseason..He didnt score , but that was a brilliant attacking perfomance and ran our defense ragged..thats what we are looking for.

I agree with your post about Memphis, if he can almost bring the attention on himself, the defender's can focus more on him and with his pace and movement could offer avenues for the other fowards. Lets hope that Mempis really kicks on too. The addition of Fellaini really always draws defenders towards( Ho0w can you not as a defender) and I really think he allows the rest of the team to play better..so a front four of

                                      Rooney
                   Memphis                   Mata
                                  Fellaini

1652~~~
No, but he's become crap over a few seasons.

Currently what he brings to the team seems to be a lack of penetration, an inability to hold the ball up, poor movement and some shockingly bad passing.

1653~~~
The thing is though, as you can see from the previous articles you've linked to, it has never been uncommon for Rooney to go on scoring droughts and he generally scores in bursts. As he is our main goal threat this season and Van Gaal has placed all his trust in him we can't really have him going 6+ games without a goal a few times a season. We can't just shrug and say this is how he's always been, he is captain now, gets paid more than anyone else and promised Van Gaal he'd get the goals. He is rightly going to be under huge scrutiny this season.

1654~~~
Tired of him for a while now. Yes i love united, yes i know what he has done over the years. No, i don't trust him anymore.

1655~~~
Football 365:

Number of times Rooney lost possession against Aston Villa: 13

Number of times Rooney lost possession against Brugge: 13

Also...

Rooney has 1 goal in his last 723 competitive minutes for Utd.

1656~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://thefootballosopher.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/mission-impossible-6-finding-rooneys_21.html?m=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thefootballosopher.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/mission-impossible-6-finding-rooneys_21.html?m=1</a>

Good read.

1657~~~
Hoping he bags a couple tomorrow to restore his form and confidence. 

I'm not completely sure whether he can be a top striker again but as things stand we desperately need him to and much of our season's fortunes depend on him.

1658~~~
The thing is he's never been one to really look after himself so it's not surprising he would have an early deterioration. We've just got rid of RvP who was suffering decline, if we have other options come available Rooney won't last long. 

I just hope we don't end up trying to shoehorn him into midfield. Fergie knew the score

1659~~~
Those who live by the sword etc.....

Rooney said "match my ambitions or Im off" so we did.

Now its Utd to say "Match OUR ambitions or you are off"

It works both ways.

1660~~~
Not when he has a contract to 2019 and no other club in their right minds would pay his £250k+ a week wages.

1661~~~
Whack him in the reserves for a month and that shitc*nt of an agent of his would be agitating for a move, I guarantee it.

1662~~~
And is there anyone that would offer anything remotely close to what we pay him? Why would Wayne move somewhere to earn say £120k a week on a 3 year contract when he could earn roughly £300k a week for the next 4 years sat in the reserves.

I think what's more likely, if he has indeed declined, is we'll marginalise him into a squad player and sign a big striker to take his place. If you asked me now I think barring a dramatic dip in form, injuries permitting, we're gearing up to go big on Harry Kane this time next year. City and Chelsea already have Aguero and Costa and Arsenal have less chance than us negotiating with Levy. I can see Wayne being reinstated to the #10 position while Kane beds in as the main striker, then if Rooney declines further he'll be rotated as cover for both roles. All opinion of course.

1663~~~
Oh dear god I hope not!

1664~~~
Can anyone remember when he actually put in a performance?

1665~~~
When he wants a new contract

1666~~~
He had 700 minutes to bag a few, it's not just 2 games

1667~~~
He is not going to be as good as before, he is going to get worse.

1668~~~
I don't disagree, but then he always has been, and is handsomely rewarded for it.

Maybe it's more in hope than expectation that I think there'll be a happy ending to the Wayne Rooney saga.

1669~~~
Are we selling him? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1670~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1671~~~
At least let him break Sir Bobby's record, he's almost there <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1672~~~
Or wait until he is one short and sell him - Fergie and Bobby's revenge for fecking over the club twice <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1673~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Cruel but funny.

1674~~~
He then refuses to go, and spends his time in a non-club suit overseeing the new striker at every home game..i.e a Valdes...

1675~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1676~~~
I seem to be going against Caf consensus here, but I think he had a pretty good first half. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1677~~~
He did have a good half. And a goal.

1678~~~
He was average, his norm has become average.

1679~~~
Standards are so low these days. Almost 14 hours now. An offside goal doesn't count, as close as it was. Needs to stop pissing around dropping deep because it's only helping Newcastle have a comfortable stroll this afternoon.

1680~~~
He wasn't average, he was good, as the rest of the team. But it's the norm here to criticize him whenever.

1681~~~
Exactly.

1682~~~
Doesn't deserve criticism. Not his biggest fan but he was fine. Definitely not the worst.

1683~~~
He reminds me of using a slow striker on Fifa Ultimate team

1684~~~
Good game, got robbed as it was a 100% goal.

1685~~~
Good 20 minutes and then became tired. Lets hope he finishes strongly.

1686~~~
He done well, he just needs to stay through the middle, when he drifts no one is in the box

1687~~~
Looked a lot better. His touch and link up play especially. Shame about the goal, though it's hard when the man arguably playing him onside is behind him from the linesman's view. If the lino was on the other touchline, the flag probably wouldn't have gone up. Oh well. He's done fine. A brace from him would be great, and hopefully kick his season into motion.

1688~~~
Rancid second half.

1689~~~
Might as well play with 10 men. Hopeless

1690~~~
Bye bye Rooney. It's been nice to have you. #Moyeslegacy

1691~~~
Looked promising in the first 15. Reverted back to type after that though.

1692~~~
Wish he would just retire. Awful player. Bebe level.

1693~~~
Alot better today, but needs a real striker to play off rather then Januzaj.

1694~~~
Needs a couple of games with the U21s to show that he's just as droppable as everyone else.

1695~~~
I'm definitely being fickle but we can't continue with him in the starting eleven.

1696~~~
Ok in the first half. Just ok but never likely to score. Nowhere to be found in the second half when it mattered.

1697~~~
Played really well, unlucky not to have that chance at the start of the game, couple of stuffy efforts in the second half. Still lacking decent service.

1698~~~
He serves no purpose right now. Doesn't bring anything to the table, other than losing the ball and sideways passes, when he's in this form.

Beginning to think that making us so reliant on him was a huge mistake. Still time to rectify that.

1699~~~
So now he isn't a 9... When he dropped deep he touched the ball about 5 times in 25 minutes. Peripheral in the team, felt like playing with 10.

1700~~~
Still has absolutely horrible ball control. Kept bouncing off him and he is pretty useless in tight spaces. Moyes basically did leave us with a millstone around our neck by getting him on such a huge wage for five years.

1701~~~
wot?

1702~~~
Looked tad better than in previous games, but stil far from his peak form. Chicha did actually looks sharper than him. But I do not even doubt that it will be Rooney starting against Brugge.

1703~~~
Wasn't good again.

1704~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Oh how standards have fallen...

1705~~~
Loved his rant at the ref after a piece of shit control late in the game. Yeah Wayne, it's his fault you can't trap a ball.

1706~~~
Not as bad as he had been, but still offered nothing. About time LVG did something about it.

1707~~~
I thought he got more involved in terms of stretching some players around. But either way, he's not really doing it as a number 9 so far but Hernandez constantly looks more dangerous as the front man. Makes more sense to me right now to play both, with Rooney behind him.

1708~~~
Makes more sense to drop him, really. Wont happen mind

1709~~~
Why don't we just play with 10 men? He's slow as hell and is hindering us massively.

LVG won't sub him because he's captain. What a load of shite, we need a world class striker ffs it's damn obvious why we aren't scoring goals.

1710~~~
Absolutely useless. 

Doesn't deserve to start. Should be earning his place from the bench. 

We're a bit fecked if we keep trying to play him out of bad form.

1711~~~
He was ok in the first half but shocking when we were pushing at the end. Mata was constantly the one looking the ball and trying to make things happen while Rooney hid.

1712~~~
Fellaini as 9. Rooney as 10. Januzaj as bench next time then.

1713~~~
He is about as useful as a pub league striker right now

1714~~~
Oh the abuse I suffered when I said he wouldn't score 10 goals this season. Where are those people know? 

He's completly shit.

1715~~~
And play where we don't need him, in the first half he was on the wing when he was needed in the box.

1716~~~
A meh-performance. Finished that disallowed goal very well but wasn't really threatening for the remainder of the match.

1717~~~
promising in the first 20mins, has gone to his poor standard since

1718~~~
He needs to be shipped out to Turkey like the rest of our former glory players

1719~~~
You realise there are still 35 PL games to be played?

1720~~~
He's broken the record for longest run without a goal now, right? Spain won Euro2012 using a false 9 system, maybe LVG wants to try the same.

1721~~~
He offers absolutely no threat whatsoever. He doesn't remotely look like scoring. 

When we finally had some urgency in the last 10 minutes he did feck all. He should be dropped.

1722~~~
Was dreadful after the first 20 did nothing. Hernandez came on and looked twice the player.

1723~~~
Getting embarrassing now, he seems to be walking through games too, expect the usual excuses to come out from his usual fanboys but were basically playing with a cone up front and I'm sick of it, can't be bothered to make runs , can't control the ball, gives away possession, always overplaying it. It's such a tiresome act now.

1724~~~
He can't control a ball or make a short pass and you want him as a 10.

1725~~~
Put him on the bench for a spell - might do him so good. Tired of the Rooney debate. If he's not scoring, take him off. I know it's still early, but the thing I was most worried about seems to be happening - we are winning feck all with Rooney as the talisman. Don't know if physically it's not there anymore or what but it is suicidal to stick with him as the main man for the rest of the season imo.

1726~~~
He had a volley that should have gone it blocked. Onside(?) goal called off. Involved in play a lot more than his previous games. He's getting better, stop calling him shite.

1727~~~
You can talk about lack of service etc. all you want, but good strikers make chances on their own as well. Look at the strikers we're up against in many games - they get the ball completely alone, but still manage to create a couple of dangerous situations during the game. Rooney creates feck all these days and often stops our attacks due to poor touches. I have no idea why he's seemingly the first name on the team-sheet - Hernandez seems to have better link-up play at the moment, and his runs are miles better. Times like this makes you wish he had actually fecked off before Moyes came in and bend over for him.

He can "get better" and still be terrible. If a blocked shot and what looked to be a marginally offside goal is good enough then the standards have truly hit rock bottom.

1728~~~
He was average, again. Physically weak and technically garbage.

1729~~~
He has scored 2 away goals since the West Ham game away...When David Moyes was still Manager..he has hardly set the house on fire at O.T either..

1730~~~
That too. Half the time he's interested in dropping off and pulling the strings. Most likely because he loses all his duals with back to goal. That's very worrying for a number 9.

1731~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This thread is incredible

1732~~~
I'm still looking for the nutjobs who said he would score over 20 goals this season. All gone into hiding

1733~~~
This is what the club has caved in to, twice. He'll be in the MLS at 32 and retired at 34.

1734~~~
You realise the level rooney is currently playing at? It is worse than pub team sunday league strikers and the fact he shows no sign of improvement in the near future.

1735~~~
Doesn't have pace, no physical threat to the defenders and his touch is awful. The only way he will scoring is if he's clean through. And he messed that up against Spurs.

1736~~~
Yeah what was up with that. I thought he finally pulled his finger out but no.

You thought he was good?

1737~~~
He just doesn't have the acceleration anymore. Getting burnt by Mbemba in the corner in the first half. Without pace or top class technique, you aren't getting anything these days. We need a striker to replace him.

1738~~~
That moment when Mitrovic robbed him, jesus christ! And to think that he is supposed to be world class.

1739~~~
I don't show it but I'm having a meltdown.

It's like playing with an handicap.

1740~~~
He is on £300K a week, how on earth is that possible?

1741~~~
Or a pen.

1742~~~
Until 2019 as well I think.

1743~~~
Decent first 15-20 mins when the entire team was playing well but an extremely average/anonymous second half. Drops deep, plays a safe square pass and then lumbers forward - rinse and repeat.

1744~~~
Are you trying to say he was good or something?

1745~~~
I thought he was good during the first half, then anonymous during 30 minutes in the second, and a bit better towards the end. He served Mata with a superb chance (the pass was very good, if Mata had a bit of a right foot it would've been a great goal), had a goal disallowed harshly (wrongly, imo) and had a couple of other half chances. 

So no, not excellent but a decent performance overall. And if people think he's our problem at the moment, they're bonkers.

1746~~~
He played well and score some decent goals when played as a striker last season. Then he was dropped back in midfield and people started complaining.
Now we put him back as a striker and the player has a run of poor games and people already want him out of the club.He will come out good. He is no Lambert or Balotelli. He is Wayne Rooney. He is our team captain for Christ's sake.

1747~~~
His best game of the season so far. Still not good though, not utterly terrible either, but still far away from what he should be capable of. Whether he is still capable, it remains to be seen.

1748~~~
Only the second game in 21 Premier League matches in 2015 that he's had more than one shot on target.

1749~~~
He was fine, it could so easily have been a goal and an assist for him today. His goal was onside and he gave Mata a goal on a plate which Mata fecked up. He was no worst or better than the rest of the team. I'm more annoyed at Memphis and Shaw at not being able to pass the ball to him when he is unmarked in the box.

1750~~~
No one's going to pay 300k a week for him.

1751~~~
Still waiting for those goals to come, Wayne.

1752~~~
Another very poor performance. In this form I'd have Fellaini up top ahead of him in a heartbeat.

1753~~~
Anonymous second half. We are picking out one or two good things he did in the game and call it a 'decent performance'. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1754~~~
Yeah, I'd agree that I'd rather play a couple games without him but as you say, that won't happen. Best option would be to drop in the 10 position if he won't sit on the bench

1755~~~
I think he looked much better in the number ten role..

1756~~~
That's not unsurprising though, and not really his fault I'd say. We're extremely cautious in the third half of the pitch, I doubt there's many of our players who get a lot of shots on goal in a single game very often.

1757~~~
As poor as he was, this was still his best game all season. Might not be saying much, but hey it was much better than his first 3 games.

I don't think he's past it yet, but he needs to get into form asap, we need him scoring goals to make a difference.

1758~~~
Slightly better than his first two games, but thats not saying much. Needs to get his shit together ASAP. Would like to see him in the hole behind Chica next game. Him as a lone striker is not working atm

1759~~~
"He was fine"

Yeah, no goals in almost 15 hours is totally fine. No bother Wayne, good shift.

1760~~~
Seems pretty uninspiring to me, both in terms of Rooney and the team's attacking intent as a whole.

1761~~~
Not as bad as he was against Villa but certainly worse than mid week and he was meant to push on from that today

1762~~~
That stuck out like a sore thumb. He just does not have the dribbling ability and his pace is gone. Add to that his poor first touches and I wonder how on earth is LVG not seeing that.

1763~~~
we could have a whole XI better than him for that wages. Just imagine that. OMG

1764~~~
I know right, more worrying though the man that matters....LVG, he seems to have some sort of blind idiotic faith in him too. 

Honest to God if we don't sign a striker this window then Lvg is a complete idiot. All this "signings are a process" bollocks is getting very tiresome now. "we only buy players that will improve us" blah blah, If that's the case might aswell go sign Jamie vardy, as he would be an immediate improvement on Rooney.

1765~~~
I can't disagree, but I think that's just the way we're set up.

1766~~~
The other players on similar wages are Messi and Ronaldo..I cry when I think that we dont even get half  of what they give their teams..

1767~~~
What annoys me is Van Gaal seemed content to ship out RVP/Falcao and not bring in anyone else on the back of Rooney telling him he'll score a ton of goals if played as the striker. If you're going to claim that you better back it up.

300k a week should get you an Aguero/Hazard/Suarez level player.

1768~~~
He doesn't make runs and can't beat CBS in the air. Add in the horrible first touch and he's really just hurting us at the moment. Drop him, stop the coddling.

1769~~~
Severly disappointed in Rooney.
Slow.
Weak.
Inconsistant.
Are we really going to keep with this guy being our main striker?
His performance today was utter garbage. 
He's on a good one here.. Captain (first name on teamsheet), undropable, no decent competition for his place in the team and on 300 grand a week!
Feck he must crap bars of gold!

1770~~~
300k a week, feck sake. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1771~~~
He's a big part of it. Bad first touch, no movement in dangerous areas and he made next to nothing of any ball he got in the box aside from that early chance.

That makes life a lot tougher for the creative players around him.

1772~~~
Yeah but.. he created one chance for Mata so its a decent performance of course <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1773~~~
No more this crap 'oh he looks better in the #10' he's not good enough, simple as that. Not good enough for #9 or #10, its time we move on. Mata #10, Hernandez/Fellaini #9

1774~~~
Believe us , we dont see the funny part..This is actually quite sad..David Moyes, what were you thinking?!?

1775~~~
It's not often on the caf we see such a massive consensus regarding a player. Really Wayne has let down a lot of fans.

1776~~~
Neville retired when he was more hindrance than help time for Rooney to do the same <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1777~~~
There was another instance in 80th minute I think. Lost the ball again in a very poor way.

1778~~~
Starting to get used to seeing Rooney with the lowest average rating after each game

1779~~~
His lack of movement is astounding. Every time Mata cut inside he should have been making a perpendicular run behind the defender and he just stood there asking for it to feet.

1780~~~
Overreacting much?

1781~~~
The funny thing is, when he was playing #10 and central midfield, the same people were saying he's better at #9. 

For me it #9 or nothing. And right now he's playing #9 terribly.

1782~~~
I've said this before, I think the 'bad touch' thing isn't true in the sense he does have some bad touches, but it's not a generality. It's just a stupid bandwagon people have jumped on. He had one truly bad touch today which cost us. He also has some fantastic touches. 

Don't agree about the movement in dangerous areas, he was found twice in dangerous areas (first half when his shot was straight at Krul, second half when he controlled it with his chest and got a countered shot off) mainly due to his good movement. Also, the times we went through the wings, the cutbacks and crosses were very poor and were incapable of finding him unmarked of him in the box. 

I'd say the creative players are making it as hard for him as he is for them, at the very least.

1783~~~
I have a feeling it's not so easy for LVG to rattle the Rooney situation - think there's a lot of politics involved and LVG doesn't have any credits in the bank yet unlike Sir Alex. Rightly or wrongly, I'm beginning to believe something is in Rooney's contract that ensures he starts or we pay some penalty. It sounds crazy to my ears but it doesn't make any sense. LVG surely knows Rooney is not good enough - he can see that, but his hands may be tied.

1784~~~
Atleast Sir Bobby's  record will be intact at the end of the season...

1785~~~
Yes..there have been a few though over the years..Cleverley and Gibson come to mind.

1786~~~
Who was it that gave him that contract? SAF or Moyes? Looking like a terrible decision now. And I don't think he was playing particularly amazingly at the time either.

Really hope we sign a striker. Either he replaces Rooney who sits on the bench or Rooney works hard and sorts himself out to perform at the required level a club like United needs.

1787~~~
Sorry, I meant when it concerns such an important player.

1788~~~
Honestly wouldn't bother, people have short memories and the last thing they will reference is the one bad touch or bad pass. He was good today and you and I can both agree the attack has problems that don't just involve Rooney.

1789~~~
He was a United fan though, and had been for all his life..For some players without that relationship, that wont happen.

1790~~~
Straight swap for John Stones and we'll pay 50% of his salary for a season.

He's useless and him being our "unsubbale" captain is making the team struggle as a whole. He's hindering us big time.

1791~~~
But neither of them were suppose to be our star player.

1792~~~
Words fail me.

He's the focal point of our attack, he's our captain. 
You'd need four hands to count the amount of times moves break down when the ball goes near him.
He's a total hindrance to our play atm, it's literally like playing with a cone up front. 
The worse thing with him is he is so so easy to defend against. 
Lack of agility, no dribbling, no pace, I honestly do not see any point in him playing atm.
Don't get me wrong Memphis wasn't great but he still had moments where he looked like he could make something happen, how many did Rooney have?
How many times does mata have to receive the ball look up and see Wayne 'the cone' Rooney marking a centre back?

How hard is it to move a bit? Just sick of this now and because he's on 300k a week and captain he has to play every week. Fecking wage thief.

1793~~~
Moyes obviously.

Fergie wanted him gone. 

Van Gaal needs to start dropping him. I rather play Fellaini upfront currently than him.

1794~~~
Agreed. My only pet pieve with him this game was how slow he is..

1795~~~
Oh, yes..I think even the ones defending him now are doing it more in defense of him and not his perfomances..you cant watch him play and come to any different conclusion.

1796~~~
Fergie threw him under the bus before he left, talked about him wanting to leave and handing in a transfer request. Moyes went down on both knees and did everything possible to keep him here, and Woodward made it happen.

1797~~~
No wonder.

1798~~~
Everton won't pay him £150k.

Only European team who might be interested is PSG, if they get rid of Ibra and want a big name. But it will be hard to get rid of him with those wages.

1799~~~
Yep, not untrue, he seemed much more dynamic towards the end though, funnily enough. Mata annoys me from this point of view also, so slow.

1800~~~
Positive things for today:

Flashing fast decision to hit the ball on the volley. Could easily gone in on a better day.

Great play to Mata. Don't think many people saw that coming.

Good fighting alone in the middle against a very compact defending Newcastle.


To me it's Memphis who's not fully compatible with Rooney yet. I think Memphis often takes the wrong decision in the box. Mostly it's leftovers from a shot that Rooney get to deal with. It's not like Rooney is an awful player. Perhaps a bit underperforming if you compare it to what he earns. It will be a couple of more games until the team is fully fluent.

1801~~~
Yes, its quite bad..I wonder what Fergie saw when he wanted to get rid of him..but my goodness, he was so right.

1802~~~
Shout out to his agent Paul Stretford as well, he could possibly be the best salesman on earth if he sold us into giving a Messi like contract to a washed up past it striker for 5 years on £300k p/w: plus to make things even worse, the guy who has bent us over two times asking for two transfer requests is going to be our ambassador at the end of it all. Sir Alex didn't get every decision right but boy oh boy was he right when he didn't see Rooney's long term position as a striker at this club

1803~~~
Some of his first touches are out of this world literally.

1804~~~
Show some balls Louis - you know it's not working - stop being so bloody stubborn

Now we have got to the point where the likes of Mata and Adnan are concentrating on serving up something easy for him and ignoring better options

1805~~~
He played better today but still shite nonetheless, his overall game was just poor.

1806~~~
I see the RDL are hanging their hat on the goal that should have stood but was given offside today.

He started brightly enough  along with the rest of the team, but once Newcastle tightened up he faded and was anonymous for vast periods of the second half. These are the games when your supposed star striker makes the difference, not the new kid on the wing or the 20 year old #10, but the star man, captain and highest paid player at the club. He is not only slow off the mark with poor control, but his movement is erratic and worryingly he is easily knocked off the ball these days where he used to be a stocky tank out there.

1807~~~
This is one instance where I blame Woodward. I know he was under pressure from a commercial point of view not to make us look even more shit if Chelsea had gotten Rooney, but to agree to such a long extension, and God knows what else in that contract, is a pretty bad mistake.

1808~~~
He needs to score, this must be his worst patch of form ever.

1809~~~
Manager has to take majority of the blame. 

As we don't have a DoF, I think the manager chooses the length of the contract. Obviously at the time, Moyes assumed he'd be here for the six years.

1810~~~
He reminds me of RVN at the end of his time. We would bring on Saha and look so much more fluid and dynamic. Rooney is just slowing us down, with how we play on the wing we need movement and speed in the centre.

Should have gone all out for Lacazette

1811~~~
Fergie couldn't pick a manager, but the man sure knew when a player had lost his usefulness. I've said it before, except for that mistake with Jaap Stam, he never gets rid of big players unless he knows they had no more left to give. The first time Rooney had the dispute with the club - he was still useful so Sir Alex held on to him. The second time it happened though, was the time to let him go, but Moyes thought otherwise...

1812~~~
How did he hinder us in this game? He did his job for the team and put himself into good positions to score..

1813~~~
At least RVN could score. He scored 20 goals in his last season.

Even in his time at Madrid he was scoring for fun, when it was clear he wasn't the same player.

1814~~~
300k a week or is it 350k?

1815~~~
I understand that, but maybe in light of the fact that Sir Alex is no longer here, we should think about not giving all the power to the manager from now onwards? I don't say interfere, but we need to have some more control over situations such as this imo.

1816~~~
Accept that point. I was reffering more to the fact that in his last season you could see plain as day he slowed the whole team down.

1817~~~
His time is over, it is all downhill from now. SAF knew it and slowly everyone else will see it.

1818~~~
Yeah, but not bloody enough.

The amount of times Mata was looking for him to make the run, but he decided to either stand there or come short was shocking.

Pure laziness from him. He simply isn't fit enough. He looks 'heavy' and slow as hell. Couldn't take on a player to save his life nowadays.

1819~~~
Do you even watch the game?

1820~~~
We are going to pay for this mistake for years now..Paul Stretford is a genius though..

1821~~~
Everyone will criticize Rooney, and I guess that comes with a player of his credentials, but he's not the only one that was poor, and to be fair, I don't think he was that bad today. I just think, like I said before, because we expect a lot more from him, he'll get the most criticism. 

Although he started off brightly, I thought Memphis was poor today, as was Januzaj. Mata, although he kept the ball well, didn't really do anything outstanding and those are the three players playing behind Rooney.

I think if Van Gaal wants to get the best out of Rooney, we need pace around him. We need pace down the wings, and we need pace in behind him if he drops off.

1822~~~
Fergie knew it two years ago - since then he's become captain, the commercial face, "un-droppable", and "un-subbable"

Why didn't anyone listen to the man?

1823~~~
He got into the box plenty of times. The crossing today was awful. Van Gaal said the same. Couldn't even clear the first man.

1824~~~
Did he not make the run that resulted in a goal( although it was off side)
Did he not flash to the top of the box to recieive the ball that resulted in a volley?
Did Rooney not get into the box plenty of times today, only to be greeted with shoody crosses from his teammates?
Rooney made himself available quite a couple of other times but his teammates did not notice the exact same way his teammates were looking for him to be available at times. This game was not on him.

1825~~~
Januzaj and Memphis were miles worse than him but it's fine, it's all Rooney these days. The latest United scapegoat.

1826~~~
Thank you!

1827~~~
Yes I know, unless we can come up with something. It's depressing<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

On the other hand, last season everyone had a go at LVG for not playing Falcao more - even his disgusting agent was throwing shade in the press. So LVG then starts doing that and of course Falcao turned out to be crap. At the time I got the feeling that LVG played so the powers that be could see what he was possibly seeing in training. It was the only way to get that point across imo. Not even his agent could argue with what Falcao was putting out. Therefore, with Rooney being such a big deal at the club, what better way to put him and/or the powers that be under pressure to face up to the fact he's not performing? I guess you play him - give him exactly what he wants. Public opinion and if it continues, his bad performances will do the rest and give him ammunition to ease him out of the side. I'm hoping this is what's happening of course<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1828~~~
Rooney is held at higher standards because the wage he's on, he's the captain, and he's meant to be our best player.

Awful once again. Do people seriously still think he's gonna hit 15 in the league? Hernandez was more of a threat when he came on.

1829~~~
Somewhere around the 70th minute, we had 1 successful cross from 13. What exactly is a striker supposed to do with that service? He scored a goal that was incorrectly ruled offside. Rooney wasn't great today but I thought he was more than decent and definitely better than some of the dross around him

1830~~~
With our service, I think Aguero would do well to get to 15 in this team. Rooney was rubbish for the first two games but he's been decent these last two. He's just becoming the scapegoat now even when others around him have far worse games.

1831~~~

Nobody else seems to think he was our worst player on random rating football sites but yes on the caf he was our worst player..

1832~~~
The best out of Rooney is already gone, and has been for some time. Maybe if we are lucky we will get flashes now and then but he is looking unfit and past his best.  We need someone else up front,.

1833~~~
Lol put most strikers in that team against that opposition and they would struggle, the biggest issue is as a team we are not creative at all, we barely create any chances, but let's ignore that because it's so much easier to blame Wayne Rooney. The one chance he was given he put the ball in the back of the net, not much more you can ask from him. If he was constantly missing chances i can get the hate but at the moment its not justified. Imo Memphis was even worse today but he won't get the same level of grief.

Biggest issue is our overall attacking play hasn't evolved much from last year which is a big concern.

1834~~~
Aguero can make something out of nothing. Rooney can't. Aguero is streets ahead.

1835~~~
He's not a scapegoat. If he had one or two bad performances, nobody would be having a go. It's a culmination of his performances since last season. Everyone would like him to do well, but we have to be realistic. Plus, the more you get, more is expected of you.

1836~~~
one can hope..but its Manchester United that will suffer for it though..Surely LVG should get himself a striker as an insurance policy..He has to worry about his own job too

1837~~~
And the Sun will give him star man, what's your point?

1838~~~
Do you reckon we would have won the game if we had a 'world class' forward today?

1839~~~
He cannot hold a ball up, doesn't win 50/50s. Basic things strikers are meant to do. He doesn't show himself for a pass enough, doesn't get into dangerous positions, poor touches, slow build up, all of these things he's been guilty of for ages. Coloccini and Taylor had an easy game today because Wayne offers no threat.

1840~~~
Shouldn't be too hard to work out.

1841~~~
Rooney comes short and doesn't run behind like a lot of good strikers would do. 

You look at Aguero vs Chelsea and how many times he did that. Mata was looking for a pass yet Rooney kept coming short. 

His first touch and hold up play is terrible. There was a moment when Carrick played a pass to him on the edge of the box and his touch as normal resulted in him fouling. Aguero would have taken that ball and created space for a shot.

1842~~~
This is as true as the claims last season's claims that some people came up with that getting Rooney to 9 would solve his goal scoring  and poor perfomance problems.. Now that has been proven false, its on to the next theory

1843~~~
So a 20 year old and a 21 year old youngster (who saved our ass in the CL recently) played (slightly) worse than our best payed player that has been wank for over 2 years now? Big deal. Doesn't take away the fact Rooney once again has NOT delivered. We needed sth special today to break those feckers down. When was the last time Rooney was able to pull sth special off? He doesn't even get the basics right.

This scapegoat is fecking tiresome. If someone is shit, there's every right for a fan to point that out.

1844~~~
I find it funny that those who defend him have had to resort to ''he wasn't the worst player on the field'' argument. As a senior captain, our most expensive player per week, he should at least put in a good performance every now and then. Not being the worst on the pitch isn't actually an achivement.

1845~~~
Yes I do.

1846~~~
He contribution is minimal, he may even be more helpful to opposition teams. He needs to be benched.

1847~~~
Our whole midfield plays slow lethargic football, and i think that's the main issue. Granted he had a few poor touches in the first 2 games but his ball control and passing was a lot better today, can't think of many times where he mis controlled it or lost the ball today. Also how can you thread balls into his feet when Newcastle had 8 men around the D for 80 mins of the game? Even if you do what is he supposed to do with 4 players around him?

1848~~~
Can you honestly say we are a creative team? if you say yes , you need glasses.

1849~~~
There isnt really a good point there..If his saving grace now is Daily Mail ratings, then that is scrapping the barrel of desperation

1850~~~
Our crossing was woeful
We completed 8 crosses total out of 38..

1851~~~

1852~~~
Comparing him to the other players in the squad you have to admit they are far more likely to get their first touch right. The idea that Rooney has a bad touch is not unfounded.

Not jumping on any bandwagon. I've seen this too often from him. He'll go on a run 5 goals in 5 games and the bad performances will be forgotten. But when his form drops off, he's terrible.

The one constant is Rooney having sub-par performances despite whatever problems you perceive to exist in attack.

Mata was good today, Memphis had very good game against Brugge and Adnan was decent against Villa. I have yet to see anything resembling an acceptable performance from Rooney this season with the current state of affairs. We are talking about a 29 year old captain with 10 seasons at the club.

He looked good for about 15 minutes at the start of the game but that doesn't mean he had a decent performance.

1853~~~
Cant defend the poor perfomances..oh yes, I'll resort to childish insults..well done..have a cookie

1854~~~
Yes, but their poor perfromances will have an effect on Rooney as well..

1855~~~
That's because a striker relies on service and chance creation, it's not rocket science. And FYI Rooney wasn't great today, average but definitely not as bad as you guys are making him out to be.

Slow sideways passing and pathetic crosses how are we going to score goals?

1856~~~
He wan't as bad as some here make him out to be, but again he was far from what we expect from him. Started well, but then failed to get involved towards the end.

1857~~~
My favourite Wayne moment today was when Shaw passed the ball to him and it bounced off his foot stronger than it was coming towards him. Highlight of the game.

1858~~~
If he were playing for Stoke he would be dropped with such performances.

1859~~~
Only if they had someone to replace him.

1860~~~
I'm watching Mame Biram Diouf now and he's actually playing much better.

1861~~~
I'm rather tipsy so I'll be vague to avoid being attacked at. 

There's level of harshness. The comments in this thread are a certain level of harshness <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fecking hell, take a chill pill (a saying I've never typed before in my life).

1862~~~
Can we put in a cheeky bid for Crouch

1863~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1864~~~
He wasn't our worst player today. He was just unable to help the team. AGAIN

1865~~~
Why is that funny, you have no argument. He is playing better than Rooney now, most strikers in the league are...

1866~~~
The bold bit is the easiest of excuses to make. Rooney had poor first touches throughout the game. Didn't really get in good positions and was not that great overall. He is our captain and our main striker and we expect him to pull a rabbit out of the bag when the opponent is this tight but he rarely ever does that anymore.

1867~~~
He's not a poor player, this much is obvious. However, he isn't good enough to be playing for us at the moment.

1868~~~
4 goals in 21 games is £1,575,000 per goal @£300k a week <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

No goals in 10 games @ £300k a week is infinity <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1869~~~
Makes for depressing reading. And end product is usually his redeeming quality.

1870~~~
It will be hard to believe we will win anything with Rooney as our main striker if he continues to perform like this.

Even though everyone was laughing at Moyes at United, Moyes had the last laugh by giving Rooney that laughable contract extension. If he was sold, we would have had a quality striker leading our line right now.

1871~~~
I just hope he outperforms RVP this season. Performing worse than the striker we sold would really leave us looking silly.

1872~~~
It's a no brainer, we won't. When has any team won anything domestically or in Europe with a 6/10 striker?

1873~~~
"Not even Aguero would score goals with this kind of service!!!" I think it's important to remember that Aguero and players of his ilk actually make movements expected of those leading the line, actually allowing for some kind of decent service. Look at the entirety of the time he spent playing #9, he was dropping FAR too deep and picking the ball up in less-advanced areas of the pitch than Memphis and Januzaj. Movement, mostly off the shoulder, playing the last man, is absolutely 101 for anyone who's playing up top. For me, put Silva in this side at the top of his game, he's not making a considerable difference to Rooney's game because the movement isn't there to give the kind of service he gives Aguero.

I see a lot of this kind of thing, like it's really unfortunate that he's playing with such a load of dross, and how much better he'd be if only he were to be played with some kind of quality. At the same time, I see very few people suggesting that by not doing the absolute basics expected of a man who's supposed to be leading the line, like offering a focal point for the attack, he's making it more difficult for the likes of Mata to do what he does...like create, which people seem to have forgotten he's quite good at.

1874~~~
Our defense is impressive and our midfield is organized. I have seen the likes of Chelsea make it to the finals with much less. We are basically playing with a handicap with Rooney's recent performances, so at the moment it does seem like a no brainer that we can write of any glory this season with his current performances.

However, I m hopefull that the introduction of Fellaini into our first team will improve Rooney drastically. As I stated before, Rooney plays better with a target man who is great at hold up play and understand the importance of team work. I never understood why we sold Welbeck as he is the type of player Rooney needs to improve.

1875~~~
Definitely our worst player. Not that we won't win anything, but we will struggle to get top 4 if Rooney remains our main striker.

1876~~~
He's really 29 ? On the pitch he looks like 36 and slowly calling it a day.

I can understand a dip in form but his wage level really require from him some sort of performance on this level.

1877~~~
It is such a bullshit argument. Great players do not rely on service, Memphis on Tuesday scored goals out of nothing .. Suarez and Aguero are way ahead of Memphis they would easily bang goals in for our side, yet some genuinely believe that they would struggle in a LVG side. Utter horseshit. If he could control the ball better and make more runs, we would be able to mount more effective attacks.

1878~~~
He's on 2, 3, or even 4 times the wage of every other player here so he's going to be under more scrutiny. A 6 out of 10 performance from Memphis isn't as bad as Rooney having one. And fans will take into account what he's on because he held the club to ransom for it.

1879~~~
It would be interesting to see whether some of the posters defending Rooney were the same calling for Van Persie to be sold because there hasn't been much difference in their performances the last few months. Actually that's not fair as at least Van Persie could control the ball.

1880~~~
I'm not sure what game people were watching. He scored a goal which was wrongly disallowed and created one of our best chances from open play with that cross to Mata. Not great, no, but our worst player? Not by a long long distance. It seems people can't wait to have a go at him regardless of performance.

1881~~~
Januzaj created that chance for Rooney and put Depay through. 

Who was the worst? If it wasn't Rooney, he wasn't far off. And him being so highly paid and our main striker this season and captain, obviously makes expectations rightfully higher than a 20 year old kid.

1882~~~
Apparently there's another angle that show's he was off?

Either way, I don't know why he's playing the line so tight in that situation, he has so much space, he could easily be half a step back and the chance is still there.

Agreed he wasn't our worst player though, I thought Adnan was pretty appalling.

1883~~~
Oh I see, so now we rate players according to their wage? Right Ill have to look up every players wage before I decide who's played well or not then.

And the "holding the club to ransom" story is just getting so old.

1884~~~
No obviously but it's why people are making more of a big deal out of Rooney's performance than say other players who were also 6/10.

1885~~~
I'm not sure why you bring up Januzaj. Thought he was good as well albeit not as good as Rooney.

And I really don't care how much he gets paid. He's played well for the last 2 games. With a bit of luck and better finishing from Depay and Mata he could have had a goal and 3 assists in the last 2 games after a stinker against Villa. Wish he'd get a goal to kick start his season, but he's done well in the last 2 games even without the goal.

1886~~~
The Rooney defenders will be the same ones saying 'I knew he was finished' 12 months after Rooney has gone.

1887~~~
Because that poster was talking about our worst players? Our defence and midfield was good, Depay was at times good but sadly at the crucial points poor, and Mata was our best player.

I don't see how any of Rooney's performances this season can qualify as good performances. If it's really as simple as "two good passes hence two almost assists hence good performance", then Di Maria has barely had a bad game in his life.

I definitely agree that we need him to get a few goals to give him confidence and kick start the season.

1888~~~
I'm probably his biggest critic on here, but he was better today. Unfortunate not to get a goal first half,  and good  control followed by blocked volley in the second. I think we were just unlucky today. Could do with Herrera in the team too.

1889~~~
The excuses in this thread reminds me of RvP's thread last season......

1890~~~
He has been good in the last 2 games, so I'd disagree. It was just two good passes either, so that's something of a strawman.

1891~~~
Even if it was, it was not much more. Agree to disagree on this.

1892~~~
I thought he was ok these last two games. Not up to the standard we should expect of a United striker but just about acceptable. If that's his average level of performance with a dozen good games and a dozen poor games, I think we'll be able to do be successful in multiple competitions this season. Lots of tight wins along the way though

1893~~~
I agree with this, he clearly wasn't great but he was a damn sight better than against Villa, and against Villa he was better than against Spurs. If he had been playing better recently and had more public goodwill that would be called a solid performance by most on here, a 6/10.

Hopefully its the embryonic signs of an upturn in form. We can't sign anyone better than an inform Rooney, so that would be the best outcome.

1894~~~
Or worse, the Falcao one...well up until february

1895~~~
14 games since scoring? Absolutely bemused as to how he's continues to start.

1896~~~
I'm reminded of the Kagawa thread.

1897~~~
The wingers failed him very badly today, terrible deliveries and not really a cross worth getting anything on. With the opposition playing so deep and within their half, its very hard to find and get on the end of a through ball either.

1898~~~
At least ppl can't blame RvP now!
Rooney being undroppable despite being absolutely useless and Herrera not getting a chance again and again are two of the most annoying things under LvG!

1899~~~
29 years.  Club captain. 300k. And the best we can hope for is he wont be thks bad next game. 

His saving grace are only : at least he's not as bad as aston villa game.

1900~~~
<img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

1901~~~
Watch the game again,  he was never in a position to receive a pass with so many defender on him.  Never mind a cross.  He's so static.

1902~~~
He gets paid 300k for being able to retain possession... Magnificent. 

Honestly, he needs a break. Bench him and let  someone else play up front.

1903~~~
Haha. Please. Mata was out best attacker by far. Memphis was very selfish but januzaj too had a good game especially in the first half. 

I hate to say it but Rooney isn't really a striker suited to van Gaal's style either. It just complicates the issue on top of him not being as good anymore.

1904~~~
yeah that's what happens when they have 10 people in their own half its hard to shake free of defenders in the middle unless the winger is being efficient. Memphis, Adnan and even Darmian got behind the defense more than once but didn't deliver one good ball for the striker.

he's had nightmare games but sadly this is one of his better days.

1905~~~
Did Ruud ever go on a 10-game streak without scoring? If so, did SAF drop him?

1906~~~
Everyone, including Mata wants to cut in, no one tried to stay wide to stretch the play and open things up in the middle. That's the bigger issue. Memphis being a greedy toad didn't help either.

1907~~~
Yup his average rating is clearly down to those agenda posters

1908~~~
Our fullbacks were providing the width all game long. Another matter altogether that neither had their crossing boots on.

1909~~~
I did give him a 6 but him being better than previous games isn't really anything to write home about. Was abysmal earlier.

1910~~~
I didn't think he was particularly bad today but he is just not going to solve our goal problem. We need a striker who will stay up top and lead the line rather than dropping deep here there and everwhere. We have Mata/Januzaj milling about in the attacking midfield already we need a striker who stays up there as a lynchpin for the smaller 'creative' players to buzz around and aim for with their passes/crosses.

1911~~~
People need to realize that he drops deep when our play goes stale and there's no movement. During the opening 20 minutes, when we were playing with intent and pace, he had no problem playing a bit higher. It's not true that we have a shitload of situations where there's no one in the box after a good attacking move cos he's faffing around in midfield, the instances when we were actually creating chances (or embryonic chances) today, he was in the box waiting for the ball. But Memphis was being greedy and Shaw and Darmian couldn't beat the first man with their crosses.

1912~~~
Looks better when he plays at number ten (although still poor) and doesn't look capable of playing as the striker at the moment.

1913~~~
I think you've misunderstood what I was saying.

If you have two players put in 6/10 performances, one in a good vein of form and one in a bad run people will tend to look at the player on a good run and say he played better.

Rooney's not playing well at the minute, so people will look at today as part of a continuation of the trend and slate him for it even if his performance was ok. I'm not saying its down to 'agenda posters' or anything. Just natural human tendencies to look for patterns.

Edit: For example, just look at the average ratings for Memphis and Rooney. I'd find it hard to say Memphis was significantly better than Rooney but is scoring nearly a point and a half higher than him.

1914~~~
Don't know about that, but RVP did until penalty against someone (too lazy to search against who) and he wasn't dropped.

1915~~~
Don't know if this has been posted but........

1916~~~
Nah that was when he missed three penalties in a row I think.

Ruud definitely never went 10 games without a goal.....That's not even legal in his mind

1917~~~
20 goals? He'd struggle to get 20 shots on target at thjs rate

1918~~~
If Ronaldo or Ruud had stayed a tad bit longer, they would have absolutely smashed Charlton's record by now

1919~~~
Christ almighty <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1920~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1921~~~
He silently dominated both ends of the field today.

1922~~~
I think a lot of people assumed that because he was now our definitive main man up top, Rooney would comfortably hit 20 goals. Looking incredibly unlikely at the moment, though. Simply moving a player further up the field doesn't guarantee their goals rate will improve, unfortunately.

1923~~~
Because his link up play was still world class and he didn't turn into a pub league player in every single aspect of the game

1924~~~
BUT.....It's the wingers fault

1925~~~
11 in 2004. Though, talking about league only.

1926~~~
Has anyone seen Odgens tweet. The twat is blaming Mata for the reason Rooney is ineffective. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1927~~~
That's when he had his injury. Was never the same player after that.

1928~~~
That was when he threw the first of his hissy fits over wanting to leave....

However, still love the man <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1929~~~
At least RVP goals before his goal drought, United had virtually won the league. 12 point's clear with 12 games to play.
If United want to complete on a level playing ground with the likes of Barcelona, Real  Madrid, Bayern, let alone City and Chelsea, they need much better.

1930~~~
I think not matey, I hated Rooney before hating rooney was cool.

1931~~~
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1932~~~
Did I say anything against RVP in my comment? Just stated he also went on goal drought and wasn't dropped, that's all. I do know that RVP back then, even without goals, was better than Rooney ever was, didn't know I should state the obvious.

1933~~~
From a tweet...
"This is only the second game in 21 Premier League matches in 2015 for Wayne Rooney that he's had more than one shot on target."

Worrying.

1934~~~
That's some praiseworthy consistency.

1935~~~
Biggest issue right now is his lack of physicality for me. He's worryingly more comfortable infront of defence playing a short pass than he is driving at defences and making those bursting runs he used to and generally doing centre forward work in and amongst defenders. It's rare that he plays passes the ball and shoots off for the one-two to go in on goal. He probably feels he can't win those duels. Maybe it's because he's played in the hole so long that he's lost that physical edge, but I remember how in 2010 (was it), when he was bossing the Milan defence with his back to goal. He's never been an RVP/RVN striker in that sense, but he always had strength. 

Hopefully much of it is down to confidence and a run of scoring will bring back the edge to his game.

1936~~~
It's like he has gone from the Boyman to Oldman.

1937~~~
He'd wanna get his arse into gear sharpish.

1938~~~
Think he's the biggest problem at the club right now (On the pitch) An injury would be a huge blessing in disguise. He's hindering our team yet he still starts. As a 9 he's hopeless, Wilson would get more goals than him over the course of the season. As a 10 we have better options now. For me we need to get rid, sadly that won't be possible so we're gonna have this issue for a few years.

1939~~~
Massive overreaction. I actually do think he'll find his scoring touch back. That doesn't just go. End product is something I still have some faith he will achieve, to a decent extent.

At the same time I think we need to sign.

1940~~~
We should have got rid before SAF retired. Unfortunately nobody would pay the wages the greedy so and so is on. So we will have to wait for when he wants to go back to Everton to play for nowt.

1941~~~
I do generally think that Wilson playing as a 9 all season would score more than Rooney. But that's a question that won't be answered. Thing is, if we buy were still going to be stuck with Rooney in the 10 role.    

Yep I agree, I wanted him out from the moment he handed in that second transfer request, would never of given him a new contract. Let alone for 5 years.

1942~~~
Wilson just doesn't look ready for United yet. In all his performances last season he looked like a kid that's been promoted to soon.

I just hope LVG drops his captain must play nonsense. If we sign a striker whoever is in form should play. And I'd prefer Rooney stay away from the number 10 position.

1943~~~
I agree Wilson may not be ready, but I would rather see him given a chance when Rooney is playing like this. Wilson will be hungry and give everything to make a statement, it can't be any worse than what we have now. 

Yeah he should he should be dropped, I can't see it happening though.

1944~~~
I'd rather have Mata at 10 or Herrera as the extra midfielder.

1945~~~
Same. And a quick right winger.

1946~~~
The funny thing is I'm sure he's dropped his captain before (can't remember at which club), so not quite sure what's happening here<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>
Must be his hands are tied in some respect - as crazy as it sounds I think it must relate in part to whatever terms the club agreed to on Rooney's last contract. Otherwise, none of this makes sense to me.

1947~~~
We don't exactly have alternatives.

1948~~~
Van Bommell got dropped at Bayern.

1949~~~
But why does a club as big as us come to this? Without any contingency plan, thats just awful decision making by whoever is responsible..

1950~~~
But most times it's like playing with 10 men so surely the Pea could replace him for example - can't be any worse?

1951~~~
I agree. I think we just seem to believe too much Rooney sometimes as a club. It's like the whole club actually. We were oblivious to our weaknesses because we were winning and getting 3 points despite playing poorly. With Rooney, we're sometimes oblivious (and maybe he has been too) to his overall game because he puts up good numbers. 

We should have made signing a striker a top priority this summer given Rooney's last three seasons. You never know though, maybe we actually did.

1952~~~
I think Hernandez deserves a chance and hopefully it happens vs Brugge. I was super impressed with him at Madrid. But I think he works well when he has a strike partner, and I suppose whenever he played for Madrid, Ronaldo was there, whereas we have Mata or Januzaj.

But yeah, I'm all for giving Hernandez a chance. I think his movement as a striker is fantastic. I'd like to see him play in the team we played today.

1953~~~
Sorry maybe I wasn't clear. I mean't we don't have great striking alternatives.

Either way we simply have to sign. We could have had Rvp step on right now with Rooney out of form. He looked a bit past it too last season but still a great backup to have.

1954~~~
It doesnt have to be necessarily a big name from a massive club that we wont get..just younger decent talent..Perhaps we need someone overseeing the football operations of things..For better long term planning..especially as we cant really depend on the SAF model of long term management.

1955~~~
I've given up on him.

1956~~~
I earlier thought it should either be a top striker or as you say a younger one with potential, who could replace Rooney in a year or so time.

But looking at Rooney's form, now I'm beginning to feel that a stop gap striker who can come in and do a decent job would be more apt. Someone like Bony but not at that ridiculous fee.

1957~~~
It has to be somebody who is a threat to him, not a kid so Rooney can still pull rank. He needs a real kick up the backside, somebody who is capable of taking his place.

1958~~~
The last time someone took his place he didn't lift his game, he didn't want to play.

1959~~~
Not a youngster in the mould of Wilson for example ..but a good striker..good enough to start..but rather he doesnt necessarily have to be someone that we will chase from Madrid, Bayern or Barca, as they arent selling..problem is this late in the window, and with everyone seeing our deficiencies up close, who can we get? Griezmann isnt a traditional striker , but can play centrally..but I dont think we are interested seeing as we let him resign for a higher buyout at Atletico

1960~~~
Looking at it he's only broken 20 goals in all competitions once in the past five seasons (and not for the past three) and there's quite a few penalties in there as well. It's going to be difficult I think for him to hit that 20 goal target (which is a little low anyway when you look at what the other top strikers in the world are doing).

1961~~~
It'll be hard to find someone..we knew that we werent keeping RVP and Falcao long before the season came to an end..surely we knew that we had to replace them..We have done very well to boost our midfield, but have an attack that is possibly even worse than last season..and we only scored 63 goals last season.

1962~~~
Then that is tough. Back then he could still produce, now he is older and isn't. If the manager is strong enough to drop him, so be it.

1963~~~
Where is demba ba these days? A fine stop gap

1964~~~
China earning 230k a week..he isnt giving that up!

1965~~~
The fact he is still called world class by some with those figures, then you compare him with Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez, Aguerro and even Neymar. He is nowhere near world class now. They have left him well behind.

1966~~~
The problem is, Hernandez isn't a good enough striker to start either, so there's not much pressure for Rooney to perform. I also think van Gaal's cautious approach is killing Rooney. He likes to take risks, be aggressive and push forward but you rarely see him do that these days. I was a huge fan of Rooney in his younger days, but I haven't seen that version of him for a while.

1967~~~
Silent guardian, watchful dominator, the Dark "Silent Dominating" Knight.

1968~~~
He had a pretty good game from an individual viewpoint I thought, but it also highlighted one of the main problems... He just doesn't look like a threat at all. Even when his touch, passing and all that is good, not once did it look like he would score. And that's a big problem with your main striker. I always thought he was at his best as a leading striker, and maybe that was the case under Fergie, but he isn't suited to playing up front for Van Gaal and the way LvG wants his strikers to play at all. For now, I'd use him as the 10 and use Hernandez in front of him, that way we have the pace up front and the off the ball movement, and added aerial power because Hernandez has always had a good leap on him, but also the strength and goalscoring in behind with Rooney in the hole.

1969~~~
There was a moment when Mata sent him through and he just couldn't catch up, Rooney of 3-4 years ago would have been able to go clear and make it a 1v1 situation with the GK. His legs are gone.

1970~~~
Wayne does work hard, but he wants to be the main striker, so he has to score. We cannot keep going on about him not being given chances, he has to show he is still capable of creating chances for himself as well.

1971~~~
Rooney will have no excuses if he doesn't hit the 20 goal mark this season.

If he fails then he should be replaced next summer. But I don't think it would be a good idea for the manager to give up on his star player after 3 games.

1972~~~
Pretty much. I usually don't care about goal droughts too much because as long as a player is still performing on the pitch and getting in chances, then you know the goals will come back. For the past year though, Rooney has just hardly ever looked like scoring, getting no chances, and the performances have been decent at best if we're being honest. He had a 8 or 9 game goal drought at the start of 2015 as well (back from the end of 2014), and then went on a small scoring run of like 5 goals maybe, and then onto his current drought. For the main striker of a team who aspires for the title, it's woeful. I would rather he got into the chances and missed them, as then you'd only worry about his finishing. But like I said, he doesn't get into any chances these days, and that is the big worry.

1973~~~
To be fair his star player is De Gea and he's had him benched for that time, if Rooney doesn't deliver I have absolute faith LvG will bench him sooner rather than later.

1974~~~
There's huge difference in there situations. Rooney is on 300k a weak, our captain and the 'face of our team', furthermore he isnt refusing to play for this club unlike DDG and we dont have good competition for him. Although our u18 striker could basically do what he does weekly for us.

1975~~~
But why is this?

He's only 29 and for most athletes this is when they are at their peak. Sprinters usually peak between 27-30 and endurance and strength athletes haven't reached their peak yet at that age.

To what extent have his injuries impacted on his abilities? If injuries have not significantly contributed to his decline, you have to wonder what he is doing in his private life that might explain why he has prematurely gone over the hill. Even if his current lack of form is a blip and he regains some confidence and starts scoring again, it is clear to everyone that he is no longer at the physical level he was at 5 years ago. Something just doesn't add up.

1976~~~
What's the 'appropriate' way of dealing with a player that is the current icon of Man Utd, the captain with a 300k wage, but one who clearly isn't playing on the required level?

1977~~~
Hire someone to kill him ?? <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

1978~~~
I said it before in one thread, if Rooney will not deliver i can see him being sold or better said ofloaded next season. But it wouldn't suprised me if he is sold in january or even next week if we can land a top striker.

LVG is ruthless and i think Rooney's days as our first striker are numbered if he will not deliver soon. We all saw with Di Maria, when LVG decide to bench one of the stars they have a hard time to come back in the first 11.

1979~~~
LvG can be ruthless as much as he wants but I highly doubt he has the power to offload Rooney. Rooney is the most commercial face of Man United.

1980~~~
I don't think he still is. Look around who did most of the commercial job, adidas boys (Mata, Herrera, Shaw, Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin) are now number one in that departement.
I think we bought a nice commercial face in Schweinsteiger and i can see Memphis become important in that departement too if he develops like we expect.

1981~~~
Just a piece of my mind, i really got this feeling LVG has no power at all . How else can you explain Di Maria and Falcao ?? Buying 60 million players and bench them is not the way van Gaal works .

1982~~~
This is looking more and more like an absolute fantasy.  He'll be lucky to hit 10 in his current state.

1983~~~
Eh? 

So let me get this straight:

1. He hasn't got the power to bench Rooney because Rooney is on a big wage and an important figurehead to the club.
2. He didn't want to sign Falcao or Di Maria, they were signed for him. <b>However, </b>despite being forced to sign Di Maria for £60m he benched him and eventually got rid of him.

:golfclap:

1984~~~
I cant even be bothered to discuss him anymore - Please score soon Wayne.

1985~~~
Always the victim.  It's never his fault.

1986~~~
Bit harsh.

1987~~~
The concerning thing is he's not missing a load of chances. At times he has gone through spells of bad finishing but you knew eventually he would get one and the confidence would come back. During his current drought I don't remember many missed opportunities, except his hesitation against Spurs, which suggests a bigger problem. When he does finally get a goal it could easily be another dry spell before we see the next one go in.

The attack is simply not functioning and it's difficult to assess whether he is the sole problem, the biggest problem or just one part of the problem.

One thing that is clear is that we don't have the right variety of attacking options in the squad to react to certain situations. Fellaini is the closest thing we have to a physical forward and there was a lack of alternatives to Mata and Januzaj today to turn to.

1988~~~
I wonder what the reaction in this thread would be if we had won. I don't think he'd be getting as much criticism as he is. He wasn't <i>that </i>bad I didn't think. He still wasn't good and has to improve, but I thought it was an improvement on the Villa match.

1989~~~
How many matches until he gets dropped? I hope it is soon as he is no longer the player he was. He is nowhere near as fast as he was at his peak, that is obviously because he is older and on the way down. He is a major problem for United right now. He is certainly in no state to be a lone striker for a club like United.

1990~~~
I fully agree with this.

Unless he suffers a long term injury he should be returning at least 1 in 2 this season with the team he has operating behind him. No excuses. There's various strikers around Europe that would have no trouble whatsoever in hitting that target, whether they are available is completely irrelevant to the discussion, he's getting paid parity with an elite group and he needs to prove he's worth it other wise we should be looking to offload him and bring in someone who can or at least someone who can offer what Rooney does for a fraction of the cost.

1991~~~
Rooney is not bigger than the club. Becks left, and we survived. Ronaldo left, we got bigger commercially. Manchester United is the brand, not Rooney(although he himself is massive). Being with Adidas changes things also. It's more important the team does well....jersey sales will follow that.

1992~~~
To bad that first run of his was offside. Scoring a goal would have probably given him a good boost. He faded pretty quickly today again though.

1993~~~
What can I say that already hasn't been said?

He'll score a tap in on Wednesday night and people will give him the Torres treatment...

"Oh he's back!"

When in reality, he's not

1994~~~
SAF couldn't have been more right. Has been average at best for far too many seasons now.

1995~~~
Let's think at this for a minute, why is Rooney so highly regarded. When he came to UTD he was the best young English talent, UTD being an English club + being the best club in the league made him what he is today and obviously leading the line for his country. Now he is clearly on the wane, can he still produce for club and country? England have Sturridge, Welbeck, Kane, Berahino, Ings + Austin, out of them its debatable that Sturridge, Welbeck and Kane can produce and provide more than what Rooney can and this is where I'm starting to think, is Rooney irreplaceable? No, I think if UTD got let's say for arguments sake Harry Kane he could quite possibly take Rooneys place and become the Commercial face of the club and therefore country as well. I'd be willing to take that chance with Kane because let's face it, commercial revenue is important to a club and its time a new kid took over the mantle.

1996~~~
SAF didn't play him against Madrid....One of the biggest tests on the road to Wembley that year, in SAF's last CL campaign.....

What does that say....

1997~~~
Oh bollocks, stop making shit up. The majority of fans arent pleased with him and havent been for a while. Can you read?. Go check the various game threads, he is getting nailed every game.

1998~~~
Deserved though to be fair

1999~~~
He's just not very good at anything anymore is he? He's decent at a lot of things, but has no standout feature to his game. He's probably not even in a list of top 10 of PL strikers these days, never mind top 10 players. 

I honestly don't think he's as good as the likes of Bony and Benteke anymore, never mind Aguero and Costa.

2000~~~
Good God man get a grip for feck sake

2001~~~
The reaction would be the same. He got plenty of deserved criticism for his performances vs Spurs/Villa which we won. 

Fact is he's been woeful but I don't hold it against LVG if he doesn't go and get a striker, there's a real lack of quality available right now.

2002~~~
Yeah, what an utterly ridiculous suggestion.

I mean its not like Bony was the highest scoring PL player in 2014, or that Benteke had a 1 in 2 record playing for a very poor Villa side.

The idea on here that lesser name players can't be as good as the 'star names' is so irritating. I swear people just see the name, and completely ignore whats actually happening on the pitch.

2003~~~
Maybe that's not the case with Rooney he started his career at 16. Usually players peak at 27-30 but he might be an exception and has already peaked. I guess it was Scholes who said this that 2009-2012 was the peak of Rooney and day by day it feels that there is some truth to this. He never had any career threatening injury like Falcao so can't blame on injuries.
Also, I doubt he has the determination of someone like Giggs or Ronaldo to take care of his body or modify his game as in the case of Giggs.

2004~~~
There's an argument that having Rooney as the club's symbol (so to speak) is rather apt right now: a fading star matched with United's fading glory and status. While he's the symbol of the club, it's a tacit admission that we're paying lip service to United's reputation of being the biggest and best club in name only - though our Captain being both skipper of the club and of England <i>sounds</i> very impressive and something to be proud of, it really isn't while those two esteemed outfits are winning...nothing at all. And this want of genuine success may well continue if we keep on doing the very thing we've always mocked our rivals for; living in the past, with accompanying unmerited pride wholly unjustified by present achievements.

2005~~~
Yeah but he was better against Newcastle than he was in those other two. I am not saying he wouldn't have escaped criticism, but it would not have been as severe.

2006~~~
From a self proclaimed 'Rooney hater', I actually thought he was one of the better attacking players today. His performance was also an improvement on that vs Brugge. One nice flick does not constitute a good performance in my eyes. And for some reason, I felt quite sorry for him with the disallowed goal.At the end of the day, I want him to do well this season because our title challenge and run in other competitions largely depends on his form. Maybe I'm just feeling a little emotional <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> but yeah I honestly do hope he finds his feet.

2007~~~
Couldn't have said it better. My fear is that we might go down the path of Liverpool, always there but never taken seriously anymore.

2008~~~
That's a very good point. A lot of people are blinded by names and neglect what happens on the pitch. As things stand, Rooney lacks several things to be a successful United striker:

(1) He's lost his explosivity and thus couldn't get the better of defenders in most situations. He may be quick over 50 yards (I believe he is) but he is slow over 10 yards and this is more important, particuarly for a possession oriented style of play.

(2) His first touch and close control in tight spaces is average and thus his hold up play couldn't help the team significantly and he couldn't create enough space and chances for himself.

(3) He lacks the height and the physical strength to bully defenders and win duels in the air.

The combination of these three things means that Rooney may score goals but not enough for United to be successful. Even if he somehow scores 7-8 goals over the next 7-8 EPL games (it won't happen), he will inevitably suffer another prolonged goalscoring drought. The sooner United sell him the better. Otherwise, there is a distinct possibility that both United and Rooney become a laughing stock. This may sound now quite exaggerated but it is true.

Read the thread on Rooney's new contract from 13/14 season and you'll see that some posters predicted the current situation 18 months ago.

He performed better when he was dropped off the front behind Chicharito. Yesterday he lacked strength, pace and first touch, even his passing wasn't great. We need a striker to perform all the time and not in bursts. Aguero performs consistently for City and we need someone like this at United, I'm all for giving Chicharito a chance up front as his pace and movement is superior to Rooney.

2010~~~
No wonder his play is a bit ugly then. Sorry.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2011~~~
Giroud, yes him, has outscored Rooney in every season he has had in English foootball..and I wouldnt be suprised if he did again this season.

2012~~~
Was he unlucky with the offside goal? yes but all strikers have that happen to them throughout a game, that doesn't excuse the fact that bar that one chance he did not get himself into a clear cut scoring opportunity or look a genuine threat for the remainder of the game.

2013~~~
Bony and Benteke are lumps of wood who I have watched on numerous occasions. I'm frustrated as much as you but both them are a step or two down from Rooney. If you suggested they might be better in this system then that would be harder to argue with.

2014~~~
This sums the situation up pretty well I think. Most clubs have a tendency to hang on to players too long, hoping that they will return to the player who did so much in years past. 

He was made captain due to there being a real lack of leaders in the squad, you could argue that he isn't a great leader himself but thats by-the-by. Ultimately he needs to be replaced, I don't think the club will bring someone in to supersede him as it will cause too much fuss. Therefore the only way to get a top striker in is for Rooney to go and sadly that isn't happening this season.

2015~~~
Actually watched it again today, Coloccini switched off pretty early in the piece with his arm up. I think he would have probably got a slide in there somewhere and altered the path of events had  he not pulled up.

2016~~~
He spent his game drifting outside or trying to regulate the midfield, as if he was needed there, tactically he manages to destroy our attacking shape by himself, he is supposed to be the head of the spear but he refuses to play that role.

2017~~~
When he is captain he becomes too obsessed with being a teamplayer, he needs to become more selfish, take some defenders on, shoot from distance.

2018~~~
A strikers job is to score goals, if both of them can score more goals than Rooney now then how are they a step or two down. You are judging Rooney on what he did years ago not how he is today. Today he isn't even one of the top 6 forwards in the league, below is a list of forwards who put into our system I honestly believe would deliver more (no particular order):
<ul>
<li>Sturridge (when fit)</li>
<li>Benteke</li>
<li>Aguero</li>
<li>Costa</li>
<li>Giroud</li>
<li>Lukaku</li>
<li>Kane</li>
</ul>Maybes
<ul>
<li>Charlie Austin</li>
<li>Bony</li>
<li>Berahino</li>
</ul>I judge this on form over the last 18 months. 

To give a little more perspective here are Rooney's goal stats for the past few seasons.


<a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Manchester_United_F.C._season" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2012–13</a> - 16

Now 14-15 you could write off as being in midfield for half the season but for me those stats from all competitions just aren't a top striker.

2019~~~
Those are to me the return I would be expecting from a 2nd striker, with your main striker getting towards 30 goals. Unfortunately Wayne atm is our main striker. If we had a top class strikers as No. 1 those amount of goals would be valuable.

2020~~~
And yet he scores his goals more from a number 10? Costa and Augero I'll not debate as I agree, Kane we don't know yet. But the rest are way off in my opinion. You say you are judging this on the last 18 months and you have Sturridge on this list?

2021~~~
People are complicating the situation with Rooney , Even when I managed a kids football team I knew all about strikers that played for opposing teams
Now premier league teams have 1000 times more knowledge of players, they have dossiers on players strengths and weaknesses.
Quite simply he has been sussed, now for a young player they have to work on things to improve their fitness,touch, strength, everything to improve
their game, he just has to work his arse off to improve his game, Can he improve ? course he can, everybody can improve little things they do wrong.
Does he want to with no competition for his place?  I cannot answer that.

2022~~~
As did I. Well, not 'hate', but I've thought he was rubbish for a few years anyway.

2023~~~
With Sturridge I did say when fit. When fit he is a top forward for me, admittedly he is nowhere near fit enough but this is more judging IMO forwards that being fit and in our team would be better than Rooney. For me Charlie Austin would do exactly the same as Rooney now but probably get you a couple more goals.

Giroud for example has scored more goals than Rooney each season since he came to the prem.

2024~~~
He is clearly getting frustrated with his performance. I really hope for his sake and ours he scores in the next game.

2025~~~
But Giroud and Rooney have both played different roles? I'm not going to debate Austin as I think that's not even up for debate. Compare Austin with Darren Bent or Steven Fletcher not Wayne Rooney for feck sake.

2026~~~
Good post and nicely put. I don't think UTD are living in past on former glory, it hasn't been long since they won the league but as Fergie knew Rooney has started to fade and to win the league in his last season he had to bring a clinical striker in Van Persie if he wanted to win it again. If we continue using Rooney as the main man and the face of UTD as you say we will fall into the trap that we mock our rivals for, as many posters believe that Rooney can lead the line for us but forget that the last time he did was 4/5 years ago and he was 24/25 at the time, its been a long time and that fire he once had is almost out. It's time we bring in someone with more desire, more fire, something to prove and the way this league is now someone with more of a physical presence, height and strenght. I'm not the biggest fan of Kane but for some reason I think he can be that man, the new face of UTD.

2027~~~
In the second half I was pretty much in line with Newcastle's back line and that gave me a great view on Rooney's movement, or lack of it. Depay Mata and Januzaj could've all had better final ball, but I struggle to see how they can create chances for a forward who isn't gambling and making runs.

I thought he was shocking. He's lucky it wasn't him who missed the best chance of the game.

2028~~~

2029~~~
Yea it's definitely anyone's fault but his. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2030~~~
Barclay's comments seem more apt, not those of people lining up to write Wayne's 422nd 'autobiography'.

2031~~~
nobbled in training?

2032~~~
Get Phil Jones on it.

2033~~~
He was absolutely appalling vs Villa, top 5 worst games I've seen him play. Just because he was better than that doesn't mean he was anywhere close to the standard we need.

2034~~~
People should look back and ask themselves when was this mans last match winning performance for us? You know, the kind of match where he actually looked like a top player and delivered.

2035~~~
Atleast he is getting better. He has always been shite early on in the season. It's nothing new but now he has the added responsibility of being our top scorer.

2036~~~
Indeed. Exhibit A....

Exhibit B......

Good post. It's like the emperors new clothes. The illusion of a world class player but the reality is he has been living on a reputation of what he did 4 or 5 years ago. United are in the middle of a rebuilding process and getting rid of him will be part of that process if they want to be competitive both in the PL and in Europe.

2037~~~
Yeah I agree, if anything it's Rooney whose hurting Mata. Mata need's a striker with movement that plays on the shoulder of defenders he can feed, he's got no where to go with Rooney constantly dropping deep and wanting the ball to feet.

2038~~~
I really don't get this "he wasn't bad".. "he played better" stuff.. he's not Januzaj or Depay, he's the captain of our team and supposedly at his peak age. He gets paid a hell of a lot of money and is happy to have his ugly mug plastered on any bit of worthless tat going.

I wonder if this is really Wayne's real problem, there's always people to make excuses for him.

I genuinely can't think of a Man Utd player I have disliked more than Rooney. Hernandez may or not be a better option, but I'd certainly feel happier about seeing him on the pitch than Rooney every week.

2039~~~
Ogden is a Rooney fanboy..After the Preseason where Rooney and Depay partnership looked out of sorts and was promptly abandoned by LVG he wrote this: 



After watching the preseason games I didnt know whether he had watched any of the games...Its that kind of thinking that makes me ignore much of what these hacks write

2040~~~
Wow, never had time for this bloke and never understood why he is held in such high regard on this place. Whenever I see him in the press conferences he comes across as really gormless. 

I remember around the time that Rooney was linked with Bayern a while ago, they had Honigstein on Sunday supplement and he basically laughed and said that a club like Bayern would never try to sign a player like Rooney whose lack of professionalism makes him a bit of a joke in Germany.

2041~~~
Michael Sammer( Bayern Director of sport) when asked about Rooney in 2013:

I think that is the reason why we are stuck with him, no self respecting big European club would have him, especially at the wages we give for such perfomaces.

2042~~~
That is supposedly why we got rid of RvP and Falcao, yet it has no difference at all.

2043~~~
Bayern showing a lack of imagination there - they could've tied a pie to the back of Robben, and Wayne would run all day.

2044~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I can't get that picture out of my head.

2045~~~
Or a 375k a week contract.

2046~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I was only joking, tbh. Even if Wayne is essentially <i>Rocky VI</i> these days, he doesn't strike me as being particularly out of shape.

2047~~~
I've just read this and it mostly it's ridiculous. Imagine that, he's been said to that he's a nr. 9. Well guess what Custis, he is a striker and best of his seasons were when he played as one. Problem is it doesn't seem like he'll copy one of those seasons. Add to that that he says he doesn't seem to wander and he's doing 4 jobs on the pitch. Why is he doing 4 jobs, why is he all over the place when he's a striker and should play like one. That is exactly wandering with no real purpose Custis or better yet it's disrupting our play most of the time. Chicharito came in as a sub and in the short time he was in the game was in the chance strikers should be in, I mean collecting a deflected ball and score. Chicharito didn't score but he was there, he was tracking the situation and he was in the right place in a right time. Rooney woulnd't have been there cause he would probably be somewhere on top of the penalty box trying to make a one two with someone.

Also Ogden is speaking bollocks too. Mata is slow and ineffective? Mata was one of our most active players yesterday, always seeking the ball, always running, trying to do something with the ball and passing. But no Ogden bashes Mata and says Rooney needs pace around him. It's the other way around, Mata needs pace around him and Rooney doesn't offer that.
And imagine those two guys are payed as sport journalists..

All this coming from a Rooney fan mind you. He has been my favorite player for a while (not popular opinion I know) but I won't turn a blind eye on his performances.

2048~~~
My ratings for Rooney in the first four games have been 5,4,5,5.

2049~~~
Yes, too much Football Manager games and blind to the reality that Rooney is actually past his best. Even Stevie Wonder would notice how bad Rooney has become in comparison to how good he USED to be.

2050~~~
I'd say that's generous.

2051~~~
Is there something up with the ratings on his profile? Says his lowest rating of the season is 6.4 against Villa <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2052~~~
Fanboys secretly giving him 8 and 9's.

2053~~~
Looked on other players and it seems to just be an issue with the ratings. At first I thought it was team ratings but then Darmian has highest rating of 6.3 and lowest of 6.7 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2054~~~
They seem a bit high.

2055~~~
MLS would die to have him. He would be The Second Coming of Beckham for the league and they would spend massively for that. Especially if he is the record goalscorer for Engalnd and MUFC.

Rooney could even play for the Miami Beckhams, the team will be starting in a year or two and the potential promotional value is massive for the league and team.

2056~~~
Wow. Didn't know journalist in other country have better understanding.

2057~~~
Didn't know they're that rich.

2058~~~
Yeah, but Giroud isn't a big name, so obviously Rooney is better. Dur!

Big lumps of wood that have both scored more PL goals then Rooney in the last 2 years. 

If you seriously think they're a step down from the Rooney we see nowadays, then you're wearing a very impressive pair of red tinted spectacles.

'Peak Rooney' was of course a lot better, but we haven't seen him for at least 3 years. And thats being generous, its probably more like 5

2059~~~
When was the last time you thought, Rooney was world class that game? i cant remember because he is far from world class. Hes a very good player capable of world class moments but not performances

2060~~~
Tottenham home last season, but that's probably because of the low standards I hold for our players since Fergie retired.

2061~~~
What were your ratings?

2062~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qqef7VbEf5o?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2064~~~
5,1,5,4.

I think I was generous with the Spurs rating though to be honest.

2065~~~
Rooney should wear electric underwear, and every time he decides to not stay upfront, Giggs pushes a button and fry his ass.

2066~~~
50,000 volts should do the trick <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2067~~~
I would love for Rooney to be back to his best, he has come back in the past. But I do not see him coming back to his best this time. Age has caught up with him and SAF was going to get rid of him as he realised that his best days were behind him. He still puts in the effort but when you get older it all catches up. He should not be captain, and he should be dropped. The least he needs is a kick up the ass by being dropped. He has not shown anything to deserve otherwise. This is not FIFA computer game this is real life football.

2068~~~
At some point if Rooney doesnt improve LVG will bite the bullet and drop him to the bench. For Rooneys sake it needs to be sooner than later.

2069~~~

2072~~~
Would love him to bang in a few goals and give it the West Ham celebration in front of the camera. Still back him 100%

2073~~~
Pictorial summary of his season so far.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2074~~~
That goal should hopefully give him a lot of confidence.

2075~~~
Delighted for him. Hopefully it rejuvenates him.

2076~~~
Was that his first one on one with a GK since Walker's OG?

2077~~~
I shall no longer shell Wazza Rodney?

2078~~~
Get into and stay in those positions and he'll get chances. Only player in the squad you could count on to finish that chance, maybe Mata too

2079~~~
I think we're into the 5 games this season where he's going to be unplayable, can we rearrange City and Chelsea H&A for the next 4 games please?

2080~~~
The goal he scored against the barcodes was one on one wasnt it?

2081~~~
So somehow he has managed to put the ball in the net 3 times in 3 one on ones this season.

2082~~~
Nice finish from Rooney. Hopefully this spurs better performances.

2083~~~
Amazing link-up and chemistry he has with Memphis. Took the goal well, very clever finish!

2084~~~
Great to see. He clearly is a confidence player (for lack of better terminology) and showed it with that ball to Memphis. Hope he gets another tonight - he will have his chance, the way Memphis is playing.

2085~~~
He can't take any credit for the Spurs goal. 

His finishing hasn't let him down in ages tbf. Just not getting on the end of enough chances. For which he should share the blame, thanks to spending too much time too deep.

2086~~~
Of course he has, and will.

2087~~~
I'm sure there will be people who call that a tap in but he did brilliantly to let it across his body and not snatch at it, particularly for a player on a goal drought.

2088~~~
That's fair.

2089~~~
Here comes the diluted praise through gritted teeth. Great goal.

2090~~~
1/30

2091~~~
My two-year old could have scored that.

2092~~~
Needed the goal. Hopefully he goes on a scoring run now.

2093~~~
Oh come on, it was a well taken finish.

2094~~~
Hopefully the start of his season now.

2095~~~
Gotta give credit where it's due. He was very good this half. Hopefully he can build on this performance.

2096~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2097~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
There's always one or in Rooney's case a few. 

Guy scores a very nice goal but you have guys like this posting this kind of stuff.

2098~~~
Good finish and much better today, looking a lot sharper.

Let's hope it kick starts his season, because we fecking need a top level Rooney.

2099~~~
Hope he kicks on now. Been decent so far.

2100~~~
That was a really clever turn and a good, sharp finish.

Hopefully he finds his form and does so quickly. This is a huge season for him and I'm far from certain he's good enough, consistently enough. Would love him to prove me wrong.

2101~~~
2/30

2102~~~
Why's Rooney so apparently religious all of a sudden?

2103~~~
Scoring two in a dead rubber against Club Brugge is gonna convince LVG we don't need a striker.

2104~~~
Wayne Rooney follows an excellent dive with an excellent goal... he really is back!

2105~~~
It's hard to just say he had a good game so far, right? Really hard.

2106~~~
Might be past his best but he's still a quality striker. Feels like such a relief to see him scoring so confidently again.

2107~~~
Really happy with his goals today. Overall play has also been better than ages. Hoping he gets his first league goal on Sunday.

2108~~~
No I'm delighted for him just think signing a striker is imperative for us before the window closes.

2109~~~
As a back up to Rooney?

2110~~~
To use the recently popular caf word, there are lots of 'embarrassing' posters in this thread posting shite like that.

2111~~~
Direct competition.

2112~~~
Nah.

2113~~~
I think he'd thrive on it.

2114~~~
Hat trick!

2115~~~
Hat trick! Don't use all your goals tonight Wayne <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2116~~~
fecking Rooney knows how to score in bunches!

2117~~~
Brilliant for him, didn't expect to see him getting a hat-trick tonight at all.

2118~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2119~~~
Get the feck in. Delighted for him. Will do him a world of good this... Rooney's back <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2120~~~
Great stuff.

Hope he can keep this up.

2121~~~
More goals than Messi and Ronaldo combined.

But haters will say it's only Club Brugge <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2122~~~
Sell him <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2123~~~
Quality finishing, let's hope it carries on

2124~~~
This was one lethal hattrick.

2125~~~
That is some midfield though.

2126~~~
So is he good again or still shit?

2127~~~
Well, to be fair, he's now got to prove he can continue this form over a longer period of time. I imagine that's what his detractors will say - doesn't make them haters. But still, brilliant for him to get three goals, almost got a 4th too!

2128~~~
Yeah he would, but it would mean signing a player who is too good, to be spending too much time on the bench. We are going to be playing with one striker. The majority of the games will be with Rooney, so we just need a back up striker.

2129~~~
Depends on Swansea Sunday!

2130~~~
Bit difficult to draw many conclusions from this. 

It's obviously fantastic that Rooney has got his finishing back. Nobody should underestimate how good that is.

However, I'll be very interested to see what he's like against another PL side next time. Brugge are a bit pants and Rooney has a lot more space than most games.

2131~~~
Ya that's a fair point.

2132~~~
Three in five so far this season. Great scoring rate, hope he keeps up his good form through the season.

2133~~~
Great finishing today but he needs to do this consistently.

2134~~~
Delighted for him after all the sniping and 'he's finished' nonsense. Not going to get carried away though, these guys are village, relatively speaking.

2135~~~
I think he will.

2136~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> The Caf is in reverse meltdown now. Just wait until our next 0-0.

He's been great tonight, to be fair. I think LVG has told him to stop dropping deep and just let the midfield deal with things. He hasn't looked this eager to score in a very long time.

2137~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2138~~~
one more and he can match Falcao's whole last year output <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2139~~~
It's not easy to score 3 goals in training so fair play to him, hope he builds on it!

2140~~~
Did not want him to start. Has proved many people (me included) wrong. Excellently taken goals, all of them.

2141~~~
4-0 Herrera, what a cracking night!

2142~~~
I hope he gets 20+ games for Chelsea <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2143~~~
Proven me wrong tonight. I thought Chicharito should've started.

2144~~~
Great to see him scoring again. Hope this gives him enough confidence to also be successful in the league. I don't want to diminish his success but it's still only Bruges he has scored against so I'm not getting my hopes up too much but still positive he will perform a lot better from now on.

2145~~~
Done very well tonight so let's start the Fellaini 9 experiment please. Keep him fresh for Sunday.

2146~~~

2147~~~
his movement and decision making has been really good. first touch is coming back aswell. He always was a fantastic finisher. Even without the goals hes done as good as can be expected from striker position

2148~~~
You know what Wayne? You may have just done enough to keep your place in my Fantasy team this weekend. Calm the feck down though you won't be the captain.

2149~~~
Baffled he didn't take the penalty. I know there's a hierarchy and all that I doubt Hernandez is on top of that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2150~~~
yeah just real odd. Get his confidence back to sky high levels with a fourth should have been the obvious.

2151~~~
He gave it to Hernandez so he gets a goal as well. I thought that was very nice of him, shame it was missed

2152~~~
3 goals in 5 matches <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2153~~~
Exactly what we needed from him tonight. I think many of us know that his very best days are probably gone footballing wise, but he showed tonight that he's certainly still capable of being a very good goalscorer when on form. If he can keep that up and remain fit, hopefully we won't have too many problems up front. Hopefully...

2154~~~
Very happy for him, hope this performance gives him bags of confidence and he can kick off right away against Swansea because we'll need him to.

2155~~~
Rooney is only about 18 penalty misses from being back on top of the pecking order now.

2156~~~
I hope he'll continue this in the PL. Played like a proper striker tonight finally.

2157~~~
He really needed a performance like that. It wasn't only his goals, he was great all over the pitch by actually contributing to attacks.

2158~~~
Once he started scoring, it felt like his whole game began to improve as his confidence had been boosted. Positive to see.

2159~~~
Played well tonight .Took his three goals very well.But i'll wait to see how he goes in the PL against Swansea.

2160~~~
Fantastic tonight, hopefully he can build on this performance.

2161~~~
Knew he had it in him.

2162~~~
Good to see him put the goals away. Big test re Swansea - needs to do it there for starters.

2163~~~
Well fecking played Wayne. feck the haters. Great all round performance. Class is permanent - form is temporary.

2164~~~
That should shut a few people up.

2165~~~
Fair fecking play, and to give him credit: he got the deliveries he needed and duly delivered. Let's hope the floodgates now open and he can use this confidence to crack on.

2166~~~
If only.

2167~~~
Well done Wayne. Now carry this forward you beautiful (not)bald bastard.

2168~~~
I've criticized him when I have felt he deserved it, it would not be fair to praise him when he does well..so well done

2169~~~
Great game tonight. A bit more of that against PL opposition please.

2170~~~
Can't believe the dumb feck interviewer just asked what the celebration was about as if it was new.

2171~~~
Fantastic performance as striker tonight. Finally his season starts.  Very happy for him

2172~~~
Three good first time finishes (first was very neat) and a generally solid game tonight. Needs to kick on from here now and hopefully that convinces him to stay on the shoulder of the defenders more often.

2173~~~
Seemed to stay right up front a lot more tonight. Hopefully he'll get a few more if Memphis, Herrera and Mata play around him.

2174~~~
I liked the "if you'd have been paying attention" reply <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2175~~~
I know<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Wayne gave him the right answer.

2176~~~
Yea definitely <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2177~~~
Yes he didn't track back so much and tried to get involved, stayed up front and waited for the balls to come in and fortunately for him they came. Three really nice finishes.

2178~~~
Great finishing tonight and much better all round game.

Fair play to him.

2179~~~

2180~~~
A real strikers performance tonight. I've been one of his biggest critics but tonight he played to his current strengths, long may it continue.

2181~~~
I knew we should have never doubted Rooney all along. One of the best players to set foot in our club.

2182~~~
Excuse my ignorance. Seen him do it loads but not sure what it's about?

2183~~~
Good performance, but I'm not so sure he'd be able to do what he did tonight against decent Premier League opposition.

We still need the likes of Lewandoski or Benzema to challenge for the titles available.

I hope we sign a big striker by Monday or this season is going to be a tough one.

2184~~~
Coleens younger sister who died.

2185~~~
Thanks the lord.

2186~~~
I don't know either <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2187~~~
Same, delighted with tonight but will reserve most judgement on Rooney for Sunday at Swansea.

2188~~~
He played well but one good performance against substandard opposition doesn't end the doubts after countless poor performances. He needs to consistently do this. No point getting knee jerk and saying he's back to his best.

2189~~~
Don't think anyone has?

2190~~~
I enjoyed that too. Can't believe a professional has never noticed that before.

2191~~~
Guys, chill. I'm not a Rooney hater. That was a joke following on from the poster I quoted.

2192~~~
Sorry then. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2193~~~
To be fair, I don't recall it before and was wondering what it was about. I thought it was a tribute to Frank Lampard's mum.

2194~~~
He's been doing it since 2013.

2195~~~
Did really well tonight. 

That's what I've been wanting to see from him, actually playing on the shoulder and being willing to run in behind and occupy that striker's position. Massive improvement, and we've got enough creativity behind him to be able to put him through a few times per game.

2196~~~
No offence taken.

2197~~~
Rooneys goals are like busses.

They are extremley frustrating to rely on, but sometimes get you out of a sticky situation.

2198~~~
It seems to me him and Memphis have a nice understanding, play with each other a lot, little passes, backheels, it's like they have some combinations from training. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2199~~~
The difference for Rooney tonight was having Herrera on the pitch.  Hope LvG plays him at the weekend.  If he does Rooney will score for sure.

2200~~~
Let's hope this kick starts his season. He's 4 goals away from Dennis Law and another 17 goals he will overtake Sir Bobby Charlton.

2201~~~
Needed that tonight. He gets his goals in spurts so hoping for another at Swansea on Sunday.

2202~~~
Sucking up to the captain so he will beg LVG to get him back into the team!

2203~~~
17 more goals for the record.

2204~~~
Haters? <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

2205~~~
Shhhh, back to the dungeon you go Dave.

2206~~~
His movement tonight was fantastic. It's obvious playing a proper 10 behind him actually helps a lot. Keep Herrera at 10 and Rooney will do very well.

2207~~~
De GeON?  <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Rooney was excellent tonight. If he gets service like this every game and stops playing like a midfielder, he'd get 25-30 for the season. It is up to him to keep disciplined and stay up-front, and it is up to our midfield to not be so **** that he has to come back and help them out - finally, this transfer window may be the one to have fixed that problem. 

Now he needs to do it in the PL.

2208~~~
Surprising how when he stops trying to be everywhere and do everything, and instead has some faith in his team mates and stays up front he scores. Hope its sunk in.

2209~~~
That helped but today he was actually moving dragging defenders with him and thus creating space for the schemers to do their thing. Well taken goals though but if we want to challenge we need a back up striker because with Rooney you never know - he could go on a run scoring for fun then an injury or suspension puts him off his game for weeks.

2210~~~
the first goal was exactly the opposite

2211~~~
For sure.  Always need another striker or at least be able to count on the other strikers we already have hitting the back of the net.  I think wilson / lingard have to get a chance next before chicharito gets anymore game time now.

2212~~~
Got MOTM from me today. Hope he replicates this on Sunday. Time for him to hit his 'purple patch' properly. Need some goals in the Premier League.

2213~~~
Lingard is not a striker if I'm not mistaken.

2214~~~
Well from what Ive seen of him he could def do a job in that position.  He has an eye for goal.  Did you think Januzaj was a number is 10 before this season?

2215~~~
Well his best position is nr. 10. Not that he showed it this season though.

2216~~~
I think there was a thread on this last season but his finishing is pretty underrated, if we create some decent chances then Rooney is likely to put them in more often than not

2217~~~
3 goals in 5 games this season, not a bad start to the season <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

Like I said before though, it's daft to write him off at the age of 29. No player goes from looking like a pub player one week to looking world class the next like Rooney. He may not be as good as he was in 2010 but he's still a class player that hit a rough patch of form. Hopefully he keeps it up, as an on form Rooney can drag us to the title and give us what we lack going forward.

2218~~~
I saw nothing impressive about his opposition today, whereas his personal performance, you can just look at his stat and say, "he did well because he scored a hat-trick." With two tough games coming up in the premier league, his performance in those match should be more compelling.

2219~~~
8th hattrick in his career, and first of several overtakings of Sir Bobby Charlton he'll do soon, who has 7 of them. Dennis Violett is ahead with 9, Jack Rowley with 12 and Denis Law with astonishing 18 hattricks!

2220~~~
The legend is back!

2221~~~
Rooney ending a lengthy goal drought with a hattrick. I remember him doing the same thing at Bolton years ago.

2222~~~
Great, great performance from him tonight. If he carries this on consistently and I don't mean every game, then I will gladly quote myself at the end of the season saying that he's well past it. I criticise him a lot but will give him credit where credits due. As others have posted,  he just needs to stay up front and stop dropping deep as he did tonight and the goals will come to him. I am still skeptical though; it's hard to let go of such a view after arguing it for so long but more of this and I will be won over.

2223~~~
Fantastic for him, one touch finishes but all well taken so he deserves praise. I've never doubted his finishing, but his movement was sublime today, hope he kicks on. Motm.

2224~~~
Do it on Sunday (and the rest of the season for that matter) Wayne and i'll hold my hands up and say i've perhaps been too critical of u. Until then i remain unconvinced.Bruges were dreadful.

2225~~~
Legend. His performance tonight was the perfect riposte. Now let's celebrate your 30th year with 30+ goals. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2226~~~
I know it was Brugge, but that doesn't discount the quality of his finishing. The defending wasn't great, but he still had to finish, and those finishes were exceptional against any opposition whether it be a Sunday league team or Barcelona. Excellent.

2227~~~
Apparently he was finished.

2228~~~
Can only play what's in front of you, but Brugge were dreadful.

Sunday is a bigger test. I'd imagine if Rooney is poor well panic and get another forward in.

2229~~~
A bit of perspective, the last time a United player scored a hattrick was the 19th of March in 2014 (RVP vs Olympiakos).

2230~~~
Jaysus.

2231~~~
Can't you just be happy for United's captain that he scored his hat trick and ended the goal drought?

2232~~~
That first goal is basically the same chance that Hernandez chuffed against Newcastle

2233~~~
Nice to have him back in goal scoring form. I'm fully expecting him to push on score many more over the next few weeks.

2234~~~
Only for the sake of giving Hernandez minutes - he was terrible tonight. Good thing i'm not a betting man.

2235~~~
Missed the game and still find a way to moan about Rooney 

Nice

2236~~~
I would be happy, if he can emulate some of this same performance in our next two games or any upcoming important matches we have. Moreover, improve his bottom level to a point that we are not playing with a handicap when he is on the field.

Re watched full match highlight.

2237~~~
Till the weekend.

2238~~~
Honestly won't be convinced until he starts banging them in vs the PL opposition

2239~~~
Delighted for Rooney and I really do hope he finds form again.  However, I take tonight's goals with a big pinch of salt when you see the opposition.  If he can score a hat trick on Sunday then he will have proven himself more than tonight.  You can only play against what is in front of you so at least he took his chances tonight.

2240~~~
I liked how his post match interview when asked about his celebration he just said he'd been doing it for two years if they paid attention

2241~~~
It was club brugge...yeah sorry not convinced

2242~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> such a stupid question.

Also "What have you done with the match ball?"

"Uh, nothing yet it's still in the dressing room"

2243~~~
The fickle nature of this thread over the years is truly embarrassing.

2244~~~
I don't think anyone will be or should be bar the kneejerkers. He will be judged on his performances against PL opposition.

2245~~~
The negativity - or "caution", as some like to call it - is bloody ridiculous in here. It's only the 9th hat-trick in his career and you lot can't even take a moment to savour it. In their entire league careers here van Nistelrooy managed 5, Cole, Solskjaer and Yorke managed 3, Scholes managed 2...I don't know their overall records but that's besides the point, really. The point is it's such a rare thing and all you can think about is ways to dismiss and downplay it. That's sad.

2246~~~
Hopefully he gets to play with a player who won't be losing the ball every other touch in behind him.

2247~~~
Unfortunately couldn't watch the game, but delighted for him!

2248~~~
Played like a 9, and did not drop too deep and scored goals, more of the same please from now on.

2249~~~
Feck the haters!

2250~~~
He had a good game and this should do wonders for his confidence. Although the service was much better, the credit goes to him for his finishing and positioning. He also found Memphis with a good pass who should have done better. 
Let's hope he can kick on from here. The team needs it as much as he personally does.

2251~~~
that was more like it.

hope this form transpires into the league and his confidence with it too.

2252~~~
Regardless of the early form he's going to have a record breaking season this season

England all time record goal scorer
Man Utd all time record goal scorer in Europe
Man Utd all time record goal scorer period
Will break into the top 10 record appearances for Man Utd

2253~~~
Exactly, all the over the top praise is funny on here, currently bruge are 5th in their very poor league, on top of that they were playing without 8 of their first XI players, so.....

2254~~~
And yet, players like januzaj, Carrick didn't do much. He played well, scored a hat trick. Just enjoy it.

2255~~~
Oh right. But when Memphis had a great game against them on his debut last week and was getting all that praise you didnt point that out did you?

2256~~~
Grand. Now bring the goals to the league.

Brugge were absolutely awful though, so I've got not real OTT Praise for any of our players tonight.  That's probably the easiest hat trick he's had other than the set-piece affair against Arsenal.

2257~~~
Took all the 3 goals well and played with some actual energy tonight, need to see it in a few games in the PL before phoenix style poetry is written. .

2258~~~
Depay hasn't proven himself in the league (he's been a bit shit tbh)...and Rooney has it all to prove as well. I'm not sure what your point is?

2259~~~
Not going to get involved with the 'feck the haters' or 'still not convinced' argument. Just going to say that I'm pleased he got some goals, and hopefully he can put a good run together now and score more.

2260~~~
Wayne Rooney has a lot less to prove in the Premier League than Memphis Depay.

It's just the usual United fan crap about Rooney. Any other player in the team scores a hat trick and the response is 100% positive. Rooney does it and it's all 'well, Brugge are shit aren't they?'

2261~~~
No Rooney has been shit for months and he has scored a hattrick against brugge. Jury is still out obviously. Don't know what your hypothetical's are about?

Edit - Removed the mean parts!

2262~~~
This.

2263~~~
I literally have no idea what you're trying to say here.

This forum wouldn't respond to any other player in the team scoring a hat trick tonight with a churlish 'well, Brugge are rubbish anyway, it means nothing.'

2264~~~
Basically what I'm saying is that Rooney's poor performance in the league shouldn't be dismissed because of a crappy tie against Club Brugge.

2265~~~
No-one's dismissing it. This performance doesn't erase the poor ones, but nor does it somehow 'not count'.

2266~~~
My opinion is that the Brugge Hattrick should be dismissed and he should be judged on his league performances. I mean Brugge are shit....

2267~~~
I've been slamming him for a long time now, but a good game from him. Hope he carries it into the league.

2268~~~
He's always been a notoriously slow starter. I was starting to wonder if he was ever going to get it back. But yup a hattrick is a good way to jump start the system, Brugge or no.  Let's hope he's finally back in the groove.  

Our back-ups strikers are worrying though.

2269~~~
I've defended Rooney, and I'm not surprised by his goals.

Give him the service and the chances, and he will put them away.

2270~~~
sure, brugge had lots of key players out for the tie and they were poor, but hat trick is a hat trick, rooney obviously still had to move into goal scoring positions and finish the chances in front of him.

personally I am not saying today's performance absolves rooney of all the past poor performances he gave this year in the league (yet) but let's hold the horses and wait until he plays more league games to draw conclusions about his performance against brugge before dismissing his long-waited goalscoring performance as a one off or purely down to poor oposition.

2271~~~
It was about time. Rooney and Memphis are developing a great understanding. I think that is why LVG did not substitute them to get that engine running. The more games they play together, the more goals we shall see from both of them.

2272~~~
Yes, Brugge is shit.  But as others have mentioned, a hat trick is a hat trick and hopefully Rooney can kick off from here.  We've played plenty of shitty teams in the past year and have still looked like shit.  We looked amazing yesterday and our captain had his first great game in a while, let's celebrate the win ffs!

2273~~~
It was only Club Brugge - so his goals don't count. Neither do Memphis or Fellaini last week especially since those were at home. Herrera's performance today was meaningless as was Smalling's or anyone else for that matter.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Um yes they count in what was a crucial game for our season.</span>

2274~~~
I would hate to be a Rooney hater.

2275~~~
It may be my imagination, but to me, it looked like that first goal really changed him for the better. Looked nothing like the player we saw the first four games

Lets just hope this keeps up. We really need Rooney in form

2276~~~
Wayne Rooney, world class player! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2277~~~
Whinge whinge fecking whinge

2278~~~
Some people are now saying "It was only Brugge".
Last week they were getting orgasmic about Memphis scoring against them

2279~~~
If he'll score on Sunday maybe it will be cause Swansea was shit on the night.

It's hard for some to give him praise it seems.

2280~~~
He is still our best player!

2281~~~
Given his whole football career to United, is one of the hardest working team players in the world, even when he isn't playing well. His hat trick was more about players starting to gel and create better movement, which is very encouraging.

2282~~~
Sadly, only saw the highlights but every one of Rooney's finishes were excellent. Rooney seems to have run the lines well. All his goals can be attributed to excellent off the ball movement, and being able to drift off the back of the Bruges defence. Some people will say we played a poor team, yet we've struggled to break down poor teams recently. Great to see Rooney playing like <i>that</i> again.

2283~~~
Exactly. Even teams a tier or two below, in cup games last season. Our attacking football was very encouraging, irrespective of the opposition.

2284~~~
I'm really happy for rooney hopefully he can replicate it in the league but people are getting a little carried away Brugge were awful probably equivalent to a championship team and left gaps all over the pitch to be exploited,

we won't get that open space in any league matches or against Swansea this sunday.

Hope the team and rooney can put in a similar performance but it'll be 100x tougher.

2285~~~
Not sure I would go that far.

2286~~~
Stoked for him to be honest. He still has plenty in the tank.

I have always stressed that the people losing their onion over the previous four performances was absolutely absurd. They have no credibility at all now, instead of being patient and reserving their right to lose the plot they now have to backtrack and such. It was completely uncalled for.

Just be patient for heavens sake. Lets look forward to this Swansea game and remember, he may not have another incredible performance and score a bunch of goals. They are a good team and Van Gaal said he respects them and I think he will set up cautiously. Relax people, just enjoy the show instead of throwing fruit.

2287~~~

2288~~~
The key was great service - Rooney had more chances to score in the game than he's had this season - nice finishing tho - thought he was a cert for that 4 and good of him to give the penalty to Chicha

2289~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant.

2290~~~
So much for the crap service eh? Good movement for the 1st and 3rd and he looked a lot sharper. Hope he can kick on and make an impact like this in the prem because we sure need it.

2291~~~
In this game, you mean? I don't agree with that. As far as the campaign to date goes, the service has been very poor up until this morning.

2292~~~
As long as we're playing teams from a third tier league every week then Rooney's gonna tear it up!

2293~~~
I know it was only Brugge, but it has to do wonders for his confidence. I've a feeling he will score at the weekend now.

2294~~~
That's fecking gold.

2295~~~
The service for him was perfect in this game. It won't be like that every week and he still has to show he can do more in the league where we are struggling. He stayed up top last night too which I think helped. Wasn't convinced when he dropped down after Hernandez came on but before that with Memphis, Herrera and mata behind that surely is the way forward for now.

2296~~~
Was a great opportunity for three players low on confidence to get some relief. Well, 2 out of 3 ain't that bad too. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

2297~~~
After reading the last few pages, it's a joy reading the salty tears of the Rooney-bashers. Honestly, why can't you be happy that a player of the team you're supposed to be supporting score a hatrick after a long run of no goals. Rooney had a good game and that will give him the world of good. Confidence will be high now, not just for him but for the whole team. Them knowing that if Rooney gets chances, he will score will be a relief for them. How confident do you think they'll be if Rooney had a Hernandez game last night? Misses a penalty and a sitter. "Shit, we've got this guy leading the attack for us...".

Brugge or not. It's a hatrick. Hoping he gets a goal vs Swansea now.

2298~~~
Fecking hell! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2299~~~
Credit to Rooney, he looked a different player yesterday, and took his goals very well. I think the only thing that can be drawn from that though is confidence, and he will still need to get better if he is to make a similar impact in the league or against proper European football teams. We efffectively beat this team 7-0, not counting a goal we kindly scored for them, and it could have been much worse. I don't think Rooney's finishing was ever in doubt, the question for me was about him getting himself into enough situations to showcase it to an extent where he can get 25 goals. In both legs against Brugges, we created far more than any league game. The times when Rooney was isolated one on one with his man he still struggled to go by him, and we may need a little more self-sufficiency from him, especially while we are creating one proper chance a game in the league.

2300~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2301~~~
He was more disciplined yesterday and stayed upfront, it's when he gets frustrated and starts going deep he becomes ineffective. But happy for him that he could shut a few people up for a few games at least. He had only played 3 games before yesterday and people were writing him off, some fans are so fickle.

He may not be the same player he used to be but was encouraging to see that his finishing is still top class.

2302~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> outstanding

2303~~~
He was terrific last night. Even his all round game was on the mark. His movement, finishing, it all came together. Hoping he kicks his league campaign off this Sunday.

2304~~~
Credit where it's due, he played well last night and took the goals well. But we have to remember the standard of opposition, we will see how he copes vs Swansea this weekend.

2305~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Not fecking Rodgers as J.Snow

2306~~~
That probably holds true for our entire attack. Brugge seemed to give us ridiculous amounts of space. But that doesn't mean we didn't have to play well. Need to show it against Swansea. They will certainly attack us but I doubt they'll be as porous as Brugge.

2307~~~
Brilliant playing on the shoulder of the last defender too. Loved watching that yesterday, was a big difference from the other games.

2308~~~
Still does not offer us what we need in a number 9 for this team. Does not run the channels, his first movement is back and not forward. He has a very poor first touch. Can't beat a man. Even with Herrera's goal last night. It was a perfect example. See the difference between Wayne and Ander who is not even a no.9. Now im not talking about space and what the movement of both players did but just the mindset. One is looking to run in past the back line whereas one wants to move back into midfield and help. 

Glad he got 3 goals last night as he really needs to get 25 goals + for us to stand any chance of winning the premier league but we do need a genuine no. 9 and one that can worry defenders. I feel with Rooney, defenders feel comfortable due to his lack of penetration.

2309~~~
You can only score against what's in front of you, and he did that against Brugge. The chances created were on a plate, tbf, so credit to him for putting them away and credit to the players supplying him. It'll be a different story in the PL where you don't have as much time and space on the ball, I fear, but we shall see what happens come the weekend.

2310~~~
The difference last night was he had movement in and around him, the premier league games especially the supporying players have been very static.

2311~~~
I agree with other posters that Rooney has to put in performances like this in the Prem as well. More importantly, he has to  play consistently well over the course of the whole season and not to relapse into mediocrity as it happened in previous years. One can score a hat trick in the Prem. Fecking Wilson did it few days ago vs Wham for fecking Bournemouth. The crucial thing is that United be successful and this won't hapen if Rooney is inconsistent. So, the best way for Rooney to respond to critics is not to score many goals in several games but to be consistently good for United. Because, otherwise, if we rely on Depay and Januzaj for consistency, we'll finish behind Liverpool in the league, i.e. outside top 4.

2312~~~
1) He might play well and score.
2) He might play well and not score.
3) He might play badly and score.
4) He might play badly and not score.
5) He might have an average game and score.
6) He might have an average game and not score.

1, 3 and 5 will see him getting praise. 2, 4 and 6 will see him getting pelters.

And it was ever thus.

2313~~~
Credit where its due, a clear-cut chance still needs to be converted and he did it 3 times in one match. Hopefully this will regain him some confidence.

2314~~~
7) he might get injured and score (with Colleen).

2315~~~
I hope we get to see the Rooney of 09/10 and 11/12, again. What a sight that could be!

2316~~~
His movement and touch looked 1000x better last night, maybe it was the opposition but he looked quick again too. 

It's frustrating that he has such a contrast Between his best and worst form, he needs to find a level of consistency. If he plays like that against Swansea i will be very pleased

2317~~~
I don't think it was the opposition. He looked sharp and the goals were very well taken. Rooney has looked like a pub player against as poor teams in the past, I think last night could be the start of a good run of form for him. Cross the fingers!

2318~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> !!

2319~~~

2320~~~
I also think he looked better in the second half when Januzaj came off. I do feel its been crowded in there for him possibly. Having a runner from a deep midfield role really seemed to improve our game I thought.

2321~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what did I just watch?

2322~~~
Not very difficult, drop janazaj for herrera, who actually knows how to play the no10 role like a boss

2323~~~
?

2324~~~
Good performance from him, but Brugge were torrid. Sunday is a proper test.

2325~~~
This.

2326~~~
Not really performance related, but look at these remarks from LvG - and once over, people were certain they wouldn't get on and Rooney would be shipped out (it was always more likely to be wishful thinking than reality, but that's what they were saying).

As here:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.90min.com/posts/2510063-louis-van-gaal-reveals-he-takes-advice-from-wayne-rooney?utm_source=RSS&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.90min.com/posts/2510063-...RSS&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a>

2327~~~
We'll hear van Gaal's <i>real</i> thoughts about Rooney when he retires. Can't fight the machine now.

<span style="color: #ffffff">:-p</span>

2328~~~
Good grief. For an uneducated person (supposedly), Wayne sure knows exactly how to play people.

2329~~~
Louis van Gaal expects Rooney to get around 25 goals, he isn't Brendan Rodgers taking random numbers out of the air, his staff obviously will have provided evidence Rooney can get this return. Rooney will be expected to play about 40 matches so 25 goals works out to around 3 in 5.

Interestingly in the past 5 seasons Rooney has averaged every 5 matches 2.65 goals (that's 5 seasons including this season so far) and most those games he hasn't even played as a striker. He also managed an average of 2 goals every 5 matches for the past three seasons, where he has played quite a bit deeper in addition to CAM under Ferguson, Moyes and Louis van Gaal and that also includes one season where we finished 7th and one where we finished 4th.

A return of 3 in 5 is a realistic target for him.

2330~~~
Huh? What do you mean "play people"? And what's education got to do with it? He's making suggestions about playing football, not solving global warming.

2331~~~
Encouraging words from LVG. Judging by our reluctance to sign a top striker, he believes in Rooney. If Rooney delivers, LVG's managerial post is safe. If Rooney fails, LVG fails too. Is United the next big club at which he is going to win a big trophey? Or rather the next big club at which he is going to be sacked again? He's sort of a flawed genius. You don't know what to expect: brilliance or underachievement.

2332~~~
I'm crying. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2333~~~
With Moyes, DM desperately needed a senior player onboard to prop-up his poor credentials as United manager (while also shifting players he considered 'disloyal' to him); in this scenario, Wayne hardly even had to try to cement his position at the club. With LVG: Van Gaal often has a lieutenant amongst his players, an on-and-off-field 'captain' with whom LVG can discuss all manner of matters; I'm not sure that we, or him, should be listening to Wayne Rooney, of all people.

2334~~~
Don't think he will score today.

2335~~~
Why?

2336~~~
Politics gone mad. There once was a time when nobody (players) was bigger than the club.

2337~~~
What politics?

2338~~~
Yeah, like that time Roy Keane held the club to ransom. Or all the way back to the 70s when Best just decided when he could be arsed turning up for training and matches.

2339~~~
Bit absurd to suggst the manager shouldn't listen to an opinion from any player, never mind the club captain. Even more so in the context of an article where Van Gaal clearly states that he takes every opinion on its own merits.

I still don't get what you mean about "playing" people, by the way. Would you prefer if Van Gaal never got any feedback from the players? Or is it just Rooney who should hold his tongue?

2340~~~
Not too fussed about this. Fergie used to take advice from Keano, Neville and Giggsy as well. It's pretty normal for a manager to do this with his captain. I'm more interested in Rooney's on field performances. Apart from Brugge, it's been shit and he needs to seriously buck up.

2341~~~
That's not at all what I suggested.

I mean that he's looked after number one whenever the occasion's presented itself. I don't consider him to be a neutral observer, with the club's best interests at heart, when it comes to discussing things with Van Gaal.

2342~~~
You'll have to give me examples of him "looking after number one" in this context.  I mean, he's not talking contract renewals with Van Gaal. He's talking about how to win games of football. What makes you think his priority here is anything other than winning?

2343~~~
Oh, granted I can only guess the detail of his conversations with LVG - it's all my opinion, rather than fact. Basically, I just don't feel that Wayne is United through-and-through (fair play to him, as he's always been honest about being an Everton supporter), so I'm always going to be uneasy about him being Captain and 'lieutenant'. But none of this matters - it's only so much opinionated garbage, after all - so long as he delivers, as I hope he does.

2344~~~
For 300k per week he should do more than play football.

2345~~~
I'm fine with him playing only football for 400k per week.

2346~~~
id rather watch Torres up front.....

2347~~~
Seen this before from him, he will have a shite 45 minutes but a goal in second half is going to erase the first half from our memory.

2348~~~
The worst thing that could have happen did when he netted 3 in midweek. 

That will reassure the management he can lead the line for the season, he can't.

2349~~~
Dissapointed he didn't shoot when Shaw played him in. Really terrible decision to try and cut back.

2350~~~
Ya, as if he needs one. His hat-trick against Bruge will have him covered until at least November.

2351~~~
Not even the best Wayne on the pitch, and Routledge is shite.

2352~~~
At one point Herrera had the ball on the edge of the penalty area, Rooney was standing next to him watching...this is the weakness in his game as a #9

2353~~~
Someone needs to pull him out of Ashley Williams's pocket

2354~~~
Several half chances but at least he is getting in behind the defence. Still think we don't fashion enough chances for him via crosses. He score about 20 goals from Valencia's crossing back in 2009/2010?

2355~~~
Lead the line? the whole line is shit right now

2356~~~
I don't disagree, but we need a strong focal point.

2357~~~
Yeah it was awful when he got that hat-trick. At 3-0 I was sitting there with my head in my hands.

2358~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2359~~~
Will score in the second half

2360~~~
Thanks FC Brukka, now we're stuck with the fat man up front for the rest of the season due to his hat trick in midweek.

2361~~~
He sure gets some protection from Sky doesn't he. Sent the half time focussing on Mata's shot when he had 2 defenders bearing down on him and didn't really have anything to say about Rooney's slow ponderous play when he was clean through on his right foot.

2362~~~
I get your point, but do you not agree he isn't good enough to be our main forward? 

I struggle to see how anyone can think we're fine with Wayne as the main man this season.

2363~~~
His touch looks worse than Smalling's.

2364~~~
Not just sky, same here by the presenters in India.

2365~~~
Service!! He needs service!! Somebody give the lad some assists ffs!

2366~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2367~~~
Carragher said he felt sorry for Rooney.

2368~~~
lazy fecking pass

2369~~~
Now his touch has cost us a goal, and who knows maybe even points.

2370~~~
Seven hells.

2371~~~
Maybe he should start cleaning LvG's boots and cook him nice dinners the coming weeks because he sure aint in the team on merit. It's a joke.

2372~~~
How is he our captain... and why does he always play? 
I'd rather see us start without a striker and an extra attacking midfielder than him. When he is bad, which is way too often, he finds a way to have a net negative contribution..

2373~~~
Everyone who says "he will score goals" totally forget other parts of his game that has become detrimental to the team. He's constantly ruining attacks with a sloppy pass or touch.

2374~~~
Not sure I can take it any longer. Woeful. Still a good player on his day but utter garbage most of the time. He can't be our main striker this season or we're fecked.

2375~~~
He's been shit for a while. He needs to go. He's not a thirty goal striker. Never been one. He's barely been a 20 goal striker throughout his career. At the rate he's going, he'd be lucky with 15. Which is pathetic.

2376~~~
Darmian has charged up and Rooney has given it away. We're 2 at the back. None of the centre backs are to blame there. Too much space for them to cover. Rooney is inexcusable to give the ball away so cheaply when Darmian has gone forward and not to bother chasing it back. Lovely work by Swansea but Rooney's negligence handed it to them on a plate.

2377~~~
Must be a proper kick in the teeth for the rest of the team to see their captain play so shite and not have to worry about losing his place

2378~~~
Him being dogshit might actually get him out of the side.. being half decent is more worrying.. it would mean he continues to be first choice and get stuck with a mediocre striker.

2379~~~
Not surprise about his performance today.

2380~~~
Get Rooney the entire feck outta here

2381~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> And we were laughing at Kane yesterday

2382~~~
He should be the first one out the door

2383~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2384~~~
I'm sick of him

2385~~~
Absolutely shocking. Took too many touches, muscled off the ball and flaps for a penalty.

Get rid.

2386~~~
Finished as a premier league striker, has been for a long time.

2387~~~
That was horrendous.

2388~~~
Jeebus

2389~~~
Really hope Williams will let him out of his pocket at full time at least

2390~~~
FFS, is he gun shy??

2391~~~
god he's fecking aweful - would batter the belgian league.

2392~~~
shooottttt

Kyle Walker wasn't around to put it in for him this time

f'cking shoot when you get that glimmer of the net!! garhh

2393~~~
Why does pause in those situations? Did the same think against Spurs.

2394~~~
Great play to make the chance himself and then ruins it with his reluctance to use his left foot again

2395~~~
Good set up for his chance, but should have been more urgent in his finishing.

2396~~~
Rooney is playing like Mesut fecking Ozil.  

The shitty Ozil that is.

2397~~~
I am sure we will get top four. Not because we are very good but everyone apart from City are shit. Rooney would not get anywhere near any of the top teams in and across Europe. I cannot believe the kind of shit we have produced this season and Rooney is a big reason for that. But LVG would say he has done well and will sell Hernandez saying he misses chances.

2398~~~
This defeat lies solely at his feet. I'm fuming.

2399~~~
Rooney has been taking left foot lessons from Valencia, hasn't he?

2400~~~
20 goals? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Maybe if we play dross like Club Brugge every other weekend...

2401~~~
At least he had good work rate when he was playing shite earlier, now he seems fkng lazy. Get rid.

2402~~~
You're not going to face Brugge every week Wayne. Unfortunately we've got no time at all to sort out a replacement.

2403~~~
We need to make him feck right off. He's wank. feck him and his record, get rid of him this transfer window if possible.

2404~~~
Officially done with him.

It's going to take a lot of effort to watch our games if he's leading the line for us for the remainder of the season.

2405~~~
Let's see how many posts we can rack up in here before the Caf breaks.

2406~~~
Hopefully we keep Hernandez. Would be a mighty disaster if we let him go

2407~~~
I wish he would feck off already this fat feck

2408~~~
That mob that turned up at Rio's when he was holding out for a new contract - anyone who has a number for any of them? Might want them to do a reverse job at Rooney's house.

2409~~~
Useless fecking idiot.

2410~~~
I actually thought that might have been a penalty but it's quite embarassing that he allowed Williams to catch him in the first place. 

He had so many embarassing moments in this game that if he had Bebe on back of his shirt he would be out of the club the next day.

2411~~~
I'm just fecking sick of it now.

I'm sick of watching him aimlessly trot about the pitch, he offers absolutely nothing. We're so toothless with him up front. He's scored 1 away league goal since March 2014. March fecking 2014! 10 league games in a row now without a goal.

Even when he's played like shite he's always had decent stats to cover him, he doesn't even have that now. He is fecking useless, the best thing he did today was miss the ball which allowed Mata to score.

If we end the window with Rooney as our only striker, Van Gaal wont be here next season.

2412~~~
That lost is all on him. Between the fluffed chances, the bad pass leading to the squalider and the slowness to shoot in that last chance.

2413~~~
I honestly think he is comfortably our worst outfield player. He's absolutely terrible.

2414~~~
This guy. Compare his last two performances for us. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2415~~~
With that stand out performance it only took 1 game.......oh well.

2416~~~
***Glass half-full head on***

May well be past his best now, to the point that he's blunting our attacks.

2417~~~
How would we have done with Hernandez up front all game? I have to imagine he'd have done a far better job.

2418~~~
Anyone who rated Rooney above 3 for this game needs to visit their doctor for a head examination immediately

2419~~~
He is a nothing player and I rather see him sold than Hernandez.

2420~~~
Got the assist for the Swansea goal other than the two fluffed chances he tried desperately to take on his right foot.

2421~~~
It wasn't. Williams simply caught up and muscled him off the ball way too easily. Either Rooney should've left him behind and had a shot on goal or he should've protected the ball so anything Williams did would've been a penalty, but he did neither.

2422~~~
His skill to set up his chance was incredible but he just stalled

Very disappointing

2423~~~
Im not a Rooney basher but the way he lost the ball which allowed Swansea to counter attack and score the 1-1 was horrible... If you do that in amateur football you get subbed for it.

2424~~~
It's sad really. He's not up to the level anymore.

2425~~~
That was 0/10 performance. One of the worst performance I've seen from United player.

2426~~~
The thing about that last chance was that he did absolutely brilliantly in the moments leading up to it... by a mile the best thing he's done all season... and then decides to feck around like an idiot (I swear he was waiting for the penalty)...

2427~~~
agree.

2428~~~
He's bullet proof, won't get subbed, won't get dropped.  Will hold us back and cost us points for a long time to come.

2429~~~
Where are all the 20 goal cultists? I want to laugh at them.

2430~~~
Terrible. Absolutely terrible. This is the guy that will carry our season. Letting RvP go seems like the biggest mistake right now.

2431~~~
Who are England playing in these international games? You can bet he'll score a couple in them and everything will be alright <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2432~~~
Ignoring the shitty performance for most the game, that last missed opportunity is proof enough for LVG to get a new striker. It's beyond madness to hang out entire season on this guy's goal scoring ability.

2433~~~
Absolutely cost us today. He had 3 golden chances to score and made a mess of all of them. 

I don't care if anybody says "but he gets no service" "he needs to be in the game and get more chances". 

If he wants to be a 9 he HAS to score those chances. When your losing and you have a chance to shoot from the penalty area 1 on 1 you take it. He's clearly so 1 footed he had to get every chance onto his right foot and lost it every time. 

I really do fear for us this season if he's what we have to rely on for 60 games by himself.

2434~~~
Genuine question, would we actually be able to get rid of Rooney if we wanted to? I can't imagine any other top club going for him at this point, and he doesn't strike me as the type of person who'd be happy to go too far down in wages. I reckon we're stuck with him.

2435~~~
Comfortably. Not even a question.

2436~~~
I'm sorry but If we are relying on him to win things this year then we will be fighting for Europa League football next season...

We have to buy before Tuesday's deadline

2437~~~
No.

But we won't try, and even if we sign another number 9 he'll still play.

2438~~~
He's finished. He looked great against a Belgium injury crocked team but against the all massive club from Wales was made to look what he is, washed up.

2439~~~
That and the flick for the Memphis chance vs. Brugge at home. It's a recurring problem though that he just takes far too long. Got away with it against Spurs when Walker scored the OG, but two chances today where he's in on goal and Williams was too quick.

Depressing stuff.

2440~~~
He had to hit it with his left but instead he tried to turn on to his right (for the third time in the game). It cost us.

2441~~~
Is anyone still going to claim the fact that his hattrick came against piss poor opposition doesn't make any difference and he's still got it?

2442~~~
I'm sorry but he looks just as finished as RvP and Falcao did last season. Too slow physically and mentally.

2443~~~
Shooooot!

2444~~~
Needs to be shipped out to China/America. Having him as the focal point of our attack just stifles everything. He's slow, weak, has no engine anymore and has a horrendous first touch, as well as being unable to play simple passes 50% of the time

2445~~~
Dire. Inept. Abysmal. 

Displayed the penalty box wisdom and finishing you'd expect of Chris Smalling or Phil Jones. How much time does he want in the box ? You'd have thought he might have learned from Walker's own goal but apparently not.

2446~~~
Contrast between his last two performances <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2447~~~
Rooney is one of the best paid players in the world. Let that sink in. 

fecking horrible performance. 0 confidence.

2448~~~
The reason we lost today simple as. His uselessness in front of goal and as a number 9 is nothing new. That pass that led to the equalizer in unforgivable though

2449~~~
Not good enough anymore for our ambitions, and I'm not (only) taking about the chance at the end. He just offered absolutely nothing throughout and set up Swansea for their equalizer. Oh well.

2450~~~
Piss poor again today. Looks past it and Van Gaal's reluctance to sub him is getting old. Inept performance, not only by him but quite a few of his teammates.

<a class="username" data-user="81972, @Empire" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81972/">@Empire</a>

2451~~~
No club would want to pay him even half of what he is currently earning.

We would probably have to subsidies his wages at another club. Or let him go for a very low transfer fee so that his new club could use some of the savings on his wages.

2452~~~
Lol at those saying 'he's back' etc. Brugge were pathetic. They could of made Heskey look good.

2453~~~
They will come out in force when Rooney scores his first away goal in the league....maybe sometime in 2016.

2454~~~
Falcao 1. Van Persie 1. Rooney 0.

2455~~~
Flat track bully, exposed again

2456~~~
We lost because we have a third rate goalkeeper. I don't see how that is even debatable?

2457~~~
Considering his wages, No.

2458~~~
why the bloody hell he didn't take the last chance on his left foot i'll never know.
he's not that far out.
why give that average gimp defender time to get back in.

I'd love to know from a premier league defender's perspective how hard he is to play against compared to others, and how it compared to a few years ago, as to me it looks pretty comfy

2459~~~
I have been defending throughout his bad spell but after that performance there really is no way anyone can defend him anymore. Both Gomis and Eder looked twice the player Rooney did today.

2460~~~
Compare the last two opponents and you have the answer.

2461~~~
That's harsh - Williams is a fine defender, and has been an absolute colossus in pretty much every game he's played against us.

2462~~~
That's it really. If we'd had Gomis up front we'd have won.

Quite sad when you think about it.

2463~~~
Didn't expect that at all <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2464~~~
I don't think his touch and general play was bad today. Its his decision making that let him down. He did a nice skill but completely fluffed it later on(similar to his run at Etihad last season). He should just shoot immediately after he makes space for himself. For too many times he wastes chances like that.

2465~~~
average by premier league standards. keeping us out isn't any sign of greatness these days!

2466~~~
Absolute horseshit. Romero was cack but Rooney this fat bald headed overpaid cnut was so shite it was not even funny

2467~~~
It'd be a club from China/Qatar/America that would take him on a free and match his salary, just because of his name and the statement it would make.

2468~~~
He scored a hatrick and they came out the woodworks to proclaim the great Rooney's return...But Danny welbeck also scored a hatrick against a  poor European side last season..

Since the wondergoal against West Ham in 2014 when David Moyes was still manager, Wayne Rooney has scored 1 away goal..a good one admittedly..against Arsenal...But some of the fanboys will come here and tell us about his greatness two/three or days from now(They wont show up now, they never do)

My heart will break on the day that Sir Bobby's record eventually does fall..he gave his life to this football club..To see it go in this way with an undroppable player that past his peak years ago while that player slowly leads us to mediocrity will be a hard pill to take ..But such is life, sigh

2469~~~
He must have bet his house on Swansea or something, how did he not even get a shot on target with his left foot?

2470~~~
He's also lazy. 

When Pep went to Barca he used Rooney as a benchmark for his pressing. Nowadays he's just walking around and rarely pressing.

2471~~~
Not good enough. We're wasting our time playing him and for some reason he never gets subbed either.

There are plenty of other problems with the team and he isn't the reason we lost today but we definitely need someone better than him.

2472~~~
Indeed. Having said that, the same is true for our whole attack. Ayou or whatever is his name is was miles better than depay and Mata. Rooney is a huge problem because he's our striker and star man and captain but I think our widemen are underwhelming too.

2473~~~
Back to shit against somewhat decen opponents.

2474~~~
Nope. Like you said, i think every other club at our level or slightly below it has a better striker. (Swansea striker Gomis was so much better than Rooney today) Also no other club in the world will pay him the same amount of money. I think he will stay at United untill the end of his contract.

2475~~~
you have to wonder whether it's instructions to not spend to much time pressing hard, or whether it's simply limitations physically.

Van Gaal has been very vocal that he's been doing a great job, which seems completely the opposite to what everyone watching can see.

2476~~~
We've fixed some deficiencies but allowed others to fester.  Hard to imagine anyone supporting Rooney and his current form in the BPL.  He has become an albatross for our side.  Everyone keeps hoping he improves and shows his real quality, but sadly I truly believe this is his standard now.  SAF knew and predicted this decline many years ago, but the free fall under Moyes forced some bad decision making and Rooney is now safe and secure on $300k/week.  To exacerbate the scenario he has been made captain by LVG, thus making him undrop-able.  The sooner we rid ourselves of him and his reputation the better off we will be as a club.

2477~~~
Why? I've always maintained that while I am a Rooney fanboy, i'll try and be objective about his performances.

This season is the first in a while where he's had a run of games up front, in a relatively settled side. And in the league, he's barely threatened. Just never looks like getting on the end of anything. Whether that's him, or the system, or both . . .

Like happened to Torres, perhaps he has lost that half yard that once allowed him to get away from defenders. So that chance today, where he turned Ashley Williams but then Williams got back at him just before he was going to shoot, might've ended up in the back of the net 3-5 years ago.

Not writing him off completely, and I still think there *are* plenty of haters about who are looking for any excuse to slate him, and have been since the first transfer request in 2010, even when he was playing well.

But age and 600+ games simply might be catching up with him. We'll see.

2478~~~
Yes, Depay downed tools in the second half. Seemed annoyed that he wasn't getting decisions and seemed more focused on the ref than the game.

2479~~~
100% this. 

Right now I'm that angry I'd be happy for everyone at the club who thinks Wayne is the way forward to be sacked. Absolute joke, it's like he has something over the management, the situation with him not being droppable or subbed is making me actually hate him.

2480~~~
I hoped the Brugge hat-trick would give his finishing confidence but he hesitated when he got into good positions again today up against proper defenders after playing against 4th tier CB's on Wednesday.

2481~~~
I've already said it's too soon to judge, not sure why you ignore this, shall we also sack Louis van Gaal and sign Monk? Monk has beaten him 3 times now. And what about Diego Costa, does he look past it? Yesterday he did nothing other than complain to the ref all game. Or what about Harry Kane?

2482~~~
Cheer up, if his £300k a week contract is accurate (and it's unlikely that it's way off) then he's only going to earn another 60 million in wages before his contract expires.

2483~~~
Yes Rooney we know what you are.

2484~~~
Yeah fair enough. It's just deflating seeing him play like and I can never understand how any could possibly derive happiness from that (not saying that there aren't such fans).

2485~~~
Terrible, again. There's not much more to say. A good performance against Brugge doesn't mean much as we have also seen with Memphis. They both have it all to prove in the league.

2486~~~
Gave the ball away poorly, they went up the other end and scored. The turning point of the game. Of course Tyler and Smith say nothing because the narrative is that Rooney's form is all down to Van Gaal's tactics.

2487~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ridiculous

2488~~~
I find it hard to criticise Memphis too much. He's just 21. Our fault in leaving our attack so bare and having to rely on a 21 year old kid and a 29 year old/50 year old striker.

2489~~~
Can't we go to the consumer court or something like that? If you sign a contract with someone to build a wall and the wall is shit you're entitled for a refund. We're bound to have some clause.

2490~~~
Moyes left us with golden handcuffs.

2491~~~
Just when you think of how much wrong David Moyes did in his time at United..

2492~~~
He's very much the reason we lost today, he missed 3 chances that a striker of any quality would scored, for swanseas second goal it was his careless pass (which was an easy pass to make) that started their counter attack.

2493~~~
His decline has been obvious for years at this stage. The decision to extend his contract a couple of years ago was a terrible footballing blunder.Big gamble from LVG to pin his no 9 hopes to him. It ain't gonna work.

2494~~~
What the flyin feck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2495~~~
Indeed. He's 21 but there's no denying that he's been dreadful in the league. I can only remember one or two good things he has done so far in all 4 games. His potential is clear but the execution has been very underwhelming so far. As you said, it is ridiculous that we are relying on him as a starter, rather than easing him in alongside an established attack force.

2496~~~
Only way it will happen is if we pay him to leave or somehow find a United mad owner in China or one of the Gulf states that is willing to take one for the team.  MLS won't be an option unless we pay a lot of his salary.

2497~~~
Just drop him...

2498~~~
He is treated and paid like a Ronaldo or a Messi and I don't even know the last time he scored a league goal. He is meant to be the difference maker but he's not even getting a shot away. 

That fecking pass today cost us the game .

2499~~~
Never gonna happen.

2500~~~
People saying he's not getting the service is rubbish. Had a few good chances today that top players would put away. He had two 1on1's today and decided not to shoot. Same thing happened against Spurs when he didn't shoot (luckily Walker bundled it in). He's just not good enough. He can't hold the ball up when we need to go long also. He hardly runs and makes movements. I just can't stress enough how much difference a striker like Kane would make. He's strong and powerful in the air, has great movement and will work his socks off.

2501~~~
He'll score a couple against San Marino and all will be forgotten

2502~~~
Moyes is partially fault as Woody the fecking idiot went along with the idea. Just wondering what sort deal would he get now if we were negotiating a new deal.

2503~~~
Personally I expected this. A kid from the Dutch league will take time to become a proper force in the premier league.

2504~~~
Is there any way we could convince him to go to Everton?

2505~~~
Not even England's best striker, what a horrible position we're in because of that contract.  No club would be interested in signing him short of us giving him away, even then they'd probably go nowhere near him with his wages.

2506~~~
Was Van Persie this bad last season?

2507~~~
£300k until 2019. Insane

2508~~~
The first task would be to convince Everton to shell out half his wages, let alone the entire sum.

2509~~~
We don't really have any option!

Anyway, back on topic:  Feck off Rooney, I don't know what's wrong with you but I don't want to wait around to find out. We need anther striker in the next two days.

2510~~~
I think it was for the first goal. We were cruising at that point I was thinking at the time just how good we were actually playing, even with him being naff. He gave the ball away so cheaply today, as with his other games, it really boggles the mind how the ver basics of basic football has eluded him. This looks terminal.

2511~~~
He should be sold this season istead of RVP...

2512~~~
Do you think Everton would take him if we paid part of his wages?

2513~~~
But at least he'll have enough games to break Bobby's record......

2514~~~
Settle down. Strikers always look poor in LVG's system if they don't score. LVG used to boast that Gomez would only touch the ball 15 times in a games at Bayern Munich, granted that he scored goals. It is no coincidence that RVP looked poor in the system last year. Our strikers need better service.

2515~~~
He and his agent have played it out brilliantly with his contract. No way was Moyes going to cause trouble with Rooney, the commercial face of United, in his first year.

2516~~~
Whatever makes you feel better. Rooney had 5 clear cut chances today and didn't get 1 shot on target.

2517~~~
Straight swap for Ibrahimovic and Lucas Moura at PSG? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2518~~~
Yeah, but can't he just fecking hold up the ball for 2 seconds, and why does he have to misplace so many easy passes?

2519~~~
Pathetic performance from a 300,000 a week teacher's pet. What in the feck was Rooney thinking when he had those opportunities? Does he fecking realize that when in front of goal, he doesn't have time to control the ball so he could either pass it or chip it in? Does he realize that he also has a left foot that he can shoot with instead of waiting to desperately flop for a penalty? And then he doesn't even work hard to win any ball. Seriously, what the feck has happened to him? I can deal with a goal drought and being off form, but at the very least show some heart.

2520~~~
don't worry,  by 2018  250k will be the average Premier league wage <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2521~~~
there is nothing more frustrating in football than a striker taking too long to get a shot off, and the chance completely going.

He knew what he'd done with that 88th min nonsense.

the ridiculous ranting at the ref after showed it

2522~~~
This was the same type of performances that saw Falcao and RVP shown the door, it is only fair that he is shown as well. 

There is no place for sentimentality in modern football.

2523~~~
Apparently it's Van Gaal's fault that Rooney can't do basic things according to the geniuses on sky sports.

2524~~~
Still can't get over that pass and the way he ONCE AGAIN fluffed 2 chances by taking ages on the ball, only that Williams did not put the ball into his own net

2525~~~
He has been poor but I was more disappointed with Depay today. He created nothing. Rooney's job is to finish chances, Depay is charged with making those chances.

2526~~~
It is. He should not play for us anymore

2527~~~
His shooting or lack of it frustrates me. Get a yard and hit the thing. Especially when you're struggling for form like him. But he's taking the extra touch or trying to chip the keeper again. Not good enough at the moment.

2528~~~
Carragher and Neville are talking utter shite about him. 

I guess England internationals and Neville doesn't want to piss him off.

2529~~~
Fergie is very rarely wrong, and he was right to try and get rid of Rooney during his final season. Another thing Moyes fecked up, persuading him to stay.

2530~~~
Dissapointed with a 21 year old kid who has just arrived from the Eredivisie, if we rely on him to win us games then we are truly fecked.

2531~~~
The most concerning thing is the hesitation in his game. The last chance he had was similar to the run he made against Manchester City last season. Why's he so reluctant to shoot? And why isn't he using his weaker foot?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LmidaZ9oSyE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2532~~~
LVG also made him captain and gave him special privileges of starting every game in all positions.

And now he has basically sold of any competition he had for him as a striker and also not brought in any.

2533~~~
A couple of times this season he has been caught for the same reason.

His age and where he came from doesn't excuse his slack play. But you are being a little silly, it is only football at the end of day, not the end of the world.

2534~~~
We'd have to pay half of his. If we do, they would. They play bloody naismith.

2535~~~
Wtf are you even talking about. A 21 year old that is new to the league and you are more dissapointed with him than with a guy up top who is on 300 k a week, constantly takes too long on ball, misplaces passes in crucial situations, can't run for shit anymore, throws his arms around and has a go at the ref to cover up for his own inabilities? 
Have a word with yourself. And don't come up with that "he has no service" bullcrap. He was through on goal 3 times today and fecked up. This guy needs a proper time out or a selling. Would still get a good amount for him I assume.

2536~~~
Rooney circa 2008 would have buried that last chance, even if Williams had been wrapped around his ankles. Knocking in a hat-trick against a ropey side like Bruges is all well and good but in a close, competitive game like this, he's lost a yard of pace and also, it seems, that ability to size up a situation in a split second. The Rooney of old was quicker mentally. Sometime, retaining that mental agility is the key to compensation the loss of physical prowess but Rooney has declined in both; at least for now. He needs to get that hunger back.

2537~~~
he got into some very good positions...then just delayed shooting. Otherwise the game was wrapped up.

2538~~~
It's even more frustrating considering the type of shots he used to do. THAT goal vs Milan back in 2007 comes to mind (yeah, long time ago, I know). And even if Atkinson fell for his flop, I wouldn't have been confident with him taking the penalty.

2539~~~
And? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2540~~~
He could have had a hat-trick today. The first chance when he was tackled by Williams while trying to cut inside, he should have just gone first time with his right. Should have also taken it first time with his left, low and hard, instead of trying the stupid dink. He should have also not tried to take <i>another</i> touch after his brilliant run late on. I don't know why he is so hesitant to shoot - he's lethal when he doesn't allow himself a moment to think, and just hits it. 

I do think a new #9 would be a good idea, but i'd still keep my faith in Rooney if LVG decides not to buy one. It's not like he didn't find himself in good positions today - he has finally stopped trying to play as a CM, and is now playing on the shoulders of the CBs. It is just a question of him shooting as soon as he has the chance. He is over-playing and over-thinking everything now, which is the last thing a #9 should do.

2541~~~
If LVG was happy with Rooney for his hat trick, then he should be fecking livid with Rooney after this game. Very disappointing. I thought he would prove everyone (including me) wrong but i don't think he has the skills or the temperament or the passing to be a valuable striker anymore.

2542~~~
He was poor I agree. Depay was completely lost though. At least Rooney got through on goal. I think only the last chance was really poor. The first two were more difficult.

2543~~~
I am going off on a rant...
You can blame Moyes and that contract all you want but van Gaal is solely to blame for this current situation. Rooney seems to have van Gaal in his pocket to a point it's becoming farcical. Makes him captain and then states the captain always plays, sells anyone who could ever threaten to take minutes off him, and spends the half of any interview singing his praises. We could move him to a club or league that likes to make vanity signings if we wanted to. Never have I seen such evident player power at United, and that is taking in account the sacking of Moyes. 

His power is such the media also never criticises him, always blaming tactics, other players or anything other than the player himself. He's like an untouchable mob boss, you can't get to him.

He'll probably keep his stats up, being a flat track bully, only thing the PL is running out of flat tracks, still he has 3 goals in 6 and that's good enough for those who still follow United via teletext.

You can class me as a hater, infact I have reached a point that everything he does annoys me, and I've never felt that way about any United player. 

P.S. I kept confusing him with the overweight 50 yr old Swansea trainer in charge of subs.

2544~~~
3 chances this guy had, one on one with the keeper and he didn't make Fabianksi sweat on any of them. The first one he tried to turn back when he should just shoot, the second was a laughable chip and the third.... Well how much time does he want to shoot? 

What doesn't he understand about shooting he has the fecking chance to! He thinks he's playing Sunday pub league football. 

Where's Wilson? For the love of God, if we're selling Hernandez, at least let Wilson start. 

At this moment in time, he wouldn't get into my family side, and that's saying something considering half of us have never played football past school level. Even then, it was sitting on the bench.

2545~~~
Seriously, even without proper attacking football United could have won today. Rooney single-handedly cost United a win or at the least a draw.

2546~~~
today I'd have been more surprised if he'd scored any of his chances.

that isn't a great position to be in!

2547~~~
The Captain of England will never get an honest slating by a large segment of the media.  It isn't just Neville, he is just the worst about it because of his coaching job.

2548~~~
Wayne got lucky by being played in CM last season, he's brought himself another season.

2549~~~
not quite single handedly when your keeper is letting near post piddlers in

2550~~~
He don't have his strikers instinct anymore. Bit worried on what we going to do with him now.

2551~~~
Reminded me of when he knocked us out in the Allianz Arena a couple of seasons ago with his same dithering in front of goal. 

We need far better, and he is holding this team back, and has done for a while.

2552~~~
This. People claim he "lacks service", but the reason behind that is that he never makes any fecking runs. Most of the time, he just stands there waving his arms like a fecking idiot, asking for the ball at his feet. It also seems he has forgotten how to shoot, so what exactly does he bring to the table? He is so static and predicable these days that pretty much any competent CB has him in his pocket.

If he keeps this up, we might as well play Mata as a CF. At least he tries to make some runs

2553~~~
How can such a fierce kid like Wayne become such a football cockblocker. Is his unhealthy lifestyle finally getting to him ?

This guy needs to get his shit together immediately or he'll be joining Gerrard in States.

2554~~~
He's already our version of Gerrard.

2555~~~
13 years of playing football in one of the toughest did it.

2556~~~
If we use Brugge as a yardstick for quality oppo then boy have our standards fallen, choccy mclair at his age now would have bagged against them midweek. 

My point still stands, that he cannot cut it at elite level games no longer.

2557~~~
I've generally held off criticising Rooney, or getting into the debates on him before, but he's no longer contributing even half of what I'd expect a centre-forward to contribute. He hardly ever wins his 50/50s, seems unable to hold the ball up and his passing in the build-up is slack as all hell.

2558~~~
I think it is frustrating for him because he is sort of caught in between creating chances and staying deep waiting for opportunities. He is unable to contribute to either of them whole heartedly.

2559~~~
To be fair under Moyes he got 17 in 29 premier league matches, due to his performances Ferguson said had Wayne Rooney played in the season before the way he did in Moyes' season he would be a guaranteed starter and that's the Wayne Rooney he likes to see.

2560~~~
Four league games and he's been our worst player in every one of them. 

I had no problems with giving him a chance up top this season but Van Gaal's refusal to drop or even sub him when the team are crying out for a change upfront is madness.

2561~~~
This. Holding us back big time. Will be interesting to see if we feck this up the way Pool did and let him play on for too long. As we tend to repeat mistakes (Moyes) I wouln't be surprised at all.

2562~~~
Really confused with the extra touches he was taking when through on goal, complete opposite to how sharp he was against Brugge.  I've always defended Wayne but today was pathetic. Still think the criticism is over the top, I think we have big problems not just with Rooney but our goal keeper defence, attacking midfielders and the way we play. 

Should he be sold? I think he will get the same chance Rvp and Falcao had and if he doesn't improve Lvg will show him the door.

2563~~~
He was pulling the trigger at the first opportunity against Brugge, yet today he wanted an extra two or three seconds to set himself before shooting.

Also I'd question his ability to perform as a captain when he's in his desperate, tantrum laden moods like he is right now.

2564~~~
He has said before that his best position is striker. Even told Fergie that.

Then when he plays there, he says number 10 is his best position. The same media calling for him to be striker now saying he should be number 10. 

He's just not very good at both. I rather get Ibrahimovic. He may lack pace, but physically and technique wise he is miles ahead of Rooney. Rooney can't even win a header. Even Richards, who isn't the tallest CB was out jumping him.

2565~~~
#throwbacktovilla

2566~~~
They were on his right foot then. Left foot right here, and his left foot is apparently shite

2567~~~
Absolutely woeful today. I can see why LVG hasn't got in another striker based on the severe lack of quality out there, but he has contributed so very little in all our league games so far.

2568~~~
Kane isn't scoring, but he's involved in the games. The other players play off him. I'd kill for that right now. Look at Gomis.

The team can't play off him. We have no focal point.

As for that missed opportunity. Well that's just not acceptable. Didn't have Walker to knock it in for him this time.

2569~~~
His pass that led to the equaliser was even worse imo.

2570~~~
I really want to call him every name under the sun right now, but then I remember what he's actually done for the club and the fact it's not really his fault that he won't be substituded/benched despite being incredibly poor, even by his standards. He's at Bébé's level. He's comfortably one of the best players I've seen for the club but he's also fast becoming one of the worst. We have really put ourselves in the worst thinkable situation regarding Rooney.

2571~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>..And the Everton's fans seem to hate Naismith for some reason

2572~~~
Just think about it, his contract would have ended last summer..Ah, then we would definitely have been forced to improve ourselves..

2573~~~
That chance at the end he created when he brought it down and powered past the last man was quality but he just didnt shoot as he thought he had more time. Very disappointing as hes always done it for us but it looks more like hes slipping into a very fast decline.

2574~~~
Watching him is quite sickening at present and I really would prefer him to be sold before Hernandez. 

A lot of comments in this thread might be criticised as disrespectful and knee-jerk, but when you've treated the club as he has done and are being paid as much as he is, you don't really deserve the benefit of the doubt.

2575~~~
try not to think of the £40m Chelsea offered too!

2576~~~
He knew exactly how much time he had - how could he not? The issue wasn't underestimating how much time he had, it was having absolutely no confidence to shoot with his left foot. He wanted to open it up on his right foot and sidefoot the shot. Like he does 99% of the time.

2577~~~
Yeah, I agree with that. It's obviously difficult so see on TV, but I noticed him just standing still when there was an open space to run into on more than one occasion today. The one that stood out for me was around the 37th minute-mark or something like that, when Herrera had a shot on goal. One of their central defenders came out to try and block Herrera, which left a huge amount of space behind him in the penalty area. Rooney was standing with his marker on the edge of that area, but he didn't even try to make a run into the open space.

Our attacking play in general is certainly lacking, but Rooney is a big part of this himself - he's not dragging around defenders to create space or anything like that, and whenever he does get a half-chance he never makes the most of it.

2578~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>..If only..But we are wasting our time..Wayne Rooney is going nowhere..here is to the next 4 years lads..enjoy!

2579~~~
Dont get me wrong i think hes been utterly tragic and should have hit it there but he did so well to create that chance. There were plenty of times where i thought he should have just unleashed a powerful hit on target and hoped for the best. 

I always say when coaching if your not confident in front of goal and get some space, just put your head down and hit it hard and on target and you will score at least some of the time. Rooney needs to do a bit of that i think just basic shooting on target with power rather than pissing around taking ages.

2580~~~
We are stuck with him for a while, and its looking likely we wont sign a better striker this transfer window, so he will remain our front man.

So perhaps a more useful debate is what does LVG have to do to get the best out of Rooney, given his current capabilities and form?

2581~~~
They would have missed out on Costa as well but I think Jose was just trolling us at the time.

2582~~~
He was a hell of a player for a decade, he just cant lead the line anymore, this isnt a knee jerk, im sure he will get on the scoresheet this season, but honestly, we would look a hell of a lot better with benteke holding the ball up and getting others into play than we do with wayne right now. We need a new striker, and this is coming from someone who actually likes Rooney.

2583~~~
Nothing, hope that he plays out of this form.

2584~~~
I have always backed Rooney but my god he is shit at the moment, to not get a shot off twice was criminal really. We need a striker in his prime if we want to be taken seriously. Rooney's head in that circle is starting to annoy me now. I want him to do well but he isn't.

2585~~~
Stick him behind hernandez and try linking up with either Depay or Mata?

2586~~~
Bench him.

2587~~~
There's not a lot he can do at the moment, you can move Rooney around but that means having to drop a player who's better suited to that position. Taking away the captaincy and buying a striker who can actually compete against him sounds like a drastic move but it will have to be done at some point, impossible to this now as the season has started but I think were in for big changes in the summer.

2588~~~
Ashley Williams be like, kid you have no idea.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/pe5n" width="560"></iframe>

2589~~~
Well done, I thought I'll never see this.

Just few more of his hardcore blind fans to go. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2590~~~
I think that sums it up nicely.
If he was paid a meagre wage, we'd swallow it better. But given that this guy is our superstar, our highest paid player, our game-changer. It's galling.

2591~~~
Nothing to be added.

2592~~~
He's at the point in his career where he has lost so much pace and explosiveness that he's randomly vacillating between quality Prem striker and talented pub player.

2593~~~
Offers nothing in the PL. Doesn't have the strength to hold the ball up, or the pace to get in behind.

The Bragge hattrick changes nothing.

2594~~~
Pretty much this, unfortunately. Looks like Wayne is on his last legs and muscles. Add to that his natural  height, and you will see why he is struggling in the EPL.

2595~~~
I'm grateful for everything he's done for the club, but I do believe - like many others - that he's holding the club back.

2596~~~
I'd agree with this. Problem with ROoney is that much of why he was so good in the past was down to that explosivness. He was reliant on it. With this gone what is left?

2597~~~
Even if he wasn't the most gifted technically speaking, he still compensated with crazy energy levels and hunger. Nowadays he's finished physically and mentally.

2598~~~
I think Rooney can still be a valuable attacking player if played with other attackers who compliment him perfectly. But not sure he is good enough to form our whole attack around him.

2599~~~
Evidently, not much.

Probably his finishing, but the lack of everything else means he doesn't get many chances.

2600~~~
Agreed. His finishing is certainly one of his strong points.

2601~~~
That's precisely the problem. If you lack physical presence, lose every 50-50, make nothing of the times you get in behind, have an inconsistent first touch and waste the times for a shot or at least an opening, then you'll struggle to score that many.

He needs to improve himself on the whole if he wants to score 20 league goals.

2602~~~
I keep hearing the argument for him being that hes not being provided service. He had probably 3 good chances and a half chance. His first chance he decides to try cut back and loses the ball. The second he takes too long and ends up trying one of his famous underhit chips. the half chance he cleared it like a defender. The third chance he is too scared to take it with his left and ends up not shooting at all and asking for a penalty.

And keep in mind this is after he got a hattrick midweek so it shouldnt really be a confidence thing.

No competition is the worst thing for a competitor.

but the worst thing is when he lost the ball and darmian was out of position, years back he would have at least dropped back to help, but he just stood there with his hands on his head.

The best thing he did today was missing the ball completely when Shaw put in a cross which meant Mata could score <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2603~~~
This one genuinely made me laugh, I really couldn't figure out what he attempted to do.

2604~~~
Looks like he's short of confidence atm.

2605~~~
Teams Rooney <i>wouldn't</i> get into...

City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Spurs, Everton, West Ham, Swansea, Southampton, West Brom

And yet, he's the man we're relying on scoring at least 20 league goals this season. He's so evidently past it. He has nothing to his game anymore apart from a few cute little passes here and there, and those long diagonal balls.

I'd laugh if it wasn't so sad. Moyes really fecked us over big time with this one.

2606~~~
Imagine Rooney in 2019. He is going to be a comedy gold for opposition fans if he still starts for us. If not already in 2016.

Gomis was today two classes above Rooney. 

Is Rooney a better striker than Gomis? A genuine question.

Nothing to do with blindness, or i'd still be saying there's nothing to worry about even now. It's more that two years ago he was being called 'past it' as well, when he decidedly wasn't.

And again, i'm still not 100% sure he is finished at the elite level. He might be, but there's plenty of games ahead of us yet.

If he is, some will undoubtedly claim vindication. But that'd be like me waking up every morning and going 'I bet you the Queen dies today'. One day, she will, but that doesn't mean i'd then have a right to go 'See? Called it!'.

2608~~~
He's our Gerrard.  

An no, he's not. Just like he's not better then Bony, Benteke, Giroud....yet I got laughed at the last time I suggested that.

2609~~~
Well today was the answer. Bugger all. 

Not as bothered as I thought I would be about the actual result though. Just confirms what we already know.

2610~~~
Just rewatched that Rooney chance near the end, fecking hell <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2611~~~
Why though?

He scored a hat-trick midweek. All first time finishes too. 

Rooney goes from showing absolutely no hesitation in a crucial Champions League tie, to being unable to get shots away from good positions against Swansea. 

Is Rooney's confidence so up and down that messing up those first half chances, that Shaw and Herrera laid on for him, meant he couldn't smash it first time when one on one late on? That's ridiculous.

2612~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Indeed. That's what I meant. We need a signing or even two and fast.

2613~~~
Well, if 2011 remains his last great year as a forward, then he's been declining for years. He was very good in the fist half of 13/14 but average in the second half. He was average last season too. He was average 12/13 as well. When was the last time when he was consistently good for at least 4-5 months?

2614~~~
That's pretty depressing.

Though LVG did sell his captain at Bayern mid way through the season, so he's not afraid of drastic moves.

2615~~~
Rooney's going nowhere. Huge deal till 2019. He's sorted for a good while.

2616~~~
That's fine. Just turn him into a squad player.

2617~~~
But context matters. 2013/14 was a terrible season for pretty much everyone, but Rooney still managed 19 goals and 18 assists in all competitions. 2014/15 saw him score some great goals in some big games, but also spend a lot of time in midfield.

That's why I specifically referenced him having a run of games in his favoured position, and in a settled side. Because then there  aren't really any 'Ifs, buts or maybes' to countenance.

Not looking promising at the moment, but we'll see.

2618~~~
Last 20 matches:

Wayne Rooney - 10 goals
Diego Costa - 8 goals
Harry Kane - 8 goals

Obviously Rooney wasn't a striker for quite a few since 14 of those games are from last season for him.

He might be past it, he might not, I'm just saying let's wait and see.

Edit - The results could also be wrong but I worked them out using soccer base and only club matches, it comes up with the players match history, that is matches that player has played in.

2619~~~
Disappointing that he had another poor performance again today after his improvement on Wednesday. I thought his whole game picked up after his first goal and we saw more of his old self, so it's annoying that he's gone back to playing poorly again.

While he did great to get that hat-trick midweek, we were ultimately against weak opposition in a game where once he'd scored one, our passage through to the next stage was virtually guaranteed. Still an impressive hat-trick, but we need to see him stepping up and getting crucial goals; match winners and the like. He's our captain, and with the money he's on is supposed to be the teams key player. He just hasn't looked like that type of player for a good while, though.

2620~~~
People he should have used his left but it doesn't matter which foot he should have shot with. From that position, even a toe poke would have been better than what he did.

2621~~~
If you're counting just league games:
Costa has 10 goals (1 in 4 this season, 9 in the last 16 last season)
Kane has 13 goals (0 in 4 this season, 13 in the last 16 last season)
Rooney has 4 goals (0 in 4 this season, 4 in 16 last season)

If you're going for all competitions:
Costa has 5 in the last 20 (1 in the league this season, 4 in the league last season)
Kane has 8 in the last 20 (8 in the league last season)
Rooney has 8 in the last 20 (3 vs Brugge, 4 in the league last season, 1 v Arsenal in the FA Cup)

2622~~~
Complete garbage yet again. Brugge wouldn't even be a mid table PL team and they set out to attack but he can't fool anyone for more than the odd game, completely past it.

2623~~~
That contract is a millstone round our necks.

2624~~~
I think that he'll be a starter this season, cover/bench next season and then MLA/Qatar for the next two seasons or until he retires.

2625~~~
Rooney the striker is finished.
He just doesn't have the pace and positional discipline to play the role.

I'd happily see him slot back into the #10 role.
Honestly, at this moment in his career, I would look at making him more of a squad player, or off loading him, but the contract length and wages are gonna make that impossible

2626~~~
Right now, he is among the worst strikers. Even the joke that Eder is, managed to hold the ball up more impressively.

2627~~~
I'd rather not. We just can't keep shoving Rooney into all these positions because he's going to be shit in every one of them.

2628~~~
When we had to do that with Kagawa apart from 1 or 2 realised it just was the player. Not the manager, not the position. It just was the player that wasn't good enough. WIth Rooney who is even worse atm ppl try to find all sorts of excuses. Really strange.

2629~~~

2630~~~
16 shots in 10 games with 8 on target <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2631~~~
Absolutely.

I listed a few clubs earlier that he wouldn't start for. Including teams like West Ham and West Brom. And not one single person has questioned it.

2632~~~
He gets no service, is played out of position, Nani, needs a run of games to get going, bad luck,...

2633~~~
Bottom line: He's talked a bloody good game. He's demanded being the main man and he's our best earner after agitating for a move/a payday twice. He's supposed to be our go to guy, our captain, our star man.

And he's quite possibly our poorest first XI player. 

That's a huge fecking problem.

2634~~~
One thing has to be said....his agent has done an incredible job. 

He's the true genius in all of this.

2635~~~
Sir Alex was right wanting to sell when his stock was high. The lad has been a shadow of his former self. He seems to have lost power, pace and he's even lost his acclaimed fighting spirit judging from his showings so far.

2636~~~
I swear to god i'm looking forward to a rooney-free team more than a trophy winning team these days

2637~~~
Agreed completely. Wonder if Mr Stretford wants to take me on as a client and get me a pay rise?

2638~~~
Even if we do get another striker I fear LvG will play him in place of Herrera and Mata.

2639~~~
All of this. Short of going to Carrington and protesting I'm afraid we're stuck because the club/LVG are kissing his arse. Can't believe we've gotten into this situation<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2640~~~
I guarantee you he would.

2641~~~
This.

This <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

And almost certainly this.

2642~~~
The real problem for me, is that he seems to have so much power internally at the moment that it's totally taken away his motivation and need to prove himself in every match. He's not the same Rooney as he was under Ferguson....and when he wasn't the same Rooney under him, Fergie wanted to get rid. I've always been a Rooney supporter, but for the first time I'm wondering whether he's a spent force, not only in his age, but his hunger to. LVG needs to drop him, however...who the hell do we have otherwise? I mean who is there? No one.

2643~~~
Just when things started to get better, a shitstorm descends on him. Kinda feel sorry for the lad.

2644~~~
What I don't understand is does no one in the club hierarchy (maybe apart from Sir Alex) see that depending on Rooney is not the answer? How can an intelligent man like LVG fall for this as well? Surely he can see that his performances are not what we need? It all just puzzles me.

2645~~~
...does Giggs have a say in all this? This is a guy who really understands how players tick. No..not a manager yet, but a guy who understands the playing side of it really well.

2646~~~
I think it's more of a case that the wages he is on, there is no way we are going to be able to sell him, so we have to play him it seems

2647~~~
Bugge were also ravaged by injuries too for the record

2648~~~
Giggs should understand what Rooney is about but, his mate Gary Nev et al never criticise Rooney. Everybody else is thrown under the bus except Rooney. There is a bias towards Rooney which I believe Giggs has as well. Wouldn't be surprised if he advised LVG to give the captaincy to Rooney. Plus, as much as I loved him as a player, Giggs is very sneaky. He's waiting for LVG to feck up so that he's right there to take over. No way do I believe he has the integrity to put the needs of the club above his own ambitions. I'm sorry if it sounds harsh but that's my reading on him.

2649~~~
I worry about this too.

2650~~~
I think Rooney will play this season and then LvG would decide what to do with him. If he succeeds then great but if he fails than it will be a season too late. I just don't understand why LvG is taking such a risk where his past seasons performance suggest he's not the player he was when he was 23-24.

2651~~~
You are characterizing Giggs as sneaky without knowing him? Neville usually don't criticize English NT players incl not only Rooney but Joe Hart amongst others as well.

2652~~~
no need for discussion, Rooney is past it, we may as well bring back Bobby Charlton

2653~~~
Hate to say it but screwing your brother's wife does seem a bit sneaky in my book.

2654~~~
It is in normal circumstances but didn't his brother's wife had a reputation for having a fetish for footballers or something?

2655~~~
Dunno what fetish she has/had. But you need to take into account Giggs' ambition to manage Man Utd. No way does he give a damn about anything except realising that ambition. He wouldn't try shit with Sir Alex, but everyone else is fair game. You watch if things get worse with our results, Scholes, Neville and so on will be having their little digs, no doubt with Ryan's full approval. Sorry, it's just the way I see them in this situation. Irrespective of all that, he will be no help whatsoever in the Rooney saga. They get on, and he won't be objective in this instance imo.

2656~~~
Good point, Giggs was only doing the honourable thing of exposing her! paying for the abortion only further proves what a great guy he is.

I love Giggs as a player and as a United Legend but he is a real cnut. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/> 

Also Rooney needs to pull the trigger sooner, get in the box, shoot on sight! simple.

2657~~~
Rooney is our hope for the season? Then we will have a very tough job to get in top 4. It may even be beyond us.

2658~~~
This is a huge fear of mine. We need two quality attacking players *and* a manager willing to sit Rooney.

2659~~~
I just saw that he's my lowest rated player this season, even with the 9 I gave him against Brugge. 0.1 points below Chicharito in second to last place.

I'd be shocked if he justifies more than a 4 in our next game too, with it being against Liverpool.

2660~~~
Rooney looks like a pub league player in every match. But he is on 300k a week . Ed Woodward spends most of his time looking for sponsors who will give the Glazers cash if they allow them to use the club logo. He has got a hell of a lot of money with that method. But contrary to the belief of many supporters of United, that cash will not be used in the interests of the club. It will go in the same direction as the future 700 million from Addidas and the 350 million from Chevrolet will go. Do not expect to see it being used to make the team better on the pitch. The owners have other plans. That is just my view.

2661~~~
It'll be "Rooney's back" again next week when he scores a couple against San Marino. That dive when he knew he'd fluffed the chance was pathetic, so depressing knowing that this guy is the Captain

2662~~~
I don't know about any of that. We got rid of lot of deadwood incl Cleverly, Evans, Fletcher who probably also got well with Giggs. Rooney is not yet a deadwood. I think its silly from management not to get competition for him which 'd have been ideal for the club going forward. But Giggs vetoing anything about Rooney that LvG decides is probably not the complete truth. 

I don't care about who shaggs whom as long as its not rape. Rooney need to improve a lot to be a real valuable player for us. Right now he seems like a liability and hence the need to sign a quality player to provide competition for him and if necessary replace him.

2663~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Does that make the fact that he chose to sleep with her any better? That's going against the bro code. Literally.

2664~~~
I agree its against bro code. But beyond that its subjective. It makes him a dick personally but does that make him a selfish arrogant who is trying to ruin LvG's career for personal ambitions? I don't think so. Plus LvG should be able to make big calls by himself.

2665~~~
His lack of striker's instinct in this match was very concerning. To not even get a shot away from two scenarios of being seemingly through on goal is poor. 

For the first one he showed good pace but then had to drive across Williams' path, not attempt to cut back, allowing him to tackle. He didn't seem to back himself dribbling at full speed so put the brakes on. 

For the second one he did really well to create the opportunity and then made the same mistake again. Infuriating. 

I will support him to the bitter end but these performances have become all to frequent. He has obviously lost the pace and power of his youth but he now seems to have lost his clinical edge which came in his mid 20s.

2666~~~
How did you work that out, Soccerbase has it my way, I checked again. I went for all competitions too but only club, no country.

Also Kane surely has three of his eight against Leicester? You should include that if you want to specify hatricks.

2667~~~
I looked it up on Transfermarkt. And yes, Kane has 3 of his 8 against Leicester. 

Kane had 4 games this season with 0 goals, in his last 16 games in 2014/15 he had 1 goal v Everton, 1 goal v Newcastle, 3 goals v Leicester, 2 goals v QPR and 1 goal v West Ham. This is including all competitions so the last 20 games includes 2 games vs Fiorentina in the Europa League and the League Cup Final, all 3 of those games he failed to score. 

In the last 20 league games he got 13 goals, same as above plus 1 goal v Liverpool, 2 v Arsenal and 2 v West Brom.

2668~~~
This may upset some people here but should Rooney be stripped of his captaincy?

2669~~~
According to transfermarkt

In all competitions in 20 matches Rooney has 9 goals, you missed the FA Cup tie against Preston.

We seem to agree on Harry Kane's 8 in his last 20 matches.

Diego Costa also has 8 in 20 according to transfermarkt. You need to check his other competitions, he plays FA Cup against Watford, Capitol one against Liverpool twice and Spurs, and Champions League twice against PSG.

Counting just the last 20 league games is fine for Costa and Kane but it's not fair when discussing Rooney as a striker since he actually started playing that position from 20 matches in all competitions ago.

2670~~~
First comment on this forum since watching the game. Absolutely diabolical, just as I predicted the Brugge game was 100% irrelevant considering those guys are as good as your local pub league players. Its worrying that the guy is 29 and he is already fecking finished! RvP at 29 was a beast, single handedly winning us the league

2671~~~
Ah yeah I fecked up, Transfermarkts American date system messed up my mind. I hate that there isn't an option to view all the games in the order they were played.

2672~~~
I know he had a poor game and he's generally been poor for a while... But I just think he doesn't suit Van gaal's style as a striker, at all. Rooney thrives when we play with quick football, and have other players running up with him, so he can pick the ball up and run with it and have others stretching teams to give him space. We don't play with that style at all. Rooney isn't suited at all to a slow, possession, safe play based on tight control and slowly trying to unlock defences. Put him in a counter attacking team and he'll be at his best, which you can also say for Mata and Memphis.

2673~~~
The only part that is not pure speculation.

2674~~~
I agree and think most of our players dont. This possession ticky tacka we are trying to play doesn't suit most of our players. Memphis was just as shit today for example.

2675~~~
I disagree with the bold. There is quite a bit of selfishness in choosing to lay your brothers wife. I do agree with the rest of the post however. I very much doubt LVG relies on Giggs to make his decisions nor that Giggs is trying to feck up his career.

2676~~~
He's a complete dung heap.

2677~~~
With the wage and status he has, he should be putting in the kind of performance he did against Spurs last season at least once every 5 games or so whilst not dropping massively in standard in the games lying in between. Think about that for a second.

2678~~~
Walker nicked the ball off him v Spurs. Fortunate for us it went in.

Same thing today. He gets into good positions and then does not convert.

He cannot play 2 games in a week anymore. He needs to drop back to being a 10 and play behind a 9.

2679~~~
Oh, come on. He's not <i>that</i> complete.

2680~~~
His agent has done brilliantly. Is the contract really until 2019? That is so utterly depressing if true. The British media need to stop making excuses for him too. If he's struggling it is because of the system or because he is out of position. He's shit as a nine or a ten these days! It is just unbelievable how cautious they are with him. He's been our worst outfield player by an absolute mile. He is a serious issue.

2681~~~
Yep. It suits our defensive organization and out central midfielders probably, but none of our attacking players. Basically if we combine possession play with some quick counter attacking football when it comes to our midfield and forwards, we'd be much better off

2682~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Makes me laugh we are discussing about Giggs and his sleeping around. But all these top professional probably are selfish and competitive.

2683~~~
Agree.The back 6 pass the ball about, but the front 4 haven't got a clue how to attack this way.

2684~~~
Rooney used to chase lost causes, these days that just refers to his first touch.

I really don't know what we are going to do with him, we are trying to update our football to match up with the other top clubs and to me he just isn't cut out for the endless pressing and lack of touches that a #9 gets, and frankly lacks the deft short passing game and dribbling to play as the #10.

2685~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Indeed. I almost forgot it was a Wayne Rooney thread for a moment and I agree; to reach the top in most cases, you must be selfish in more ways than not.

2686~~~

2687~~~
I don't think it will take long until Smalling gets it tbh.

2688~~~
After he gave the ball away for their first he just stood there. Was poor from a captain.

2689~~~
Ah not to worry....

He'll score against whatever shithouse England are playing and the headlines will be...

"Rooney, best in the world!"
"Rooney! Robson, Eric and Keane rolled into one!"
"Rooney, 90% of mothers want their kids to be like him!"

The Caf will eat it up but, in reality, Fergie handed his head on a plate to Moyes, when we all saw Rooney decline.....And we're now here, unable to get rid of him and having to watch him fluff any decent chance to be a captain and cost us dearly

Robbo, Bruce, Eric and Keane....They're the benchmark...He falls below that standard

2690~~~
A decision taken by Moyes will haunt us for years. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2691~~~
Just feck him, drop him to the reserves and never give him chances, we're paying him either way playing or not playing, not playing him at least won't ruin the team so much.

2692~~~
He's a spent force. As with most things, Fergie knew.

Now LvG has put all trust in him...he's made his bed and will have to lie in it.

2693~~~
Prick did everything that SAF advised/wanted him to not do - sack all the staff, give a new bumper contract to Rooney, marginalize all the other senior players. The Moyes debacle is going to hurt us for a few more years

2694~~~
That last chance summed him up. He goes pass Williams I think then he's clear on goal and instead of shooting he makes one more step, don't know why and is bundled by Williams. Penalty or not he could have shot 3 times before he fell. Destroyed some nice through balls passed to him.

2695~~~
Aye <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

2696~~~
I feel so sick of Rooney right now, that I think we'd better off with him being injured for a few months.  Bloody - having no striker is better than playing with Rooney and watching him talk big and deliver naught.   I thought he maybe turned a corner with Brugge, but man,  yesterday was up there with his worst performances for us (and there have been a fair bit in the last couple of years).  Somehow, him being shit has coloured every opinion of the United team I have right now - and I can't think past that.  He slows up the attack,  misses sitters and screams at the ref asking for a penalty when its clear as day that he fecked it up!

It doesn't help that we have this stupid international break, coz my anger with him for this loss will keep festering for 2 weeks.  We had a chance to be 6 points ahead of Chelsea and we screwed up.   For all of their problems, it saddens me that we are only 3 points better off.  It doesn't help that bloody city have made the most of it.

2697~~~
Why is LVG exempt from sacking Wayne based on his performances. If anything, Wayne should be shitting bricks worried whether or not he will be in the squad.

2698~~~
Fully agree.  But LVG should share the blame.  He had a great relationship with RVP, but chose Rooney over him! I still don't understand that decision, but things could have been very different had RVP come back straight after the world cup.  I don't think Rooney would have been able to do whatever politics s***ing up he did to land the captains role.

2699~~~
Because LVG said so.  Rooney is my captain - so he has special privileges.

2700~~~
It's so frustrating to watch him play. What is he even trying to to? Chip the goalie every time? If he, as a lone striker, can't take a shot 5 meters from goal then he has no place in this team at all. It's as if he doesn't realize that the opposing defenders will try and prevent him from scoring, there is just no urgency from him when he finds himself in dangerous positions.

2701~~~
He's done as a top level forward. Fergie could see it and I can't believe LVG isn't seeing it. 

Tactically he is absolutely destroying this team by continnually ignoring his duties. In this system, he absolutely has to stay as far up top as possible but instead we get the Wayne Rooney show in the half way line. I'm not having this bollocks of he does it to get on the ball and influence the game - he has to understand he kills this team by doing that.

2702~~~
He took a goal from similar position vs Brugge and took it very well, don't know why he diddle daddled yesterday when through on goal, just put the fecking ball in the net!

2703~~~

2704~~~
Handjobs?

2705~~~
He's tried that chip countless times. It rarely works. 

Going to be very hard to get rid of him. This is like RVN situation. But atleast RVN still scored goals. Not one top club in Europe would want him. 

I just don't get this guy. A few years ago he wanted to go to Chelsea because he wanted to play as number 9 and all the media were saying that's his best position. Now they saying it is number 10.

2706~~~
At this rate even Swansea would prefer to play Gomis upfront

Touching the ball less than the keeper?

2707~~~
Oh LvG absolutely is to blame as well. He's continued to put Rooney in a position of prominence, just like Moyes did. Arguably to a higher degree as well.

But its Moyes that had the golden opportunity to get rid. Now, with a 300k/week contract, its much harder.

2708~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34104468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34104468</a>

Some more excuses and some more lazy journalism by Jason Roberts.

He should now be nr. 10 and Mata and Herrera should do more runs cause Rooney likes to drift around.

2709~~~
I know I'm going to be alone in this, but whatever. To preface this, I don't think he was good yesterday - but I don't think he was as poor as most think either, and there were at least 3 players that were more detrimental to the team performance than he was. In any case, I think he's improving. I'm not sure whether it's him or it's the team getting a bit better, but at the beginning of the season, first couple of games (and similar against Newcastle), we weren't creating anything. Unless I'm mistaken, this is our PL game with the most clear cut chances, and I think Rooney (and Herrera) were responsible for this yesterday. People were criticizing his movement and the fact he wouldn't take on players. Yesterday, he got two chances when running in behind the defence (passes from Shaw and Herrera) and one when taking in both CBs, the hail Mary clearance he converted into a clear cut chance (which came from a sublime touch). 

Now I'm not excusing his finishing, it was awful yesterday, you could tell the killer instincts just weren't there and he's still thinking too much, when really a striker should be reacting in a split second with his instincts, which Rooney definitely had. Whether those instincts are definitely gone or just need reigniting is of course a question that's still up in the air, and I know the majority consensus on here, but I just wanted to say that there's signs of us having more penetration and ability to create chances than I initially feared, and Rooney's game yesterday was a big reason in that.

2710~~~
Problem is when he was in good situations he overthought it, when Shaw put him through for instance he tried to dribble and lost the ball instead on going through in the direction of the goal or at least shot it. Not to mention that last chance when he took a step more for no apparent reason when he had all the time in the world to shot. When he needs to shoot he dribbles, when he needs to dribble he shoots.

2711~~~
That's exactly what I'm saying, currently his instincts in front of goal aren't great. But funnily enough, the monkey on his back seems to be limited to PL because his three goals against Brugge were the exact opposite, just quick thinking and execution (and for that aspect, it doesn't really matter what the level of opposition is, it's split second stuff). I thought the one where Herrera put him through and he tried the chip wasn't actually a dreadful decision, the angle for a left footed shot wasn't great (even though he could've tried it), and the ship wasn't necessarily a poor decision, the execution was just missed. The other two though were chances he realistically should've put away and where his slow reactions were the problem.

2712~~~
How much more we should wait for him though?

2713~~~
Oh I'm not suggesting anything myself, it's not a decision for me to make but for the management - and the impression I'm getting is that they're willing to wait. I just wanted to post my impressions on his performance yesterday and what I felt was wrong as I feel there's a huge overreaction to his game on here, but I'm used to it anyway.

My feeling is that he'll probably need a reference game to start firing again, just some clean neat goals that will dust off the cobwebs and get it all rolling again. I thought maybe the Brugge game would work a treat, as they were real striker goals, but I guess he's feeling the pressure more in the PL.

2714~~~
The only difference Rooney being moved to the number 10 position would bring would be him being fecking rubbish in a slightly different area of the pitch.

He needs to be dropped. He needs to be sold really but that isn't happening anytime soon so just dropping him will do for now.

2715~~~
Say I don't disagree, why does he spend so much time away from the opposition centre backs/full backs? His job is to occupy them and push towards their own goal - he continually ends up on the half way line. Whether he's scoring or not, the team will not succeed until he starts doing what he should be. 

PS. All the so called pundits in the media defending him does my fecking box in. I remember Rvp lambasted by the media for fewest touches in game at emirates last season/season before.....no mention of that when it comes to Rooney. It's everybody else's fault.

2716~~~
I don't think he does to be honest, and definitely not yesterday.

As for the media part, I don't watch English TV or read the papers, so I'm not really affected by that.

2717~~~
He was less coming near the middle or out of the box for the ball but still too much. He should have played like vs Brugge, occupy positions in which striker should be, not constantly drift around and ask for the ball. You have wingers and midfielders behind you, wait for the right ball.

2718~~~
Rooney had 39 touched against Swansea. RvP got stick after a game where he touched the ball 12 times.

2719~~~
I wasn't meaning touches for Rooney in this way - bad example. I was more meaning performance in general.

2720~~~
Watch each of the games again from this season and watch where he ends up everytime we have the ball. You may be right that yesterday was in fact an improvement but its a mile off what we need from a No.9 with this system.

2721~~~
You're a lucky man GIP. English TV refuses to acknowledge the obvious problem live. Instead it's everyone else's fault.

2722~~~
It was nowhere near as awful a performance in general as you'd think from this thread. People on here are so emotionally involved in the whole Rooney thing they exagerrate wildly. Especially after a bad result. He was awful against Villa. He wasn't awful yesterday.

He should have done better with those chances but none of them were straightforward and the fact he played a sloppy pass in the build-up to their goal also puts him in the firing line. In reality he was up against one of the most in-form CB pairings in the league and his all-round game was decent enough. Not great but by no means awful. If he'd scored the equaliser after that sensational first touch/nutmeg near the end we'd all be looking back on his game very differently. 

The media aren't as emotionally involved so their opinion is more balanced. They slaughtered him after Villa, they're not being as critical now. Which is fair.

2723~~~
I think he played better overrall, he seems to be getting chances now, where he wasn't really before.
HOWEVER the second one should have been a 100% goal, but instead of shooting with his left after leaving the defender for dead and being one on one with the keeper, he dilly dallied like he did vs Spurs, then attempted to bring the ball on his right and was disposed.

There should have been zero chance for Williams to tackle him after he got past him.

2724~~~
He's a good player but the spot lights on him in absence of no other options up front. In seasons past, RVP would have scored and the focus would be less on Rooney cause we were still winning...

2725~~~
By "straightforward" I mean a chance that doesn't need any additional work from him for a strike at goal. Yes, he should have hit it with his left but the fact he was coming at it on his weaker side did make it a little more complicated. Williams defended the situation very well too.  He's so strong and quick. But yeah, Rooney should have done a lot better. I don't disagree with that. It was a black mark on his performance. I just think too many people are inferring from that (as well as the weak chip and the sloppy pass mentioned above) that he had a really poor game overall. He didn't.

2726~~~
I guess the bar is set differently. For me for a top class striker that is a straightforward goal. You would also be aware of the pressure coming from your right and not manoeuvre the ball from your left.
I thought his overall performance was ok, making good runs and players were putting him in, so the chances not being creating for him stuff doesn't stand.

Put it like this, the 2 chances he had, had I had those in my Sunday league team and not even got a shot in at goal let alone score at least one of them, I would have been subbed.

2727~~~
I agree with Pogue, his Villa performance was a lot worse. Not that he was good against Swansea either, but it wasn't as bad.

2728~~~
Simple fact is the club have made stupid decisions to keep this guy happy leaving us up the creek. 

RVP was our best pure number 9. Mata is our best 10. For whatever reason there is this policy that because Rooney is captain he had to play. We sold RVP, in my opinion the wrong forward to sell and now we have Wayne damaging the entire team.

LVG knows that if he drops or strips Rooney of the captaincy there will be a media storm as he is the countries golden boy so is bottling it hoping Wayne turns it round.

I've not liked him since the contract situation years ago and now his performances are holding the entire team back. I get so angry watching this as to me at least it seems to obvious and I can't fathom how the management aren't doing something about it.

The sooner Rooney is out the club the better it will be for all parties. He'll probably get one mega payday in the MLS.

2729~~~
Respectfully, I disagree. Although you're absolutely right he was better yesterday than against Villa. As a Utd centre forward, he should have taken some of those chances. That said, my issue with him is his general movement which results in our inability to create. He's got to give the guys behind him a chance by creating space. Something Costa (I know they've started poorly) does extremely well. 

I just think it's the one position on the pitch that Utd need top level - and we don't have it in Rooney. For all I disagreed with SAF over the last years, he could see Rooney fading. His current performances have been there to see for a while.

2730~~~
His game was nowhere near 'decent enough'. He is a lead striker for one of the biggest clubs in the world, I know you love him beyond measure but this was not a satisfactory performance at all.

2731~~~
At whose cost and if his overall play and passing remains as shit as it is won't he actually do more harm to team's approach play? It's a pity that we have put ourselves in a position where we are completely reliant on him but imo he should be dropped and only allowed back in when he has proven himself in training and cameos - like every other player. He was polluting the media with his "I can score 25 goals if I play 9" garbage well so far he has proven that scoring ten will be a tough ask. What message are sending to the rest of the squad if merit applies to everyone else bar him?

2732~~~
Yep.

Especially coming off the back of 9 league games without a goal and 1 away goal in the league for about 18 months. He wasn't as atrocious as he was against Villa, but he still wasn't good enough.

2733~~~
This might have been all right by Sunderland standards. In no way this was anywhere near 'decent enough' for a player who's a supposed leader for Manchester United. Not like this was one off average performance, he plays like that all the time recently.

2734~~~
He was very poor. He had one straightforward chance where he should have scored and 2 half chances where you'd expect the goalkeeper to make a good save. Out of those 3 chances he had a very poor attempt at a chip (which was basically a pass back) and failed to get any other shot away. Most mid table centre forwards would have scored yesterday, world class strikers would expect to score a couple (the chance where he tried to cut back onto his right foot but did so in a sluggish, easy to read way was particularly poor - a simple Cruyff turn would have had the defender on his arse and created a golden opportunity).

As he's undroppable we need to move him to the right hand side, where he isn't a focal point of our attack and his poor touch and passing aren't as big of an issue. Even if it means playing Mata or Depay as a false 9 it would be a big improvement.

2735~~~
Are you talking about the chance he created for himself in the closing minutes? That wasn't even close to "straightforward" when he first received the ball.

The other two chances he definitely should have done better but you're exaggerating if you think a mid-table centre forward would have scored either of them. For example, Gomis missed an easier finish than any of Rooney's when he (similarly) did brilliantly to create a chance in the first place then clipped the post.

The one chance Gomis did score from was more clear-cut than any opportunity Rooney had. Ditto Ayew's header for their opener.

Ultimately, the service to our strikers has been consistently abysmal for over 12 months now. Falcao and RvP had to move on because their all-round game was so bad but there's a good reason two such prolific strikers had such a terrible goal return last seson.

Rooney hasn't helped himself by starting the season in very poor form but has been gradually improving and was nowher near as shite yesterday as you make out.

2736~~~
He did very well to create the chance but he let himself down with the (lack of) finish, the finish was the most straightforward part. All his chances yesterday looked to me like he has no confidence to take any shots on his left foot.

2737~~~
Yeah, agreed. It was the hesitation that killed him. Still, for all the posession we had that's a fairly paltry service he got. A long-running theme under Van Gaal.

2738~~~
Yeah he was poor, which is sadly becoming the standard now. 

Hoping he turns up finally for the next league game.

2739~~~
This is a good point. I forget who it was but I remember somebody saying that they don't necessarily see Rooney as a Giggs or a Scholes and playing until their late 30's as the football early in his career will catch up with him. He was after all a regular with club and country at the age of 17.

Maybe that has started earlier than we anticipated. What we're getting from him at the moment is not good enough by a long way though. The way Williams caught up with him yesterday was alarming. He's a decent defender but not lightning quick. Rooney is just not sharp enough and for some reason does not get his shots away when he should.

2740~~~
The chance he created for himself was straightforward. Not when he received the ball but once the 1 on 1 chance presented itself a couple of yards ahead of the last defender should be simple for any centre forward.

The chance Gomes had was a more difficult chance than putting away the 1v1, due to the more narrow angle. Likewise Gomes' other chance resulted in the width of the goalpost away from scoring - at least if Rooney was getting his shots away and forcing great saves or being 3-4 inches away you could see progress and argue he's being unlucky.

You can talk about shite service but Mata seemed to score ok with 1 decent chance. We aren't going to get 6-7 golden opportunities away at a top 8 team, which is why the difference between Rooney putting us 2-0 up or level at 2-2 is a huge deal.

We can't just keep saying "well it was good chance but not a great one", these chances are ones that you still need to score 1/3 or 1/4. This is before we even talk about top strikers who create and score goals every 4-5 games out of nothing. In terms of chance creation I'd have taken 2 great chances and maybe 3 decent chances at the start of the game.

Naturally this is before even talking about the decent counter attacking opportunity that turned into us conceding because of his horrendous touch, which has been a theme of the season so far. Potentially good opportunities breaking down due to poor touches, poor passing or generally bad play.

2741~~~
Well, no. But we should expect the more/better chances of the two teams when we have so much more of the ball. The fact we didn't is the big issue here and has feck all to do with Rooney.

2742~~~
Don't strikers also have a role to play in chance creation with their movement and touch?

2743~~~
They do. And Rooney's movement and touch was fine against Swansea. In contrast to, say, his performance against Villa.

2744~~~
Of course it has something to do with Rooney. Just like their chance creation had a lot to do with Ayew and Gomes. You have a centre forward that has no real movement, can't control a ball sent in to him at pace and can't finish and you are probably going to struggle to create chances and score goals.

As I said before if he does a simple Cruyff turn he turns a chance that we are saying is a "half chance" into a great chance. Instead he tries a slow, laborious outside of his boot turn and the defender comfortably deals with it. He finds himself in a 1v1 situation and another terrible bit of control and the defender comfortably gets back. 

The first chance might put us 2-0 up and then it's game over, we keep the ball and see out the 3 points. The second chance puts us at 2-2 and they start to get nervous.

The difference between us and Swansea yesterday was that they finished 2 of their 3 or 4 chances, we scored 1 of our 3 or 4 chances. Now the amount of money we pay our striker compared to them I'd expect our chance conversion to be higher than Swansea's. This has been a consistent feature throughout the season: Rooney should be on 2 or 3 PL goals for the season which probably gives us another 1-3 points.

2745~~~
I don't think that's up for debate Pogue going by yesterday's game. I think majority of people are pissed because he missed two to three big goal scoring opportunities. It's his performance in front of goal which was shit rathar then his overall gameplay. But at the end of the day strikers job is to finish the chances off and he failed spectacularly at that yesterday.

2746~~~
Two good opportunities yesterday and didn't even manage to get a shot away on either occasion, his best days  are long gone and if we are relying on him as our main striker we are in big trouble. Best position for him would be in number ten role but we haven't got any alternative but to play him up front.

2747~~~
If all Rooney has to do to be considered good or decent is be better than he was against Villa then standards really have dropped.

2748~~~
just finished watching the game. How on earth this player play for us. Absolute shambles. Moyes you did really well, thanks a lot

2749~~~
Not only that, how is he earning the sort of money he is to play like that for us!?

2750~~~
he played with RVP for 3 years, as a pair their chemistry was zero. Now the team has to be rejigged to get the most out of him

2751~~~
Everyobdy's fault but his. Plays at nr. 10, is crap, play him as a striker. 
Plays as a striker, is crap, play him as nr. 10.

2752~~~
can you imagine we would have 6 other forwards which are on par or better than him for that wages?

From top of my head: Gomis, Wilson, Berahino, Jayrod, Austin, Vardy..

2753~~~
But he doesn't have to make Rooney Captain, and play him every game.  Benching him (regardless of his contract) is not hard.  I want LVG to do well, but he needs to get over his Rooney shaped blind spot.

I wish <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2754~~~
Start Martial every game and bench Rooney. Yes, he is 19 and will be inconsistent, but consider this about Rooney nowadays:

- Crap unreliable first touch that ruins our attack or gives away the ball leading to counters for opponents to score goals from? Check.

- Inconsistent form? Check.

- Too slow to react, playing the game as if he's surrounded by a vaccuum bubble that's tagged "ten seconds behind real life time"? Check.

- No shots on target in the premier league? Check.

So how could any professional premier division footballer do any worse? At least this guy has pace on him/.

2755~~~
No service? Gomis was playing in a counter attacking team,  alone and isolated,  he looked more dangerous everytime he touches the ball, created a goal out of a 50/50 chance at best. 

Do you watch aguero's goal? How many things he has to do before ge scores? He did all that,  and that my friend is what world class striker does. 

If we're judging things on easy chances kevin phillips would have been world class,  it's the slim chances converted that makes the difference between pub player and world class player

2756~~~
And he's also captain and no captain would/should/could allow his team to lose the way we did, he should have scored at least 2 of his chance, its absolutely ridiculous that there are people still backing this guy and expect him to come good. He is finished at top level and not only the fans but LVG and himself should realise this.

2757~~~
He was 1 on 1 with keeper and should have been 1 on 1 with for the his other chance, they don't get better than that, let's face it a WC striker would have buried those, name me a WC striker who wouldn't.

2758~~~
I've seen Aguero miss quite a few easy chances over the last 2 or 3 games. But City create so many that he tends to slot one eventually.

2759~~~
Seems we have a Rooney replacement. If he underperforms now, we have a player who will be itching to replace him.

Unless of course we're playing a formation with both players...Rooney back at #10, which I'd prefer.

2760~~~
What has been better about Rooney's all round game?

2761~~~
Better than RvP and Falcao? Pretty much all of it.

2762~~~
So.. he can't trap a ball, miss passed, no penetration, no nothing

What makes you think he'll suddenly becomes the next zidane just because he's told to play 5 meter deeper?

2763~~~
Can't we just get Rio to spike his Rogaine with some illegal substance, that way he gets done by the FA or doping and is given a lengthy ban. Thereforemore no more Rooney in the starting 11 and we don't have to pay his wages either <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2764~~~
For example? Has his touch been better? Has he been creating chances for others? Has he been effective in holding the ball up?

2765~~~
Maybe we could frame him for murder?

2766~~~
Killing our attacking play. We'll get a conviction.

2767~~~
In a game where United had about half as much possession and he was substituted in.

2768~~~
Check his celebrations, clearly he's a masonic illuminati member. No way we'd get a conviction.

2769~~~
I hope to god signing Martial doesnt mean Rooney ends up as a #10.

2770~~~
LVG will shoehorn Rooney into the team even if it means he has to play him in goal.

The only way he's getting dropped is if he gets injured or suspended.

2771~~~
He shouted "shit" wasn't he? on telly? Ima report that to the FA

2772~~~
Get to it, there's at least a 3 match ban in there somewhere!

2773~~~
if he drops back to 10, it means Valenica will have to play aswell for his favourite pass

2774~~~
That's exactly what will happen unfortunately.

2775~~~
So apparently LVG doesn't have big balls after all.

2776~~~
Yup, no doubt about it. Januzaj going out on loan is another perfect indicator for this. Well feck my life.

2777~~~
A #10 with no first touch who can't dribble and has one pass in his locker.

2778~~~
Pretty much. But he throws himself around. That's enough for some Roneehh chants. fecking clowns.

2779~~~
A pass that doesn't suit our players- both Depay and Mata want to be moving inside during attacks not forced wide. Also a pass that Carrick/Scweinsteiger can easily pull off.

2780~~~
Watching him switch wings with that cross<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2781~~~
No worries, all the booing behind tv screens balances that.

2782~~~
Who booes at the tv screen? Smashing the screen after another one of his inept touches is even likelier.

2783~~~
That's expensive, play a drinking game rather.

2784~~~
Soon, he will be our only senior striker at the club...

Think about that.

2785~~~
Posted this in the Januzaj thread and gonna repeat here as it's relevant.

I can't believe I'm about to defend Januzaj somewhat but I can't help but think something...

Januzaj hasn't been very good at all but I wonder if Rooney's finishing had been remotely close to PL standard on some of the through balls Adnan played him in on, would Adnan still be here?

Felt very much like a test LVG gave him and he failed, with a massive assist from Rooney's negligence. So has Rooney indirectly just killed his chances this season with us?

2786~~~
I don't think LvG had too many issues with his attacking play, its his chronic inability to keep the ball and leaving us open to counter attacks that probably sealed the deal that he's not really ready.

To be frank, Rooney did the exact same mistake for the first goal yesterday by misplacing a pass straight to Swansea.

2787~~~
Well that's another assist to go with the Walker one. And they say Wayne is past it...

2788~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2789~~~
2019? OMG <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> it is 4 years to go, and he is already on the wane. (excuse the pun)

2790~~~
I am speechless on that one, but I am sure he notices it, and the day will come when he reacts, hopefully soon.

2791~~~
That part shouldn't be acceptable from any striker for any club with decent aspiration.

2792~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> We're getting rid of all the players. Except the one that really needs getting rid of.

2793~~~
I think this was obvious the moment Januzaj was strongly linked to a move to Dortmund. He'll play 10 behind Martial. So we're in a situation where a 19 year old striker with a big price tag is thrown into the first team and expected to contribute immediately.

Also, we're buying and selling players based on Rooney's inability to play as 9, AND his undroppable status. fecking hell.

2794~~~
Does he even do that any more? He might throw himself around the staff canteen when he's hiring and firing kitchen staff but he rarely does it on the pitch these days.

2795~~~
I remember  wing ridiculed earlier in the summer when I suggested that his status may even be partially contractual. The timing of his last deal was perfect for him and he had us over a barrel. It was clear that Moyes was smitten with him, and I suspect that at the very least, his captaincy was agreed as part of his deal. Moyes was the boss then and probably gladly okayed it, thinking he would make Rooney his next captain after Vidic anyway.

Van Gaal has shown a ruthlessness with any other underperforming player. I cannot think of one player who has been playing poorly and remained I  the side, or even remained at the club. Yet Rooney is treated as if his performances are consistently the best on the pitch.

2796~~~
Then we are well and truly fecked

2797~~~
Yes of course let's sell Rooney tomorrow shall we?

2798~~~
For the long term sake of our club I would

2799~~~
And then be the first to complain about only having Martial and Wilson as our strikers. Yeah, great thinking.

2800~~~
The whole problem was created by Moyes and has been perpetuated by LVG. He's been ruthless in cutting loose players who have under performed, but has made undroppable the one person who's form should be held to the highest standard. If we are left with Martial and Wilson then so be it, I'd be happier not having a Gerrard situation.

2801~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/watch/video/9972919/neville-rooney-needs-freedom" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/watch/video/9972919/neville-rooney-needs-freedom</a>

Don't have sound at work so if someone could fill me in what Gary is saying. Something about Rooney needing more freedom. Basically more excuses for him.

2802~~~
Yeah Neville is a bullshitter when one of his agenda driven matters are affected.

2803~~~
British media love for Rooney is astonishing really.

2804~~~
The same freedom we've afforded Mata, Herrera, Di Maria and Januzaj?

2805~~~
We are now entirely reliant on him, and our most realistic chance of achieving anything this season is tied with him not being quite as finished as people are saying that he is.

2806~~~
Yup looks that way, and unfortunately I'm in the camp that feel that he is long past his best.

2807~~~
Even if he is not finished and he improves, sooner or later he'll get injured for at least 5-10 games considering that happened few times per season in pretty much every season(apart from last one, right?). And we are playing formation with pretty much two strikers.

So excited about this season.

2808~~~
Hes taking a huge amount of the wage bill till 2019, on huge money where other teams would expect a player on such money to be getting a goal or an assist most games, while our Rodney hasnt done anything since the start of the season, not true as after the city game of his "silent domination", he has been very poor as he was throughout since LVG took over

SAF knew exactly what he was doing when he wanted to get rid of Rooney

2809~~~
I'm amazed Van Gaal has seen Rooney's performances so far and decided he's all we need to fight on four fronts. Incredible. Van Gaal is literally betting everything on Rooney, I think in a year's time Wayne's position at the club is going to be much different to how it is right now.

2810~~~
Really hope Rooney is dropped now.

Martian is a better option up front, and we have a better No. 10 in Mata and Herrera

2811~~~
Is he? Sure would hope so considering the amount he set us back with but can't say I've seen him play bar the match against Arsenal at Emirates.

2812~~~
It feels like every second post on Rooney states this at some kind of fact, when it isn't.

2813~~~
If were using Martial as a striker then Mata and Herrera will suffer from this, one will get dropped and the other will be forced to play on the wing.

2814~~~
I hope this won't alienate him up top...

2815~~~
Martial/Martian 

Tom-ay-to/Tomato

2816~~~
While it isn't an established fact; it looked pretty ominous at the end of Fergie's career that he would have maybe sold him had he remained in charge.

2817~~~
Classic, guy hasn't kicked a ball in the league and he's already a better option than Rooney. 

Tagline worthy that is, the typo is the icing on the cake.

2818~~~
Valencia upfront with his right leg in a cast is a better option that Rooney up top at the minute

2819~~~
Just out of interest which through balls are you referring to? Only one I can remember is the Newcastle chance where Rooney finished but was offside. Of course I appreciate that the fact that Rooney hasn't been put through clear on goal much in the league is also down to his poor form.

2820~~~
So yesterday I was talking with a non-United supporting friend about football and bemoaning Rooney's performances and my friend said he hasn't watched us live but the impression he got from highlights was that he was playing fairly well. Anyway I just went on iplayer and watched their package of the Swansea game on MOTD 2 and it was amazing, this was the main game of the day, first up on the show with a lot of time devoted to the game itself as well as studio analysis. Despite this they:

1. Edited out the moment when Rooney was played through by Shaw and due to being slow and indecisive was tackled by Williams.
2. Edited out the moment when Rooney was played through by Herrera and the best he could do was chip the ball gently to their keeper.
3. They did show Rooney giving the ball away for Swansea's equaliser but even though Rooney's pass was straight at the defender and nowhere near a red shirt the commentator made no mention of the error, or his failure to try and atone for it, and instead called it first a block and then an interception by the defender.
4. In the post match analysis the only talk of Rooney, who has been our worst player in every league game so far, was to say that he lacked confidence, and then the blame was quickly shifted to our other players who, apparently, are not providing Rooney with enough service.

I've grown used to commentators like Neville and Owen downplaying Rooney's faults and exaggerating his abilities but as someone who doesn't watch MOTD I thought that was just a bias limited to his friends. I didn't know the flagship football programme of the country would actively edit out Rooney missing chances to promote a narrative that chances aren't being created for him.

2821~~~
To be fair it doesn't take much to be a better option than Rooney at this moment in time.

2822~~~
MOTD is a pile of crap

2823~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2824~~~
Hopefully his last year at the club. He's an average footballer,  and massively undeserving of his status here.

2825~~~
Assuming he carries on with this dreadful form, we'd still find it hard to get rid of him because no top in their right state of mind would pay his wages. Certainly no self-respecting top tier club would even want him.

2826~~~
I imagine that LA Galaxy would happily take him and pay him a vast amount of money

2827~~~
This has now plummeted to the depths of a new bizarre low.

2828~~~
Rags media. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2829~~~
Whatever happens, if we finally reach the point of deciding he isn't up to it and we don't want him anymore, then he won't be in the team.

Also, I'm sure a team like PSG will see him as a coup, given his brand. They are new money, and are still trying to convince the world that they matter. They will spin it as them taking the biggest star from the biggest club. Failing that, City probably would not have developed enough ettiquette to resist the opportunity to sign the United captain, even if he's shite.

2830~~~
So our season will largely depend on how he performs..Buckle up boys and girls..its going to be a long ride.

2831~~~
That's a good point actually.

They signed an obvious fecking crock like Hargreaves just on the off chance it would wind us up.  I think they'd be all over Rooney if it was a possibility, even the Rooney of 2015.

2832~~~
Those cnuts have been doing it even before they hit the lotto. Not just Hargreaves and Tevez, but the likes of Schmeichel, Kanchelskis, Cole and probably a few other 'United Legends' have been snapped up given half the chance.

2833~~~
Even when they're bigtime, they're smalltime.

2834~~~
Scored penalty for England , 1 more to break sir bobby's record

2835~~~
Not a lot of reactions so far.

2836~~~
him or this thread?

2837~~~
This thread.

2838~~~
San Marino. Penalty. No one cares.

2839~~~
Typical really. Had he got sent off this place would have been full of comments.

2840~~~
Robbie Keane is the 13th highest scorer in international football.
He's also the 3rd highest in Europe, and 3 goals away from overtaking Klose and Gerd Muller

Do people think he's world class?

2841~~~
Scoring from open play would be a minor miracle, though I am amazed that he managed to score a penalty. I think his last penalty for MUFC, was a miss (somebody correct me if I am wrong).
Against Brugge he was very good - but apart from that game, all other recent games he has played in, he has been average or poor.

I am shocked that he not only has LVG under his spell, but also Hodgson.
That's 2 different managers who have made him their Captain.

And for those who think that Martial should be our striker - MUFC should not be using a 19 year old as their main striker. That's too much pressure for someone so young who has never faced an EPL team, which IMO is the most physical league in the World.

2842~~~
not one, but two threads based on his tying goal have been created. hardly reactionless

2843~~~
Do you think bobby charlton was world class?

2844~~~
Scored a penalty against a pub side to continue his inevitable crawl towards a record we've all known he would break for years. Not much to discuss really.

2845~~~
It's good for Rooney that he did not break the record against San Marino.

2846~~~
There's not a lot to say, England were playing a Sunday League team in a ground that looked more like a country club with zero atmosphere on a pitch made of dried cornflakes and glue. Rooney got his record equaling goal from a dodgy penalty that no one seemed to understand and missed out on breaking the record when his first touch let him down on the other good chance he had.

2847~~~
San Marino no 9 missed last few games as he could not find another person to look after his bar when he was away playing football <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>
Anyways good to see all the goal fecked players score some goals.

2848~~~
I think he will start scoring once the team is settled, I still expect him to score 20-25 goals this season.

2849~~~
I still think that trying to play a hold up 9 role is pointless and massively hindering his ability to score. Especially with the way Mata is playing. I'd love to see Martial on the right playing like Valencia used to, see if we can get him scoring regularly.

2850~~~
Yes. I want Mata to play in that #10 role, with Memphis and Martial on the left and right wings.

2851~~~
That makes just too much sense for LVG so nope,we wont be seeing that.

2852~~~
Haha,yeah obviously.

2853~~~
Yeah, that's why we were typing furiously on our keyboards while he went about managing Bayern, Barca and the Dutch national team. What a travesty.

2854~~~
Hey, I could've managed Barcelona...but I had a 'paper round.

2855~~~
Haha, we'll see. It was a luxury that has not been afforded to RVP, Falcao, Di Maria and Chicharito so far. Wilson can adapt because he's younger, I am still thinking down the lines of "if you want Rooney to start scoring, wouldn't you move the pieces into a position that get him scoring?..." Right now he's playing a particular role that is clearly and obviously not his game, in a system that is out of balance and he's already up against it trying to at least be prolific enough.

If you look at how our strikers and attacking players have performed.. What has transpired so far has been pretty grim if you ask me, Rooney is not a magician.

This is what I was doing when LVG was managing Barcelona.

2856~~~
Why would you want to play Martial on the wings? I think that never helped Welbeck, yes it got him minutes in the first XI, but learning a position that he wasn't made for. Martial may do a job but he's a striker and we bought him for that reason.

2857~~~
Martial is not Welbeck.He is capable of playing that position.

2858~~~
Did you read my post? I didn't say he wasn't capable, I said it wouldn't be good for his development

2859~~~
I thought he mainly played left up in a three for Monaco?

2860~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Managing Bayern, Barca and Dutch national team surely means he can't do no wrong, he's like perfect, isn't he?

2861~~~
As an inside direct forward not a supportive winger.. Depay is on the left, Martial should play center

2862~~~
I know he's trying his best for United, but being stubborn isn't best of qualities.

Sometimes you need to adopt to players, but him insisting on his philospohy means either players play like he expect them or they don't play at all, it's a shame really, because with some minor twists (players playing their natural positions) we could play really good footy.

Rooney, like RVP last season, looks too isolated up-front and with no impact at all, and that's mostly due to tactics.

2863~~~
I did. But your mentioning of Welbeck suggested that you expect him to go down that path. 

I don't see how playing on the right for a year or 2 would halt his development - and i don't think LVG is going to place the mantle of scoring all on a 19 year old, which makes me believe Martial will <i>initially</i> be used in other roles(just like Wilson), with Rooney remaining in the #9 role.

2864~~~
Will rooney get dropped? He's the square pegs that's making all the round pegs square. 

It'll be very straightforward lineup for united if he's not playing

2865~~~
No, let me simplify this complex and convoluted line of thought for you. Since he has managed at those clubs and succeeded, there is a very high probability that he may have his reasons for the decisions that he is making based on information that neither you or I am privy to.

It is acceptable to question his judgement but unacceptable to hold the opinion that somehow every blind man and his dog can see something that LVG cannot see and he has built his career on the back of decisions made simply through his blinkered vision and his inflexibility.

2866~~~
Considering he has done this 4 times in 13 seasons and is currently in his worst form since 2010 what exactly makes you so sure?

2867~~~
1. I didn't say I was entirely sure, I was only making a prediction.
2. Considering this is going to be only his 3rd full season as a pure 9, with it being only August - I don't think predicting 20-25 goals is far fetched, I expect him to pick up form as the season progresses.

2868~~~
But he ISN'T a pure 9, he doesn't have the self control, a pure 9 shouldn't be dropping back into midfield constantly, chasing back to left back right back and everywhere bar goalkeeper. 
 I know his work rate has been a big win for us over the years but if he had played like a 9 he would have been played AS a 9. As for his form picking up, Normally it does, but this time im not so sure.

2869~~~
His best position will always be up for debate. What i don't understand is why you're using <i>a</i> prediction to dispute <i>my</i> prediction.

2870~~~
because my prediction has more supporting evidence <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2871~~~
Wow, thanks for the insight, I can see now things I never seen before, like he wasn't really fired from Bayern and Barcelona, it was more due to incompetence of people running those clubs, he must've done everything right like he always does.

He's doing his best for the club, that I'm sure, but sometimes most simple solution is best solution.

2872~~~
Like?

2873~~~
Highlights of the game just come up again. Still fuming. If he had a brain cell, we most likely be going 2 nil up rather than conceding an equalizer <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2874~~~
This is the second time you are putting words in my mouth. Did you even read what I was responding to?

I have never claimed he doesn't make mistakes. Just pointing out that things like the post quoted below are unwarranted and uncalled for considering his experience and track record.

Yes, you can ignore this one as well.

2875~~~
But if he keeps making same mistakes, what then?

As I said, I'm sure he does everything in Uniteds best interest, just sometimes he comes across as too stubborn and if he's trying to be too smart when there's no need for such a thing and because of that stubborness more simple solutions go untried while we wait for his philosophy to click.

He's great coach, his records speak for themselves, yet this United team looks to ordinary at the moment eventhough he's had enough time to implement his philosophy and players to get used to it.

What's wrong with giving Mata chance in his natural position?

2876~~~
Like the fact he has only scored more than 20 goals 3 times.

2877~~~
And played as the main striker twice in 10+ seasons.

You can't criticise him for not scoring more than 20 goals when he wasn't playing in that position and tasked to primarily score goals. Where is the sense in that?

2878~~~
99% of his time he has been a forward, regardless of wide or central.

2879~~~
problem with mata as a 10 behind rooney is that there is no pace through the middle.

I'd gladly see mata at no.10 but then you'd need a wilson/martial or a no.9 that is prepared to make good off the ball runs. Januzaj's movement for his goal against villa was especially beneficial to a player like mata.

2880~~~
So are you saying every forward (regardless of position) is tasked with the same role and expected to produce the same type of result ( in this case goals)?

2881~~~
What I am saying is for the vast majority of his Utd career he has been a forward, and in only three of those seasons he has scored more than 20 goals, therefore there is more chance of him NOT doing that this season than there is of him doing it.

2882~~~
The second striker position was ideal for Rooney. Barring the odd season fergie also saw it as his best position. Post ronaldo he was given the position up top for awhile but eventually we put chicharito or rvp infront of him. He wouldn't have scored more goals up top otherwise saf wouldn't have signed those players to play in front of him. Similarly ronaldo wouldn't score 100 goals if his starring position was central and not wide left. At the end od the day rooney drifts in and around the box and finds the right place to be. Apart from his stints on the right or left or central midfield, I don't think we hampered his goalscoring.

2883~~~
And I am telling you that he has only been a primary scorer in 2 of those seasons ( where he scored 34 goals) and this is only his 3rd season in that role.

You can't admit that Rooney has been deployed in many forward roles his whole career ( the majority being support roles) then criticise him for not scoring 20 goals every season, that makes no sense.

If you had made a prediction based on his recent form or the fact that he has regressed as a player overall - then your prediction would have made more sense.

Oversimplifying the forward role and then proceeding to criticise him based on that just reeks of laziness.

2884~~~
For an elite level player, even as a support striker you should get 20 goals more often IMO.
However Rooney is/was a very good player, and he brought a lot to the team regardless of his goalscoring record.
The issue now is that, is he bringing those other qualities to the team anymore? Debatable to say the least, and if not then obvioulsy if hes not scoring then thats a big issue.

2885~~~
Rooney was a powerhouse in those forward roles and we all watched him execute them really well, and he still managed to average 20 goals a season...

...When he could easily have been deployed upfront with one primary task and scored a lot more. So to simply dismiss his goalscoring ability by comparing his numbers to a typical striker's numbers without actually taking positions and roles into account,just blatantly comparing them as 'forwards' really doesn't do him justice at all.

David Villa used to be a scoring machine; look at his numbers for Valencia and look at his numbers for Barcelona and then Atletico Madrid - he is the perfect example of a main striker who was deployed in other forward positions for Barca and as a result - he wasn't as lethal as he was for Valencia.... why? it's not like he significantly regressed as a player or anything, he just wasn't set with the primary task of scoring goals.

2886~~~
Let's check back at the end of the season and see who is right, I'd love it to be you because that would mean  we've probably had a really good season, but I'm not holding my breathd

2887~~~
I'd agree. Some of Rooney's best football for us came in the second half of the 2010/2011 season when he was in the second striker position, but it was also when Rooney's goalscoring form began to improve again after a disappointing start to the season. Similarly, he played plenty of the 2011/2012 season as a second striker yet it's one of his most productive seasons for the club.

We arguably hampered his goalscoring a little bit when Ronaldo was the focal point of our team, but even then, I don't think it was by a significant amount. As you say, Rooney's a player who generally scores plenty anyway if he's played in an advanced position.

2888~~~
The average is a little bit skewed by his two best seasons though, which are significantly better than the rest of them. Granted, they're still impressive, but Rooney's only really had a couple of seasons for us where he was a formidable goalscorer.

2889~~~
Take away those two 34 goal seasons as the main striker( although I'm not sure why) and he still averaged 18 as the second scoring option - only one season below 15, but you would think he was averaging 7 goals with the kind of bashing he gets on here.

2890~~~
He's getting "bashed" because he's been rubbish so far this season when we've given him the main role upfront and are paying him mega-bucks.

2891~~~
An average of 18 is still impressive, admittedly, but it shows that Rooney's generally more of a consistent goalscorer than he is a brilliant one. He's never had the 7 goal type seasons where he's been completely terrible, but he's only really had a couple where he's managed to log a total significantly better than 20. Aguero, by contrast, has already hit 28 or more over a season on three occasions, despite having played in the PL for a lot less time than Rooney.

2892~~~
Rooney is obviously not just getting bashed for playing badly in August, a lot of people are just using it as an excuse to release some pent-up anger/aggression and manipulating facts to fit their narratives in the process.
How many player's get this much criticism after only a month of action? 

The "Get behind your manager/team" bandits are the same ones not even giving a United legend the benefit of the doubt, it has come to a point where i think some people actually derive pleasure from his bad performances just so they can come here to bash him some more.

2893~~~
There's definitely angst against Rooney, no doubt. I'll admit to having some of that in the past but I've let that go. It's because of how he handled the "situations" he created, and at the end of the day that does affect fans. And he's not making it easier when he performs the way he has been.

Personally, the past is the past. But in the present, he deserves criticism <i>and </i>support. I hope he breaks every record and fast for the sake of the team, but at the same time the correlation between the importance the club has given him/his pay and his performances is pretty nuts.

2894~~~
Whilst i agree with you on your point about Aguero, i should also point out that he is usually the focal point of that Man City attack; even when he has a partner to compliment him - one he usually plays behind (like last season), he doesn't actually play to compliment the likes of Dzeko, they usually compliment him.

I also agree with your point about Rooney being a consistent goalscorer - and in this context - where i'm arguing about his goalscoring record, i truly believe if he had been the focal point of our attack for the last 10 seasons he would have scored a lot more goals, as he is really consistent at finding the back of the net - even during an average performance.

2895~~~
There's a reason why Rooney doesn't play that role - because he isn't that great at it. It's why Chicharito making runs behind and Rooney as the second striker worked so well, or Fergie felt the need to sign RVP. If Rooney was Aguero good as the guy right at the top SAF I'm not so sure Fergie would haves signed RVP, or LVG would have taken Falcao on loan.

2896~~~
I see no reason why crimes in the past should be referenced in every single conversation, especially in a thread about his performances in 2015/16.

His salary is really not an excuse for people to come here and spew hate - He deserves to be criticised, but i don't think any sane person would call the happenings in this thread 'mere criticisms'. Any little whiff of support is usually trounced by unnecessary hate.

2897~~~
You were discussing his past hence I mentioned it.

The hate I obviously don't agree with. The criticism I do.

2898~~~
Christ, we're not going down that tedious road upon which criticism of Rooney is 'bizarre' and praise for Rooney is 'sense' again, are we?

2899~~~
No. He didn't play that role because Fergie recognised that he would be more vital to the team(the team not himself) in the #10 role, people just ran with the notion.
A selfish Rooney would not have made that sacrifice and still thrived.

City also signed top strikers, they were also very much in the running for RVP's signature - so it's really not like they didn't try to give Aguero a world class partner who would probably have been the focal point.

2900~~~
Try and think of a top top 30 goal a season main striker who has been moved over to different positions to play behind a striker like Hernandez.

2901~~~
Well, i would also have to think of one who has been moved around his whole career now wouldn't i?

And the highest amount of league games Hernandez started in a PL campaign was 18.

2902~~~
No you wouldn't because Rooney hasn't been shafted as much as people make it out to be. He fills out in central midfield for 3 games and people go overboard about his sacrifices. And I'm making it easier for you. Try and name a few absolutely top strikers who have been playing as second strikers. From what I've seen it doesn't happen. And it's not even a slight on Rooney. For me, it's been the role that has suited his game well. He gets to roam around like he likes too, doesn't have to battle strong defenders and makes intelligent runs into the box and uses his nose for goal to be in the right place at the right time.

2903~~~
Positions Rooney has played for United
Striker 
Right midfield 
Right wing attacker 
Centre attacking midfield 
Centre midfield 
Left wing attacker 
Second Striker

I really don't think there has been a striker (which is what he was for Everton) who has been moved to so many positions in his career, the last striker who was moved to the supporting role(without being the focal point of the attack) is David Villa and that limited his abilities.

Rooney has perfectly executed that <i>Totti role</i> and yet he is being bashed for his goalscoring despite putting up similar numbers.

I welcome criticism, but when facts are skewed to fuel criticism - it becomes hate. What i find interesting is that, all this stemmed from a harmless prediction based on the fact that his primary task now is to score goals.

2904~~~
Yes, all those positions over <b>10 years. </b>I'm not actually "hating" nor am I "criticizing". I'm saying we've used him correctly and if he was better as a centre forward he would have most likely played there more.

2905~~~
And i <b>disagree</b> - so this is where we call it quits.

2906~~~
Indeed it is.

2907~~~
facht.

2908~~~
Is the myth that Rooney has only played two seasons as the main striker still being peddled here?
<ul>
<li>What happened for half of the 06/07 season when Saha was injured?</li>
<li>What happened 07-08 when he and Tevez both played as central strikers?</li>
<li>What happened 08/09 when he and Berbatov both played as central strikers?</li>
<li>What happened for the first half of 10/11 season before Hernandez replaced him?</li>
</ul>We went into 6 seasons with him as our main striker, whether it be alongside another centre forward in a flat 4-4-2, or with attacking players behind him. Two seasons he was replaced by someone who was performing better in that role - so he can't really complain (Saha & Hernandez), two seasons he didn't set the world alight (scoring 11 league goals) and two seasons he performed exceptionally. Unfortunately that's his consistency as a player: 1/3 poor, 1/3 decent, 1/3 great.

The reason he hasn't been our main attacking striker consistently since Van Nistelrooy left is pretty simple: he's been given several chances from 2006-2012 to establish himself as our main 25 league goals a season man and could only manage it twice, averaging 11-14 League goals the other 3 seasons.

2909~~~
Good post. It's worth noting that even when Rooney's playing as a second striker, it's hardly been in some ridiculously deep role. He's still encouraged to go forward, and to score goals. The difference is that he generally has extra responsibilities to try and link the attack and defence, but that's what he tends to do anyway a lot of the time since he's naturally a player who works hard. Rooney's been played in positions for the majority of his career where you'd expect him to score plenty of goals, and be a key forward.

2910~~~
06/07 he had a strong finish to the season, compensating for the run in September/October when he went 10 games without scoring (Saha and Ronaldo carried the burden)
07/08 he got injured first day of the season with a metatarsal fracture. Our formation after he came back was rarely orthodox, yet he and Tevez get a lot of deserved credit for supporting Ronaldo
08/09 he had a strong first half of the season while Ronaldo was out recovering from surgery. Finished with 20 goals, and who could forget his role in that counterattack against Arsenal?
10/11 he only had 25 appearances in the league. My memory is hazy, so I can't comment too much on the league performance (was that around the transfer saga?) but he was brilliant in the Champions League, scoring in the quarterfinals, semifinals, and final, before we bent over to Barcelona's brilliance.

And in all that beyond the goals he always proved integral to our operations in the final 3. Even when Ronaldo was getting goals Rooney's role was always prominent. And it was recognized as such by SAF. Which explains why he was moved all over the pitch. That this is even debatable boggles the mind; we endured 2 fruitless years in Europe of Rooney always playing as a winger in a 4-5-1 for some odd reason.

2911~~~
It's hardly in some ridiculous deep role, but his main responsibility at times was not to get goals, but to facilitate our general play. Because of his talent we were able to get away with it. At his prime a few years ago, he proved he could take on that main role before he got injured against Bayern in 2010. 

What's with everyone trying to pretend Rooney hasn't been that great over the years?

2912~~~
We're not. Rooney's played plenty of great football for us. He was superb in 2009/2010 and 2011/2012, while being a very good footballer who was key to our side in earlier years as well. It's more that a variety of excuses are being made for the fact that he's often not been a particularly brilliant goalscorer.

2913~~~
Played as an orthodox striker in 09/10, he yielded the output of a brilliant goalscorer, to the detriment of his other capabilities on the pitch. Why is it a reach to suggest that if he was placed up top from the beginning he wouldn't have more goals for us?

2914~~~
Not sure I completely agree with that - he had an excellent season in 09/10. While he was primarily playing as an out and out forward, his overall game was still very good and he added a lot to our side as a whole. He wasn't just a poacher who was hardly ever involved.

It's not too much of a reach to suggest that Rooney's output would be slightly higher if he'd been played on the wing or in central midfield less, but again, he's still played the pre-dominant portion of his career in a central role. Even when he's played as a second striker, he's still scored goals when on form. His best football for us probably came in the second half of the 2010/2011 season. He played in behind the striker, yet was still scoring. He played as a second striker for parts of the 2011/2012 season, yet - once again - still had one of his best seasons.

2915~~~
He wasn't a poacher, but compared to previous seasons, his role in the buildup dropped. He has played through the center a lot, but again, in the support of RvN and Saha. From 07-09 we capitalized on Ronaldo's effectiveness from a free role by constraining Rooney and Tevez.

It is fair to say Rooney hasn't been brilliant at goal scoring for most of his career, I will concede that.

2916~~~
06/07 - henrik larsson/alan smith
07/08 - striker
08/09 - left wing
10/11 first half - off field issues worst form of career, pretty sure he played as a number 10 as well

I agree it looks like LVG always chooses the complex solution to a simple problem. But maybe he has already tried the simple solution in training and it didn't work? We don't know.

Also, what is Mata's natural position? Mourinho played him in the wing very often and he was voted as their best player two seasons in a row playing that position so it is not as black and white as you make it to be. 

Now, let us think of the reason why LVG doesn't play him there. One of them could be his lack of strength. Playing that position against lesser teams, Mata will definitely have to face a DM throughout the match who would try to cut him down. Do you think he has the strength to hold up the ball or has the trickery and the pace to beat his man? If he is marked out of the game then our whole plan of 4-2-3-1 will collapse.

On the other hand, if we really want to use his creativity and eye for the final ball, we need to give him time to pick his passes. In the current set up, one of the best ways of doing it is to play him on the right and ask him to drift in. The AM player will take the DM who is marking him away and that will give a lot of space in front of the defense for Mata to play a final ball in.

2918~~~
Mata got Chelsea's player of the year playing mainly as a #10. Mourinho only managed him for six months and played him a few games as a #10 and a few games as a winger and then sold him. #10 is clearly his preferred position and he has said so himself publicly. 

He can play on the right but it only works in some games. Against Liverpool at Anfield last season he got tons of space and was fantastic. However it should be obvious to everyone by now that he is much less effective against defensive teams that park the bus. Against such sides you are more reliant on individual attackers being able to isolate and beat their marker to create chances. Mata, even vs the slowest defender, cannot do this. He can only come inside into an already congested area packed with defenders.

2919~~~
No-one is saying Rooney wasn't a prominent player for us. The argument is whether he was an excellent goalscorer, which apart from the two seasons where the stars aligned for him, he has never been. He was moved all over the pitch because historically he's been a very good all round player, but he's never been great in any single position. Unfortunately for him in his favourite position at a top club you need a great <b>striker</b>, as he's never been able to consistently become this he's never made the position his own.

06/07 - Larsson started 5 Premier League games, Smith started 6. Also the latter was never a typical number 9 - Rooney played alongside him. 

08/09 - Rooney has never played left wing all season. He played a handful of games wide left, but it sticks into the memory because of the CL final.

10/11 - Again this "number 10" isn't the case. Oscar is a number 10, Mata for Chelsea was a number 10. Apart from when Rooney played behind Van Nistelrooy and later for the season with Van Persie he has rarely been a "number 10". Fergie tried to recreate the Yorke-Cole partnership with 2 number 9's that are given licence to come deep (with Tevez, Berbatov & briefly the likes of Smith/Welbeck/Hernandez). This is no different to how Rooney played 09/10 when he scored 26 Premier League goals alongside Berbatov, or in 11/12 when he scored 27 league goals alongside Hernandez & sometimes Berbatov/Welbeck.

There is absolutely no difference between his position in the team 09/10 & 11/12 vs 06/07, 07/08, 08/09 & 10/11 - the only difference was his performances and his productivity. Rooney has almost never played as a lone number 9, even when he was at his best and most productive. He has played several seasons dove-tailing with another forward player, which is where he's at his most productive (as illustrated by 09/10 and 11/12).

2920~~~
My initial comment was half joking btw, but for some reason you took it too serious so decided to went along with it <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

This all makes sense, I do believe LVG trying things in training we can only guess, but if something doesn't work in matches no matter how great it may look in training you must find other solution.

When it comes to Mata it is more complex than I put it, just feel he would have much more options playing off the striker than playing on the right where he lacks pace and strenght to go past fullbacks. Playing him as number 10 doesn't mean he has fixed position and can't move along front line. He's very intelligent player who could pick pocket of spaces around the box and use his imagination to create something. Also his constant moving means he could drag marking DM out of his position which again opens space for our CMs to explore it. And since it's his preffered position he would feel much better playing it than being on the right.

He does drift in mostly due to his incompetence to play with right foot, what I don't understand why he doesn't use Darmians runs more often but chooses to cut in and then plays safe pass to CM. He's great player to watch but feel he's too far from real action when deployed on the right, perhaps it gives him more time to pick his pass, but it also gives more time for the defence to settle and block eventual move.

Really hope LVG will twist something within formation and tactics because we look too slow and static at times, shame really since we have personel to play much better football than we currently do.

2921~~~
Are there any instances in the past of players losing their physical edge and then regaining it (not counting players recovering from injuries)?

2922~~~
I am pretty sure Mata played left wing forward mostly for Chelsea. I can't claim to be 100% sure but I watched his Chelsea goal/assist compilation and a lot of them were on the left hand side.

2923~~~
It was only in Mata's last full season at Chelsea he played as a No 10. For the vast majority of his career, he's played as a false winger. Same thing with David Silva. I don't understand he argument that Mata playing on the right is impeding Rooney. Rooney could have gotten a hat trick against Swansea.
Any striker worth his salt knows when a false winger cuts inside, he's looking to play the ball over the defense into the path of the foward so he need to be on the last line making  runs. Watch Silva when he plays for on the wings, watch Messi when he plays on the wings. They all have players running towards goal when they cut on their left foot looking to play one over the defense. Mata has already done this on many occasions this season. The problem imo, is Rooney comes deep to often and asks for the ball to feet trying to do Mata's job for him. It leaves Mata with Memphis often as the only option. And quite often Memphis has gotten into decent positions on the end of a Mata long ball but his decision making has let him down.
The heat maps show it. Memphis is often way ahead of Rooney in their average positions.

2924~~~
Yeah, it is usually Depay out high left, Rooney a bit further back central and then Mata near the half way line on the right. Rooney has mainly been having to drop into the space vacated by Mata rarely being up field at the right times to influence the play. When he is, his go to move is to get the ball with his back to goal, run back, turn inside and pass. 
I don't think I've even seen Mata attempt one of those balls this season. Especially since he is so one footed and plays with his back to the space, I mean he can't really play a conventional pass over his right shoulder from there. Those passes are never on from Mata, Rooney doesn't make those runs because those passes never come. It is wasted energy.
Yeah, that is Mata which is causing the problem. Basically he's playing almost like a second fullback. A lot of the times he's either miles behind the play and not getting on the ball and moving it forward. Or he's up on the right getting the ball with his back to space and turning back and central which means those passes you describe are not on.

2925~~~
Part of the reason why Rooney got moved around was his own quality. Bad he been indispensable in the striker's role and damn good there, he wouldn't have been.

2926~~~
Can't recall any. When you are done you are done I guess.

2927~~~
I disagree. On many occasions especially against Newcastle, I was at the game. When Mata cut in only for him to take his head up and see Rooney only 10 yards away from him. What's he supposed to do? I do agree that he needs to face the goal more but he has definitely tried to find players making runs on the left side of the pitch. Any striker is supposed to gamble and make runs. It's what you expect. I think Rooney is struggling to accept he won't see much of the ball.  I stand by that.

Mata has been occupying the spaces you would expect a false right winger to occupy. look at the heat maps? Rooney and Adnan Januzaj have been occupying virtually the same positions. Rooney hasn't been dropping into Mata's space. He's been dropping into Januzaj space.  I think you're comparing Mata to a conventional winger.

As I said you're comparing Mata with a conventional winger. Of course he's going to be behind the ball more often than not. He's a play maker. How often do you see David Silva ahead of play. His positioning seems correct to me. Looking at has average position he's inbetween Januzaj and the two deep lying midfielders. We must also note Januzaj was expected to play as a second striker not a conventional No 10. I also would like Mata to turn and face the goal more  but accusing him of not trying  to find people making runs is wrong. Personally, I don't see the major crime LVG has committed by putting him there. He's atarted every game there since March and I think LVG  is happy with him otherwise I don't think he'd be playing as much as he has.

2928~~~
I wasn't tbh, I'm just of the opinion that he isn't an elitle level goal scorer. Think he has and always has been a very good one, and a top level player. But in terms of being a pure goalscorer I always rated him as very good but not elite. Thats just my opinion.

EDIT: Also on David Villa, at Barca his primary job was actually to score goals. His issues were more to do with the terrible injury he had IMO. His first season at Barca he scored a lot

2929~~~
Rooneys movement off the ball has looked a little sharper so far tonight.

2930~~~
Lovely control and pass too.

2931~~~
Kinda glad he's getting this game time with England. I remember Ferguson saying that the only way to get him into form is to get him to log minutes.

2932~~~
I always thought he had a great first touch.

2933~~~
Yep

2934~~~
I love Rooney and don't understand the hate he gets, but i've been wondering if he is another england captain that cares more about that than his club. Beckhams domestic game dropped compared to his international one when he became captain. I wonder if Rooney is the same.

It wouldn't have been as noticeable last season due to him playing here, there and everywhere for us...

2935~~~
What hate? He's been bang average for Man United for a year now.

2936~~~
Will I be able to buy a commemorative tea set to mark the occasion?

2937~~~
England's all-time top scorer eh?

2938~~~
England record done. Another game he's been sloppy and poor in. Doesn't matter though now, just like San Marino game. 50 goals. Good lad. Pleased for him.

Hopefully it's a weight off his shoulders and all that nonsense...

2939~~~
Its funny reading the post from the previous page. Rooney plays as number 10 = He wont get that many goals from there, he needs to play as the leading striker to get you goals. Rooney plays as the leading striker = That's not his best position, he needs to be involved in the game to get the best out of him. There no universal agreement on his best position is there? and that probably says more about him than anything else.

2940~~~

2941~~~
We need to start winning some penalties.

2942~~~
He wasn't sloppy and poor at all, he had a good game.

2943~~~
Not sure if this is accurate , i got it from somewhere else, but I think it mostly is, heres his record when hes not playing small European teams, in the World Cup:

Gary lineker 10 goals in 2 world cups, Bobby charlton 4 goals in 2 world cups, Owen 4 goals in 2 world cups... Rooney 1 little goal in 3 world cups

2944~~~
I thought he looked off pace and lacked energy again tonight.

2945~~~
Im a Scotsman so don't really care about England but what it's worth Rooney has played in largely inferior teams than both Charlton and that guy who is morphing into Rolf Harris.

2946~~~
Plenty of hate aroung. Glad thats what you focused on though.

2947~~~
You cant really use world cups as an argument as he was injured before 2006 and 2010 and was decent in 2014 imo.

2948~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he was every bit as crap as everyone else in 2014, the entire squad should have retired from internationals after that farce

2949~~~
"What hate?".. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2950~~~
Another pen eh

2951~~~
England looked a much better side when Kane came on and played as the striker.

Hopefully this will give him a confidence boost ahead of the weekend, but still not happy that he's undisputed first choice here.

2952~~~
6 out of 50. Mighty 10ish percent.

2953~~~
5 goals in 8 starts, this season. Pretty good start...

2954~~~
It isnt hate, criticism isnt the same as hate? Are we 12 year olds? I dont think theres someone who wants Rooney to do bad or is glad that Rooney isnt performing.

2955~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2956~~~
Lionel Messi on Rooney:

Very high praise from arguably the best player ever.

2957~~~
Sir Alex called Phil Jones someone likely to be our greatest player ever..

Moral of the story, people say a lot of things..especially when they are put under the spot and asked questions about a particular player. Context is important. If he had said that Rooney was the worst player he had ever seen, would you take that too? You would probably think that its just one person saying that( Like a lot of people do when someone says something negative about the club, see Queiroz ), surely that logic should apply to positive statements too?

2958~~~
Isnt Mata our  penalty taker? Rooney has a wretched record for us at penalties..at least 12 misses if I recall.

2959~~~

2960~~~
I'd forgotten about that Lvg-ism, still getting used to his peculiarities.

2961~~~
EDIT: Wrong thread.

2962~~~
Rumours that Rooney might be out of the Pool game.  Punishment for his outburst?  There was no mention of him being injured at the presser was there?

2963~~~
Relevance to Rooney?

2964~~~
Check edit.

2965~~~
Heh. It took a whole month for him to pick up the injury we banked on him not getting all season.

2966~~~
No sign of Rooney after the players checked into the hotel. No loss whatsoever. Would love to see Wilson get a chance. Although it'll probably be Fellaini.

2967~~~
Wilson has gone and will be pretty too short notice to recall?

2968~~~
Has he definitely gone yet?

2969~~~
Wilson wasn't there either.

2970~~~
FFS. Fellaini it is then.

2971~~~
No love for the most expensive teenager in history?

2972~~~
I didn't think he'd start. Although, I guess Van Gaal may be forced to play him if Rooney is indeed out.

2973~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Kill me

2974~~~
We'll just play this French kid with Fellaini behind if Rooney is injured. Happy days.

2975~~~
It just had to happen. First game after the window and he seems to be injured. Lets just hope we have enough fire power upfront.

2976~~~
If he was injured.. Surely Wilson would be atleast in the squad!

2977~~~

2978~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2979~~~
He hasn't gone anywhere yet. He trained with the first team today but apparently isn't with the squad at the hotel.

2980~~~
We've made our bed. Let's see what happens if he is injured.

2981~~~
Hopefully Martial and the other emergency options can perform.

2982~~~
Not if Fellaini is a no 9. one striker starts, one one the bench.

2983~~~

2984~~~
Oh look, relying on Rooney to stay fit all season wasn't the best idea. What a massive shock. No one ever saw that one coming <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2985~~~
God it starts already. Are we going to throw Martial in at the deep end?

2986~~~
Could explain why Wilson hasn't been confirmed anywhere yet.

2987~~~

2988~~~
Rooney is always appalling against Liverpool anyway. Not a big loss.

2989~~~
FFS! We have to throw Martial in now, surely?

2990~~~
So? 

He'd contribute sweet FA in his current form

2991~~~
He's usually shite against Liverpool anyway.

2992~~~
Excited to see Martial.

2993~~~
LVG has said that Martial will be eased in slowly.  Fellaini more likely if Rooney is out

2994~~~
-------------Fellaini
Memphis---Mata---Martial

2995~~~
Rooney never performs well at Anfield vs Liverpool, but he's had good games at OT vs Pool.

If he's out, I wonder if LVG will trust Martial to start.

2996~~~
I'm not awfully fussed. It'll give us a chance to try something new.

2997~~~
...and that's why we should've bought a fecking striker before we shipped out four of them.

2998~~~
Fellaini is no striker but at least he'll hold up the ball well

2999~~~
Too soon to give Derby a call? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Would like to see Perreira get a chance, but highly unlikely he'll be used in this game.

3000~~~
Wilson is still with us, he trained today with the first team....


edit: ffs now i see rooney, it looks like video is from few days ago :S

3001~~~
Not a problem RVP is fit.... Oh wait! Some serious questions to answer LVG.

3002~~~
FELLAINI

3003~~~
This.

3004~~~
Yeah and if Fellaini is up top then surely Herrera will start at number 10.

3005~~~
I know Rooney has been bad but christ, not bothered that our only recognised striker is injured? I don't get that.

3006~~~
feck.

3007~~~
We should start Martial upfront but knowing LvG it's Fellaini with Young out wide.

3008~~~
I'm now guessing

Fellaini

Memphis
Herrera
Mata

Bit of everything there to be honest, could potentially work.

3009~~~
I'm not bothered. In fact, I wanted him benched or sold. 

Yes, he can score penalties.
Yes, he can score against Brugge (B team).
But in the EPL, he is shockingly bad. I mean, really bad. Like Falcao, Mk2.
In fact, it's been so long since he scored an EPL goal, I can't remember.

The good thing about Fellaini is that he creates chaos and panic amongst opposition defenders. Last year, Mourinho took the Fellaini threat so seriously that he was singled him out for man-marking.

3010~~~
Time to get those line up submissions amended.

3011~~~
I expect Rooney to start tomorrow, the injury is probably nothing major. If he doesn't play then it will definitely be Fellaini, can't see Martial featuring much in his first game at the club. Then again it'd be very exiciting to see our new 19-year old expensive star starting a game, he's been in very good form for Monaco this season so maybe we should let him keep the momentum.

3012~~~
Hope he isn't injured. Yes, he never really performs greatly against Liverpool, but it'll give them a massive psychological boost if he is out. He is also a player who can do something special at any given time (not as much as before but still can, i.e. Villa goal last season). 

If he is, then Fellaini it is. Terrorised them last season.

3013~~~
Has he played more than Fellaini? How many internationals have they both played?

Edit: Martial vs Fellaini

3014~~~
Martial only came on around 80th minute in both international games. Fellaini played full games for Belgium I think, before the break Martial started every game for Monaco though while Fellaini didn't play much for us.

3015~~~
That may factor into the gaffers thinking then. If it wasn't Pool I reckon he would start. Providing Rooney is indeed injured.

3016~~~
Someone in the matchday thread said 18 players checked into the hotel, with no Rooney. Surely that means he's out? Or is that a common thing when there's injury concerns so close to a match?

3017~~~
If that's the case then he is probably out. Fellaini up front then.

3018~~~
Fellaini come off in like the 60th min against Cyprus.

3019~~~
Do remember in the same fixture last year LVG started Wilson so can't see why he wouldn't do the same for Martial.

3020~~~
The meltdown from James Ducker over this is funny. You do think he's a United fan. Why can't everyone relax. LVG that made all the decisions is obviously aware of the risk. If it comes off, good luck to him if not, he will pay for it with his job. Am kind of interested to see how this one unfold.

3021~~~
Would be kind of funny to see the hemming and hawing from the usual suspects, avoiding the elephant in the room, if we end up playing great without Rooney

3022~~~
If we do play well and whoever starts up-front scores then it will be interesting to see what happens.

3023~~~
I'm so sure about a half fit Rooney. His standard Liverpool performance is a pretty poor one as it is.

3024~~~
For starters I think you are over exaggerating how bad Rooney is to the point where I can only assume you are taking the piss. Secondly fair enough if you would rather have someone else instead in the squad but the point is we dont.

3025~~~
after a while I think I just realised that there's always some 'elephant in the room' for fans, and when the manager changes the team and nothing happens it just goes away. 

In the moyes days it was 'why can't he see that he has to play kagawa #10. And then kagawa played number 10, did nothing and they moved on to some other reason, 'rooney isn't moving enough' or whatever. 

Two weeks ago fans were saying we'd be unbelieveable if we just start herrera in a midfield 3. And predictably we start him and we weren't very good. He did fine, but it wasn't the missing link. 

There's always some narrative that people find, right now for some people it's rooney. We'll probably see after he misses a few games that actually this is just another of the million example of oversimplifying why we're not playing that well. For gods sake people are posting their strongest line ups with martial up front... without ever having seen him play bar youtube

3026~~~
Uh oh Wayne. Who honestly missed him? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3027~~~
shit as usual.. <span style="color: #ffffff">:-)</span>

3028~~~
Now THATS how it's done Wayne........

3029~~~
That was his best game of the season.

3030~~~
True enough, but at the same time it's not quite that simple. It's people searching for things that might improve us, not necessarily the answer to all our problems. It being the internet though it gets blown up to sounding like the answer to it all.

Our attack was crap again today in the first half, even Fellaini seemed to lack his usual fight.

3031~~~
How long is he out?

3032~~~
LvG said he probably wouldn't risk him on Tuesday but would see how he is over the next couple of days, so it's not serious. My guess is we'll play it safe and he'll return for the game against Southampton next Sunday.

3033~~~
I already feel sorry for the Saints.



Thanks!

3034~~~
Until we're no longer due to face Merseyside teams. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3035~~~
If he misses the Southampton match, he certainly will not play against Ipswich.

3036~~~
I'm annoyed that he's injured, mainly because we're going to have to listen to the 'it takes him x games to get back to his full sharpness!!' over the coming months.

3037~~~
That excuse has always been bullshit to me.

3038~~~
The games people like to write off for Rooney. He needs games to find form, he never plays well against Liverpool and Everton. That's half the season already.

3039~~~
Just heard he's 2 goals shy off equalling RvN’s European goal scoring record for United. Another record we could see tumble in the coming months..

3040~~~
Just re watched his debut on YouTube. Unbelievable talent. I'm approaching my mid twenties but so I've not been watching football for too long. I have not seen a better teenager in the game since. He was magical.

3041~~~
I can't think of a single game he played well against either.

3042~~~
2 short of Andy Cole in the Premier League aswell.

3043~~~
The 2-1 win at Old Trafford with the Suarez Evra Handshake? Scored twice as I recall.

3044~~~
Haha, well, I never said my memory is any good! 

In fact it's pretty selective and has been known to rewrite history.

3045~~~
Scored against Liverpool at Old Trafford only last year. Was also MOTM in the cup match at OT during Moyes' reign. His performances against them are poor mainly away from home.

3046~~~
No, we don't need him at all..  Idiots maybe now realising who is our most valuable and the most important player..

3047~~~
He wouldn't have made a difference tonight. If anything he would of taken our one strength away, pace.

3048~~~
He'd of done nothing tonight, as always. Martial held the ball up well and brought others into the game. Unlike what Rooney does.

3049~~~
So... When's Wayne back?

3050~~~
Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 1 fewer goal in his last 180 minutes than Wayne Rooney has in 2015.

3051~~~
Rooney is a red though <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3052~~~
He's fecking shit. 90% of the time he plays for us, it's like watching a Championship player....he's physically slow, he's mentally dull (plays like a drunk) and his first touch is not worthy of a Premier League player.

Bye bye Wayne, you're fecking finished.

3053~~~
As ever, he is playing so bad it has a huge affect on our team. Bench him for good

3054~~~
His lack of acceleration and stamina hinders him in one aspect (doesn't find space, struggling to avoid his marker), the lack of solid passing and first touch hinders him from another aspect (can't set himself up, find his team-mates or dribble into space).

His finishing I have no doubt is still up there but with all those hinderances he's not going to get chances against decent sides.

I think we are watching the end of his United career. RVP was much better than this last year and Van Gaal got rid of him.

3055~~~
There's a few in the team that are playing at a slow pace, but feck me, Wayne is like a geriatric out there.

3056~~~
His best position will soon be No 9

3057~~~
He's easily our worst player once again. The ball came out from the Southampton box and he was on the half way line. I wouldn't mind if he was pulling the strings and bossing the midfield, but he's even worse there than he is around the box.

3058~~~
I don't understand what role he has, what's he actually trying to do?

3059~~~
Looks physically shot.

3060~~~
He's the new Anderson. Most of the time it looks that he isn't even in the pitch, while when you see it is either after he loses a ball after his horrible first touch, or making an overhit pass. And he's fat too.

Genuinely, I think that he might be the worst player in the league based on performances of this season. Cannot think of a player who has been worst this season.

3061~~~
He is physically weak as a little girl.

It's really incredible how soft he is in duels, most of the time he doesn't even challenge for the ball, and not just against Wanyama. And he is supposed to be one of the tough guys in the team, embarassing really.

3062~~~
No doubt someone will be along soon to inexplicably try to defend him. How do you get to be both undroppable and your teams worst player by a distance? It's mind boggling.

3063~~~
Slows everything down. It's painful to watch and a shame really.

3064~~~
Garbage again.

3065~~~
I waiting for the first poster to say he needs a run of games to get up to speed after an injury.

3066~~~
Has he done much attacking work? No.
Has he done much midfield work? No.
Has he done much defensive work? No.
Has he been unlucky? No.
Does he look like he has a goal in him? No.

Marouane or Ander please at HT please.

3067~~~
I think Rooney's time at United is coming to an end. He's been terrible this season bar that hat-trick.

3068~~~
LVG gave him the instructions in dutch, that's the only explanation.

3069~~~
"No wonder he's been poor, he's playing out of position" in 3...2...1...

3070~~~
He is missing Valencia. Play that ball to the right side.

3071~~~
Can't win a header, can't make a pass, can't make forward runs, can't get a proper first touch. What can he do these days?

3072~~~
I'm really beginning to think that he's on an irreversible decline. 

He's always been a streaky player. He used to have these bad patches before but he'd always find form after that. But he hasn't been good for a few months now.

3073~~~
Genuinely been terrible, and epitomises everything wrong with our attack. Herrera isn't perfect, but at least he'll fight and move and graft and run and pass and try something different.

3074~~~
I doubt Rooney will ever lead the front line again, he has been so poor that Martial has managed to do more in 180 odd minutes. It will be average performances at number 10 for the rest of the reason.

3075~~~
Awful, shouldn't be starting at the moment.

3076~~~
I thought he was better than he has been. Still poor though.

3077~~~
Sorry to say it but he is fecking useless atm and needs to be dropped.

3078~~~
He'll never get dropped. Captain's privileges

3079~~~
15 hours without scoring in the league.

3080~~~
When you consider his recent performances over the first lot of games this season, you add in his position as captain for arguably the biggest club in the world and then you add in his massive wages.

Honestly, football is a batshit crazy sport.

When I reflect on it, I feel like Tommy Lee Jones in No Country for Old Men:

<i>Okay..I'll be part of this world. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/></i>

3081~~~
Can the real Rooney please step up as I don't know who this imposter is?

3082~~~
Mane looks eons ahead of him in ability as the opposing #10

3083~~~
Playing his usual 8 positions today it seems.

3084~~~
Slow starter, needs a run of games etc etc

3085~~~
I think he's hungover. He must be, I mean how else could you explain one of the most high profile players on the planet looking so fecking slow. He's like a sloth.

3086~~~
Unfortunately, he's in decline. It's been obvious for a while now.

3087~~~
Where has his energy and drive gone???

3088~~~
I actually cannot bare watching him play football.

3089~~~
Watching him this season is absolutely painful. He's not only ineffective in himself, but he's damaging the team.

Mata hasn't set the world alight, but in this match he has shown decent movement when he's moved in from the right. We should be putting Mata in the centre and letting him move where he wants. He has the intelligence of movement that Rooney lacks, and lord knows he's not a right winger.

If we had bought Mane for the right wing and stuck Mata in the middle I could see us being a lot more potent this season. Instead, we're forced to endure Rooney the undroppable. Bleurgh.

3090~~~
Headless chicken most of the time now.

3091~~~
Looks totally shot. No energy or aggression that he used to have.

3092~~~
He's not done much but Southampton are playing with Wanyama and Romeu and they're playing deep.

3093~~~
Has been too inconsistent these past two seasons to say it's a poor patch. He's just lost the spring in his legs.

3094~~~
Should have done better there, even his passing has gone to shit.

3095~~~
Inconsistent is the last accusation you can level at him. He's consistently shit.

3096~~~
Only hope is a MLS team is willing to pay big, big bucks for him.

3097~~~
Am I correct in thinking Martial has now scored more away goals in the league than Rooney in 2015?

3098~~~
Last time I remember him scoring away from home was against Arsenal and that was back in 2014.

3099~~~
Heard in commentary he hasn't scored away from home since November.

3100~~~
He has one away goal in the League since March 2014 which was the one at Arsenal last November.

3101~~~
Might as well have played with 10 men today.

3102~~~
Oh the irony.

3103~~~
fecking useless. Kept slowing things down when there were chances to attack. Never in the right #10 positions to support our midfielders.

3104~~~
Another poor game from Rooney. How long can this continue? 4/10 today.

3105~~~
Thought he had a very cool and composed 2nd half playing very deep. Did very little wrong 

1st was quite poor

As normal everyone goes over the top because it's Rooney

3106~~~
Nothing over the top at all. He's shocking. You must be living in a bubble.

3107~~~
He looks shot.

3108~~~
I agree with this actually. 

Don't think he was great by any means but his second half performance was adequate.

3109~~~
Another very bad match. Nothing surprising anymore.

3110~~~
Absolutely piss poor. If his name wasn't Rooney, he'd be dropped. It's incredible how poor he looks. Herrera should be the #10,not him. 

You must have very low expectations.

3111~~~
Have to say - I agree.  What did he do in the 2nd half that deserves any praise?  He was "cool" yes - because he dropped needlessly deep and barely broke a sweat.  He didn't make a single genuinely useful contribution that I can recall, broke up a couple of promising attacks with poor passes/touches and strolled around a bit.  God, but I want him to be good again - but he really hasn't been even decent for a long, long, time

3112~~~
I have been highly critical of him, recently. But I thought he was really good in that second half. When he's not got his back to goal, he's a completely different player.

3113~~~
He looked better when we went ahead, because him dropping deep and spraying it around slowing the game down was beneficial, however he was culpable for the first half performance with an absolutely horrific display. He seemed to make the wrong decision every time and too many attacks faltered because of his input in the latter stages as well.

3114~~~
He doesn't contribute anything. It's remarkable how utterly pointless he was today.

3115~~~
I don't know what to make of him today. He was pretty much playing as a midfielder. Mata moved into the central area much more in second half.

3116~~~
It's like playing with 10 men every game.

3117~~~
I can't believe there were lots of posters calling for him to be playing number 10 behind Martial...<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3118~~~
It's clear to me that Rooney is now holding the team back. He is no longer worthy of his place in the team. Martial is a better striker and we have much better options than him at number 10.

3119~~~
I think he should be left back <span style="color: #ffffff">in the dressing room</span>

3120~~~
Needs to pull his head out of his arse.

3121~~~
I didn't think he was bad in the second half. First half I thought quite a few were shite, including Rooney. I can guarantee that if he isn't playing, and we are losing, the caf match day thread will be screaming for him to come on.

3122~~~
He only looked slightly better in the second and that was only because we were winning and in control so he could drop into the centre backs and pass it out to the right without any pressure. But in terms contributing to the game he was a huge negative.

3123~~~
How long will this last? LVG was visibly upset with him today, surely we can't sustain these shite performances every week.

3124~~~
Shite.

3125~~~
Didn't fumble the ball as many times in the second half, but he is so slow and turgid in his decision-making when he's given space and time in the ball that Southampton didn't really need to force errors from him. Easier to just relax and conserve energy when he's on the ball. He doesn't do anything either way.

Stunk out the place yet again, just like he as in all the other Premier League games he's played this season.

3126~~~
Absolutely coasted through that and it annoys me because I know he's capable of more. Where's the drive to get on the ball and make things happen? He was content to hang around in the midfield area passing the ball negatively. He also said he would accept the responsibility of scoring goals for us this season. Well i'm not seeing that hunger to get up there and score. 

No shots, no key passes, no threat to speak of.

3127~~~
A little bit better in the second half but still our worst player today. I don't even think it matters where you play him either- start him as a 9 and he drops deep anyway and shirks responsibility, play him as a 10 and he's just... anonymous. Now that Martial is obviously going to be starting in the CF role for the foreseeable future, him playing 10 means someone like Herrera has to be benched which is unfair. I didn't see it but apparently van Gaal gave him a telling off so we'll see how long he's allowed to keep playing at this standard before LVG loses patience and he's finally dropped.

3128~~~
That's part of the problem really. I expect more than "did little wrong". Particularly from our captain and senior most player.

3129~~~
I'd love to see a gif of that. Everyone here was saying how LVG was shouting at him.

3130~~~
The most worrying thing is how physically shot he looks. He not only looks like he's running through treacle, but he also gets out-muscled and out-fought on a regular basis.

I think he's lost his fire. He probably thinks he has nothing left to prove and no critics left to answer. If I were manager I'd drop him for 3-4 weeks and hope it gives him a kick up the backside.

3131~~~
I thought this was the case when Van Persie was here and we bought Mata.

I think I have low expectations of him, but I thought he was okay today in the 2nd half. He's better when he does the simpler things.

3132~~~
He looks awful physically which is the worrying part. There was a point in the 2nd half when the ball was close to going out and Rooney just took it out of play trying to "accelerate".

3133~~~
Now starting to actually get worried. His performances are consistently bad and its obvious that he is physically not up to it.

3134~~~
You could see Blind lay into him once when he once again just refused to turn and look up with the ball and passed it back. Does little wrong say his believers, does very little that warrants a start I'd say.

3135~~~
Played much deeper than a traditional 10. And in the second half, I thought he did okay. Basically performed a similar role to Schweinsteiger in receiving and recycling the ball, and helping us to control the game (only one's getting slaughtered for it, and one's getting praised to the heavens).

But yes, the urgency does seem to be lacking in his play at the moment. There were a number of times he received the ball on the edge of the box. The Rooney of old would've been looking to get a shot off or surge forward. This Rooney just laid it off.

Has seemed strangely subdued for a while now, and you do expect a bit more from him.

3136~~~
Rooney's stats today:
Shots: 0 Goals: 0 Assists: 0 Passes: 50/56 - 36 back/square Chances created: 0 Crosses: 0 Take-ons: 1

3137~~~
First half he was off the pace, as were the whole team, but much more involved in the game in the second half. 

Think Van Gaal will want him to play a lot closer to Martial, with Mata taking up the 10 position when drifting inside, but because we weren't getting the ball to him in the first half, he obviously felt the need to search for the ball.

3138~~~
Today was the biggest indicator of a situation whereby Rooney is completely undroppable.

He's just come back from injury and was clearly not fit. His statistics may be fine looking back at this but his actual use of the ball was awful. He was the catalyst for a lot of Southampton's attacks early on and the more we ignored him the better we were. In fact, the game span on it's head when Mata drifted infield and did Rooney's job for him.

On that note, you can forgive him for today. But it's not been about today. We've been witnessing this and have been the victim of it for the past 18-24 months truth be told. Fergie was right and it's time to wake up to it.

At half time I wrote this and it's still the same. It's always been the case in 2015 and has been the case more often than not since Fergie dropped him for Welbeck vs Real.

We're carrying him and playing with 10 men. If we ignore him toward the end of an attacking phase, our probability of scoring is greatly increased. If we include him, our probability of scoring is greatly reduced. It's that simple.

He should be starting in the cups and coming from the bench for the forseeable future. He won't. This discussion will be had every week till the long process of finally clearing him off our books is done.

Roll on that day.

3139~~~
The only reason he didn't do anything wrong is because he just didn't do anything at all.

3140~~~
Didn't think he was good at all today. I think he needs dropping for a few games. We would be much better with Herrera in behind the striker.

3141~~~
Didn't notice him much. I'm not sure what role he should be in, he didn't offer a great deal.

3142~~~
Bit of a nothing game from him today. He very rarely looks like a goal threat these days.

3143~~~
Absolute pointless today.

3144~~~
His stats are not fine. Take a look:

3145~~~
Hardly in the game and when he was, it was frustrating. LVG furious with him.... wonder how long he's going to be an automatic starter...? Just not there physically or mentally.

3146~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3147~~~
Thanks for that mate. Hadn't seen them. Assumed the percentage completed would be fairly high but the use of it was often negative to an attacking phase.

3148~~~
He'll continue to be selected  as LVG is dependent on playing him back into form. We can't just rely on Martial even if he has been excellent so far. 

This is exactly why I was so frustrated that the attack wasn't our focus for the window gone.

3149~~~
I'm finding myself willing the ball to reach anyone bit him at times lately.

3150~~~
Haha!

3151~~~
Don't know how he didn't get subbed. He's very disappointing now

3152~~~
I'm actually starting to doubt that he'll get Charlton's record. Bar the match against Brugge, he's looked nothing at all like scoring this season, and it's a trend that goes further back than that as well. Looking more and more like a Torres for every match that goes by.

3153~~~
LVG will shift him when the season ends, I can see it happening.

3154~~~
He looks like RvP last season, physically his edge is blunted, no acceleration, no strength on the ball and he offers nothing in a role that is supposed to be the creative hub as he can't turn with it and drive and he doesn't see the little slide passes needed in that position. Not a #9 or #10 at this point, just a wage thief.

3155~~~
Silent domination?

3156~~~
Only scored in one game so far and that was by far the weakest side we've played. He won't have a better chance than Sunderland at OT next week though, I think he'll get a goal then and hopefully it will change things for him.

3157~~~

3158~~~
No problem with a player that's coming back from injury. Fits in the style of play for LVG.....

3159~~~
great burst of acceleration, but incredibly poor pass

3160~~~
I've lost count of of times he messed up our attack going forward this season. Seems like he really is finished.

3161~~~
This pass infuriated me the most.

3162~~~
That touch looks worse every time you see it. Painful.

3163~~~
yup

<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3164~~~
Is true. 

When you don't try anything, you can't do much wrong. 

He fecked up a simple 5 yard pass on the 3 v 3 counter early on and just didn't bother after that. 

Herrera should take his place as the AM.

3165~~~
He wouldn't be starting for any other big club atm. He stinks.

3166~~~
god he's fecking shit at everything that has anything to do with football. his feet are where attacking moves go to die.

3167~~~
It's painful to watch when you remember how good he used to be. Even if he never quite fulfilled his early promise, he was still a fantastic player. Now we are definitely seeing the Vegas era Elvis. With Martial hitting the ground running and other options upfront, I see no reason for putting him in the first XI.

3168~~~
Just came in to post this. I suspect a part of it is what happens to athletes as they get older, they just become more cautious. Added to this is his decline physically, and this will cause a loss of confidence. I hate to see it happening to anyone when they get to this stage of their career. But on the other hand, we can't afford to carry him. It's a real mess.

3169~~~
He was woeful, his: movement, positioning, passing, awareness, anticipation, and physicality were next to zero. I don't think I have ever seen him have a poorer game from him than this. For most parts of the game particularly in the closing stages it felt as if we were playing with ten men. 

One has to spare a thought for non defensive players sitting on our bench today, wondering what they have to do to get game time. On the basis of his showing today, it must pretty demoralizing to the rest of the squad having to sweat for their spot in team only for Wayne to simply declare himself fit and get a game. 

LVG needs to sort this out ASAP, we got away with it today. On any other day it might have been very different indeed.

Trouble is at this moment in time I really am struggling to see what Rooney brings to the team. Is it psychological? Physical? technical? None of them from point of view. I understand the need for leaders on the pitch but honestly there are far better candidates for that, offering a lot more to side than Rooney.

3170~~~
Our highest paid player. Our captain. The only undroppable player. And you think adequate is okay?

I was not a fan of Falcao, but at least Falcao made attempts to score. In any case, Falcao is not good enough to play in the EPL, as Chelsea are currently realising. 
Rooney looks scared to shoot and would rather pass to another player, than shoot, himself.
A striker who can't make assists or score goals is a striker who should not be playing for MUFC.

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3171~~~
Jaysus. "Did little wrong" is the new he did fecking nothing ?

3172~~~
That performance was horrendous, not sure what I just witnessed. 

He's been bad for a while now, but today he looked completely uninterested too.

3173~~~
Seems he's shot his bolt. Was a passenger today. I'll give him the benefit of doubt here though as he has been injured. Saying that though, he should have been subbed.

3174~~~
That was a terrible moment. Need better from a #10.

3175~~~
Not sure where he goes. Not with his astronomical wages.

Best hope is probably someone like PSG wanting to make a marquee signing based on name alone.

From a footballing perspective not sure why they'd want him.

Maybe he can rejuvenate himself with a backwards move on lower wages at Everton, and we can use him as bait for Stones or Barkley. One can dream.

3176~~~
Use Herrera or Mata there..  And just put Young on the wing

3177~~~
We are going to take an absolute hit if we move him. Can see us having to pay him 100 grand a week to play for someone else.

3178~~~
That was the most disappointing thing about his performance today he so often just didn't seem to care that he actually was on a football pitch, I couldn't see any desire in him to get involved into any play he was just there jogging along and arguing with the ref at times. I'm also baffled by why LvG is letting this slide.

3179~~~
I wonder what Van Gaal told him in the second half. He did not look very happy. Hopefully, he gets dropped soon so he realizes he can't just lumber around the pitch week in and week out and still be guaranteed to play 

Did he have one good involvement today? I can't remember a single one. One thing is being in poor form, but what really brings my piss to a boil is seeing how little effort he puts in these days.

3180~~~
Lets see if Van Gaal has balls to drop him if no improvements to be seen in next few games.

3181~~~
Can't believe I;m agreeing with Carragher and Souness about Rooney. Carragher trying to gently suggest to Gary Nev that maybe there comes a time when maybe it's not the system we're playing, tactics whatever, but maybe Wayne needs to look at his performance etc.... Nev saying he needs freedom and such, but freedom to do what I wonder, lose the ball, slow down our attacks, constantly pay the ball backwards most of the time... so worrying his form, really is..

3182~~~
There are only a few clubs in the world that could afford his wages and none of them will want to touch him these days. He won't be going anywhere which makes his five year contract look an odd decision.

3183~~~
I watched the Duncan Ferguson memorial during the pre-season and you could see it meant a lot to him to be back in blue..I think he was testing out the waters almost..That would be a great move for all of us..They can throw in Stones too , we wont mind.

3184~~~
He just doesn't do anything interesting with the ball anymore. He can't do it.

He doesn't take it on the half turn. He doesn't dribble. He doesn't run with the ball into open space.

He simply gets it, his first touch takes him backwards and he moves it on. Rinse and repeat. If you're lucky he'll smash out that woeful pass of his to the right hand side. Which never leads to anything.

Van Gaal has afforded Rooney more loyalty and patience than any other player. He's binned both Falcao and Van Persie. He's made him captain. I don't think it's a stretch to say that Rooney is very much fighting for his United career over the coming months.

Van Gaal won't drop him now, but you can sure as hell bet he'll flog him when he feels the time is right. We've got too much money to be fecking around with an out of touch Wayne Rooney.

I look at that first Martial goal today and I just can't see Rooney coming out with that sort of ingenuity anymore. What Martial did was different and unexpected, which is why he's scored three goals already.

3185~~~
Was it a pass or his first touch?  Hard to tell these days.

3186~~~
The counter where he passed it to the defender instead of Memphis was very frustrating today. I mean sure, Memphis probably would've ran to the byline, cut in and either put someone on their arse or hit a tame shot, but you've got to be able to thread a simple pass as a number 10. 

I don't want to sit here ripping into him, but he HAS to do more.

3187~~~
We could bin Falcao or RVP.

But Rooney has like three years left on his contract. We hoping some team from Qatar will make an offer for him. That's the only way we getting rid of him.

3188~~~
He's useless, and we're basically attacking around him as opposed to with him.

I shudder to think if we hadn't signed  Martial.

3189~~~
I dont think Everton could afford him on a loan where we pay half his wages. We're stuck with him because his contract is unreal. The only way I see him going back to Everton is if they do a David Beckham thing. Where Rooney moves to the MSL on massive wages, and he moves to Everton on next to nothing during the off season.

He looks well past it to me. Its not an over reaction either. The signs have been there for a few years now. He seems to have hit the wall massively in the last 12 months, though.

3190~~~
they made a point ive said here before, about him being an instinct player and plays best aggressive and on the edge. Its complete contrast to what LVG wants in his players, preferring them to use their head instead of their gut. that's a clear difference between the Fergie era/LVG

3191~~~
*head scratch*

3192~~~
nutshell

3193~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> There was a moment during the second half where he received the ball with loads of space behind him. Rather than taking the ball and turning into space he just passed it right back first-time. The defender he passed to (I think it was Blind, but not sure) didn't seem too happy about it.

3194~~~
Just put him on the fecking bench and his pride will take care of the rest. Even Robin wasn't this bad and he was really bad.

3195~~~
Sluggish today but one move stands out. He cleared the ball in his own box with his head then sprinted upfield to get in position for a return pass from Martial who was fouled before he could square the ball. If Rooney had got on the end of that, we'd have been praising him to the heavens.

3196~~~
He offers us absolutely nothing, he's finished. He's rubbish at Old Trafford but he's even worse away from home. We may as well play with 10 men when we're away.

He went missing in the 2nd half. He dropped so deep, it was almost as though he was hiding.

3197~~~
He's done. Scary to think what this season would look like if we hadn't signed Martial. Going forward LVG needs to decide how our forward line should look without him and make the changes in the next few windows. Griezmann in and Mata to 10 maybe.

3198~~~
I guess LVG thinks Rooney's captaincy role is worth us effectively playing with 10 men? He must be a very important voice in the dressing room.

3199~~~
He's physically and footballing wise really poor. But what I don't understand is that he lacks drive and enthusiasm or energy like today. He really needs to be benched but let's see if LVG ever does that. Just a shit performance

3200~~~
Nev is blind when it comes to English players. Not surprised.

3201~~~
I think Gary was quite critical in a more subtle way. 

He had said that he has been playing poorly and that even Rooney would say his best position is number 9 and basically said he got by at number 10 on sheer workrate.

3202~~~
He didn't look happy with his captain in the second half 

He offered nothing today - a passenger and the sheer lack of effort is baffling - even when he played badly in the past you could see he was trying hard but today he barely made himself available or ran faster than a trot

3203~~~
When he did sign that new deal, wasnt a large part of that also in image rights?..so maybe he can keep that..He has to take a paycut though, and I am not sure he would be willing to do that. 

The Everton fans wont like that, if he is to go back, it has to be the real thing.

3204~~~
I realize I'm late, so which one of these is it this time:

1. Played out of position
2. CM's and DM's have been poor
3. The wingers were awful
4. Just coming back from injury
5. Other

I hate the fact that he's taking the place of another player that could be far more useful to the team.

3205~~~
I can see him turning into our version of John Terry, shite but somehow keeps playing. Must be an English thing. 

Let's help he sorts it out or Van Gaal does.

3206~~~

3207~~~
Seriously Wayne..

3208~~~
You just need to listen to the commentary for that failed pass on our counter attack. Neville didn't even comment on it because he doesn't want to criticise Rooney.

3209~~~
Yes. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Blind was livid. You could see.

3210~~~
He's so far off it's incredible. He's becoming a big problem for us and I can see LVG doing a RvP on him in the summer

3211~~~
His role should be back up to Herrera and when Martial needs a rest at the moment, right now he is a complete deadweight.

3212~~~
I think it's Martial's fault Rooney didn't play well today. I mean, he was going all alone all the time, ignoring Rooney, taking people all by himself and occupying our Wayne's position at times. Who the feck he thinks he is coming straight into the team and looking two times better than Rooney looked in more than two years? It's definitely his fault, I would drop him because he might make people think Rooney is shite and we don't want that.

Also, it's van Gaal's fault because it's obvious that he is playing him out of position. He should move him to [insert position where he didn't play], which is obviously his natural position.

Also we should sell Mata because he makes Rooney looks shite and sign Messi to feed him with the passes. With Messi he could maybe even have a shot on goal.

3213~~~
I'm in a pub and he's getting an absolute pasting from neutral fans. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3214~~~
I'm not even saying anything cause I don't want to be seen having a go at my own olayer infront of ABUs

3215~~~
My friend, you can't use Rooney as bait for anybody. If anything, we will need to pay Rooney or another club to take him off our hands.
LVG culled Falcao and RVP, who IMO were better than Rooney is now, so lets wait and see how this unravels.

If Rooney can get a decent tally by the end of the season, he will be safe, but if he scores less than 10 goals, LVG will definitely be thinking about getting rid of him.
The latest stats: 6 games into the season, he has scored zero goals

3216~~~
I thought it was 3 in 2?

3217~~~
Almost sad to see that once upon a time him and Ronaldo were tearing teams up with moves like that and now he's stopping Memphis and Martial doing the same. 

His most valuable contributions today were the crossfield ball to Mata and going down holding his head to relieve pressure at the end.

3218~~~
That tweet was before his second goal today

3219~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3220~~~
We should try to work some deal with Everton with Rooney and Barkley switching clubs. Rooney seems to have no fight or desire and seems uncomfortable in our current team, he would benefit from returning to Everton.

3221~~~
Showed today why he shouldn't be playing in behind the striker. If he's up front and not playing well, there's always the hope that he'll compensate with a goal. His game is just off right now though, and we can't afford to have him in a deeper role. If we're not playing him ahead of Martial (which we shouldn't at the moment), then he should be dropped. Herrera will offer us more in behind the striker.

3222~~~
Tries to do be the all action Rooney but his legs are gone. If he commits to be an out and out striker and not this bullshit 9.5 he can prolong his career. Give me Fellaini in the 10 over him. Moyes was right...Rooney has become soft.

3223~~~
But.... But.... He didn't play upfront for atleast 90 minutes of those 15 hours....

3224~~~
He's on a longish contract and on a massive wage. After the Euros he should be retiring from international football because it's affecting his day job. He should follow Scholes' example.

3225~~~
Sure like Everton can pay Rooney 300.000k a week ..lol

3226~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I could imagine how assertive and explosive our attack down the middle would be with Barkley just behind Martial. However, if we are planning to offload Rooney, it would be at a club that can actually offered the wage he would command.

Rooney is becoming the elephant in the room, that everyone does not want to talk about and is being ignored by our management team. He needs to play himself back into the team, as I believe Herrera should have never been dropped for him.

3227~~~
Shouldn't start for at least a few games. Would it be dead rude to recall Wilson already?

3228~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/ePA7PX7uTnP/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

3229~~~
Does anyone still think he'll hit the 20 odd or so some people thought he would at the start of the season?

I honestly can't see how we can justify starting him.

3230~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ouch

Michael Cox's take on Rooney and Mane today: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/20/southampton-manchester-united-sadio-mane-tactics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/20/southampton-manchester-united-sadio-mane-tactics</a>

3231~~~
I think I predicted something like 12 or 13. Honestly I think he could struggle to get even that, even if has already scored 3 (against Brugge).

3232~~~
Nice article. Pretty much summed my issue with Rooney in the first half. Might as well have been down to ten men with how non-existent his movement was.

3233~~~
They wouldn't have to, any deal would presumably include Rooney earning a severance package from United, and a large fee from United for Barkley that Everton could use towards a signing on fee for Rooney. It would end up costing United and arm and a leg but given his seemingly unending poor performances I think it's something the club should look at.

It would need to be a pretty complex deal but I'm sure it's possible, even if Rooney was unwilling to lose anything financially which he might even given his supposed love of Everton and supposed dislike of LVG's rigidity. As my initial post indicated, I only see this as a remote possibility due to Rooney looking completely unmotivated and uncomfortable for us - hence he might fancy a return to Everton even at the expense of monetary gain. If he goes sooner rather than later he'll still be in a position to negotiate for bigger perks from Everton (image rights, future roles at the club after his playing days etc)

3234~~~
It has reached a point where his continued inclusion in the team is not only going to negatively effect us on the pitch but also cause disharmony amongst the squad, especially the poor swines he is keeping out of the team. Being captain he should be leading the charge but looks more akin to an albatross as the weeks go on.

He looks lost out there which only makes the fact LVG has repeatedly praised him for embodying his philosophy (being his best captain etc.) all the more baffling.

Edit# That vine is absolutely ridiculous, almost like he is deliberately taking the piss.

3235~~~
You realise that Brugge never actually qualified for the CL?
Brugge were terrible, especially that 'B' team which they used against us because most of their first team were injured.

In any case, I tend to use EPL goals as the yard-stick and I believe that he probably will get 12-13 EPL goals, this year. But for a player on World record wages, I expect more.
In comparison, Falcao got 4 EPL goals last year, when he played roughly half a season. And Falcao is woeful/dire.

3236~~~
Half arsed Napoli scored 5 past them.

3237~~~
He's playing because he's Rooney.

3238~~~
You'd struggle to find a forward that has performed worse in the league thus far. He's been horrible.

Any other player would be dropped a long time ago.

3239~~~
Was Van Gaal bollocking him today when Soton player got a cramp?

3240~~~
How the hell are we going to sell him?

3241~~~
Yeah I'm not disagreeing with that, I'm just saying that even despite the fact that he already has 3 goals I just can't see him get 12 let alone 20. We're not going to face poor teams like Brugge any time soon.

3242~~~
Memphis would've been through on goal there, Rooney just had a simple pass. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3243~~~
Hypotheticals get you nowhere but my first thought was what might've happened if Herrera were in that situation instead.  I would almost certainly think Memphis gets a break at goal.

What really pissed me off about Rooney today is that even in previous games when he's not doing much offensively, he would at least be dropping deep and trying to work against the counterattack, which in this game we could've used. His effort was in the negative numbers.  Absolutely did not want to know.

3244~~~
Categorically absolutely will not break sir bobs record. Won't do it this season and will be gone next

3245~~~
At this point I'm not sure he's even going to break Andy Cole's Premier League total.

3246~~~
I'd be perfectly happy for him never to start again

3247~~~
And to who. Don't think any club in Europe is going to take him for the money he'll want and some MLS club will be our best option. Which is why he'll probably stay for at least two more years.

3248~~~
It's just sad to see him play like this. And I'm not sure what we can do about it either. He's Wayne Rooney, and he wont be dropped, but his complete lack of physicality is a problem.

3249~~~
Any idea why LVG was scolding him during the game?

3250~~~
It's very possible that he won't be considered for the first 11 next season if he keeps it up. Maybe he will want to keep his England place and move on to somewhere he can play every week. But he has beaten Charlton's record so he probably wont care.

3251~~~
Yeah, that was very odd. He was plenty of place behind. 

The issue right now is that noone can say what he brings to the team. He's shockingly lacking pace and power, so he isn't a goal threat, but he isn't a great play maker either.

I'm just randomly hoping one day we see the proper Rooney turn up in the PL.

3252~~~
Thankfully we are winning whilst carrying him. Sooner he is dropped the better and he can kiss being our all time top scorer goodbye. 
I don't care about his long and utterly disgusting contact. Club can afford it, but he shouldn't be anywhere near our first team squad, let alone first 11.

3253~~~
That's true and I agree, but I just don't see a buyer for him and whoever is in charge of England might not care if he regularly plays or not.

3254~~~
His inclusion is starting to hamper our performances. He needs to be benched and forced to work to earn his spot back. Herrera would have been much better than him today and I'm hopeful LvG will find the balls to drop him. He is slow, barely even jogs let alone sprints. His inclusion must be contract stipulated because had Herrera or Young or Mata played as badly they would training with the reserves. That has to rub some people the wrong way. I think he can improve but he needs to be motivated to do that and only dropping him will spur that on.

3255~~~
It's all very comfortable and if it remains so then he will never improve. A kick up the backside could do the trick because it would pressure him to prove himself to LvG. By keeping him on regardless LvG is not only holding the team back but he is also coming close to the point where players like Young and Herrera will rightly question his judgement since they work their arses off but must always make way for someone who is not earning his keep.

3256~~~
The Rooney we're seeing now is unrecognisable from the one we loved. He's always had patches of poor form and I had hoped that this was another one but it doesn't seem to matter where we play him, he just isn't up to it any more. 

During the first half there was a void where he needed to be and the back four and midfield just had nothing central to aim for. When he did find himself on the ball be looked sluggish and devoid of creativity and drive. 

He just doesn't offer anything anymore. I feel embarrassed for him most games, as the contrast between what he was and what he's become is so marked. It's sad to see.

3257~~~
It really is. Funny thing, I'm still confident in his finishing abilities, but he doesn't seem to have the physical presence to be a goal threat right now.

3258~~~
Didn't even think his all round game was bad today. The one counter attack pass to Memphis he messed up aside, his passing and touch and all that was good. He just didn't look a goal threat, but hopefully he'll improve. Just needs to end the goal drought in the league and he'll be good again. You can tell he's playing within himself a bit and holding things back, it's not natural for him to be so possession oriented. He's much better when we start breaking quickly. He'll come good again, you just have to believe...

3259~~~
He deserved it?

3260~~~
For?

3261~~~
The last 4 pages sum it up well enough mate.

3262~~~
If it was his performance level, he would have been giving him bollockings since the start of the season. Looked like something tactcal. Reminded me of SAF in 2011 CL final.

3263~~~
I think that's most likely the case: he's still an excellent finisher (I doubt that ever leaves strikers even after retirement). But given his lack of movement, acceleration and close control, he's rarely going to get opportunities to score.

3264~~~
I'd happily stand corrected if he can find some proper form (over time) again but for me he's done. If only there was a way to sell him without all the drama.

3265~~~
At the start of the season people went on about form or position but I don't think these are the main factors, he just looks like he is struggling to get his body around the pitch most of the time. Like you say it is something that happens to athletes in top level sport, there is no clock on exactly when physical deterioration sets in, some will go on until nearly 40 like Giggs, others decline around the 30 mark like RvP and Shevchenko, I'd say Rooney looks like he is in the latter group.

3266~~~
He won't break the Utd scoring record this season. 

No chance.

3267~~~
Physically he is absolutely shot. There's just nothing left in the tank anymore. 

He's becoming our Gerrard.

3268~~~
20+ goals guaranteed.

3269~~~
I looked who is my best and worst rated player this season - no suprise with the best who is Smalling at 7,2 (Martial is 8.0 but i think he didn't played enough matches to be competing for it) but suprisingly the worst rated player for me is Rooney at 4.2.

And it tells a lot about his performances this year when i, one of the Rooney's biggest fans, rated him so low in this season. I rarely even give 3 points for performances, i really can't even remember when or even if a gave 3 points for performance of our players which tells that apart from Brugge away he was one of the worst players for us this season. He need to start performing because this is just not good enough, not good enough to be a first team player for United and definetly not good enough for a player of his reputation.

3270~~~
Shit again today

Herrera should be starting instead of him

3271~~~
I agree 100%

3272~~~
Or Mata, Or Fellaini. He really is our worst option at #10 right now.

But hey, he's Wayne Rooney, so he has to start.

3273~~~
Didn't see the game, was he really that bad again. Jeez

3274~~~
There is no excuses for him anymore, he doesn't do the simple Things right, he will still score goals here and there, but doesn't add enough to our overall play.

3275~~~
He's not going to break the goal record this season unless he scores a ton of penalties.

I'll be glad to see that proved wrong but I just can't see what could improve from a physical stand point. His passing and first touch has been poor for 2-3 seasons so it's not even like it's just bad form from that aspect.

3276~~~
As much as I was impressed by Martial today, the equal and opposite could be said of Rooney. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

He didn't do anything you want a #10 to do, and it's an indictment on him that even when not asked to score the goals or lead the line, he can't even get the passing the ball forward and being a creative hub for the team element right.

How many non-square or backward passes did he make today? How many threaded passes? It's more than a concern how... well, plain ordinary, Rooney looks out there. You'd never, in a million years, know this was our supposed star man if you'd not watched a game of ours before. He's honestly not giving us anything that half the league's #10's couldn't do at the moment, and that should be a big worry.

What I don't get is even if he is physically shot, which some people say, but I don't believe is the case, why has the ability to pass or try anything "Rooney-esque" completely deserted him as well? Rooney seems to be content to get the ball and just mindlessly play it square time and time again, he's not even trying things and having them not come off. Everything is just so bland and unimaginative from him these days, and I find that really depressing.

It's getting to the point where you have to wonder why he's getting game time and I never thought I'd say that about Rooney. I'm not one of the many Rooney haters, but I'm now getting to the point where I feel others need to be getting a go in the team instead of him.

3277~~~
Just imagine how good we will be once Wayne comes into form.

3278~~~
Like to see what Pereira can do.

3279~~~
weve been waiting for ages.

3280~~~
Dunno, even when he's had chances (Swansea) he's been indecisive. He used to be a handful irrespective of whether he was scoring goals or not but I don't actually have any confidence in any area of his game just now. 

The dynamism is just not there.

3281~~~
Don't wait - just rejoice when it happens.

3282~~~
Yep, we were crying out for a player like Herrera today. Schneiderlin and Carrick are fairly similar players. We needed someone to take a chance from midfield and those 2 seemed reluctant to either get forward or take a chance.

3283~~~
When was the last time he was 'in form'?

Seriously, his last truly great season was 5 years ago.

3284~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/20/anthony-martial-manchester-united-wayne-rooney-southampton" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...al-manchester-united-wayne-rooney-southampton</a>

3285~~~
He's not that player anymore - by in form i simply mean scoring more goals.

3286~~~
Did anybody else see this? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/65yhk1c.gif" src="http://i.imgur.com/65yhk1c.gif"/>

3287~~~
A player capable of a great season? Surely we can do better then that then?

Even if he starts scoring some goals, that won't mask the major deficiencies in his all round game these days. He's just not a very good player anymore. He looks like a 35 year old, who's past his peak. He might put in the odd good game, maybe even great, but he's going to put in great performances week in week out. He just doesn't have the legs for it anymore. 13 years of top flight football have taken their toll.

3288~~~
He's been average to poor for the last few years but his goals have covered it up. He's always had good stats in terms of goals and assists at the end of a season.

Now he doesn't even offer that. He can't even paper over the cracks anymore.

3289~~~
wonder if Herrera will get the same next time he puts in a similar performance

3290~~~
Van Gaal's undroppable man-child.

3291~~~
He's ours for at least the rest of this year so we should get used to it. And who knows, he may start knocking in goals and to quiet the persistent moaning around here.

3292~~~
So we should just accept his sub standard performances because we're stuck with him?

And its going to take a lot more then knocking in a few goals to turn things around. Being able to actually control the ball without taking about 7 touches would be a good start. 

And we have every right to moan. He's our highest paid player, and captain, who has a seemingly divine right to start every game he's fit for, and yet he's been awful all season (bar one 90 minutes against Brugge). Its not good enough, and we have every right to point that out.

3293~~~
Pretty much yes. Complaining in here accomplishes feck all. He'll still be here tomorrow, so best to get behind him and hope for the best.

3294~~~
During the rest of his career if he plays until he's 40 maybe.

3295~~~
How about this... can you name worse player in our team right now? Even the likes of Pereira and other youth players would do better than this. He's maybe the most overrated player in English history. It's proly because his fall was so steep, nobody just expects world class talent like him to decline so quickly.

Like someone said he's our Gerrard, need to get rid of him asap, wouldn't care having him as a squad player but his name and ego is too big to play second or third fiddle which is what he deserves not only recently but for years...

3296~~~
Say what you want about Mourinho, but he had the balls to drop his Captain/Leader/Legend John Terry as he was abysmal. LvG should have the balls to do the same now.

3297~~~
We need an Arab or Chinese billionaire to take one for the team.

3298~~~
Might as well all pack up and go home then if we're just supposed to accept his performances. Surely the whole point of the forum is do discuss them? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3299~~~
No one is saying you can't discuss them. But don't expect discussions about replacing him to be anything more than discussions. He isn't going anywhere.

3300~~~
I see the solution as getting Rooney to play at a higher level, which he can and once he does, it will unlock the gates of a lot more attacking options involving Memphis and Martial as well

3301~~~
He's past it. He can't even sprint that fast anymore, and his passing is too limited to play a passing role a la Carrick and Schweini. His strength is gone too. Tbh, he's a shell of his former self, and it's just reminiscent of Gerrard of the last few seasons at L'pool.

3302~~~
We don't need the sprinting, we just need him to be a bit more audacious and score a few more goals. He has plenty of pace surroudning him to get it done.

3303~~~
I thought his finishing, intelligence, unselfishness and experience would be enough for him to have a productive season as a 9 this year. Surprised how poor he's been and how awful he looks out there. 

At the moment, it's just wrong to start him as a 9 over Martial, as a 10 over Herrera or even over Young, who could play out wide with Mata as the 10.

3304~~~
So we don't need him to sprint as he has pace around him? So when the pacey players are in position to lay it off to him are they going to just wait for him to jog in position? It will
Be a bloody long wait on days like today where our talismanic
Number ten is deeper than schweinsteiger.

3305~~~
<a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a> not complaining, how deluded are you <a class="username" data-user="15, @Raoul" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/15/">@Raoul</a> ?!

3306~~~
Neither is this team if he continues to be a main part of it beyond this season, he's a hindrance more than a help at this point, no pace, no skill, one offensive pass in his range and he's also lost his power which was a key asset of his.

3307~~~
The answer is obviously not to bench him as that will neither improve his contribution or confidence. He needs to stay fit and build on his hat trick performance from a few weeks ago and kick on.

3308~~~
He's shown absolutely no sign of doing that, the game directly after that hat-trick he was awful because he was up against top opposition in Swansea, not a Championship level team like Brugge. He'll continue to play but in truth as much as I am not a fan of Fellaini and am not sold on Herrera as a #10, him playing over them week after week when he hasn't had a decent league game this season is not good, the team is bigger than one player no matter how much money he is on and his undroppable status is not a way to keep the team morale up.

3309~~~
He'll be fine. Once he knocks one or two league goals in more will come, and things will go quiet in here. Happens every time a player loses then recovers form.

3310~~~
The inevitable decline for a player with his mileage and early start age wise has begun and the only way is down unfortunately.

3311~~~
Agree.

3312~~~
I don't think so, it's not about confidence, it's exactly what we saw with RvP, he is simply past his best and doesn't have enough assets at this point to make it worth the price we pay to have him in the team, neither on the pitch or financially.

3313~~~
Yep, agreed. I think this may be Wayne's final year here. The search for a club to take him will probably start in early 2016, at which point it will just be a matter of selling him for peanuts to offset the buying club taking on his wages.

3314~~~
RvP was also on the decline, but moving him on also had a lot to do with reducing the wage bill, along with the likes of Falcao and Nani.

3315~~~
The real issue is people still think he is a very good player.  Replace is with was and the riddle is solved. 

It's like asking why a 40 years old giggs can't run down the left channel anymore. 

He's finished at top level. Fact  the reality. A 38 years old teddy sheringham can have a good goal and score 1-2 goals,  even macheda did that.  But week in week out this will be the rooney you'd see.  Before its the evil rooney playing bad,  now its the good roonet that plays bad and the evil rooney is very far in between

3316~~~
We could reduce the wage bill by moving Rooney on as well and getting in young, hungry talent that is ready to step into their best years.

3317~~~
I'm sure we will, but it won't happen until next summer, which makes the endless complaining about him even less meaningful.

3318~~~
Of course we wont be able to do it until next summer but I am not sure what you are expecting, it's a message board and this is Rooney's performance thread, his performances are shite but he never gets dropped or taken off and he's paid an obscene amount of money for the privilege of making our team worse, I think it's only logical that fans vent their frustration in the correct thread for it.

3319~~~
Agreed, just as much as its logical for those who are tired of hearing about it to vent their frustration as well.

3320~~~
Think he'll end up at Everton myself and it would be a nice way to end the cycle imo.

3321~~~
Rooney plus cash for Stones ? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3322~~~
He will, but its taking longer and longer for him to find form after a layoff/summer. There will come a point where hes spending more time finding form that he is in it, and i think that could be this season.

Another issue is his captaincy and general status at the club. He will leave big shoes to fill and with that agent of his wont go quietly if we dont handle his phasing out properly.

3323~~~
Yeah it will be tricky when he leaves. The transfer fee will be very little since most clubs won't be prepared to eat a 260k/wk wage bill

3324~~~
I've never really understood being annoyed by people having an opinion on a board designed for that in truth. If a topic starts to grate just don't click on the thread is my method, like the circular Fellaini debate.

3325~~~
That would be rather one sided wouldn't it. The purpose of this board is to discuss points and counterpoints.

3326~~~
But saying "Stop moaning even though I agree he's playing shite" is not really debating the points, right now there isn't anything to debate with Rooney in fairness, his performances are rancid hence people are annoyed, I think more because he just keeps playing regardless, where everyone else is dropped when they have poor form.

3327~~~
Yeah he's clearly mentally shot. No physical issues. He's a second behind the game these days... reluctance to pass, reluctance to shoot, reluctance to make runs.

3328~~~
Seeing all this talk of Rooney 2015 = Rvp 2014, I checked out the Fenerbahce page...
Nani 4 goals 2 assists (6 starts)
RvP 2 goals 1 assist (4 starts)

Not bad but no earth-shakingly good either

3329~~~
They are still good players who can contribute. Having looked at our wage bill, which is still the highest in the Prem this year, it quickly became clear that we moved each of them on because they were past their respective primes and we needed to reduce our wage bill after pursuing players like Schweinsteiger. Same will probably be the case for Rooney next year.

3330~~~
He's only good for 1/3 of the season, the rest of the time he's spent looking like utter shit or injured. Moyes fecked this club in more ways than just the results on the pitch.

3331~~~
Is he finished as a man utd player? He cannot seems to contribute anymore

3332~~~
I would not say no to that!

3333~~~
I've been defending our captain in the newb forums since I started, saying form is temporary, class is permanent and all those other clichés.  Genuinely thought he'd reach top form soon, especially considering the fairly reasonable start to the season we were given in terms of who we were playing, and put to rest all those who were slating the guy.

Last few games he's played he doesn't seem to be improving at all and yesterday was slowing the match down way too much. Starting to feel it's time he was dropped and herrera / mata play in the no. 10 role with martial as the no. 9

3334~~~
looks so slow and uninterested. he needs to step up quickly if not then time to drop him.

3335~~~
The debate isn't on whether he should be sold now or not is it, when the window is shut and it's obvious he's here for the season. It's on whether he should be starting games when he's in a terrible run of form / looking past it. 

It's conceivable that he will hit form and play closer to what he did before, but is that the best option for the team, to play him into form? Do we have better options already perhaps - I wouldn't play Fellaini ahead of Rooney as a #10 as he's got worse first touch, is more static, with a lesser passing range and handles being pressed even worse (he's a decent sub to have though, at times) - but I'd prefer to see Herrera instead of Rooney when he's not giving the manager a reason for picking him. 

We've carried him this season but it's not just Louis who hypes him up, the whole team seems to speak incredibly highly of him which might be part Wayne's world codependency and part being his importance to the team due to his career history with the club given our team is brand new. If he could hold that influence and not sulk if he were dropped but instead play himself into the team in training, that'd be really neat.

3336~~~
I would not be surprised if LvG sells him next summer if this continues.  Captain or not, LvG is ruthless.  He saw RVP was in decline and looked physically shot and made the honest assessment that it was best he move.   The question is, if he did move, where could he realistically go?  Not many teams can afford his wages.  But hopefully for our and his sake, this is a rough patch in form and he will start scoring again in bucket loads like usual.

3337~~~
Absolutely shambolic performance. Even his first touch is now letting him down. There were many instances when Martial and Memphis made some bright runs behind the Saints back 4 and he just did not take a chance. A Mata or Herrera would have definitely attempted that. I get it, Herrera and Mata may not be the perfect no.10 but still they make that effort of trying those through balls. 

All Rooney kept on doing was spraying ball from one end to the other which did not help when we were counter-attacking. He is really a waste of space currently and needs to be dropped.

3338~~~
Any other player would have been dropped to bench a long time ago. 

Not exactly the stuff you'd expect from the captain and club's top earner.

3339~~~
I wonder if it's a case of him not being able to adapt.

Wayne Rooney has always had a special talent from an early age. He had that X-factor and the football brain that made him stand out and unfortunately, in my opinion, the versatility to play in a number of positions. In his early years, he was allowed to play with his instincts - his 'street football' type style, where he'd take on defenders, go for spectacular shots, while running back to defend in his own box.  Needless to say, that's the Rooney we all remember fondly.

With each year, as he gets older, and as he's slowly moved away from his street football type game, its not surprising to see that he's no longer the same type of player. To make matters worse, rather than playing his preferred ST role, we've all seen him shifted onto the Wing and into Center Mid, under Fergie's last few seasons, under Moyes and now under LVG.

Now that he's back as a ST under LVG, a manager known for his philosophy and a set of unique roles for each of the players in his system - I honestly think Rooney doesn't have a clue about what he's supposed to do.

Don't get me wrong, the talent is clearly still there, as is his experience and leadership quality, but I suspect that more so than Fergie and Moyes, he's really been asked to reign in his instincts (which made him a worldclass player in the first place) and opposed to taking the speculative shot or pass, to instead, shift the ball or to maintain possession - which would explain why he's so dire...

I would clearly like to see him banging in the goals again- but I honestly don't think that under LVG, we're going to see much from Rooney, aside from the occasional glimpses of his ability.

3340~~~
He should be behind Herrera and Fellaini in the pecking order for the #10 position on recent form. He has become a huge problem that doesn't look like being solved.

3341~~~
You just answered your own post. Whether or not you accept it or creating a wall of hypothetical reasons and excuses is another issue.

People keep on pointing on that 2011-2012 season while it's 4 years ago. Rooney is 30 this year? It's not wise to assume he can simply become the 4 years younger Rooney just because he's Rooney.

3342~~~
Embarrassing how Gary was trying to pin the blame for his form on LVG yesterday.

3343~~~
Forget about goals, he hasn't even has 5 shots on target this season in the league

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2015/matches/803216/player-stats/13017/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...er-stats/13017/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

This is pretty telling, he's all over the park making passes without purpose

And here's Martial's 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/8-2015/matches/803216/player-stats/148225/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...r-stats/148225/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor</a>

3344~~~
I've already said in another thread I see no place for him in Van Gaal's new team. He's simply not a no.10 and if Van Gaal continues to play him there he'll only hold Martial back.

3345~~~
With Rooney at no. 9 - we were dire and scored 2 goals (apart from the OG) in 4 games.  With Martial playing the same position, we have 6 goals in 2 games. Isn't that a clear indication of Rooney's performances?

Now - he has moved to no. 10 to accommodate the skill, pace and creativity that Martial has shown. No. 10 is where he played most of last season (and wasn't very good).  There will be a period of 5-10 games (I'm sure) where Rooney will look like the real deal, but the question that LVG needs to answer is whether that is worth the team carrying him for the remaining 40-50 games??

3346~~~
How does playing Rooney at No. 10 hold Martial back?  I'd imagine it holds Herrera back.

3347~~~
His contract tuns till 2019. Imagine how he'll be then at 34. Will be a sight.

3348~~~
Wow!!  Rooney's map has 1 successful 'forward' pass (though it has a lot of blues) ...  That is really really dire.

3349~~~
He's holding everyone back. In last match he looks positionally very off, there were times him and Mata clashing trying to get into the same position. He leaves a very big hole in the middle, he offers nothing but acting like a lamp post with his sideways passing and back to whomever passing to him. It counts as a pass sure but in the grand scheme of things he's not needed there, his position would better be occupied by Herrera who overs alot going forward. Check the link above on his stats, there's really nothing in his game, no interception, not even one single successful forward pass.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i1197.photobucket.com/albums/aa424/AngelicRayment/2015-09-21_13-49-51.jpg" src="http://i1197.photobucket.com/albums/aa424/AngelicRayment/2015-09-21_13-49-51.jpg"/> 

We're like playing with 10 men, and if that isn't holding the team back I don't know which is.

3350~~~
Wasn't Rooney playing at 10 with Martial at 9?... Anyway, this thread is a bit of an icon at the moment. Roll onto the next game.

3351~~~
Not a single pass into the box. Jesus

3352~~~
I fully agree with you.  My only point to your post was that, playing him at no. 10 doesn't really hold Martial back (as much as it does Herrera).  Rooney is playing at no. 10 to accommodate Martial.  If he played at no. 9, then it would hold Martial back.

3353~~~
er.. having no service from Number 10 is holding Martial back, he won't perform as good as if we had a proper #10. We know how impatient the fans could be at times, lucky he made his own goal or it would have been "Martial's shit, Rooney back on 9"

Scoring on your debut could have a big domino effect on how he performs, the effect of having a goal to your name and being relaxed is underrated sometimes.

3354~~~
#10 is the most important attacking position on the pitch and supposed to be the creative conduit that holds and distributes for the entire attack. Rooney, as the #10, is supposed to be Martial's supplier with a constant stream of forward passes that probe and penetrate. He's also supposed to link up with his #9 more than any other player in short passing chains back and forth.

Rooney isn't offering anything as a #10 and if that continues, he'll actually stifle Martial's development and give him little chance to learn how to make runs away from the play and fine tune his game, or make runs at all in expectation or instinct his #10 will find, or even attempt to put him in.

Rooney is going to prevent Herrera getting on the pitch, which is a big problem for us and the Spaniard, but first and foremost he is going to stifle our entire attack and especially Martial if this level of play persists. 

People say his legs have gone and so too his strength, but that shouldn't prevent him from passing the ball forward or attempting to at the very least. I'm more disappointed with this aspect of his play because even if he doesn't score many, to keep his place in the team he has to supply for others and he isn't even trying to do that, which really is concerning.

3355~~~
I was starting to believe people who said he don't get enough service to score goal early in this season but when you see what Martial has done in this last matches, not only creating chances for himself but also for others there is no excuses left for Wayne.

3356~~~
I think Martial's issue now will be to live up to the hype around him.  He has had an immense start to his career here.  Teams will now be aware of his threat and play him accordingly.  That's the bit where Januzaj failed over the last 18 months.   

Anyway - back to the topic.  Unless LVG benches Rooney (which should be very close given his performances, and the 'discussion' on Sunday) and plays Herrera, I'd rather Rooney plays at 10 than at 9.

3357~~~
He's looking as average as van Persie did last season, which is not encouraging. Martial is clearly the better centre forward.

3358~~~
Fair enough.  But you are assuming Rooney gets benched - I am assuming that he wont.  Not yet.  LVG loves Rooney for some reason (which is beyond me).  In an ideal situation, I'd have Rooney gone from the club altogether (instead of being dropped), but that is not happening anytime soon.

3359~~~
It's true isn't it? When Rooney got his chances up front last season it was the same story, with the added evidence that Falcao and Van Persie weren't getting chances either. I was always skeptical of this opinion because people like Herrera and Mata regularly ended up in scoring positions. 

The signing of Martial has instantly put those excuses to bed. A player who isn't afraid to run at the opposition defence, take players on and run in behind. If nothing else it stretches the opposition defence and creates room for others to play into.

3360~~~
A bit sad Herrera won't play cause of this guy.

3361~~~
His friends in the media can't protect him forever.

3362~~~
I'm not. He'll be given the longest amount of time to play himself into the team, perhaps rightfully so given this can't be his actual level - I refuse to believe this is the best he can offer.

But there's one thing being detrimental to himself and then there's another when the lack of ambition in his play is holding the rest of the team back.

A #9 can be more selfish and insular and only really concern themselves with getting goals if they want to, but a #10 has the weight of the teams' creative load resting on his shoulders and other players waiting on him to <i>do something</i> so they in turn can do their thing, and it won't be long before Rooney's bad play hinders somebody elses game and that's another level of problem than Rooney playing poorly and us still winning games because of moments of individual magic or fortuitous back passes from opposing centre-backs that put us through on goal.

3363~~~
I think he's burned out, he's been playing every week since he was 16 and the media was all over him. That has to take it's toll, both physically and mentally.

3364~~~
i think you are right. But if that is the case, how come no one at the club saw it and gave him such a ridiculous contract? He's impossible to move on imo.What's worse is that he know it.

3365~~~
If city come in for him next summer, who here would consider it?

3366~~~
Why on Earth would City come in for him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3367~~~
spite

3368~~~
He really has become quite fecking shite hasn't he. If we're going to do anything title wise we are going to need him to step it up. Otherwise hopefully he breaks the scoring records this year and leaves in the summer.

3369~~~
Someone I was watching the game with yesterday blamed Rooney's crapness on the fact he has taken to wearing a long sleeve compression top, in every game, no matter how hot it is.

He went on to predict that once the weather gets cold Rooney will improve and he'll be 'dominating games' come January.

3370~~~
We should (won't) bench him for a few games, then give him some sub appearances and see if he picks up a bit. He doesn't seem to be trying to me and it might be because he seems to be guaranteed a place regardless of how terribly he plays football. If that has no effect on his form then it's time to sell up. Offer him to Everton in a Stones deal perhaps.

3371~~~
You probably never experienced Paul Gascoigne. The England Legend!!

3372~~~
I may agree with the bold part but the rest is crap. No one can have his record especially at a time when England arent as brilliant as they used to be and be considered the most overrated player in England's history. Id give him this season and allow him to leave next year if things doesn't improve

3373~~~
Yes.. I've said it probably a few times too many but: Moyes really fecked us by giving him that 5 year contract. Ferguson saw Rooney's decline coming and played it right into the hands of Moyes, but The Dour One didn't have the balls to finish the move.

3374~~~
Herrera should start instead of Rooney. Would inject energy and much needed fluidity and creativity in the final third. Rooney looks completely shot both physically and technically.

3375~~~
Not that I feel a duty to defend Moyes, but what was he supposed to do? We didn't seem capable of attracting any players at all at the time. Fecking hell, we had to pay £37m(<b>!!!) </b>for a Chelsea reject (that's what Mata was, no matter how good he's been for us), and we could barely land Fellaini. Should he chuck his main attacker? His relationship with RvP was obviously not good.

3376~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He was as red as a beetroot in the huddle after Martial scored.

3377~~~
So difficult to say if he gets benched or not by LVG. On current form, he can be happy to even be on the bench. He's one big reason we look so poor and for him to play 90mins is not understandable.

3378~~~
Maybe he needs to go on the wing next?! Relieve those 2008 glory days..

3379~~~
Surely he's way too sluggish to play on the wings now?

3380~~~
Rooney is now at the Falcao stage where he is that bad, even the slightest showing of encouragement gets well overblown.

He was crap yesterday, no sugar coating it. He has to go at the end of the season if this continues, we cannot carry him as a passenger any longer. Herrera must be sat on the bench thinking 'Jesus Christ, i'm here on the bench while this pub player Rooney is untouchable'

3381~~~
Well I'm running out of places to put him...

3382~~~
The MEN gave Rooney a 5 rating, not even that good. The Express gave him 7, SEVEN, how did they come to that conclusion?

3383~~~
MEN gave Rooney and Mata the same rating.

3384~~~
David Moyes.

3385~~~
That beggars belief as well. Mata wasn't perfect but still made a big contribution. Rooney did nothing at all, in fact he was at times a hindrance. Maybethe MEN won't go lower than 5, but they got Mata wrong. The Express, obviously Rooney is their darling and can do nothing wrong.

3386~~~
Offer him a new deal but not one that pays out close to a £1m month until he's 34. Woody screwed up as well for agreeing to go long with it. LVG making him captain didn't help either but in his defence he didn't have many players to pick from at the time.

3387~~~
He said he would not drop his captain, then take the captaincy off him. Sorted.

3388~~~
Rooney didnt even make his usual no of mistakes because he did not try anything at all <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3389~~~
Because he's not the constructive player a no.10 needs to be. He's supposed to be able to create opportunities for the striker.

3390~~~
Drop him to bench if that helps,he's doesn't show same level of passion he had.

3391~~~
I am stating the bleeding obvious here but his days are numbered especially with Memphis and Martial already looking for each other  as first options for passes

3392~~~
He gets an easy ride from the British Press/media these days. Captain Fantastic.

3393~~~
So where are the people who were crowing about LVG's system being at fault for Rewnay!'s toothless displays? ''In this system Messi/Ronaldo/Aguero/Suarez would struggle to perform'' indeed. Enter a 19 year old kid who can actually run and control a ball and he flourishes.

3394~~~
The MEN rating of 5 was probably generous, but to give Mata the same was ridiculous. However the Express giving him 7 was beyond ridiculous.

3395~~~
He needs to be dropped/moved on ASAP before he tarnishes his United legacy completely. Although he's the best silent dominator out there, there is still not room for such a player in LvG's philosophy.

3396~~~
He will never be dropped by van Gaal. If we could have Fergie back for 3 days he'd release him from his contract, in fact he'd have left in 2013 100% if it weren't for Ferguson retiring and Moyes being terrified of losing Rooney (of course Moyes fans at the time gave him incredible amount of credit for tying Rooney down for the next 25 years).

3397~~~
Why?

3398~~~
Because if it were to happen, it would have by now. It's not the first time Rooney plays poorly, besides the praise he's got from van Gaal is quite high (top 5 players he's ever worked with, the best captain etc.). I think he's the only undroppable element in our team.

3399~~~
I still cant believe, with the euros around the corner and the chance to be Man Utd all time top scorer in sight, he isnt trying hard to be better. When it was 3-1 and Southampton were pretty much done, Rooney barely tried to do anything. When Messi/Ronaldo are in these kind of games, that's when they rack up goals. Rooney was happy to see the game out and go through another game without a goal. Mentality is a big thing in sports.

3400~~~
Martial had two chances all game. One was a pass from a defender, the other was a lucky break of the ball from a defender tackling a clearly offside Juan Mata.

Right now Martial's doing a great job of showing RvP/Falcao/Rooney how to be clinical in front of goal but for all that he's been direct and exciting to watch his addition to our team hasn't made us any more creative as a team, despite the relative goal glut of the last two games. Schweinsteiger playing his way into fitness and Depay's occasional moment of brilliance will hopefully move things in the right direction but we're still not creating nearly as many chances per game as we should be if we're going to have a good season. Martial hasn't changed this at all, unfortunately.

3401~~~
Why do you think Van Gaal rates him so highly?

3402~~~
To be fair so many people are on his back right now, imagine back then if he sold him to Chelsea (because that was the most likely destination). He'd be stoned by the people of Caf and Manchester.

3403~~~
No idea. Van Gaal during his career has made a number of completely baffling choices.

I think van Gaal might be you actually.

3404~~~
Well he took them both, very much doubt the same would have gone for Rooney. He also created a goal for himself against Liverpool in a manner that Rooney hasn't done in a long time. The pace of our attack with Martial is significantly different than with Rooney.

3405~~~
A pity you stopped reading after the bit in bold...

3406~~~
In current form, it's anyone's guess. The only footballing reason I can think of why Rooney is still in the team is to play him into form, somehow.

3407~~~
I don't often agree with Carragher but he was spot on in his summary on Sunday.  Rooney has been given a lot of chances in a lot of positions / formations.  Its about time the finger was pointed at him for not doing enough rather than the system not working / wrong position etc etc.  Martial has fed off scraps and got 3 goals.  Players make positions and systems and unfortunately, at the minute Rooney isn't the best player in any position on the field.

Souness also made a valid point about the fire having gone.  Countless times yesterday a United player (usually Memphis or mata) actually ran passed rooney to press the opposition.

He was soooo poor yesterday that it was only when Mata came in from the right that we started getting on the ball and dictating play.  Until then Carrick / Schniderlin's only pass on was the full backs as Rooney was hiding.

He's got a big few games ahead of him.

Those saying LVG wont drop him is nonsense.  He likes his captain to play, obviously.  However, he's "sacked" and dropped captains mid season before and I cant see him being overley bothered about doing it again.

I'll give him Sunday's performance as he may still be feeling the injury but if he performs the same on Saturday, he should only get an hour.  It wouldn't do him any harm playing 90 minutes on Wednesday!

3408~~~
I found myself agreeing with Carragher yesterday as well. He seemed to be the only one bringing up the fact Rooney has to improve. We can't keep blaming the system.

We can talk about needing to find the right system, or the right position for Rooney to flourish but if he's going to be as awful as he has been for the last 6 months or so it doesn't matter what tactics we use.

3409~~~
a penalty in the carling cup on Wednesday should keep the wolf from the door

3410~~~
It's a strange position we're in, Rooney breaking the England goalscoring record and subsequently (and continually) being well below average in the PL. David Moyes made a rod for all our backs in giving Rooney the new contract when Fergie had clearly saw the writing on the wall. LVG utilises said rod in constantly whipping us with it in naming Rooney on his teamsheet (and arguably more irritatingly, keeping him on for the full 90!). 
Media don't want to look stupid in calling him out as his records will stand the test of time even if these abysmal performances wont. 
Our biggest obstacle is LVG's stubborn arrogance and his 'undroppable' captain. The sooner he sees Rooney's current form is detrimental to the team, the better. Who knows, a spell on the bench may reinvigorate Rooney, get the hunger back. Either way, his current form needs to be addressed.

3411~~~
Wow.

3412~~~
I think the stat about him playing only one forward pass all game really should be a talking point. Even an all out defensive midfielder would be doing poorly with that, for a #10, who should be making more forward passes than anyone else in the team, it's a really, really shocking statistic, if it's true.

3413~~~
I think stubbornness more than anything else. When he first joined the club he pinned his team around Rooney; he gave him the captaincy, very early said he was one of the best players he's worked with and basically made the decision to build a team around him. The reason he pinned it around Rooney is obvious: he was the biggest name in the team and to someone who doesn't watch him every week he's been consistently one of the greatest players of our generation for the last decade. Even after 12 months of mediocrity pundits and "experts" are giving him 7/10 every week and blaming everyone but Rooney for his form.

People like Van Gaal do not accept they are wrong very easily, their ego is one of their biggest strengths but can also be a big weakness. Fergie did the same thing with Berbatov - after half a season it was abundantly clear that Tevez fit our team and system far better, but after spending over £30m and clearly seeing him as the final piece of the puzzle he backed Berbatov over all else. It took him 3.5 seasons to accept that his style was completely at odds with our team, despite most fans knowing it within 6 months.

My prediction is that by the end of this season he finally accepts that Rooney isn't what we need in the team. If Martial continues as he's started Van Gaal will have an easy get out in that Martial was such a great signing that he took his place in the team. However I'm not going to hold my breath, it could well take Van Gaal a similar period of time than it took Fergie with Berbatov and we'll have Rooney staggering around until his contract is up.

3414~~~
It's not.

He attempted 19 forward passes. Completing 14 of them. That's more forward passes than any other player in our front four.

You're also wrong about #10s making the most forward passes. They will always come from a deep-lying CM, who have much more targets in front of them. Either that or one of the defenders anyway.

3415~~~
Stat is complete bollocks, watching the game he definately completed a number of forward passes. His overrall performance wasn't great though

3416~~~
During other periods of goal-drought Rooney still looked like a quality player and had a lot of energy. For instance, he wasn't scoring goals in the first 1-2 months after he signed a new contract in 2010 but was quite good and created a lot of chances. 

Nowadays, he's incredibly sluggish and contributes nothing in terms of physical presence and creativity. He's turning into a parody of a star player. If he continues like that, LVG will drop him. Otherwise, he won't finish the season as United manager because Rooney's insipid performances will cost us points. Yesterday we were a bit lucky to win, only the individual brilliance of DDG and Martial saved us. We won't be that lucky in other games though...

3417~~~
Don't forget Depay...

3418~~~
there's no chance he will be in the team by end of his contract, he will be waddling around the pitch like a penguin

3419~~~
He might have done that but I would be surprised if he does so with Rooney after all the praise he has showered on him.

Back on topic about Rooney's performances, one bit of play from him basically summed him up. It was in the second half and we had just gone on a great fast counter attack with one and two touch passes nearly getting us to the Soton penalty box. The ball is passed to Rooney who has a simple pass down his left to Memphis and he screws that up so bad that the defender not only intercepted it, he did so barely moving. Apart from this, the numerous times he tried to play a pass or flick it just went awry.

Right now he is more a mill around the neck than a captain we need.

3420~~~
What <i>does</i> Wayne Rooney actually have to do in order to get dropped???  Are we just going to continue rotating him around different positions to mask the fact that he is simply no longer good enough at this level?

3421~~~
It seems so...

3422~~~
I've yet to re-watch the game. Will be interesting to see how much my view changes, or not, with regards to Rooney's performance.

In the real time live game, all I remember is him playing it square time and time again and never trying anything creative or forward-thinking.

By the way, do lofted crossfield passes that go on a slight diagonal count as forward passes in these statistical analyses?

3423~~~
Probably yes

3424~~~
technically its forward I guess. But that pass of his is becoming a parody of itself, its embarrassingly predictable

3425~~~
If that's the case, it would be interesting to know how many "genuine" forward passes he made in the game with those discounted.

3426~~~
I've always been one of Rooney's biggest supporters, but he has been poor this season. 

He looks like half the player he was even a few years ago. I hope he finds his feet again.

Forward passes:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i1197.photobucket.com/albums/aa424/AngelicRayment/2015-09-21_13-49-51.jpg" src="http://i1197.photobucket.com/albums/aa424/AngelicRayment/2015-09-21_13-49-51.jpg"/>

Come on, I know you love him but we don't really need to go to the extremes. These are not genuine forward passes, it's sideways passes.

3428~~~
Especially when there's so much more on for someone who has hit plenty of good forward passes in his career. It's quite infuriating when he does it and then just jogs off upfield. It's his job to progress the ball in that position, not just spray it wide.

3429~~~
I'm starting to think that it doesn't have much to to with hunger and motivation. He knows he's playing badly, and I think he's dying to score and play well for us again. 

Think he's just a bit burned out, his body has played a lot of football all these years. He'll have to change up his game a bit, because it doesn't look like his explosivity is coming back.

3430~~~
But that's about as meaningful as pointing out defenders who make nothing but 5 yard passes have ridiculously high pass percentage rates.

I should have said creative, or probing, forward passes to remove all doubt as to my inference.

3431~~~
What are you on about now? I'm not inventing statistics, just sharing them. The only "extreme" was the fictitious idea  he only made one forward pass.

3432~~~
Yes you should. That would have been less melodramatic though, right?

3433~~~
Judging by that, it's 2 or 3 forward passes realistically and 0 shots attempted?

3434~~~
There's actually no better time to drop him and let him have a few games off. We've two relatively simple fixtures coming up and then Wolfsburg. I don't think Rooney should start a single game, and should be given 20-30 minutes in each of the three.

3435~~~
Do you think there's any melodrama, Pogue?

Or are you saying the #10 in any team shouldn't be the most probing player in the side?

3436~~~
I'm amazed LvG continually plays him and I do wonder what is Rooney doing in training to be constantly given chance after chance. Herrera makes one bad pass and he's dropped for a few games, yet Rooney plays like garbage constantly and is always given 90 minutes. 

It would be better for Rooney IMO if he is dropped! It may just be the kick up the arse he needs.

3437~~~
There was nothing wrong with the claim that he didn't pass the ball forward yet you had to tackle that with some statistics that don't really prove otherwise when you look at them in detail. Has there ever been a time when you actually admitted Rooney was crap without trying to justify him?

You probably even have an argument for Martial scoring more away goals than Rooney this calendar year, international goals or whatever.

3438~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3439~~~
but he supposedly needs 2,3,4 games to get back to full fitness. So we are told

3440~~~
"Forward passes"

3441~~~
Implying he only attempted a single forwards pass in 90 minutes is melodramatic, yes.

I agree the number 10 should be taking the most risks in terms of their passing but the whole team is extremely risk averse under Van Gaal. Have a look at Herrera's passing graphic against Liverpool. It looks almost exactly the same. For whatever reason, every outfield player in the squad seems unwilling/unable to make progressive passes in the final third.

I suspect Van Gaal is happy with this and Rooney and Herrera were adhering to the game plan. Whether we - as fans - like it or not.

3442~~~
No, he attempted 3 and misplaced 2 of them. Sideways passes at 1 degree angle are not forward passes.

3443~~~
I don't know if he isn't fully fit, however, the treatment he's receiving is astonishing. What sort of standards are we setting by constantly giving him a free ride? Players such as Herrera, Fellaini, and Young haven't been anywhere near as bad as him, yet none are allowed to start a consistent number of games. Then we have youngsters like Wilson, Pereira and Lingard who could probably do a better job.

3444~~~
Yes. At least twice this season already. 

lol

3445~~~
It's very unfair on the rest of the squad that he gets these privileges of keeping his spot. I was just imagining if Herrera, Fellaini, Young or anyone had put in that kind of performance, they probably would have been off at HT.

3446~~~
Herrera would never be allowed at training ground after some of Rooney performances.

3447~~~
if you take a step back you can see this is a new team that is ready to move on without him. He gets moved around the side to shoehorn him in somewhere but doesn't really justify it. There was no international tournament in the summer so was well rested for this start, the league seems to really have caught up with him

3448~~~
I didn't imply it. It was mentioned a number of times in the thread and I ended my post with: 'if it's true'. 

Besides which, from that graphic, it's not far off the truth, so I'm not sure how it could be considered melodramatic.

The goalscoring burden was on Rooney at #9, but now he's dropped into the #10, the onus is on him, more than anyone else, to get the team ticking and moving progressively upfield, it's then a real concern when he's not willing to <i>even attempt</i> to do that.

I'd rather him have passes forward not come off than see him not try them at all. LVG is conservative and pragmatic, but if there's any one player he'll give creative licence to, it's his #10.

3449~~~
But they are just like What Scholes used to do those passes! Im being sarcastic off course, the guy needs to buck up his ideas.

Not so sure, Basti has played a number of chance creating passes that Rooney has yet to play for us this season. Think of the pass to Mata vs PSV or Memphis yesterday. Where are Rooneys passes like that?

3450~~~
There is a simple explanation why LVG plays Rooney despite his poor form. It is not because Rooney is valuable to the team even when he puts in mediocre performances. And it is not because he expects Rooney to become world class again. LVG isn't that stupid. His motivation is related to the history of his failures at Barca and Bayern. When you look at the reasons behind his unsuccessful periods at those clubs, you see that he lost the plot in his relationship with the team. He is a smart guy and has understood his mistake. In order to avoid such a development at United, he regards his relationship with Rooney as key to controlling the team and avoiding the bad scenario from Barca and Bayern. It's about politics. LvG doesn't want to get the sack again because of losing the plot in his relationship with the team.

3451~~~
In 50 minutes at St Mary's, <b>Anthony Martial</b> scored more away league goals than <b>Wayne Rooney </b>has managed since March 2014. He's played 1,753 fewer minutes.

3452~~~
We really need the crying emoji on this site. It's the only way to describe it.

3453~~~
His passing and touch was "good" because he played with his back against the goal the whole match and just played it right back to the back four nine times out of ten. If you play as a number 10, you are expected to be the architect who creates chances for your team mates, not just recycle the ball back to the CB's. It's pointless. 

Hes been getting a lot of abuse lately, and one might say people have an agenda against him, but most people (me included) are just feed up with seeing him delivering these kinds of lackluster performances, and still be guaranteed a starting spot. That's one thing, but what irks me the most is it seems he can't be arsed these days.

3454~~~
I don't think anyone at the club would really moan about it if Rooney is shown the door but yeah its not worth burning a bridge when the transfer window is closed and he won't have a place to go. One knock to Martial and we'll be depending on him once again.

3455~~~
Silent domination aint no joke bro...........

3456~~~
Rooney has been garbage this season apart from Brugge. Even the latter stage of last season he was the same. 
Its unfortunate for him but he is just not the player for club or country that he used to be and I doubt he ever will be again. I think a spell on the sidelines (Captain or not) could reignite his passion which seems to also be lacking though maybe not his talent but even a 50% Rooney of old is still a valuable player to bring on. At the moment he is at about 25% and maybe that is being generous. We really cannot afford to carry players and although Mata was pretty bad against PSV at 10 I would give him a start in his favored role against Sunderland and bring Young on to the right. I think we can batter them and bring on Wayne when Sunderland players are tiring maybe.

3457~~~
Even Falcao scored more for us away from home in that period..and he's shite.

3458~~~
And 2 great runs that ended with 2 free kicks from the edge of the box and more general good play.

3459~~~
Yeah, that doesn't take away from my point. Martial did great but the team still isn't creating enough.

3460~~~
But at least Martial is playing the game instead of just waiting to get the ball fed to him in the box.

3461~~~
I'm usually a defender of his but this run of form is unacceptable.  It's clear that it is quite difficult for forward players to shine in this system but his inadequacies can't be solely blamed on this.  What's most perplexing to me is that he seems terrified to receive the ball and turn towards the opposition goal anymore.  A lot of times yesterday he passed it back straight away without seeming to realise that there was a lot of space behind him that he could move into.  I don't know if this is fear of losing the ball or just him lacking confidence is his ability now.  I don't care if he gives the ball away or has the odd bad touch if he is willing to face the opposition and try to make things happen.  In fact if he had done this the 3 or 4 times it was possible for him yesterday I would have been at least encouraged that he was trying to do the things needed and trying to play with bravery again.  

I din't want to give up on him but he should be dropped for Herrera to give him a kick in the ass.  He could still be lethal behind Martial and Depay simply if he grows the balls to run into that space when the opportunity arises.  Although I must say I have had the same issue with Herrera at times when he has played the 10 role.  Maybe it is just instruction or a fear of losing the ball because Ander has also lost the willingness to turn and drive at the defence when the chance is there.  You can't tell me Rooney has lost the ability to run with a ball into clear space.  It's a conundrum to be honest and sadly it takes away from the abilities of Martial and Depay because they would thrive off of that bit more directness and it would put the opposition on the back foot much more too.

However anyone talking about him ruining his repuatation and legacy here is a fool.  The guy is a club legend regardless of what happens.  He gave us at least 10 years of being a huge part of our success and it's quite sad that some here seem to forget or downplay his importance in them times regardless of if he needs to be gotten rid of presently.

3462~~~
He doesn't even have the hunger to win back the ball anymore. Not sure what's up with him.

But at this present moment, i'm 100% certain that I have a better touch and movement than Rooney. For someone who is paid to play football, that is unacceptable.

3463~~~
Rooney, Rooney, wherefore art thou Rooney!
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xl_QlhtSGi4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
I had actually forgotten just how awesome he used to be.

3464~~~
I'm surprised no-one has mentioned his pathetic attempt to dispossess Fonte in the lead up to their first goal. It was a small factor in the scheme of things and doesn't mean he's directly culpable but it infuriated me. Between Rooney and Schneiderlin one of them should have easily closed the space and either tackled the defender or forced him to play it sideways or backwards, but neither of them even attempted to do so; 2 passes later we're 1-0 down.

3465~~~
If anything, Rooney would have scored more goals this season if he did more of that. His main problem as a striker has been coming back too deep to try and get on the ball earlier in the move. It was a problem at the weekend too.

3466~~~
shit that was really sad to watch, he isn't a shadow of that anymore <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3467~~~
He's been well below average for England too.
Those 2 goals he scored (to get the record) were penalties, created by somebody else.
Where Walcott scored 2, against San Marino, Rooney scored a penalty. I'm not sure when the last time it was that he scored from open play, for England. [perhaps somebody can look this up]
Recently, his only good game was against Brugge, who were a side decimated with injury. And the 'b' team which did show up, would probably struggle to play in the Championship, let alone in the EPL.

The issue isn't that he is crap today or for the last week. The issue is that he has been crap for a long time. Last year, it was said that he was crap because he was played out of position.

The other thing I noticed on SKY, post match analysis, is that the pundits refused to say anything negative about Rooney. The fact that he is our senior striker and can't score - this was never mentioned. The fact that our winger (Mata) and a 19 year old have outscored Rooney. The fact that Rooney had no shots on goal, made no assists, no key passes and created nothing. The fact that all our other attackers were attempting to score goals, except Rooney. The fact that Rooney made no contribution whatsoever. All this was never discussed.

I gave Falcao a very hard time last year. I stated that playing with him on the pitch was like playing with 10 men. I now believe that Rooney has taken Falcao's place as the non-scoring striker.

3468~~~
14th of June 2015, scored the winner against Slovenia in 3-2 Euro qualifier win. It was his 48th England goal.

Shown here (2:40)

3469~~~
It amazes me how some players are poor for 30-45mins and find themselves on the bench for weeks but Rooney is above being benched.

3470~~~
I was just going to say the same thing, it's hard to believe that's the same player we have now.

3471~~~
Damn I forgot about that. Fonte just surged straight through the middle, carrying the ball a good 40 yards without a player challenging him. I was screaming for Rooney to press him. 4 years ago, he would have stuck a foot in a took a yellow card rather than let a defender walk through his space.

3472~~~
Okay...so not too long ago.

3473~~~
Four years ago? He got sent off one year ago for doing more or less exactly that to Mark Noble. Which may well have been in his mind at that moment yesterday.

3474~~~
There is zero fire in him. He's coasting.

He doesn't even tackle anymore. I keep watching him close someone down, stick his leg out a bit, but there is zero conviction in his effort to actually tackle anyone.

I could not believe it when he had that clear shot right on the edge of the box and he passed it sideways. That is not Rooney. Two years ago he'd of done that annoying thing where he kept trying to chip the goal keeper from distance or simply had a crack at goal.

I want the lad that plays with an edge back. It's like watching a totally new player now with this mindset. Big mistake making him captain, that's made it worse.

3475~~~
I for one certainly took Rooney for granted during the Ronaldo era. Fantastic player that was clearly over-shadowed by Ronaldo, who was obviously a level above. Still, to have that Rooney again would be glorious.

I definitely find it sad how much he's deteriorated. Just seems his body has used all the gas.

3476~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

It's almost as if we have an imposter playing for us these days.

3477~~~
Watched that video a few weeks ago. Depressing watch. He was an unbelievable player.

3478~~~
You are right about our passing against Liverpool, particularly in the first half, but it should also be noted that Herrera had Fellaini ahead of him, not Martial. The best number 10s would struggle to be sliding passes down the side for Fellaini. His movement as a centre forward is shocking, and he has no pace to stretch whatsoever. 

Besides, I don't think it can be argued that Herrera doesn't or cannot consistently attempt and complete forward passes anyway, but yea, he didn't against Liverpool.

3479~~~
This is the point, top strikers can do that. Martial wasn't standing in the box waiting for his goal at Liverpool, but it's a goal Rooney wouldn'tbe able to score, as when he does drop back, he doesn't have that physical or technical quality to be a threat.

3480~~~
Mata has 14 shots in the premierleague to Rooney's 8. Mata doesn't even shoot regularly. What's wrong with this guy?

3481~~~
Because SAF and Gill had already left the club.. They would never have give him that huge contract.

3482~~~
Recently gone from resenting/despairing of rooney to kindof feeling sorry for him. He's played at the highest level for years now and he's simply burnt out. The amount of games hes played correlates to a mid thirties player nearing the end of their career. Couple that with a naturally stocky/unathletic physique and this was bound to happen. He's more or less delivered for us these last 10 years and, despite that for me he'll never be a proper united legend , I appreciate what he has done.

Time to move on, though. Fcking sharpish.

3483~~~
got carried away a little but he's crap for 4 years, getting praise for simple things

3484~~~
Anyone who still doubts just how far he's fallen really should watch this. He's simply unrecognizable from the great player he once was. 

I doubt he could still do 90% of the things in that video nowadays. His body just wont let him, he's absolutely shot. Just like Falcao and Torres before that. Its actually really sad to watch that video.

3485~~~
Why i came in this thread... that video <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3486~~~
On a more positive note, at least he is able to turn with the ball more effectively...

3487~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LtwiGBn1BQw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Remembr thinking after this game this was a guaranteed Ballon d'or winner.

3488~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 
That seems so long way back now.

3489~~~
Don't forget he started playing regular football at the age of 16. He'll be 30 soon, so that's 14 years playing top flight football!!
Considering most players don't become regulars till they're 22/23, add 14 to that and you get 36. A lot of players would be past it at 36! So yeh, one way of looking at it is that after 14 years of playing football, he's completely shot!

3490~~~
But Sam, does anyone even do that in this system? Does Memphis/Young? Did Di Maria and Falcao last year?... Herrera has it in his locker but even he doesn't. Januzaj even put on the gimp mask and was eventually moved on. We simply don't play like that anymore.

This is all I have, last year. Not at the same levels in that compilation but still, not to shabby a run and finish. More sophisticated to go with our current style I guess?
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iGrojLsJ4VU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3491~~~
He was once my favourite United player. That Rooney is long gone. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3492~~~
I still think Rooney has glimpses of that early magic, but I think his age/genetics have caught up with him.

I don't think he has the longevity of Ronaldo, who is a genetic/physical beast. Ronnie is an athlete, whereas Rooney, if he wasn't training daily would likely be about 16/17 stone. These are his genetics:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://news.7msport.com/news/upload_img/20121109/rooney-family-walk_1616255a_2012110909260440.jpg" src="http://news.7msport.com/news/upload_img/20121109/rooney-family-walk_1616255a_2012110909260440.jpg"/>

He is still a very good player, but let's not kid ourselves he is still able to do the things he was doing 12-14 years ago.

Rooney is underrated by too many United fans, but I think his game needs to evolve, like Giggs had to. I don't think he's got 25-30 goals a season in him, but he's still got a great eye for a pass and could probably do a job in a deeper role and let Martial / Memphis do the running.

3493~~~
But he had 19 forward passes and was amazing!!!!!!!!!

3494~~~
Honestly, I am a segregated commodity but I think it is just the caf that doesn't rate him. Or that is to say, pours out whirling torrents of abuse at every possible chance. That part is generally weird. A lot of fans I've ever met in my travels in Australia respect him as a player, even most neutrals.

3495~~~
Go on other forums. Search Rooney on Twitter.

3496~~~
No thanks, don't care.

3497~~~
I don't even see the torrent of abuse here. Just people saying he should not be starting and he's in decline. How is that abuse?

3498~~~
Yep, I agree. I was shocked when I watched it, as his mediocre performances of late have made me forget what Rooney was for us.

3499~~~
You rate him this season?

3500~~~
Nice video. And some say he isnt a United legend.

3501~~~
Um, 6.9. Hmmm, that seems a bit high maybe? He's been average, not awful and not on the better side of good/great.

Things like "offers nothing", "legs gone", "can't trap a ball ever", "can't pass", "past it", "one of the worst United legends to exist and will be a travesty if he is top scorer" etc etc.

Not buying it. I don't really care what happens, I hope for the team's sake he comes good but if he doesn't I will still sleep at night knowing I watched one of our best ever and most talented players from dawn until dusk. I won't be afraid to admit it as well.

3502~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3503~~~
6.9 is ludicrously high for Rooney given his awful performances. You have him above your team average and only 0.2 behind your highest rated player. He's had one good game and 6 bad ones.

3504~~~
How the hell have you come up with 6.9? Probably a 10 against Brugge and some other 7s or 8s. Or you give him a 7 even for Southampton game.

3505~~~
I think he's a big fan <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3506~~~
I don't think that gives Ronaldo the credit he deserves. You can tell he spends a lot of time in the gym and on his physique and I believe he doesn't drink alcohol. You can tell Rooney is more from the Ricky Hatton school of fitness.

3507~~~
Thing with the Rooney lovers camp is that they often struggle to admit even his worst performances were in any way bad. 'Works hard', 'pass completion', 'forward passes' and crap like this always appears even after the most horrid performances. There are few of them but those that belong to the group cannot see any fault with him.

3508~~~
My base starts at 7 as an average. That is probably why.

3509~~~
What's your average for Mata, Herrera, Depay and Schweinsteiger?

3510~~~
My rating is 4.3 this season. 6.9? Wow.

3511~~~
Denial. That and the need for forums to separate any conversation into 2 tribes with warring opinions, only one of whom being right. It makes people cling to their opinion and demolishes any nuances.

3512~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/vajn" width="560"></iframe>

I thought this was pretty interesting, this kinda sums up how he's been playing. Looks nervous or rattled or something.

3513~~~
My rating is 3.9.. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>
My team average is only 5.6. Hence not a bad score I think <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3514~~~
6.9 is higher than any player I've rated bar Martial, Smalling and Shaw. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Wow.

Always get the excuse that he did nothing wrong. That's usually because he actually didn't do anything.

3515~~~
Think he just knew it was a must win game against decent opponents. He's faced criticism most of his career. Can't imagine him being rattled.

3516~~~
well, I haven't rated the team for a couple of matches, so there is a good chance my rating for him would be around that mark. He would get 4 off me for the last match.

3517~~~
Only Shaw and Smalling (and Martial) have over 6.9 in my ratings.

Rooney is on 5.4 for me.

3518~~~
I've got him at 4.1 so far.

If it wasn't for the Brugge game, he'd have an even lower rating.

3519~~~
Yeah true, or in the zone or something. Intensely focused. Seems an intense guy, kinda feels like he's playing on edge or something.

3520~~~
Just look at one of his newest compilation, he has changed his game completely. Really weird, he doesn't seem to be playing to his strengths at all these days.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMIFo5LAz9Y?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3521~~~
5.8 from me.

I've mostly just given him 6s.

3522~~~
Thanks for the vid, he was pretty good when fit in the Moyes season.

3523~~~
From what I've read, Ronaldo is an incredible trainer and lives a "clean" life (i.e. no booze / cigs). I do think that he's also "genetically gifted" - Rooney is very different, and probably works harder than he is given credit for in terms of keeping trim etc.

I just think years and years of playing at a top level will take its toll quicker on Rooney, and we're starting to see the inevitable decline a few years earlier than we will with Ronaldo, who either due to genetics or sheer attitude/work rate has retained that level of explosiveness and will likely continue to do so into his early/mid thirties.

3524~~~
The sad part is how far he's regressed and the annoying part is that we'd probably win the league this season if we had that Rooney in the side. Was one hell of a player.

3525~~~
When a player starts to decline physically, he starts to change his game in order to use his brain more and rely less on his legs. Rooney hasn't done that sadly.

I think genetics are always an excuse (not by you in this post but in general) to justify one person's exceptional fitness.

3526~~~
There is definatley something in this.  He sees Rooney, Carrick and Smalling as the English / old united back bone.  Had Rooney been fit for the Liverpool game I am certain Schniderlin would have started but with Rooney out he wanted Carrick in there. 

Its sensible if it doesn't hinder us.  The problem being I think Herrera would press quicker and higher than Rooney, he's linked better with Memphis, Martial and definitely Mata.  His passing is far superior and dare I say it, but he is arguably more of a goal threat.

3527~~~
For too long people said it was just poor form, but maybe he has seriously declined. It's up to him to prove himself now but if he cant, he should become a bench player. We need good strikers especially now that we're short upfront and there is no way he's going to score 20 goals this season like this. Not even 10

3528~~~
Looks like he just remembered he left the stove on to me.

3529~~~
The last time he played consistently well was the first half of Moyes Season. That's more than just bad form.

3530~~~
For me he was the best outfield player last season overall. 

His game and his body have lost some of their youthful zip and he and van Gaal have to work out how he is going to adapt. He could do worse than work with Giggs who has been there and done that.

3531~~~
I didn't realise that getting fat meant your touch and desire went too. Stop giving him excuses guys, he just turned Torres on us. No one has a reason or excuse for Torres turning shite from 2010 on wards.

3532~~~
This is code for lets play him in midfield. United have just revamped the midfield in the space of 3 transfer windows after years of neglect. If United want to compete with the bigger clubs in Europe let alone the PL, playing a declining Rooney in his 30's in midfield should not be a option.

3533~~~
Sadly, this.

3534~~~
For me the most important business next summer must be selling Rooney.We won't progress back to the position of a top club with him playing every week and he isn't going to be backup with his wage and insistence to play every game.Used to be great for us but like other great players in the past, he'll have to move on someday.

3535~~~
Come on Rooney. Score 5 in 9 mins against Wolfsburg <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3536~~~
I assumed last year firmly put to bed any ideas on that experiment.

lets bench Basti, and let the white Pele do his ping to the wing

3537~~~
We have always debated what his best position is for most of his career. But for most of his career, the qualies he brought on the pitch demanded he had to be on the pitch. He was worth the hassle. I don't think he is now.

3538~~~
It used to be 'what role should Rooney play for the sake of the team'. Now it's almost 'what role should the team give Rooney for the sake of Rooney'.

3539~~~
It is a vicious cycle. He's playing bad as No.10 so he needs to go and play deeper. But considering that he would be shit as a midfielder, people will say that he is being sacrificed for the team and should always play as a No.9 cause he has 25-30 goals on him. Then he'll go and play as a striker but be shit, so people will say that he needs to play as No.10 cause that is his best position. Repeat!

Well, at least this has been the story of the last 2-3 years.

3540~~~
Sadly this is very close to the truth.

3541~~~
In short: he's finished.

3542~~~
That remains to be seen. He can probably still do a job. Be it as supporting crew to the young players, or even as a squad player.

But 'Rooney the superstar, one of the best in the world' hasn't been the case for a few seasons now.

3543~~~
Wayne is one of my all-time favorite United players. The pace, the ability but also the anger he played with in his younger years made him and Ronaldo one of my favorite duos in United history. With that being said, as much as I still want him to play and do well, it just hasn't been happening and it's frustrating to see really. Despite the troubles we've had with him over the years, he's been with us for a long time and you always want those players to fare well.

3544~~~
This thread is not getting any action tonight <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3545~~~
Scored against a team at his current level.

3546~~~
Not everybody has access to streams tonight.

3547~~~
Very good goal. Difficult to judge the team's whole performance due to stream issues, but still deserves credit for his goal. 

Unfortunately, he won't get it from many.

3548~~~
A great take down, good physical strength and tidy finish for the goal. My stream has been sh*t and intermittent so I can't offer much more of an opinion.

3549~~~
Shocked he managed to control it so well. Finished it nicely as well. Credit where credit is due.

3550~~~
Jesus.

3551~~~
Good to see he's scored again after Brugge. Can't help but notice all his goals are against shite opposition but hopefully it spurs him to perform much better in the real games.

3552~~~
I was impressed. Showed some of the old power under pressure from a couple of defenders. A nicely taken chance.

3553~~~
Took his goal very well but his overall performance was no better than what we've seen from him all season.

3554~~~
6 goals and an assist in 10 games for club and country this season.

Or 6 goals in his last 6 games, if you like.

Good as ever, the boy:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnUNYsDhFa7QHkM0xPLX2QzrC7emofpJrZnh-K7TD_naRmUvd8tLCjoQ" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnUNYsDhFa7QHkM0xPLX2QzrC7emofpJrZnh-K7TD_naRmUvd8tLCjoQ"/>

3555~~~
Super finish tonight. Great strength, great touch and great composure. Nicely done.

3556~~~
Good game. I am happy.

3557~~~
This.

3558~~~
I thought he held it up well.

3559~~~
Good goal but its a Championship side, he'll get proper praise when he strings a decent run together in the League.

3560~~~
yeah agreed

3561~~~
Difficult skill to bring down the ball and immediately hold off the defender. Hopefully he will trust his left foot more now. Needs to improve on his premier league performances.

3562~~~
took the goal well, a couple of nice lay offs and nice crossfield pass. He deserves credit today

3563~~~
Perfectly put.

3564~~~
He is a striker and he scored a decent goal against decent opponents*, during open play. I have no complaints.
This should do his confidence good.
If he can score 1 goal every 2 games, he'll have done well.
Now lets hope he can score a goal in the EPL.

<i>*I realise that some of you are stating that this is a Championship side, but lets be honest guys, today's goal is against the highest level of opposition, whom he has scored against recently, in open play.
What I am not interested in is scoring from penalties (against San Marino) or against teams like Brugge (who would've struggled against a Conference side, due to their injuries, when he scored 3).</i>

3565~~~
Chuffed he scored. Now for Sunderland....

3566~~~
He isn't a part of our strongest 11 anymore.

We have better 10s, Martial looks to be a much better option, and the idea of him going into midfield or out wide is laughable.

3567~~~
It was a really good touch from Rooney, didn't expect that!

3568~~~
He took his goal very well, I said this after his hat trick against Club Brugge but I hope he can transfer this into the Premier League.

3569~~~
Was a good goal, but other than that I still thought he was one of our worst players.

3570~~~
I think he definitely answered his critics scoring against Ipswich in the Cap One Cup.

3571~~~
He took it well, really well in fact. Time will tell if he can can kick on or if he just got lucky with the touch this once and returns to playing like a drunken toddler on ice.

3572~~~
Good goal, wasn't sure he was still capable of that. Having missed the match, no idea how he was overall.

3573~~~
Nice goal.

3574~~~
4 in 8.  Not bad Wayne, not bad at all.

Just 2 behind Messi in 1 less game.

3575~~~
"A goal but he's still shit lads.."

3576~~~
Great goal, then spent the rest of the match looking crap. Looked a bit better when he dropped deep for a bit.

People thinking that was a good performance really are lowering their standards in order to not criticise him.

3577~~~
He seemed to cover ground more easily tonight.  Wonder how much he's been hindered by the injury.

3578~~~
Didn't get to see the match, but saw the highlights. Great run, great touch, good strength and a tidy finish. Now, it remains to see if he can do that in the league

3579~~~
Was a great finish regardless of the opposition, that has to be a good sign 

Thought his best work came deeper though and you have to say martial should be furthest forward on current form. Perhaps the move to midfield will happen a lot sooner than we all thought

3580~~~
A good goal against a 2nd string Championship side, and then anonymous for the rest of the match.  His performance was no better in this match than in any others this season.

3581~~~
Rooney will soon be uniteds top goal scorer of all time but to you lot his shit. Get a grip. He's having a bad patch but he still deserves some love. You guys have a short memory or you are too young to know what he's done for this club

3582~~~
He deserves the love he showed us when he wanted more money an questioned the clubs ambition or when he got angry and confused at being dropped when he wasn't playing well.

3583~~~
The classic "too young to know" argument doesn't really go with Rooney ffs.

3584~~~
Martin Keown says he has the RVP of last season feel about him and I agree.

3585~~~
I think Wayne played well last night. Took his goal well, but actually looked a footballer other than that too. He was able to control the ball and move it on in good time, and looked a bit freer in his movement. 

Rooney will likely never be good enough again to have any sort of real impact on the team I feel, but given he has to play, I'd certainly settle for him at least not being a hindrance. More performances last night, including the odd goal here and there will do. And if this is the start of some sort of revival, then we have a real chance, as Ai was optimistic already and that was without considering any meaningful contribution from him. If he can bring 15 league goals to the table as a 10 we are in business.

3586~~~
First time I've ever seen the Age Card being played when talking about a player yet to hit the thirties. Well done.

I do remember fondly what he's done for the club, though. I just want him out before he tarnishes his United legacy completely. Oh, and that he's really nowhere near good enough to be top dog anymore.

3587~~~
Yes he has that jaded vibe, but RVP wasn't as poor with the ball

3588~~~
United's current top scorer of all time is probably no good anymore either. You don't pick a player based on what he did 5 years ago.

3589~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

There's really no excuse for this slump that Rooney is in now, it's one thing that he's on a goalless streak (11 PL matches?) but his overall play have been below par for a long time - it's not just this season. He should be playing for his future at the club right now.

3590~~~
If we could get a top class season out of Rooney this year, I'd feel pretty good about our chances of winning some silverware and challenging for the title.

He's really critical for us, being our captain means he won't get dropped, so his form is vital. An in form Rooney also wins you games.

Come on Wayne!

3591~~~
I don't think it's clear what an 'in-form' Rooney actually looks like. Surely 'in form' is not referring to 3 or 4 years ago when he was a top player, otherwise you would be implying that the years that have followed just represent a spell of poor form, which would be ridiculous to classify such an extended period.

If you are referring to a more recent spell, I don't think anything has been good enough for a while to the extent that the whole caf would, d agree that this was the reference point of ' good form '. Sadly, I don't agree that an in form Rooney wins you games. That is just rhetoric, similar to 'Manchester United are always a better team with Rooney than without him'.

Today, an in form Rooney is simply not a liability. HI'm playing well is not him being a regular match winner for us, otherwise he simply hasn't played well for years. Him playing well now is him doing his bit and not letting his other teammates down, which is not guaranteed these days. That used to be his minimum. He'd at least work so hard that if nothing was coming off, at least he wasn't being carried. Now he can't get about the pitch in the same way, and cannot play with the same intensity as before. Games in which he is being  bypassed are more frequent, and his team, for my money, are playing around him as opposed to through him. Now, him playing well is actually not that good a player, again, unless we agree that he hasn't played well for years. I believe an average Rooney performance these days is a 4 out of 10, and a good one is a 6 or 7 at best. Nothing special anyway.

3592~~~
My mate hopped on my laptop and typed that post out aha so I disagree with the age thing he said. But I do agree that as long as we're still winning games we should keep playing him, so he can try get his form back up. We know what he's capable of and there's no reason why he can't get to some good form again.

3593~~~
I'll never understand the player over club mentality. Yes Rooney has done some great things for United and in turn the club has made him a multi millionaire, not just with what we pay him but with the platform to market his "brand" that the Manchester United name offers him. He wanted to leave when he thought he needed better players to play with or to get even more money out of the club, likewise the club now need better players than him if we want to start winning trophies again.

There is a reason, many of us think he's physically shot like RvP or Shevchenko, if that is the case he isn't going to be near the player he once was.

3594~~~
He scored,did his job, nothing else to see here..

3595~~~
What worries me is that we're clinging to see the Rooney of 4 years ago, there's no guarantee that a player can replicate what he did 4 years ago.

3596~~~
Open your eyes and watch the game. He IS playing shit and has been for awhile. There's no two ways about it. The standards have been dropped far more than the No Child Left Behind policy for Rooney.

3597~~~
Nice cover story <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3598~~~
Hahaha nah honest. He said fark these pricks all hate Rooney. So I told him to rip into them. So I guess it's partly my fault.

But seriously if we're winning games and we have an 'easy' game against Sunderland at home. Why not play him and let him try get he's form back. I doubt we will lose to Sunderland because of him

3599~~~
What I don't get is why people think we should "keep playing him" until his form returns. Why does any player deserve that sort of royal treatment?. At 1 stage Fergie thought it was because he couldn't stay fit, but now he looks fit but well off the mark whatever happens. The lack of speed wouldn't be such an issue if he could turn or take on a man, but he lacks any sort of basic dribbling skills that don't require power/pace. 

He is never going to be a midfield dictator and he hasn't got the legs anymore to play the box to box role, I really do feel he's got maybe this season and 1 more coming, then he will be sold.

3600~~~
Not winning i.e drawing 0-0 is a huge problem given the upcoming fixtures. Arsenal(a) Everton(a) City(h) I think he should play behind Martial. He looked ok vs Ipswitch but this is actually a must win game for us so if he isn't performing and its 0-0 he needs to come off.

3601~~~
Shouldn't feed a troll but screw it:

<ul>
<li><i>Rooney will soon be uniteds top goal scorer of all time but to you lot his shit. </i>- Well most of those goals he got when he actually played well. Nobody in here is suggested he wasn't a great footballer once upon a time.
</li>
<li><i>Get a grip. He's having a bad patch but he still deserves some love. - </i>Nah we're the sane ones in here. Bad patch? For 1-2 years? He's doing a Torres at this rate. Deserves love? He gets paid £250,000+ a week. He gets plenty of love.
</li>
<li><i>You guys have a short memory or you are too young to know what he's done for this club. - </i>Nope, I do not and I doubt most on here have short memories either. He's done his bit but plenty have done more and much more than Wayne Rooney for Manchester United. He will probably become our top goalscorer but he's no where near our best ever striker.</li>
</ul>

3602~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

On topic: Rooney's all round game is pretty gash these days and I don't understand the support to to keep playing him until he hits form. He hasn't had a good run of form for absolutely ages, I think it's past the time that we should be considering him a spent force. I can't speak for his impact on the pitch in terms of being captain (does his presence lift morale? are others inspired) but I can say that his impact on the ball is usually to cock things up.

3603~~~
1 in the carling cup against a championship team, 3 in a CL qualifier against a team thats not that good to begin with and decimated by injuries and no goals in the league.

Dont get me wrong, im delighted he scored against ipswich but looking at things so far this season not bad is far from true.

3604~~~
I'm a huge critic of Rooney. Highest paid player - but struggles to do well on the pitch...and all that.
HOWEVER, the role of a forward/striker is to create/score goals. That's it.
If he scores plenty of goals, but does nothing else, I'd be ecstatic. Against Ipswich, he did score a decent goal.

That goal was a step in the right direction - a week ago, he'd have struggled to do that, so hopefully, he can get 15 EPL goals this season.

3605~~~
Unless he scores lots of goals this year, I think he will be gone next Summer. Basically, he will get the Falcao, Hernandez, RVP treatment.

3606~~~
Well that's just not true is it? How can you score that many goals and still be said to have "done his bit". Stupid stuff like this should get called out

3607~~~
True he's been playing horribly. You'd be stupid to disagree with that but my point is, he obviously still has the talent and the football knowledge to have a positive impact on the team, you don't just completely lose that. And if we are winning games (which we are) then leave him on. Besides apart from Herrera we have no better players to play behind martial

3608~~~
Didn't Giggs go through a bit of a dodgy patch in his late 20s, with the criticism he attracted spawning the infamous 'Sack Fergie, sell Giggs' meme?

But then Giggs went on to be an important player for us for nearly another 10 years, albeit with reduced playing time.

The obvious difference, people will say, is that Rooney is no Giggs in a physical sense. And perhaps they are right.

But as with Giggs, this little bad patch doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean he's finished as a player who can contribute to a successful Manchester United for a few years yet.

Like Giggs and Scholes before him, a clever manager could find a way to maximise his combination of experience and talent - and yes, he has it in abundance -  so that his influence is a net positive one. On the pitch and off the pitch. We'll see, though.

It's possible he'll be shipped out at the end of the season, signalling the proper end of the Fergie era for me*, and the start of a bright new dawn . . .

(I thought it was interesting that, despite their well documented differences, Rooney recently <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11849721/Man-Utd-news-Wayne-Rooney-buries-hatchet-with-Sir-Alex-Ferguson.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described</a> Fergie as 'the greatest manager of all time'. I'm wondering if he's only just starting to realise how good he had it under Fergie, now that Fergie is gone).

I guess Martial and Memphis are the future now, and if they can go on to be as good as Rooney and Ronaldo, we're laughing. If they can go on to be better - as a partnership, and for Manchester United specifically - the sky is the f*cking limit.

3609~~~
So you're saying he hasn't done his bit?

You seem to be missing the point of most of the complaints. The goals he scored in the past are irrelevant. He simply doesn't play well enough any more and he doesn't score enough to justify being in the team. We are well past the point of just leaving him in the team until he finds form, it's gone on way too long. With your mindset we should still be playing Sir Bobby.

3610~~~
Have a feeling he'll bag a brace, tomorrow.

3611~~~
hope so. As much as I think he's done at our level and think he should be sold. Any goal return from him is welcome.

3612~~~
LVG still thinks he's on for 25 goals. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3613~~~
He's got 4 already. 25 isn't exactly outrageous.

3614~~~
Art Vandelay hahaha love the name

I was saying how demeaning the term "done his bit" is for a guy who is almost our top scorer of all time. And made huge contributions to many premierships, cups and a champions league. We're not well past that point of leaving him in the team because we are still leaving him in the team and we're still winning games. I just feel he deserves a bit more respect than his getting that's all. Mind you, LVG's style doesn't particularly suit Rooney either. I can't remember the last time Rooney had a proper crack from outside the box because he's being told to play the percentages every time he gets it.

3615~~~
Rooney was right about United needing better players.

Yes he went about it the wrong way and he was greedy but he was in fact the first person to acknowledge that our transfer policy was shite. 

For a scouser he's pretty observant.

3616~~~
I think he'll get close to the record this season. The last two seasons have seem major changes and our play has been poor at times. IF you are a striker, when do you make a run? We've seen halves of football with no ambition to attack teams. Martial allows us to stretch teams and that will help Depay and Rooney or whoevers playing.

I think Rooney is pretty unselfish. Forget the way at times he's played, how many shots per game (over a period of time) are we looking at? This is why the goals haven't been flowing but as LVG mentioned - you need luck. I can't remember if he was offside against Newcastle but when the chance arose, he finished it well.

Once the confidence rises, and the players start moving - which is happening at the minute then we'll see an improvement. We've players now spreading play and not just one but 2 or 3 players. So Rooney will find more space and I would expect him to focus more on scoring should the opportunity come about

Interestingly enough with a small squad, LVG now has an opportunity to rest Rooney now and then to protect him.

3617~~~
On a different wavelength to everyone else. Get him off. 


Cue him scoring before half time.

3618~~~
Been shocking so far this season, shocking.

3619~~~
BREAKING NEWS: Wayne Rooney in another counter intuitive and disappointing 45 minutes of Premier League football.

Again our best work comes from avoiding him in any phase of attacking play.

3620~~~
Its come to the stage where I wish his hamstring injury was more serious. He doesn't deserve to play at all

3621~~~
He's just playing too deep.

3622~~~
The inside out ball to Tony V is back! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3623~~~
Cattermole has kept him under wraps. He lacks the dynamism to receive the ball forward so he's always dropping deep.

3624~~~
He's absolutely hopeless. I don't care if he scores a tap in in the second half, it won't change my opinion.

It's like playing with 10.

3625~~~
He's completely past it.

3626~~~
What's sad is that he isn't even having one of his worst games this season, yet he is our worst attacking player by a mile(from the front 4).

3627~~~
So awful. Schweinsteiger on for Carrick and Herrera on for Rooney.

3628~~~
This half has been the most disappointing half I've seen from him this season. He actually looks lost. He's basically doing the simple stuff that Fellaini does well but anything beyond that is asking too much at this stage. Those two times where he ran at the defense were just plain said. He never threatened a shot like he used too. Just sloppy passing. First time that I'm worried that it's something more than simply poor form.

3629~~~
Drama Queen

3630~~~
He's only playing because he's captain. Martial is better option upfront. Herrera and even Fellaini at this point are better options at 10.

3631~~~
Pointless. He offers nothing.

One nice turn and run and that was it. That isn't good enough.

3632~~~
It's like he's playing for sunderland. I lost count on the number of times he gave the ball away.

3633~~~
Schweinsteiger on for Rooney would be a good move imo, though I don't think Rooney's been too bad so far.

3634~~~
I don't want to vent. But feck me, awful

3635~~~
he just can't play as 10, exactly what we lacked in the first half the link between midfield and attack, he just can't play the role, his touch and agility is dreadful so he tends to drop too deep where he's as ineffective as it gets, sub him off for herrera or pereira..

3636~~~
Pretty much. Same situation as Gerrard for Liverpool last season.

3637~~~
The one pass he's best at and its too the player who's crossing continually lets him/us down.

Rooney though really is not justifying his spot at all. I think the problem is worse with thr midfield pairing today. If Rooney was dropping of and playing the passes to Valencia and you had one of the midfielders going past Rooney it might be better. At the moment though Rooney is playing too average in arguably the key creative position in the team.

3638~~~
To be honest he's bound to not be at his best, he's playing out of position. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">Bite</span>

3639~~~
For every good touch and turn with the ball, there are 4 or 5 awful ones which lose possession. He did a couple of good things, especially when we broke on the counter, but it's just surrounded by awfulness. 

He looks the most impotent, unthreatening player on the pitch. Even when Valencia gets the ball, he looks more likely to do something with it than Rooney.

Would really love to see Herrera come on for him, and Schweinsteiger for Carrick. Schmidfield+Herrera is <span style="text-decoration: underline"><i>the</i></span> midfield.

3640~~~
Static as feck, always expects the pass to feet, never in space. 

Playing him is like playing with 10 men every game.

3641~~~
Done some good things but final product is missing.

3642~~~
Bullsit.
Edit FFS. You got me.

3643~~~
He looks too uninspired with everything he does. Bereft of power and pace that we're used to from Rooney. I don't think it's just poor form. He looks completely past it physically this season so far.

3644~~~
What surprises me is the sudden drop in performance. Its understandable for a player to be rusty but he seemed incredibly clueless at times. He had a lot more to offer last season.

3645~~~
I actually thought his touch and movement is starting to look a bit more like it should, he just needs to stop dropping so deep.

3646~~~
I actually thought he was playing better today,but eh high expectations are expected from the Captain

3647~~~
Hehehe...

3648~~~
Yay fat shit scores

3649~~~
Hope that fires him up.

3650~~~
ffs a tap-in worse than Ronaldo. Sell him to a championship club <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

Kai Rooney <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3654~~~
That's right up there with the one he scored many years ago against sunderland's bitter rivals.

Meh.... Knee-jerk.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3657~~~
Ha

3658~~~
Nice. He looks so relieved. Get that monkey off your back Wayne!

3659~~~
Hopefully this gets the monkey off his back and performances improve, but he's been poor today. Goal was all about Martial.

3660~~~
Get in there Roo

3661~~~
And he scores

3662~~~
Good god,  the commentary for a miss cross is bordering fellatio

3663~~~
The vision and ability to play that ball to Valencia<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3664~~~
Feel like a cnut after that first half, he's been running the show this second half.

3665~~~
Much better 2nd half but his Hollywood passes to Valencia getting tiresome, can he try something else?

3666~~~
Good performance in 2nd half. No. 10 roles suits him nicely and once he gets confidence back he can still be a very useful player.

3667~~~
Much better from wayne.  Credit where its due

3668~~~
Much better in the second half.

3669~~~
Very good from him in the second half, need to see it more often.

3670~~~
Much better 2nd half for sure. One can only hope the goal is the start of something.

3671~~~
Loved his runs with the ball in the 2nd half, his passing was good too. Well done

3672~~~
Looked much better 2nd half. That run he had late, I didn't think he was capable of that anymore. Hopefully he builds on this.

3673~~~
It's no surprise that the goal has helped him.

3674~~~
Good today, apart from the seemingly uncontrollable need to try that ball out to Valencia over and over and over I'm quite pleased.

3675~~~
Actually looked like Rooney during the 2nd half. Let's hope he kicks on from there.

3676~~~
Much better after the goal. Ran with the ball and got attacks going.

3677~~~
That brought back memories

3678~~~
He enjoys having his pal Valencia back on the pitch.

3679~~~
Showed glimpses of the Rooney of old today. That hunger.

3680~~~
Much better in the second half. That crossfield pass to Valencia tho.......

3681~~~
Best PL game from him in bloody ages. Nice one Wayne.

3682~~~
I swear every time he does it his pay should be docked by 25000 that week

3683~~~
Poor first half. Better second after that bundled goal.

Hopefully he kicks on from here. If he's stopping Herrera get in the team, lord knows we need him to. And everyone but Louis knows he needs to.

3684~~~
V good in the second half, look forward to more of this.

3685~~~
Yeah his best game so far this season

5 goals in all comes sounds good too, although it does hide his poor form in the pl

Really hope he kicks off from this, he can form a great partnership with martial

3686~~~
Looking much better in the #10 role behind Martial.

3687~~~
Much better 2nd half from him after an average 1st half. Hopefully he gets better.

3688~~~
First half was worst of Rooney.
Second half was Rooney of 6 years ago.

3689~~~
Good game today. I've noticed he holds himself back on making off the ball runs though since he's been a number 10. We break forward and he sits back like a central midfielder when he should be running forward as well and joining the attack. Maybe this is a tactical thing e.g. if a central midfielder goes forward, Rooney can't make a run forward so that we can prevent a counter?

3690~~~
Thought he was good today. Glad he got his goal. Controlled the game, especially in the second half. Why the feck doesn't he shoot from long distance anymore, though?

3691~~~
Good performance from him today. Huge relief from him visibly to finally get the goal. Hopefully he kicks on now, perfect time to get a goal as we go away to Arsenal next weekend and he's always great there.

3692~~~
He literally looked a different player after that goal. Hopefully he kicks on from now.

3693~~~
Good 2nd half.

3694~~~
Garbage in the first half. Really good in the second. Hopes this means he can regain some form, because we really need him to step up as the season progresses

3695~~~
I've noticed that too. Can't imagine he'd do it if we were losing, but I remember when we were winning 4 nil against Brugge and Herrera, who was playing 10 at the time, was bombing forward at every occasion, so I can't imagine it's a tactic.

3696~~~
Now that he's got the goal he better replicate his old form. Imagine if he goes on a goalless streak again <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3697~~~
Did his job, scored, stretched the play, and created chances. His overall play seems to be improving and improving every game.

3698~~~
I'm hip! When he went on that run and had a clear shot from distance, he decided to see if he can cut away from the defender..Needs to bring back that aspect of his game.

3699~~~
His best/close second best performance in 2015 in that second half. He thrives on having Valencia in the side.

3700~~~
Played a bit better after the goal but still erratic in good positions, needs to think beyond the ball to Valencia.

3701~~~
Very good second half. More of the same please

3702~~~
He was better but was given a shit load of space from a poor Sunderland side and all he wanted to do was pass diagonally to Valencia. Not excited by his performance as much as most seem to be.

3703~~~
Much better 2nd half. Still way below what he is capable of, but better than he's been so far in the league.

Performances aside, when you just look at the numbers, 5 goals in 9 games is pretty decent.

3704~~~
Much better second half, but I don't think you can read that much in to it as after the second Sunderland knew they were out of it. Real test will be if he can do it from the start of the next game/ Getting that goal is a big help though.

3705~~~
First league game of the season where he didn't look like complete shit. Still has a long way to go to get back to his old self but he seems to be on the up again after his long form crisis, I hope it continues.

3706~~~
As ever...he's the talisman. Take Rooney out of our squad and something disappears. Not sure what....but something does.

3707~~~
Extra weight?

3708~~~
oh come on. Look I'm a huge Rooney fan. The guy has given his whole professional life to this club which is bloody rare these days and has scored goals that have no doubt often won us the league. He's a winner, a grafter and always tries even when it's not working out. He's also a team player. Anyone that doesn't believe that is blind. I thought he played really well today...getting into the rhythm and finding the passes.

3709~~~
I don't really think we can make that case now. In the past yes that was definitely true. But I think an extended run of say Herrera in for Rooney, or young in for him and mata moving central and I think the team would do very well. I know people will point to the PSV game but the Shaw injury clearly had an impact on the team and as I said you need to give them a few games to gel.

Hypotheticals of course but I don't really see what it would lack that Rooney would bring in. As I said earlier Rooney had a good second half but he needs to do that in a game at the start of a game really and not when it's pretty much over.

3710~~~
I was joking <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3711~~~
I don't disagree that he hasn't produced the goods so far. But this is a team with a pretty big number of new young players. He knows united, knows what is required and LVG has made him the captain. He's not a bad player as well. I just think he brings more than his playing ability to the team at the moment, his experience, his experience of united, his experience of being under Fergie for all those years. He's the only player on the field that experienced that for the most time. I just think, at the moment it's bloody useful. But hey, I might be wrong.

3712~~~
Good to see him be better than shit.  I have been wishing for him to get better, and hopefully, this is a start at that.

3713~~~
fair enough....<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3714~~~
Rooney now has 5 goals in 9 appearances this season.  He has basically played well in 1.5 games.  How soon do you think the media will pick up on that and start calling him the fulcrum of our team - when he is anything but, at the moment.

3715~~~
Well I agree with what you say although I think those are qualities that he brings as part as being at the club rather than as part of the first 11 and I wouldn't say we should ship him out as there's no indication that he's a negative presence at all. 

I just think it's becoming harder to justify his role in the first 11. 2nd half he was good but in terms of the season as a whole he's been average at best and I would say out of our 4 main attackers he's the one who doesn't fit in as well in terms of how he wants to play. If he can find his form and play at least like he did in the second half then that would be great. If he goes back to in many ways slowing/inhibiting moves then I'd say that whilst his experience is great, performance is much more important.

In the case he was dropped and had to earn his way back in the team I would hope that he continued to be a good presence, as you say he has a lot to offer as a character. I'm not sure he would settle for that though.

3716~~~
Great game from him!

3717~~~
He's the best paid footballer in the country, he should be doing more than 'not being a negative presence'. I think he's finished.

3718~~~
If he idnt have Valencia, he would have looked wank again today, all in all was a much much improved performance, albeit against a very poor Sunderland team, and people saying Rooney has 5 goals in 9 games, 3 where against a Brugges team missing 6-7 of their first team players, along with being a very poor side anyway, and his other league goal was a deflection of Kyle Walker

So for 300k he hasnt justified himself for the last year and a half now

3719~~~
I thought he played well in the second half. Far too much of that awful diagonal out to Valencia, mind you. His willingness to carry the ball forward into free space was a welcome return.

3720~~~
No, your're right, I don't think he would to be honest. Even though he is what, 30? I don't know, I just feel in this huge transition, where LVG has signed so many new young talented players, who no doubt respect what Rooney has achieved, and lets be honest..he's achieved a lot at United, means that part of the transition involves Rooney. As a manager coming into this great institution of success, I would need someone like Rooney to instil the ethics of what he learnt through manager that was all about winning. Even if it meant I needed to put him into the team. However...I concede, that if it's not working, if he is detrimental to the team, then sure....perhaps it will be time to drop him. Although, I would imagine that would have a pretty negative effect on team morale because of his reaction. Kind of catch 22 if you like.

3721~~~
5 goals in 9 games, and 2 in the last 2.

Not bad Wayne, not bad at all.

3722~~~
In an ideal world he fights for his place in the team if dropped. I don't have anything against Rooney and would love to have Rooney playing great as I think a Rooney in form would add to the team both in terms of performance and in terms of his personality. At the moment I think others would bring more to the team although I'm hoping today is a turning point.

Tbh thinking about it if he did get dropped and told to earn his way back in he probably wouldn't throw his toys out to much. No one else in a top league is going to offer him close to what we pay him.

3723~~~
Really fecks up a lot of our attacks. What's most annoying about his performances is we have both Mata and Herrera who are excellent #10 players. 

Drop Rooney, Start BFS and make him captain.

3724~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He actually still gets praised for that after all the stuff with his contracts. Incredible.

3725~~~
hes no talisman anymore. He is a cog in the wheel now

3726~~~
Played a lot better today. Those runs he made is what we have come to expect off Rooney every single game, so I hope he can kick on from this and start putting in some great performances for us!

3727~~~
The balls out are really good, it's what happens next that's usually awful.

3728~~~
Amen.

3729~~~
Plays for free aswell

3730~~~
In case you have forgotten this is what Rooney playing well looks like:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hJ8rK7TWAK4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Anyone who thinks Rooney played good against Sunderland, please explain how what he showed today can be compared to that.

Rooney was at 6 out of 10 level this afternoon, max.

3731~~~
To be fair, that's a lot better than some of his recent offerings...

3732~~~
Better performance today. Still not where he should be but promising signs.

3733~~~
He was dogshite until the goal went in and then his touch and passing seemed to come back a bit, still not good though.

3734~~~
There's a hint of flat track bully here. Arsenal and Everton up next, let's see that hook shot Wayne.

3735~~~
I think they're good in moderation, but too often makes him too predictable.

3736~~~
Well, in the second half, he actually wanted the ball, his touch was good, his passing was decent and he was generally moving around well - with purpose and intent. It wasn't incredible or anything, but compared to what we've been seeing from Rooney in the league, it was a big step-up.

3737~~~
How many did he make today? I think I counted about 7 or so.

3738~~~
exactly, you can predict him teeing them up and they are hit and miss. Been doing them the day Scholes left the building

3739~~~
Yeah, can you imagine if we had someone like Bale on the end of those?

3740~~~
Much better today, although that says a lot more about his recent performances then it does todays.

3741~~~
Or one goal in six league games.

On a serious note, let's hope he kicks on from here.

3742~~~
Rooney has looked a shadow of his former self this season. Only time will tell if this is temporary or start of his gradual demise as a player capable of being a player to lead the line at United. Having watching him closely at Old Trafford this season he's lost his bite, energy and most importantly his famed enthusiasm.

3743~~~
Just like RVP and Falcao, his legs have gone.

3744~~~
518 appearances at senior level for England, Everton and United. That's 6 less than Andy Cole had in his entire career and Rooney has definitely started more games. Sheringham was around 33 when he hit 518. RVP has played about 50 less and Van Nistelrooy retired after 519. 

He's played a ton of football. A career's worth. I wouldn't be surprised if his legs have gone.

3745~~~
I actually thought he was great today - was at the game and made a point of watching him closely. I've been critical of him this season, but he was good today.

3746~~~
Motivation, form, fitness or ability?  One answer only.

3747~~~
Amazing what a ball hitting you and bouncing into the net can do. Actually resembled a premier league footballer again afterwards.

3748~~~
Absolutely. I've been banging this drum for a while, but I reckon his 'body age' is a lot older then his actual age. 

He's been playing top flight football since he was 16, and he's suffered a lot of injures along the way too. Those stats really do highlight <i>just </i>how much football he's played.

3749~~~
He looks burnt out, he has been playing in the PL since he is 16 and he is on a cushy untouchable contract which is not good for motivation, SAF seen that and wanted him out, here we are, it is poxy watching him, he does the occasional thing that staves off criticism like the hatrick against brugges and in fairness, that goal against Ipswich was class, but in reality he looks physically unable to do what he used to and to compound that, lacks the motivation to even attempt it.

3750~~~
I first said this about 4 years ago, that due to the amount of football he has played and his genetics I dont think he would age particularly well, but got shouted down, I freely admit I dont like the little tit but its obvious to anyone with eyes that he isnt going to blessed with the longevity of some other players.

3751~~~
Frustrated the heck out of me in the first half today but, definitely got better. Seems the pressure really has been on regarding not scoring in the league and looked to me almost in tears after his goal. Seriously hope that's really what has been a big reason for the below mediocre performances from him and he is ready to kick into high gear. With Martial's performances, opposition are really going to focus on him and that will hopefully open up things for Rooney on the attacking side and have less of what happened today like Cattermole trying to mark him out. 

Also, not really sure how the commentators on the US broadcast picked it up but, apparently after Martial setup Memphis for the one he should have scored, Rooney went to Martial to tell him how well he'd done. I know a lot don't like Rooney but, he is very respected by players and is making a very good captain. Just needs some more captain level performances.

3752~~~
He was very good today. A true captain's game. He is important to the players around him, example with regards to Martial.

He will be very imporatnt to us this season. Next month we have some really big games and we need him to be fit and in form.

3753~~~
Van Gaal needs to start rotating Rooney and Herrera.  At current form Herrera slightly nudges ahead and sitting on the bench might fire Rooney to a better performance.

3754~~~
Seriously?

3755~~~
I reckon it's burnout. Lifestyle and longevity catching up.

3756~~~
He was great in the 2nd half, good touches, great passes, created chances. More of this please.

3757~~~
I didn't really see how great he was in the 2nd half. He was OK in the 2nd half for me, shocking in the 1st. He hadn't a clue about the goal, it was all down to Marial.

It's not even the dropping deep thing that's his main problem. It's the lack of touch, the relentless dispossessions, and like most our team in the 1st half, his passing was bad. He's a slight upgrade on Fellaini these times, and that says it all, though he does have that long ball to Tony in him, which is often to no avail.

3758~~~
That goal gave him so much confidence, his all round play yesterday was so much better compared to what we've seen recently. He looked so much more confident and had that swagger about him back.

3759~~~
Been mulling his performance yesterday over a little and come to a rather simple conclusion. Maybe it was just a confidence thing? And the no goals in nearly 1000 minutes in the Premier League thing was really starting to mess with his head. So when he did score in minute 46, he felt and then played like a different man. 

I realise this theory can be disproved on Wednesday or next Sunday or whenever he next has a bad game. And you might say, why should the great Wayne Rooney suffer with such a mental block affecting his performance. But perhaps that explains his vastly different performances between the two halves.

3760~~~
If he plays 45 games this season, and maintains that ratio, he'll score 25. And that isn't bad.

3761~~~
He's not going to be old Rooney anymore unfortunately. You can tell in the way he easily get's muscled off the ball these days that he is physically declining. Hopefully he can tailor his game to compensate, although without that physicality he is losing a lot of what he was, just like Gerrard. I just hope he manages the transition better.

Still, his numbers look surprisingly good.

3762~~~
Looked like vintage Wayne Rooney yesterday; ran at defenders with the ball, was pinging it across the field, and made some some smart runs and passes.

Glad it to see it. That goal will do wonders for his confidence.

3763~~~
Its not even physical for me, he just isnt as sharp in his thinking. He makes some seriously lazy passes or decisions these days. Basically, I dont think Rooney can play with a level of control <b>he</b> thinks he can. Rooney isnt a Zlatan or Zidane/Pirlo type of players who can glide through a game effortlessly - His technique level isnt high enough. But he seems to think he can and that's a big issue.

We need him to be back firing if we are going to get close to the title. Id still move him on next summer regardless of how the season pans out.

3764~~~
I agree with your general point, in total (all competitions) he's already on 662 games which is an awful lot for a 29 year-old.

3765~~~
I don't think his body allows him to go back to his old days. I was a massive fan of that Rooney, but it took a lot of hard work and dedication for him to get there and it really put a strain on his body. Looking at the large amount of games he's played and it's easy to see why his body is breaking down. It's a shame, but you can't fault him. He's always worked hard to keep it in good shape.

3766~~~
He's not going to play many sides as poor as Brugge, let alone 45 of them

3767~~~
I hope he hits little purple patch now, going to need some goals in the coming 3/4 games.

3768~~~
Thought it was an average performance from him.But he took his goal when the opportunity arose.

3769~~~
Translating that ratio into what he'll hypothetically score for the season is a very poor way of looking at it, though. It's a fairly small sample, wherein scoring one or two goals changes it massively. Three of Rooney's goals came in a comfortable win in a tie where we were already pretty much guaranteed to be going through. Still scored the three goals, right enough, and 5 in 9's a decent ratio, but it doesn't particularly tell the whole story of his season so far at all.

If he can keep it up, with a similar ratio after another 9 or 10 games, then you'll have a fair point about it.

3770~~~
If he plays 38 PL games this season, and maintains that ratio, he'll score just under 7 goals. And that is terrible.

3771~~~
I am a little worried that all his goals and his good performances have only come against the weakest sides we've played. As if he can no longer cut it on the level above that. Hope he can prove me wrong this week!

3772~~~
I quite like your posts normally mate but I think this is so overly generous it needs correcting and I'll explain why.

It's like Brendan Rodgers saying they've lost less games in all competitions than City. All well and true but when you've only just scraped past Bournemouth courtesy of huge luck, got spanked by West Ham and your arch enemies United, drawn with Norwich in a dire game and nearly exited a cup to Carlisle, it absolutely overwrites everything else. No cheap stat or hypotheses can gloss over the glaringly obvious.

Re; Rooney - the same law applies. Such performances that to call them "poor" is too kind in the majority of those games you're using as a sample does not overrule the hypothetical projection because he whooped Club Brugge upside the head and a ball bounced off his knee in a favourable direction on the weekend. He has still been absolutely awful. The lad has barely had a shot on target, offered nothing to United away from home since March 2014 and has been playing so horribly for the majority of this season that he's actually been detrimental to our attacking phases.

As a side note, let's break these same stats you've used to generate your hypothesis down a bit shall we...
<ul>
<li>Rooney has been bad in 6 of 8 games - 75%. For the sake of 25 hypothetical goals across all competitions, would you really take over 33 of those 45 games being anonymous and detrimental to the team to justify that?</li>
<li>Then factor in where the majority of those goals have been scored. 1 in 6 appearances in the Prem so far. That equates to just under 6 and a half goals so lets be generous and say 7. Are you still saying that if Rooney misses no more league games, completes the full 37 available, you'd take 7 goals as a satisfactory return? RVP got 10 in 27 for context and was called "past it" left, right and centre. What makes Rooney immune to that?</li>
<li>Now add in how 0 goals or shots on target were against Liverpool and Spurs, the toughest teams in that run. Would you carry on that hypothetical projection vs Chelsea, City and Arsenal home and away?</li>
</ul>I'm not trying to have a pop at you here but I just needed to put into context how grossly inflated that was. If you're using hypothesis and projections of form to justify anything good from a player, you have to acknowledge the negatives too. When it comes to Rooney since March 2014, there has been far too much to let that post slide without a response for me.

3773~~~
You're not the only one. So far he's only a flat track bully. Useful, no doubt but on that basis he shouldn't start against anyone good. I wouldn't mind tbh if LvG looked like he might actually sub Rooney off for a crap performance (ie all of them this season). His touch is abysmal, he can't hold it up, doesn't look sharp when he's in the box. He also slows play up horribly. Basically if he was any other player, then he'd be lucky to be on the bench.

Still hope he can come good though!

3774~~~
Great post. I agree.

3775~~~
Did he play v Liverpool?

3776~~~
Apologies. Good spot. Point is still relevant, swap Pool for Saints.

3777~~~
Cry me a river, precious.

<b>Wayne Rooney: Man Utd forward denies transfer request in 2013
</b>
Manchester United's Wayne Rooney has admitted falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson during his final season but denies putting in a transfer request.

Rooney says he went to see Ferguson, who was United manager for 26 years, after being dropped in 2013.

<b>"It's not just me who's had a fall-out with him," added the forward, 29, in Rooney - The Man Behind The Goals, to be shown on BBC One on 5 October.

"I don't know what happened or why that came out that way."</b>

The England captain added: <b>"I went in to see him and just said if you're not going to play me it might be better if I moved on - then all of a sudden it's all over the press I put in a transfer request, which I never did." </b>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34389171" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34389171</a>

3782~~~
He handed it in. I still think if Ferguson had stayed he'd of been sold.

3783~~~
Without a doubt, we were probably going to get Ronaldo as a replacement due to Valencia giving away the number 7 and how Jose was at that time

3784~~~
That always did sound like the most plausible scenario. Off hand comment, nothing official or definitive.

Fergie about it...

"I think he wants to think things through in his own mind. I think that's a good idea. <b>We're not going to let him go.</b>"

3785~~~
Yes Wayne, inexplicable isn't it that if you threaten to leave people might think you want to leave.

3786~~~
To be fair a private conversation isn't an official transfer request.  2013 was of a different ilk to the previous contract disputes.  Many were questioning his place in team and a lot of fans would have supported selling him, just like today.  Rooney was well within his rights to think about moving on if he felt his place in the team was gone.

3787~~~
He should just shut it rather than bringing it all back out in the open again. He played the big bollocks and you don't do that against Fergie, no one gives a toss if a formal transfer request wasn't handed in. 

Really hoping he kicks on from his goal. For too long he's got away with his poor form because intermittently he's had a few good games. He's our highest paid player (I think) and his form needs to reflect it.

3788~~~
I think his version of events is probably truthful. But, as Brendan Rodgers is finding, it's not words but performances that gets the fans onside again.

3789~~~
And Fergie should just shut it with some of the shit he's talking these days too?  Player speaks about his career in a documentary shocker.  Also of course the request is held against him, just read many posts in this thread.  I agree with you about his form though, particularly this season so far.

Edit; terrible spelling.

3790~~~
I would agree, he surely wouldn't be stupid to go through all that officially twice. plus adds to the theory Fergie was done with him

3791~~~
He was dropped for one game. If his reason for thinking he should leave was because he fell out with Alex Ferguson then how do you explain his being an arse at the start of the next season?

3792~~~
I will gladly take 25 goals from a <i>finished </i> Rooney (as most people have branded him).

We had dross upfront last season (Rooney incl.) and we came 4th, 25 goals from Rooney might help us win a major trophy, especially if you're willing to consider the likes of Mata,Martial and Memphis and what they have to bring to the table this season.

Don't care about his performances at this point, if he keeps on scoring. Not like he will win over the fans with performances anyway, that ship has obviously sailed.

3793~~~
That just doesn't make sense to me. Our nr.10 being constantly poor should of course be of some worry to us. We would of course score more goals as a team with someone playing well in that position. Even though he scores an acceptable amount of goals, we should always value the overall performances.

3794~~~
We should have shipped him out when Fergie retired, it was the perfect time, but now that is no longer possible. Everything was set up by Sir Alex, but then Moyes cam in and... yeah.

Now getting rid of him is no longer an option, even if he is shit on the pitch, he is the main man at the club, the player the others players and the new signings look up to. He is basically our most important player, although that has nothing to do with his performances. Also he appears to be doing a very good job being the captain.

In 2013 we had a lot of players that were leaders and were respected, looked up to by everyone, now we only have him, when people think of Manchester United these days he's the first player that comes to their mind.

Hopefully he regains his form, him playing like shit doesn't help anyone, we should all try to get behind him, no matter if we like him or not.

3795~~~
Nothing wrong with players wanting to leave the club.  Ronaldo and more have courted other clubs publicly.  Rooney had a private conversation with Ferguson, he didn't hand in a public request to leave the club, that's what he is referring to in the interview.  It may have been one game but the general consensus here is that Fergie would've gotten rid of him if he stayed on as manager.  Maybe this is something Rooney could see coming at the time too.  Look he deserves flak for a lot of things, his form included but there is nothing wrong with a player having a private chat with his manager about his future.  It's getting tiresome him being shot at for every little thing he does at this stage.  Want to complain about how he is playing that's perfectly fine but going into every bloody thread and seeing references to him all over the place is ridiculous.  They guy wasn't the first and won't be the last player to do these things at the club but the difference with him is that he's still here.  In fact you want t talk about loyalty then look through this thread and tell me where the loyalty is for a guy who has given us his entire careere, been a huge part is winning countless trophies and is on course for breaking the goalscoring record.  This is a guy who in his prime (I consider his peak to be earlier in his career, looks as if his legs have gone prematurely at the minute) watched Ronaldo, Tevez and the likes leave and be replaced with far inferior players but he kept giving his all for us through this time.  Fans want loyalty when it suits them simple as.  Most here can't wait to get him out of this club so where's the difference in Rooney wanting to leave?

3796~~~
He was still acting a dick after Alex Ferguson had left.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UyUCPVDLM08?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Rooney would show no loyalty to us the moment we were incapable of matching the level he wanted to play at or the money he wanted. He's brought the criticism on himself.

3797~~~
Where the heck do you see him being a dick in that video?!

3798~~~
So rather than buckle down and earn his spot back, its play me or ill leave, what a warrior.

3799~~~
Don't see much wrong in that to be honest.  Which is exactly my point, he'll show no loyalty when he feels he has outgrown us and now us fans show no loyalty when we feel we have outgrown him.  Where's the problem is this?

3800~~~
You are making it sound like he is showing to be a good goalscorer at the moment who will score 25. You must have forgotten that he didn't score one goal in first five games of PL this season playing as a striker.

3801~~~
That was in response to the poster who predicted him to score 25 goals in 45 games based on his current ratio, which i agree with. I expect Rooney to pick up form as the year progresses and ultimately start scoring goals again as well as putting in decent performances, but, if he isn't capable of putting up above average performances - as 99% of the posters on this forum have suggested, then i would gladly take 25 goals from him, which is still possible, as he already has 5 goals in the first 2 months of the season, and he already seems to be improving.

I have quite frankly heard and seen it all. 'Club Brugge', 'shite team', '50 of their top players were out', 'Ipswich','tea cup','Kyle Walker own goal' 'only one league goal' etc. The fact still remains that he at least has been able to score 5 goals without penalties, so we can afford to look on the bright side (which is something, most were willing to do for the manager, a few weeks ago, but strangely not for our captain).

Ronaldo has only scored in one league match this season(out of 6), albeit 5 goals. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3802~~~
Then you'll know that for every "He's a fat twat with Brillo Pad hair" post, there's an equal "How dare you disrespect Our Wayne - he's sacrificed his children to play for United" one.

3803~~~
That is simply not true. Not on this forum anyway.

3804~~~
If you think his record so far is good and you don't care if his goals were against shit opponents then there isn't really much left to discuss.

3805~~~
Only recently, perhaps.

3806~~~
No. That is you putting words in my mouth, as far as his record is concerned.

As for the goals against shite opponents, i clearly said 

<span style="font-size: 12px">Nowhere in my post, have i praised Rooney for being a top striker this season, nor have i claimed he has scored against top teams, i am simply glad he has at least managed to score 5 goals this season, and hopeful about the future. We can go on and on about the quality of teams he has scored against, but the fact still remains that he has still managed to score, and his performances seem to have improved.

He has had some awful performances this season, but that is already a well known fact. He has failed to score against top teams, also another  well known fact. And those are facts that have been stated times without number in this thread, other threads relating to Rooney, my grandma's house, pubs around the world, churches, schools,offices etc.

So, why is there a sudden need to pounce on every post that focuses on certain positives (thankfully, there are 1 or 2) and lambaste every positive prediction? 


</span>

3807~~~
This has been the case for a while now. And i understand the frustrations of certain posters, when it comes to his performances.

Just don't get the shitting on optimism bit, like the crying is going to stop him from starting.

3808~~~
The problem is how shit he's playing. Nobody is complaining about loyalty at the moment. He'd probably be cut more slack when he's not playing well had he not acted the dick in the past.

3809~~~
Think back to when Wayne was excelling, playing fast and attacking.  In most of his goals, we had wings that would support the center striker and/or we had a counter attacking style.  We had Nani, Young, Valencia and even Ronaldo sending balls into and across the box.  Or we had Giggs and the such providing him long balls to run past defenders (like Ipswich),  Watch Wayne's highlight reel.  You see his movements are fantastic near the 6 yard box but to be effective, he needs supply from out wide or someone to break down the opponent .  

Who has done that for us this season?  Okay, Memphis can break down a defender ... but when he does, he takes a 25 yard shot outside the box.  

I would like to see more diagonal runs from Wayne especially when Juan has the ball, but otherwise, his lack of "goal scoring form" can be well understood... we're not providing service.  

One perfect example of this is, look at Robert Lewandowski.   Last season he has 17 goals, pretty productive by almost everyone's standards.  HOWEVER, Ribery and Robben get hurt early this season and in comes Coman and Costa whom are willing to use pace and skill to beat the wide defenders and cross to the #9.  And LOOK at his results since Ribery and Robben's injuries.  10 goals in 3 games.  There is plenty written on Lewandowski's scoring and the reasons for it and I believe this generally applies to Wayne as well.  

Seriously, watch the highlight reel in this thread and see how he's scoring many of his goals.  IMO, he still has the ability to score as he has in the past and I dare say it....., drop him into Bayern and he'd be finding the net on a very high pace right now as well...  But have cut in wings and see that production drop significantly.

I know, it's not popular to say anything kind about Wayne Rooney around here....   But I for one am still a supporter and a believer that he's not just gone to crap.  We as a club have changed style and philosophy and to heap this onto his shoulders is simply narrow minded and reeking of an anti-Wayne agenda.  

Look, I hate that he ever wanted to consider leaving the club too....   but I'm not going to let that cause me to miss out on enjoying him while we still have him.

3810~~~
No need to be mad at him (not that I care, just don't see the point). His level of play has been shit, but not for lack of trying. That he is in the team is down to LVG's insistence on not playing Herrara as the no 10, for one reason or another.

3811~~~
That's great and everything, but if he doesn't fit this managers playing style why should be play?. Others have come into the team and done just fine. Anyway it's not just service, he is clearly lacking in many other areas that he used to be just fine in.

3812~~~
Last season: 12 goals and 5 assists as mostly a midfielder in 33 games in the Premier League, 23 goals and 8 assists in all competitions including for England.  

"Others have come in and done just fine?"  Who would that be?  Martial?  A bit early to conclude that isn't it?  Maybe he will and surely I hope he's a long term answer up top for us AND frankly I like Wayne in the 10 spot just behind him anyway but nobody has been prolific in the 9 hole since we were playing more aggressively with RVP and Wayne up top 2 or 3 seasons ago.  

Of course all this is my humble and non popular opinion.  I simply think there's more to it than Wayne losing a step or losing that edge and I think LVG agrees with me (although he's not called me yet to discuss).

3813~~~
Doing the Lord's work. ^

3814~~~
He wanted to be a number 9, but I think he's realised himself he's done as a line leading striker. He's always player better with a pacey striker IMO, as it helps him use his mental skills. Lately though his movement in the box and around it has been very poor, and his lack of agility/acceleration in tight areas shows out massively. The fact he hadn't had a shot in 5 games or so is very very poor. 

He's not completely finished but he's certainly not the player he used to be. I'm just not sure how long we can persist with carrying him if he plays poorly. Atleast he's bucked his ideas up a bit in the last 2 games, hopefully that continues tonight.

3815~~~
Here's one for you then, lads.

Despite Wayne Rooney being the worst striker in the Premier League, not even good enough for Leicester City, he is currently on the same number of club goals as Diego Costa, Harry Kane and Sergio Aguero combined.

3816~~~
He also scored more PL than Messi and Ronaldo combined. Get in!

3817~~~
Won more Carling Cups than Pele, Maradona and Puskas put together. Truly phenomenal.

3818~~~
White van Basten as they call him.

3819~~~
Why the sarcasm?

3820~~~
Amar started it, Miss!

3821~~~
feck off you ugly fat bum fecking shit player

3822~~~
dreadful miss. great pass before that though.

3823~~~
Mods this is what happens when you give newbies access to the mains.

3824~~~
That was worse than terrible from him.

3825~~~
He's not wrong. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3826~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3827~~~
If I'm being fair so far he's had a mixed game but there's no doubt that he slows our attacking play down and his first touch is atrocious as usual. It's just frustrating to watch when a better player could be complimenting our other attackers better.

3828~~~
He's really poor and it's becoming a problem. No other player would be able to get away with being so bad so often.

3829~~~
Take him of and put Pereira on. Let's play with 11 players for a change.

3830~~~
Really poor miss. Think he's been good at times and at times poor.

3831~~~
He's holding Man Utd back and we all know it.

3832~~~
Our worst player on the pitch by far. He is neither helping us defensively nor offensively. Really need a replacement for him at the moment.

3833~~~
I don't get the OTT hate again. He's showed some nice touches and amazing passes, mixed with a very bad miss and a couple of misplaced passes.

3834~~~
What does he need to do to get dropped?

3835~~~
Martial served it on a plate for him and he still manages to feck it up real bad. Ugh.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/asd0" width="560"></iframe>

3836~~~
He's a weak link. 

There should be no place for him in our team nowadays especially when Ander is fit. 

Ander is 10x the player Rooney is at 10

3837~~~
He's been shit yet again.  Game just passes him by game after game.

3838~~~
Underwhelming so far,

3839~~~
The thing is, was anyone even <i>that </i>surprised with the miss?

3840~~~
How many times must we all come in here at HT to say he shouldn't be playing? Considering how LVG has lacked sentimentality in getting rid of players, I can only assume it must be in his contract that he has to play.

3841~~~
Are we watching the same game? Amazing passes?

3842~~~
Yes. I just don't think he's been as bad as some people on here seem so keen to point out whenever they can.

3843~~~
He really is short of confidence

3844~~~
What amazing passes?

3845~~~
Rooney too tired to run after 30 mins <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3846~~~
Apart from the miss, I think he's been really good when he's got the ball. Good range of passing. Think he'll score tonight.

3847~~~
He looks shot at this level. We'd be better without him on the pitch.

3848~~~
Criminal. He has been awful. No idea what's wrong with him. No other player gets so many chances to play themselves into form. He has been this all over the shop since he hesitated in front of the Spurs goal. Just don't understand why he is playing with such a massive monkey on his back.

3849~~~
He's becoming a problem now. Very alarming

3850~~~
I was. A professional footballer in the Champions League has to be scoring that. I think just about anyone else in the team would have buried that with ease. Even Dave.

3851~~~
Like when he passed the ball directly to the Wolfsburg player in the middle of the park, really good play.

3852~~~
He's played a couple of great ones inside the channels (one with his left over 30/40 yards too particularly impressive), plus switches out to Valencia and Darmian. I'm not denying he's made errors too by the way, I just don't buy this Rooney is a complete waste of space and not much else chatter every single game. People are asking me if I'm watching the same game, and I ask others the same question; those who only wish to see what goes wrong. Our play through the phases tonight has been very good so far, if he was quite so terrible, he'd be breaking it up every time.

3853~~~
He is, and he's going to keep playing. Every time he touches the ball I expect him to screw something up.

3854~~~
Trust you to remember that one. Schweinsteigers give it away a lot more than Rooney, yet I doubt that'll be mentioned, or maybe you just didn't see it. 

If you were to watch the first half again, most people would notice how silly they are criticising him. He's been fine in the first half.

3855~~~
Good stuff developing with Martial.

3856~~~
He missed an open goal.

How is that fine? Or silly to criticise him?

3857~~~
He played decently today. Much better than his usual level so far this season. But how did he miss that chance!

3858~~~
Fine isn't good enough for our self  styled most important player

3859~~~
Thought he's been good, the miss apart.

3860~~~
Created 0 chances from the no 10 position is not playing fine. And I do remember Bastian giving it away, but we're in the Rooney thread.
He is not playing fine.

3861~~~
His overall play has actually been very good today. That missed chance is very uncharacteristic for him though, as he's been a very reliable finisher the last few years.

3862~~~
Hes been fine. The moaning is just getting silly. Memphis and schweinsteiger have been worst but as usual its Rooney everybody moans about.

3863~~~
Didn't he square it for Memphis in the build up to his left-footed shot that was saved or am I making that up?

3864~~~
Elephant in the room.

3865~~~
The most worrying part is that some people are defending him saying he was "not bad" or "decent". Is that good enough?

3866~~~
I thought that was Mata, but possibly. I don't know why but when the CMs and the CBs get the ball they are looking for someone in the whole and there is no one available. That is the main reason I say he isn't playing fine.

3867~~~
I said apart from his missed chance he's been fine, which, if you watched the first half, you'd see that.

3868~~~
It's certainly a divisive issue.

I literally can't imagine what the other half are watching when it comes to defending Rooney. I can only assume they've lowered their standards so drastically that they see this kind of performance as acceptable.

3869~~~
So apart from the great chance he missed he's been fine?

Okay, well apart from the goal we conceded, we're keeping a clean sheet tonight.

3870~~~
You're not alone.

3871~~~
Here here.

3872~~~
You've answered your question there people are saying it every single game because it happens every single game. 

He offers nothing and hasn't done for months he is the weak link in our team everyone can see that. He's that bad he's become a problem. If Ander was fit then he should be picked over Rooney everytime.

3873~~~
Sigh

3874~~~
Great comparison. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Despite missing the chance, his OVERALL play has been good.

3875~~~
But that just isn't the case. We'll have to agree to differ.

3876~~~
Remember we're in Rooney's thread. "Fine" is the new he's done fecking nothing( good or bad ), despite of being one of the highest paid player in the world, club' icon etc...

3877~~~
Every time he receives the ball there seems to be some kind of mistake or feck up. His performances haven't been up to scratch even for an average striker of our level for a while now.

Honestly I hope we sell him next Summer, as on his wage I'd imagine he wouldn't accept a rotation role. I realise he's been a great servant for the club, but it seems more and more it is coming time for us to part ways, as painful as that might be to hear.

3878~~~
I wonder if he realizes how badly he's playing.

3879~~~
Schweinsteiger has been less than just "fine" hes been bad and is on £275,000 a week, but its always this stupid thread that gets bumped to moan 3 minutes into a match, its just ridiculous.

3880~~~
Give me strength

3881~~~
Struggling to even dribble with the ball.

3882~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3883~~~
He looks like Falcao and RVP did last season. Out of his depth.

3884~~~
What worries me as well is that after big feck ups, like missing the sitter Martial passed to him in the first half, he seems to blame external things like the pitch or whatever, which doesn't bode well for improvement if it's always somebody else's fault.

3885~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> Please tell me you have a gif of that rooney dribble <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3886~~~
Didn't say Rooney is the worst player on the pitch.

3887~~~
31 year old, not match fit,  new team and tactics.  What's Rooneys excuse?

3888~~~
Schweinsteiger is on £275k a week? Pretty sure that you have made that figure up

3889~~~
Pathetic

3890~~~
Schweinsteiger's been quite good so far. Looked composed when he's come on at times, made some lovely passes too. For someone who's still settling in, he's done a decent job thus far. Rooney's certainly played worse than him.

3891~~~
The fact that Rooney defense has boiled down to the two other new guys played worse says it all.

3892~~~
Is that directed towards me or the attempted dribble?

3893~~~
What does he actually contribute? Please enlighten me

3894~~~
If Schweinsteiger had been shite for 90% of games this season his thread would get bumped too but he's actually been playing well this season. Rooney on the other hand...

3895~~~
You

3896~~~
Considering Rooney is on around £300k a week he needs to do better. Considering his complaining about the lack of great signings he needs to really be performing at a level above what he is now. Definitely needs to improve

3897~~~
Why is it pathetic? It was pretty funny

Don't be so sensitive you creep

3898~~~
This is becoming a big problem now because I am actually starting to become really angry towards him as are a lot of you it seems, I hate being like that to someone who has done so much for our club but thats Van Gaals fault for being blind to the fact that his history and name should not come before what he actually does on that pitch, he's been nothing short of garbage for a few seasons now, I mean his stats for last season were rubbish, for being the highest paid player and someone thats to lead by example he's a passenger, especially in tonights game, he should of been the first player off tonight and thats becoming a regular occurrence now

3899~~~
He's not undroppable on this form, not wth Van Gaal as manager. I think it's been the correct decision to give him the chance to play into some form, given his record, but it's time to give Herrera a chance imo.

3900~~~
Don't be so childish you creep

3901~~~
Hasn't been a captain's performance tonight. Standing and watching the defensive phases at times here. A catalyst for poor possession and failing to influence the team in these times of panic.

3902~~~
Absolutely tremendous performance. Offer that man a new contract.

3903~~~
Yes calling people pathetic for laughing at something isn't childish at all. What the matter with you?

3905~~~
Utter shit. On the pitch Bastians the real captain.

3906~~~
He had a nightmare tonight. We look so good as a team at times, but Rooney never looks good. He struggles with the most simple of touches these days. Its quite something to see actually. Cant see him being dropped, but something has to be done here. God, he's rotten.

3907~~~
Bit strange of him. I can understand someone being pissed off at you for laughing at our own players if it had led to an opposition goal in a CL final, but seems a bit pointless to get angry when we've won. We can all have a sense of humour about United.

3908~~~
At some point someone around LvG has to start asking him what we could achieve with a player who's actually contributing in the number 10 role, instead of persisting with Rooney there. It's baffling that he's getting minutes in the form he's currently displaying.

3909~~~
He's so fecking horribly bad it's unbelievable. Don't think I've been pissed off with him for ages.

3910~~~
Zero goalthreat. Zero creativity. But a goal line clearence. ROONAY! ROONAY!

3911~~~
That's pretty woeful. Terrible from someone whose role is to be one of our most creative and productive forces. Only thing that's even remotely decent there is his passing percentage.

3912~~~
He is giving shit displays again and again.

Getting too many privileges as a captain.

3913~~~
3rd worst player on the pitch. Mephis and Schneiderlin were even worse.

3914~~~
Indeed.
The problem that I have with him is that he is undroppable. So as such, I'd expect him to be our talisman. But a talisman is not what he is.
A striker who finds it difficult to score or create chances. This is the reason why we got rid of Falcao, Hernandez and RVP. Yet, Rooney is undroppable.

3915~~~
Gave his all and worked his ass off. He may not be in top form, but you have to hand it to him that he gives his all.

3916~~~
I feel sorry for Rooney.

He's not playing well, no confidence and his sharpness has fallen off a cliff. He knows just as much as everyone else that he's un-droppable and that must add pressure to an already off form player

3917~~~
It's not even stats, every single pass he makes, it's either slowing everything to 0 or is too difficult for others to control it, his decision making is just baffling, he seems to have lost all footballing ability he's had, it's not even about pace, shooting, scoring or feck knows what anymore.

3918~~~
This isn't school PE class, we don't give credit for trying.

3919~~~
I see no signs of him getting better. He is physically shot IMO which is the worst part. He's not out of form. It's who he is right now which is the harsh truth.

3920~~~
Very poor tonight

3921~~~
I think <a class="username" data-user="80706, @Walters_19_MuFc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80706/">@Walters_19_MuFc</a> takes Rooney's poor performances very personally. Sadly he's the only one who can see how well he's played

3922~~~
Very poor, along with blind he should have been taken off as both were contributing nothing positive. He is the weakest link up front and slows everything down.

3923~~~
Wayne Rooney can count himself blessed Ander Herrera is currently injured and Adnan's out on loan. He has done nothing to warrant the #10 role in this United side.

3924~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3925~~~
He was comfortably worse than both.

3926~~~
The hell is wrong with you? It was yet another example Rooney's lack of ability on the ball which has been evident for about three seasons now.

What's pathetic about wanting some confirmation of what we just witnessed? Or are you just fed up of being proved wrong (as nearly everyone on your side is) regarding Rooney's performance and value to this team?

Back to the game..

Absolutely killed us in the second half with his slow play. I was ready to scream near the end when he fecked up with Mata and nearly set them off on another attack. Just embarrassing at times given his status. What I will give him is he certainly tried to press well but if that's the best I can offer for him then deary me. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Thank god Smalling is in there and leading well because when Schweinsteiger leaves the pitch, it's clear we've lost a leader and Rooney is never in the same breath in that regard.

3927~~~
How dare you laugh at captian Rooney? Call yourself a United supporter?

3928~~~
He needs to go. Addition by subtraction really. He sticks out like a sore thumb given the overall technical ability of players like Blind, Martial, Mata, Carrick and Schweini in the team. Even Young has managed to look so much better than anything Rooney's put up.

3929~~~
FFS. He is earning silly money every week, money normally reserved to the too players in the world. 

I could go out there be shit and work my ass off pal. Shouldnt be anywhere near the team, he makes us worse, that's all there is to it.

3930~~~
I was thinking the same. He's struggling to run and turn, he looks finished at the moment.

3931~~~
He was shit again, no disguising it. Thought he'd turned a corner against Sunderland - turns out that probably had more to do with Sunderland being shit.

3932~~~
I feel slightly sorry for him because physically he is done.

3933~~~
Needs new shoes for start, slipping all over the place..

3934~~~
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

3935~~~
Only saw a bit of the game but he looked fairly anonymous and didn't really offer much at all. I fear that he's going to be kept in the team due to sporadically scoring every so often, with an occasional goal being enough for LVG to justify his place. If he doesn't improve form wise, he's going to be fairly detrimental to us.

3936~~~
Are you atill going on? 

Personally, I think its pathetic to laugh at our own players misfortune, but you obviously don't. Its gone now. Move on!

3937~~~
There were times he literally just stood there and watched their players run past him when we were trying to hang on to a lead.

3938~~~
My god he is diabolical. It's actually become a parody.

3939~~~
Poor, he gets the ball on the break 3 or 4 times and doesn't know what to do with the ball except slow the fecking game down and then lose possession.

3940~~~
Doesn't contribute at all going forward. He's getting a free pass.

3941~~~
Not much than Schneiderlin. Couldn't decide who was crappier from both.

Depay I think was ok.

3942~~~
Well maybe not, but I've seen players doing fck all if things don't go their way. Atleast he tries.. Not discrediting his great performance ofcourse...

3943~~~
If Van Gaal still can't see how shite he is and bad for us, I guess his reputation for not looking for names but performances should be fecked off. Absolutely horrible today. Useless. This guy is our captain and highest earner. Joke.

3944~~~
Exactly

3945~~~
Thats not what not what the stats say. Top 3 in distance covered.

3946~~~
Yeah not all of us take football as seriously as you do so refrain from calling people pathetic next time maybe

3947~~~
Each and every one of us here would run and give our all till we puke on the pitch. So?

3948~~~
Unfortunately, I think you're right. Looks too tired these days. Worked his socks off at times, but he paid the price for it for a few minutes afterwards as he tried catching his breath and stuff.

3949~~~
At least Brendon had the balls to drop Mr.liverpool

Rooney is MLS standard now laughable his fanboys and worryingly lvg can keep supporting him

3950~~~
Captain or not, he needs a wakeup call.

3951~~~
I don't think he was physically able at times.

3952~~~
Rooney is done, we should be looking to replace him in summer.

3953~~~
He's fecking shite.

3954~~~
He just doesn't have many qualities any more. He can't dribble, can't hold up the ball, his short passing is sloppy, doesn't get into good positions, lost a fair bit of pace, prone to a poor first touch and isn't clinical in front of goal either any more. Basically the Anti-Martial. He's one of our biggest weaknesses these days unfortunately.

3955~~~
That's the issue I have in all honesty! If Rooney was sitting on the bench as a bit-part player, I wouldn't care that much (I'd be much less angry about him anyway) but its the fact he's robbing someone else of an opportunity.

There's no way in hell Herrera or Mata couldn't perform better in that role.

3956~~~
Poor today for me, probably the worst player on the park. Thought he showed a few nice passes in the first half but bottled his chance and was horrendous in the 2nd.

Interesting to see what LvG does with him, surely he can't be oblivious to this.

3957~~~
He worked hard but his play bar the odd moment was average/poor. Could say the same for most the players today but for the majority of them it's an odd blip in their season, for Rooney it's in keeping with his overall play. When you look at what Mata shows he can bring when he comes inside I just think with him allowed a central role for a series of games, he could bring a lot more than Rooney is. And if not him then surely this game was calling out for Herrera to help get control and get the passing back on. I really hope LVG lives up to his reputation with Rooney if he keeps on like this.

3958~~~
He looked like he was after running a marathon at the end of that game, could barely even jog he was that exhausted. He was absolute garbage tonight. He is a major step below everyone else in the team, and I don't think this is even a bad patch, he's past it and needs to be dropped. He would be good for us coming off the bench instead of starting games, but for whatever reason it's not going to happen. He's going to keep starting games and being shit for the whole season. I really can't see what Van Gaal is hoping is going to happen. It's going to cost us in the long run if he keeps playing.

3959~~~
Did I say he should start, or he makes us better? Off the ball he wasn't playing that bad. On the ball however it was dreadful...

3960~~~
It happens, he's playing since 16 years old, unfortunately the end is here and the only way now is down.

3961~~~
Forgetting his bizarre inability to put away clear chances his refusal to take on a defender and simultaneously slow down promising attacks on the counter is worse than anything.  I am convinced that Herrera needs a run at CAM and if that fails then we should be in the market for one next summer.

3962~~~
What does he actually do?

3963~~~
Needs dropping. It's not llike he was a captain tonight either. He didn't track runners, offered nothing on the ball and also offered nothing organisationally, you could see that Bastian was directing players, Rooney included. The sooner he is out of the team, the better.

3964~~~
He'll be out of the team by January/Feb and out of the club next summer.

3965~~~
I think this is his last year as a starter. It will be tough to move him on with the wages and length of contract 

It's quite amazing how much better Martial looks so far

3966~~~
His weaknesses far far out way his positives (what are they actually?) thesedays.

He's our Gerrard. The millstone around the teams neck.

3967~~~
Yea, why discuss things, what a bunch of weirdos.

3968~~~
How? We'd have to pay someone to take him, given his wages.

3969~~~
How does that stat discredit the post you quoted?

3970~~~
But why should he get until the end of the season? Players should be in the team on form and Rooney is clearly in decline and offering nothing.

3971~~~
It's almost time to start a sweepstake thread on when he will be dropped. This form is calling for a Ferguson Welbeck Real Madrid moment.

3972~~~
Are you joking? LVG has made Rooney undroppable even though he has been horrendous in nearly every game he has played in this season.

3973~~~
It's honestly a challenge to even say what they might be. We'd be much better off with Herrera in his spot at the moment.

3974~~~
PSG can take him probably. As well Arab teams and MLS.

3975~~~
Woodward did.

3976~~~
The very definition of a deadweight amongst the attacking quartet. Memphis was  in some ways worse tonight but at least offers a potential threat with his pace and directness. Rooney offers absolutely nothing attacking wise.

3977~~~
PSG wouldn't want him. The others wouldn't match his wages.

3978~~~
Its a trademark pass<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3979~~~
Shit, non-existent yet again... Needs to be dropped for his own sake now.

3980~~~
Yeah I agree he should be out the team ASAP but I will be surprised if Van Gaal does it considering how he manages to start and finish every single game so far despite being terrible

3981~~~
Scholes talking shit. He just refuses to come out and say his good days are more rare than his bad days now

3982~~~
Giggs needs to have a word with Rooney. Remember Giggs going through a bit of a rotten spell when he was 29/30 and reinvented himself and remained a force until he was 38/39. Rooney is going to have to do something similar because he just doesnt look at the races at all. Its actually a shame to be honest. He isnt carrying his load in this side. And he's the one who you should look at for inspiration.

3983~~~
Got rinsed by Michael Owen there

3984~~~
Ya it is baffling to say the least.

3985~~~
We need to accept that we fecked up with his big fat contract. Seems like we are hoping he plays himself into some form so that we will be able to justify agreeing to pay him so much. I genuinely believe he is finished at the top level and we need to accept this hit and start to integrate other players in the team. How the hell did Rooney managed to play the full ninety minutes while having a game like he had today.

3986~~~
Nothing to discuss. I think its pathetic, he doesn't. End of!

3987~~~
What is actually he good at anymore?

3988~~~
Why would any reasonable club want him now? Seriously can we leave our bubble and understand that no other top clubs rate Rooney?

I assume these prospective clubs in this scenario of a transfer are those that just buy players without even scouting them because that's what it will take. A club stupidly believing they're signing 08-10 Rooney.

3989~~~
Hits a nice ball out to the right, now and then.

3990~~~
Almost like Ivanovic for Chelsea, how they are both getting so much game time only they know.

3991~~~
There are some very good reasons for keeping Rooney in the team thus far. Such as his record over the past 10 years, and the fact it takes him time to play into form. There will be a tipping point though, I don't agree with those who think he's undroppable.

3992~~~
He's literally and figuratively the elephant in the room as far as our team goes.

3993~~~
As bad as he was tonight - and he was bloody awful - you don't drop your captain when the team's on a good winning run. It's too much of a risk to team spirit.

3994~~~
By reputation and still 30 I think there will be takers. Hell Falcao was brought in for Chelsea, despite being even worse than Rooney.

3995~~~
He dropped his captain at munich and he wasnt doing as badly as rooney. He dropped the dutch captain and then sold him mercilessly, he dropped riquelme. He will drop rooney but our options are limited as of now. You think he doesnt see rooney being shit and having the first touch that sends the ball into the next solar system ? He does. Van gaal waits for right moment and right replacement. 

The thing i wonder is as captain rooney has a look at himself, the way he plays in last month or so, why doesnt he shamefully ask van gaal to drop him for greater good of the team, that is what a captain does. In this form he is stealing money from the club and fans.

3996~~~
Hopefully he'll get his usual goal vs Arsenal.

3997~~~
He's very slow when running these days. But he covers great distances apparently, so what gives? With the ball he looks like his legs have gone.

3998~~~
I have the same question, he supports the midfield when it's not needed, he plays upfront when he is needed deeper, he is unable to play with speed, he rarely runs with the ball, rarely tries through balls, rarely shot.

3999~~~
Diabolical

4000~~~
Owen saying if he takes penalty and scores then nobody talks about performance. 

He's not on penalties because he has missed the last few.

4001~~~
Van Gaal has to know, a manager of his credentials.

Surely he can see how utterly shit Rooney is these days?

4002~~~
When was the last time he put in an 8/10 performance? serious question.

4003~~~
What he say?

4004~~~
He's only decent games so far have been against Brugge's second string, a Championship side and a half decent game against the bottom side in the Premier League. He's supposed to be our talisman and star player, he needs to perform in games like this and PSV and Arsenal at the weekend.

4005~~~
My friend, I tell you what.
Pay me £1000 p/w.
I'll play as striker and I will try as if my life depended on it. I'll run like a crazed man on crack.
I wont score or create, but boy will I provide you with laughs. I'll even do a copy of what Jones did when he headed the ball along the ground, last season. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

This is top level CL football and "trying" is not what a £300k/week footballer is paid/selected for.

4006~~~
Like the family's favorite dog who has gone blind in one eye and starting to become senile, its time to put him down.

4007~~~
I don't know what's wrong with him. He doesn't look like he can even run properly. I just hope he gets some kind of form back because his contribution tonight was basically nothing.

4008~~~
Personally if I was in a team and some guy who was really really shit (captain or not) kept getting his game I would be delighted when he was dropped for someone better who isn't a liability. If everyone here think's he's passed it and should be dropped, why wouldn't you think the rest of the players would want the same?

4009~~~
Unfortunatelly he dig himself in that hole. What options do we have. Our attack consists of 19 years old Martial, Rooney and Wilson, who is far from being a regular choice.

4010~~~
He did that for a couple of years though. He'd be poor to average but nick us a goal and it was ignored.

Now the goals have dried up we're left with just his all round performance to look at. And it isn't pretty.

4011~~~
His hat-trick game. That's seeming more like an anomaly though, as opposed to his usual level.

4012~~~
Ander Herrera. Marouane Fellaini. Andreas Pereira. Anyone. Me. You?

Brugge away tbf. Every dog has their day. Even a broken clock tells the right time twice a day etc.

4013~~~
I knew this would happen. Move him to 10 and watch him take off they said.     This is who Wayne is these days, meh. Nothing new really.

4014~~~
I think we have to accept that he's never going to be as good as we want/need him to be anymore. Yeah, he might come into some form and score some goals, but over the course of a season he's not going to be worth the money or the position in the team if we want to be the best in the league. We can do better than Rooney now. That miss in the first half was really bad, Hernandez basically got sold for doing that and we all remember the look on Van Gaal's face when he did it

4015~~~
I mean, he put in a hard working shift..

Don't think he was <i>that</i> bad but really need to see more from Rooney

4016~~~
At some point I can see why LvG is stubborn in chasing Thomas Muller. I love Rooney but he needs badly someone who could replace him in two matches per week system. That doesn't mean he should be dropped permanently but today even some of his long passing was... well, no further comment.

4017~~~
He has to improve, LVG will sell him off if not.

4018~~~
If we can afford to take a risk of paying almost 60 mil for an unproven gem, surely we can take the financial hit of maybe stumping up sum of his wages..as Spurs were forced to with Adebayor..

I think a return to Everton would be best, and I would mind Stones coming the other way.

4019~~~
he is a liability, pure and simple

time to plan for his replacement - if we had a decent attacking right sided player and moved Mata inside we'd be a much improved side

4020~~~
Remember last year, when people were criticising our system and not our non-scoring strikers?
Martial (who has speed and has an eye for goal), comes in and immediately threatens whenever he gets the ball.
Even Memphis gets himself in goal-scoring positions (he just needs to improve his finishing).
Falcao/Rooney - these guys were barely able to even get into goal scoring positions.
Our system relies on strikers who want to score and who have speed...but then doesn't this apply to all teams?

4021~~~
Easiest game we will play all season to be fair.

4022~~~
Scandalously bad. Dropped him immediately.

4023~~~
he's on 300k a week....how on earth could Everton even pay half that?

4024~~~
You can't expect Martial to play in every game this season. I'm not sure Depay as well would be useful as a #9 as of this moment. 

We needed to bring in an experienced attacker and we didn't.

4025~~~
I don't see him go for hollywood-crossfield passes anymore. He had one successful one today but it's such a rare sighting now.

To me that's a sign that he's aware of how bad he's playing. There's no confidence in his play anymore.

4026~~~
He could burn down LvG's house and he still won't be dropped. Terrible today, he should be dropped yasap.

4027~~~
He must know his days are numbered.

4028~~~
The media agenda with him is unbelievable. They just can't accept what we all knew was going to happen and that his body and playing so early on has caught up to him earlier than most players. Any excuse.

Giving him the arm band was such a massive mistake.

4029~~~
I am not much of a 10, But for United Ill step up..
New premier league deal maybe..from what I read from the Grand old team Everton forum, its not necessarily true that Everton have no money..Kenwright is just a cheap bugger.

4030~~~
They may be stupid, but I doubt they are that stupid. Let's face it Rooney is past his best. It happens to all players at some stage and he was a top player earlier than most, so it is understandable if he is finished earlier than most.  His time has gone, and most are aware of it, I am sure that Van Gaal is also realising the reality slowly. Rooney is no longer a top class player, he does show patches of his old class but not enough.

4031~~~
Everton's wage bill is surprisingly large, or at least it was under Moyes.

And they'd afford half because we'd be paying the other half... we may end up having to do something like that.

4032~~~
A poor second half with some very careless touches. But I still maintain, especially now watching the ITV highlights, that a lot of our best first half play went through him.

4033~~~
Think it's not so easy to drop him. I know it sounds crazy but I maintain there is something in his contract and/or some marketing reason why he keeps getting played. It's the club's fault plain and simple and they're reaping what they sowed. 
Have to say I think he's an ok guy and seems to look out for his teammates, but unfortunately this is not enough to justify him starting.

Wonder how long before some of his teammates start resenting the fact that he starts no matter what and they get dropped for the smallest of mistakes? Surely that cannot be good in the long run?

4034~~~
So far Herrera & Pereira can offer great movement plus we're still waiting for Lingard to start but if we could actually get Muller this summer window, everything would probably be already fully sorted out.

4035~~~
This. is it any wonder why we do so badly on the international scene? It's all about hype with the media. Surely there's nothing wrong with giving an honest assessment of a player's performance regardless of whether or not you like them? Not criticising him makes him think he's doing fine. I don't know.

4036~~~
Thought he was very poor, it's games like these where you need experienced players to slow the game down, that it becomes evident just how stupid it is that Rooney is our captain.

4037~~~
Finished. Move on.

4038~~~
I don't think it's necessarily some clause in his contract or anything, but more the fact that we're probably wary to drop him considering he's our captain and presumably our highest earner. It'd seem a bit ridiculous if our captain was sitting on the bench, especially when he's still technically at an age when plenty of players are in their prime, and there's probably be a lot of drama if he was stripped of it. I'm also guessing that our management team still hold hopes that he's going to find his previous level again.

4039~~~
I'm trying so hard to defend him in my mind, but it's getting harder and harder each week. Plus the fact I know I'm doing it now, which undermines any attempt to be objective. 

My last refuge is that his lowest level has always been one of the lowest of his class level brethren

4040~~~
Fecking terrible again.

Is everyone finally onboard with him not being good enough at number 10 now? Seem pretty unanimous.

4041~~~
Becks says that Rooney has been very good this season and the "one to watch" from the English league. No wonder neither Rooney nor LvG realise that Rooney is done at this level when media and (former) footballers continue to single out Rooney as the star man despite him being extremely poor.

4042~~~
His hat-trick game was in a CL qualifier game, against team decimated by injury. Brugge fielded a 'B' Team. Against their first team, I'd highly doubt he'd score more than 1 goal.
In fairness to him though, he put 3 goals passed the team which was put in front of him.

I prefer to look at EPL goals - as the teams tend to be of a consistently high quality. He has scored 1 goal in about 5-6 games...which is poor.

4043~~~
Awful today but well our manager decided to buy no strikers/number 10 so he'll play.

4044~~~
The amount of money he is paid relative to his input is fraud!

4045~~~
To be fair, as much as Beckham is a decent guy, he's one of those former England figures who are generally fairly uncontroversial and bland in their opinions like Shearer/Owen. Not necessarily an awful thing since he's not in a punditry role like the other two on a regular basis, but he's not the type who's going to lay into players he's fairly friendly with.

4046~~~
This

4047~~~
We keep expecting him to be better than he is. His standards are too high. 

We need to accept that he is just an average player these days. Not shit, mind you, just quite average. With great experience, and some moments of brilliant quality.

4048~~~
Wayne still has a lot to offer but he is a player in remission. I expect Louis to realise this during the season and than next season you'll see Wayne being treated justly.

4049~~~
Honestly think he's past it. Our best XI should be Herrera as #10, he would offer so much more not to mention he actually has a first touch.

4050~~~
That's not really an excuse to play him, though, if it's what LVG wants to go by. We have Martial, who looks a lot more sharp, fit and generally better all-round than Rooney at the moment. Herrera's perfectly capable of play in the number 10 role. As is Mata, although I'm happy with his current role within the side.

4051~~~
Well they'll be waiting for a long time imo. I don't quite buy this though you may be right. LVG is too experienced not to see Rooney's decline. There's no way he can miss that. I believe he doesn't want to go against the wishes of the club as they tend to fawn over him. I guess the best way to get them to change their minds is to play him until they can't deny what's actually happening with Rooney's form. Only my speculation but that is what I believe as nothing else makes sense to me.

4052~~~
Ross Barkley is ready made to take over from Rooney.

4053~~~
Just like Owen, Shevchenko, Torres, Falcao...it'll take at least 2 seasons of this form before the media pick up on the fact that he might be past his best. For now everytime he does something slightly good (see hatrick against Brugge) it'll be 'Rooney's back!'

4054~~~
I don't think LvG likes Mata in the 10 and he didn't do well there in the one game he played there vs PSV. Herrera is another he doesn't seem to fancy and Rooney is definitely a better option than Fellaini at 10 as it stops us lumping useless balls up top

4055~~~
So you wait until he costs you points or advancement in a tournament to do so? How about the morale of the players he keeping out of the side? Or those who have to carry him in matches? I think we are slowly reaching a point where his continued stay in the side is now detrimental to our play and that's just being polite.

4056~~~
Yeah, but instead of being asked specifically about Rooney, he namedrops him, and only him from the Premier League, when talking about exciting players from the top leagues. He added that "Wazza has made a very good start to the season", which is weird when coming from a guy you would think watches United regularly. Feels like media and the experts are being paid by Rooney's PR department now.

4057~~~
I don't think they'll wait <i>that </i>long, to be fair, but I do think they're very reluctant to throw him out the side considering it's still early in the season. I don't particularly think he's going to improve all that much and he's probably getting towards his last legs, but even though I'd drop him, I suppose it's very different when you're in the position to actually have to pull the trigger.

4058~~~
It's quite ridiculous how bad he's become. Ffs he lost the ball with a simple dribble today. He really looks like the popular bloke you invite to your sunday game who thinks he's good enough to play in the hole but is just straight shite.

4059~~~
I can't think many people would seriously arguing against him being dropped now. Whether he's finished or not is another thing. I'm not gonna write him off yet, he's had really shite spells before. 

I'd easily have Fellaini over him at the moment.

4060~~~
He should be benched for his own good, give the armband to Smalling or Schweinsteiger and bring Rooney on as a sub, it will probably spark some life into him as he tries to prove a point.

4061~~~
Yes I guess so. Need to at least start getting rotated with Herrera or whomever. Longer they wait to phase him out, the worse it'll be. Just worried this will cost us. I mean surely getting a win takes priority over Rooney's feelings?

4062~~~
Definitely. Although Rooney's a key player and has been here for a long time: I imagine he has plenty of friends in the dressing room. If we were to drop him and we suddenly regressed, it could end up being a bit messy. If we were struggling, then it'd be easier to do, but it's probably hard to drop your biggest name and captain when you're actually top of the league.

4063~~~
Maybe LVG will wait until we lose a run of games before taking action...otherwise, the English press will swoop down on him like those evil monkey thingies from <i>The Wizard of O</i>z.

4064~~~
he's shit

4065~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4066~~~
There has to be some clause in his contract about him starting matches or something. It is just mind boggling as to how he continues to keep getting games. And to think, there are actually some people here who are defending his performance tonight. How standards have fallen!

4067~~~
Beckham says Rooney is having a great year, and guess who is filthy rich and owns an MLS team? That's right, this guy with the hair plugs:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i/?img=/photo/2015/0408/fc_beckham_jc_1296x729.jpg&amp;w=738&amp;site=espnfc" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i/?img=/photo/2015/0408/fc_beckham_jc_1296x729.jpg&amp;w=738&amp;site=espnfc"/> 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/manchester-united/story/2639672/beckham-hails-man-utd-star-rooney-with-ronaldo-messi-neymar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/manchester-un...man-utd-star-rooney-with-ronaldo-messi-neymar</a>

4068~~~
I think this is it. LVG needs to be very careful.
I think playing Rooney for 90 minutes every game, is more a political decision, than a performance based one.

4069~~~
Tbf, David would say nice things about Jack the Ripper...or just about anyone, in fact.

4070~~~
I think this is his last season. MLS bound..or back to Everton

4071~~~
Worrying thing for me is that I can't remember him being anything like this shite before.  We all know he's had lean spells in front of goal, and spells when he's not really got into matches, but this time he's added being utterly unable to control, pass or shoot the football.

4072~~~
Why the feck would Everton want him like this? Seriously.

4073~~~
Brugge's defenders left enough room for an elephant to run past them

4074~~~
As close as you'll go to saying he's past it. 

He is done.

4075~~~
Imagine if we had a top quality #10 in his position? It would benefit our attack so much.

4076~~~
He's been Falcaoed.The manager needs to face the truth.

If only we could have give his game times to someone who can benefit us more both this season and long-term...

4077~~~
Yeah, I don't see why they'd put someone on like £250k a week who's probably going to sit on the bench behind Lukaku.

4078~~~
Not going to lie, when Rooney dribbled in the second half and managed to tackle himself, I actually burst out laughing like a mad man.

Thought he had a decent game for Wolfsburg though.

4079~~~
Normally I ignore anti-Rooney posts as they have tended to be quite unfair in the past.

As is though it's difficult to understate how much of a passenger he is in this side. Certainly doesn't deserve to be starting on form and he is a really big worry atm.

4080~~~
Our boy David says lovely things a lot. I once wrote a song about that. "David the Slut"... He's a man who has good advisers. He wouldn't throw the kind of silly money we pay Wayne away.

4081~~~
He's become a liability. I'd start Herrera, Mata and Pereira at 10 before Rooney.

4082~~~
I've been a big defender but even I'm losing faith.

The thing is, commercially he is worth £300k a week to United so not sure what we will do with him.

Some of the abuse in here is way over the top though, unsurprisingly.

4083~~~
If you put Muller in the team in Rooney's position, I'd actually be pretty confident that we would win the title.

4084~~~
It's not even his fault. I’m quite annoyed at Martial, he didn’t hit Rooney with the ball even once today.

4085~~~
Apart from the time Martial put it on a plate for Rooney only for him to sky it over?

It isn't Rooney's fault that he loses the ball when he dribbles without a tackle either?

4086~~~
That cut back in the first half?

4087~~~
I think it's a joke guys. Martial hit him with the ball on Saturday.

4088~~~
anything is possible in the Rooney thread.

4089~~~
Well played. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

4090~~~
He's had bad spells throughout his career but he's never been this bad for this long.

It's been about 6 or 7 months of absolute shite.

4091~~~
Thank you <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4092~~~
I was listening to Andy Goldstein on the way back from the match and he made an excellent point, whilst he's not playing at his best at the moment, he's still a huge player for us. If you took him out of our team we'd lack his experience.

I actually thought his link up play in the first half was fine.

4093~~~
I still don't think he's passed it but he was poor tonight. Every time he had the ball he just didn't look comfortable and that confidence he had from Saturday had disappeared.

4094~~~
Wrap him up in plastic foil(leave hole for breathing) and set him up on the entrance to the stadium before every home match. If I was on his money for the shite he has delivered recently I would happily be wrapped in plastic foil and hung up. Shit, they could hang me up even when the team is playing away. To be fair to the lad, he was a great player for United but is past it and from now on will only go downhill. Seriously.

4095~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pn3dMtHJw6M?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

After watching tonight's performance and most this season it's evident he's on the decline rapidly. I went back and found a game where he was in my eyes brilliant, I think if anyone's in any doubt of the decline to give this a watch! The difference between the 2011 Rooney seen here to now is like night and day. It will be interesting to see what happens this summer if he doesn't improve. a young energetic number 10 or even Mata/Herrera would be miles better based on what we are seeing.

4096~~~
Yes but what about Rooney?

4097~~~
Let his defenders come and dismiss everything as 'Rooney hatred' again. 

I said on here months ago that my suspicion was that his status in the team, at least to some degree, was included in the terms of his last contract, and was dismissed, but I stand by that notion. He offers nothing and is clearly done. I'd have Marcus Rashford or Callus Gribbin  in the team ahead of him, he's that useless. 

The fact that he thinks he's a 20 goal striker is a joke. Martial is a whole 5 or 6 levels above him, and if we didn't sign him, we would not make the  CL next season.

4098~~~
Looking increasingly like we wasted our money on this Martial lad. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4099~~~
What part of his experience would we be missing? His long lasting ability of doing feck all? Mata contributed more in the no. 10 position, despite playing out wide for most of the game. Apart from the clearance in front of our goal-line he didn't really do anything defensively either. In the last part when we just hoofed it up the pitch he didn't really seem to step in and offer any experience or leadership either.

I genuinely don't see what he brings to the team these days. He seems to be a step behind in almost every aspect of the game.

4100~~~
What does this rhetoric even mean? Another myth, that we are apparently better with a shit Rooney than an actual good footballer. You would think we were talking of Messi or something.

4101~~~
He seems to run around in a daze between the front 3 and the midfield looking lost, he has zero creativity for a #10 and is pretty much a 300k a week Tom Cleverley at this point.

4102~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4103~~~
Put Bobby Charlton back in the team and Rooney will be more goals behind the record in no time.

4104~~~
Bit harsh on Tom that. At least he can actually run and control a football.

4105~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4106~~~
he is a huge name for us yes. if he was out of the side our attacks would speed up

4107~~~
I've been a Rooney defender since the beginning.   And I can't defend this.  He was exceedingly poor today.  No movement, poor touches, poor finishing and generally looked poor.   I'm sad for us and him.  I really hope lvg sees this too and subs in Herrera next game but also communicates about what he's doing wrong.

He won't make his powerful runs into the box anymore.  He simply plays the ball back to our defensive mids every time he gets the ball.  He had one or 2 nice little touches but generally he was poor.  Only to be underperformed today by schneiderlin.

4108~~~
He actually looks quite fast once he decides to run. For me, the biggest problem is his first touch, but he also looks a little lazy at times. But I might be wrong about that, maybe van Gaal wants him not to get involved what would be a sensible decision really.

4109~~~
what does he need?

a week or two away from the first team?
work with a sports psychologist?
a fitness change?

he's lost some sharpness but inside the lumbering, slow player we have at 10 is a player with superb ability

he's been in this slump for a long long time tho.....is he too far gone to get the hunger, desire and inspirational play we last saw really about 3 years ago

interesting to see Torres showing his class only in the odd game

4110~~~
I thought he looked good in the 2nd half against Sunderland. Thought he might have rounded a corner, thought he might have something still to show us.

I realize now. He might look decent when playing against the worst defense in the league. But against any competent team, he will be exposed for what he truly is: Hes done at the top level. He has nothing.

I salute him for his contributions to this club, but when did Giggs/Scholes/Neville/Anyone  get so many chances at once, deliver shit, and still start?

4111~~~
It was as if he was playing a game that was happening 5 seconds after it was actually happening.

4112~~~
It's true - he was buffering on my stream.

4113~~~
After one decent game he is back to being shit again.

Since we have very few options up top he will certainly get the season to prove me wrong but I'm fairly certain now that he is finished at the top level of football.

4114~~~
I can remember frustrations with performances simmering towards the end of Giggs' tenure when Fergie kept playing him, but at least he was on and off whereas Rooney has been consistently poor.

4115~~~
It just feels like forever since he's been in any type form, he ended last season quite poorly, and started this one in much the same vein, I'd already given up on him ever achieving *game changing* moments again with us despite his image/wages, but you would hope he could at least do -OK- up the top and chip in with 15~ league goals a year despite the usual flaws to his game.
But it doesn't seem like he can even do that right now,  you have to say it's really worrying, for both him and the club, this can only go on for so long before the clueless media catch on and bring the situation to a boil.

4116~~~
Would Everton be willing to spend 300k/week on a benchwamer though? He isn't near as good as Lukaku, and not even as good as Naysmith or Barkley.

4117~~~
Giggs was about 38 and had no legs. But he still had decent performances from time to time. 

Rooney is 29 and has been awful for a long time. When was his last great performance. And don't give me the Brugge game. They just made him look good. Possibly the worst team we would have played this season.

4118~~~
Quite the opposite, I'd say. Standards for him have fallen. He has one <b>decent half </b>and people talk about how it's the Second Coming. That's when you know a players well and truly fecked.

4119~~~
More then decent. Sometimes he was the best player on the pitch.

4120~~~
I think you'll be waiting a while for the Media to catch up. They're fecking useless.

In loads of the reports of tonights games there seems to be a lot of surprise and shock that Rooney didn't take the penalty even though it's been established what LVG's take on penalties is. You miss one and you go to the back of the line. Rooney isn't even very good at penalties. He's missed loads for Utd.

And that's just a relatively small thing, we'll still get months of hearing how vital Rooney is for Utd, about how he provided experience and know how and other meaningless buzz words.

EDIT- Giggs used to have one brilliant game and then he'd be average for 3 or 4 games towards the end. His performance at home to Olympiakos in his last season is better than anything Rooney has provided in at least 8 or 9 months.

4121~~~
Usually I'm all about supporting any Manchester United player. But Rooney is pushing me lol. It feels like we play with 10 players most of the times. His touch has been horrible this season. Passing is touch and go on if it will hit our player or go to the opposition. And his finishing is terrible. Got lucky the other day that Martial hit him hard enough with the ball that it bounced into the goal. 

Put the armband on Carrick or Bastian and let him sit on the bench for the next month. See if that lights a fire under him and get him performing.

4122~~~
Shit keeps getting worse for him. it will take forever now for him to get past Charlton's record.

4123~~~
Not sure if serious or joking. No team would spend so much on a 30 year old. Especially when he publicly stated he wanted to return to Everton.

4124~~~
Was saying his touch and how often he gave the ball away were embarrassing for a professional footballer and that it was quite odd to see.

4125~~~
You obviously didn't watch this afternoon's U19 game...

4126~~~
Saying he wouldn't get into the Everton team ahead of Naismith is ridiculous.

4127~~~
Naismith can be quite effective at times playing between the lines, he caused havoc against Chelsea a couple games back.

4128~~~
This is a serious problem at the moment, it's very worrying. 

We're handicapped with him in the team at the moment. He has to be got rid of in the summer.

4129~~~
Thought he was good in the first half, tap in miss aside. If he scored that people would be saying he's back in form, but obviously it was a bad miss. That type of thing just happens. His second half performance was poor though and he needs to improve a lot. I still hold faith in Rooney to come back in form, but he's been off form for the majority of the past 2 years now you'd have to say, with only a few good months here and there.

4130~~~
Maybe his missus is having a difficult pregnancy, he has the look of a man having problems elsewhere.

4131~~~
Just needs to be dropped until he has earned a place in the side. The problem there is he needs 6 games to get going after missing 1 game apparently, so he'd never get to fitness/sharpness if he is eventually benched.

4132~~~
Last time he looked like this he was messing around with an escort behind his pregnant wifes back, same again?
You wouldn't rule it out...

4133~~~
He's past it, the only times he's looked even anywhere near adequate to the level required to play for us is against lower level opponents. The sooner we drop him, the better we'll be.

4134~~~
What did Owen say about him?

4135~~~
I just don't get what is happening to him suddenly. He seems to have lost fitness, technical ability and mental strength (and seemingly desire) all the same time. Even though we keep hoping that it is a temporary phenomenon, he doesn't seem to be able to show any evidence that he can turn it around.

4136~~~
IMO, the problem with Rooney is that he himself has now realized that he's quickly fading away from being a top player. And he can't deal with it. You can see that he's not only under pressure, he doesn't seem to be enjoying himself at all.

In previous seasons, when he was playing this poorly, he'd still look positive and enjoy playing.

4137~~~
Because for Schweinsteiger it's a bad day, but for Rooney it's the norm. Nobody cares if Rooney had a bad game, but he's been having a bad 10 games (bar Brugge), and longer before that.

4138~~~
I think his technical ability is normal. He just missed a sitter today. Linked okay on the penalty. 

He definitely looks slower to me, though. Significantly. I think that's the issue.

4139~~~
When will he be dropped? Surely it's a matter of time?

4140~~~
Really really poor 2nd half from him. I was expecting him to the very least lead the team when we were being put under pressure but, he was just done. The play around the 84:45ish mark - Young takes a throw in to Schneiderlin and he is coming in field, being surrounded by 3 Wolfsburg players and Rooney is right in between them clogging up the space even more leading to Schneiderlin give away the ball. What's worse after that is even though Schneiderlin is further up the pitch, Rooney makes no effort to get back and luckily enough Schneiderlin who did get back and foul Draxler did not get a second yellow.

I started the season thinking he is going to really do well this year with the focus being back on him much like when Ronaldo left - he'll be playing with that burning desire but, either because he just doesn't have that fight left in him or his legs have really gone (or both), his performances are definitely starting to make me think - we are in a big world of hurt if the Martial bubble bursts. 

Arsenal next and that's cannon fodder for him usually - hopefully todays dire performance can spur him for the game.

4141~~~
See the old video posted above. While he always was a bit inconsistent, when was the last time he was good/excellent? His passing, first touch, heading, etc., have all seemingly regressed.

4142~~~
Try 10 months and you're probably closer to how long Rooney has been having his poor form for.

4143~~~
He made a few runs tackling the Wolfsburg defenders/midfielders when everyone was tired in the end that looked like the old Rooney, but was poor for the majority of the second half.

4144~~~
Dear Rooney, please dont keep giving awesome passes to opposition players <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Watta miss.. He should dig his head in the sand and stay there <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

But the captain wont be dropped. So I pray he hits the form before mid season at least.

4145~~~
This is almost definitely his worst spell so far, yeah. What gives me some hope is form after his transfer request in 2011 was woeful (if not as prolonged), and the bolded bit was completely applicable then, and he bounced back and produced some of the best form of his career later than season.

4146~~~
Rooney was poor last night. He's been poor for a while though, I actually can't remember when the last time he had a good game.

It's only a matter of time before we get a replacement in for him. No wonder we were apparently chasing Kane during the summer

4147~~~
comfortably our worst player this season

4148~~~
I felt a bit sorry for him yesterday actually. Was quite sad to see him unable to do the things he wanted his body to do... I mean, a lot of the endeavor was there, it was just the execution, eye-foot coordination that continually let him down.

4149~~~
Not a good game from Rooney, but he's had those before while still putting away easy chances. But my goodness that shot in the first half was bloody terrible, felt bad for him when he skyed it. I'm hoping that he steps it up this weekend, there's a chance he might, seeing as he likes to score against Arsenal. Could kickstart his individual season.

4150~~~
Last time I remember him playing with some real fire in the belly was against Spurs after the "knockout headlines" were all over the tabloids. Scored a fabulous goal that day did the famous celebration and was brilliant overall. For what it's worth I think he's on a steep decline and finished as a top player but I'd like to see that fire back at least.

4151~~~
On merit - based on the form of players in 2015 or so - Naysmith would easily start ahead of Rooney.

4152~~~
It's barely tolerable now that he has a free pass based on his showings on the pitch. Now imagine if we get to the knockout stages against a big club, and he's still lumbering about. I think LVG needs to have a good think about rather he wants to be successful here, or give into a 300k a week player that's holding back the team.

4153~~~
For me the fire in his belly has gone. He used to be a player that was passionate and went to war every game, but now he looks like he's just going through the motions and plays just because he has too. 

People keep using the stat about him being a high distance cover in games, but most of that distance is covered in long runs up and down the pitch, rather than using that energy stretching defences or offering movement to recieve a pass.

I don't know if maybe his stint in midfield has confused him about what he's actually supposed to do, but the striker play between him and martial is like night and day these days. I can't believe how poorly he uses his body to shield the ball and his first touch is just so hard and lumpy, he never looks like the ball is fully under control. 

It's such a shame as he used to be such a fabulous player, but for me he looks he has almost had enough, compare his desire to ronaldo's and you see the big difference.

4154~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4155~~~
Should we start booing rooney???

<span style="color: #ffffff">Hide for cover</span>

4156~~~
No

Although, what some of us do in our own home, whilst sitting in our armchair, is our own business <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4157~~~
Ever heard of Sgt. Wyde Techst?

4158~~~
I think we should, kick some arse into him, will make it easier for LVG to drop him, maybe the media will notice that Rooney isn't that golden boy nomore.

He deserves it imo, if there's any other way other than booing to let him know that we're fed up with his continuous shite performance every fecking week.

4159~~~
Nope

The media will never ever turn on him, unless it's something to do with his personal life.

4160~~~
Indeed you are correct. Hasn't started the season consistently brilliant has Gribbin, but he has shown far more flashes of it than Rooney. And yes, I appreciate it's a different level.

4161~~~
Once was warrior.... Now, he's nothing more than a ball & chain. Martial & Pererra looked like they felt obliged to pass it to him last nite, and in turn, Rooney in turn, done his level best to knock it 30yards backwards.... God forbid he kickstarted an attack.
Surely it's only going to be a matter of time before Luis swallows that stubborn pride of his and at least subs Rooney off.... The lads been offering nothing for months.

4162~~~
feck him, we created the star in him (although him being a very good footballer is to his credit), we have a few bankable faces in our team (Luke Shaw, Darmian, BFS, Martial, Memphis), time to make a new poster boy out of them and phased out the last remaining old guard.

I'm really sick of him getting carte blanche every game and he didn't even bothered to do anything about being shite. Forget about scoring, he didn't even do the basic right, it seems he didn't even try to focus. Age and decline has nothing to do with doing the basic right. 

He's lost his head, and probably will never get that back again.

4163~~~
Was it Scholes who said Rooney would be done when 30 comes around?

Maybe not but, some football pundit said it

4164~~~
Why the hell should we want the media to turn on him? If you guys are serious, than you are a couple of idiots. It's well known that he needs his time to hit form, so LVG will know it too, if he continues to play like he has so far, LVG will drop him, he wants to have success in his last 2 seasons as a manager, and if Rooney's in that way he won't continue playing him, but should Rooney hit form he would be a huge contribution to the team, that's the reason why LVG plays him. However, for me personally it's hard to believe that he won't hit form again, he's only 29 after all, pretty sure LVG thinks that way too.

4165~~~
Don't think we should ever boo our players. He might be poor at the moment but he isn't underperforming on purpose.

4166~~~
He said something like that prior to the last world cup, that Rooney should think about adjusting his game and moving back to centre-midfield, in order to still play at top level.

4167~~~
No.

4168~~~
How long should we wait?

He has been playing like this for a good few month, how long should we wait? 

What are we waiting for? Those ages aren't going to come back

4169~~~
Exactly, it will be even harder for him to hit form if that happens, which isn't in our interest at all. It's not like Rooney himself will be happy with his performances so far this season.

4170~~~
That's up to the manager to decide, if he hits form he is a huge help, that's why it's worth the <i>gamble</i>, if you want to call it that way, I just don't see how booing him or turning the media on him could be in our interest.

4171~~~
His last on form was a good few years ago. We're basically have been waiting for a good few years for him to hit his form.

4172~~~
Right, we won't see the Rooney from 2007 anymore, I think everyone knows it. I myself am not a big Rooney defender and I found it a bit of a warning that he didn't seem as fit as last season at the start of the season, but turning the media on him or even booing him is a stupid idea, our hope is that he gets a nice run and hits form, how much time he'll get is up to LVG, if he does, we'll have a great player, if he doesn't it's time to drop him, LVG knows it, he's not stupid, I just think it's too early into the season to decide something as important as that. Besides, it's not as if Herrera has set the league alight as a No. 10 so far.

4173~~~
LVG has to drop him, it's simple as that. As long as he knows he's gonna play every match no matter how terrible he was previous one I doubt we'll see any kind of improvement from him. Last night was really hard to watch at times, highlight for me was at the end of match when he was running with the ball with no one challenging him and he managed somehow to stumble over the ball and lose possession, as if he forgot how to run straight. Was sure he'll produce if given chance to play as a striker and now been proved wrong. For Uniteds sake he needs to sit on the bench, and sooner the better.

4174~~~
So so bad. Sad to see him like this. 

The annoying thing is without Rooney we'd not only look better, but we'd have a real shot at the title. Unfortunately for LvG he's stuck with him and it'll undermine his time here as manager.

4175~~~
This is turning into a real problem. Not only is he playing shit, he look so disinterested and casual at times. The most infurirating thing is he seems to play week in, week out regardless of his performance.

4176~~~
If Wayne Rooney were a foreigner soaking up £250k + a week and performing like he has done all season so far, the press would be all over him and calling him done.

4177~~~
English press having a bias on english players, why is that so shocking? It's like that in every country.

4178~~~
Like they did with Falcao last season and this season at Chelsea? Oh wait, they didn't, did they?

4179~~~
I would be absolutely disgusted if that happened.

If anyone sat around me did that... well... I'd give them a disapproving glare, that's for sure.

4180~~~
He has been on a massive decline for 12-18 months, This isn't bad form, It's a player who is past it.

4181~~~
I don't think that's definitive yet, he wasn't as shit as people make him out to be.

4182~~~
Isn't definitive? what more evidence do you need? In fact, just let the rest of the season play out and that will finally tell you all you need to know.

4183~~~
Leave the press, imagine if mata, had 1 league goal from months, with only 1-2 assists in the league, he would get slaughtered on here, he already did a few weeks back, people saying hes a luxury player etc

Rooney is well passed it should be dropped indefintely, bring nothing to the team bring in herrera, theres a player who loves the club, and didnt join for the money, hes proper quality and is just stagnating on the bench

4184~~~
Scholes seems a bit of an idiot though and talks a large amount of rubbish.*

Latest was him going on last night about how Rooney will definitely get 20-25 goals this season.


<span style="font-size: 12px">*Usual disclaimer about how I know that he was a briliant player and I love him bla bla.</span>

4185~~~
I will.

4186~~~
He's definitely inconsistent in his opinions.

4187~~~
It must scare Rooney to see how quickly Martial has settled, and how much he's contributing in the role that Rooney was so poor in only a month ago.

4188~~~
It's about time Louis grew a pair of balls and dropped his captain for a few games. Let the shock waves trickle down and keep the rest of them on their toes. We'd be playing with 11 men too while he'd having a little chat with himself on the bench.

4189~~~
Yeah, I agree. There's some logic in persisting with him in the hope he finally hits some form (because he's such a good player at his best) but you also have to be careful you don't reach a point where the rest of the team get pissed off at seeing someone continually get games at the expense of their mates, while not performing well enough to justify his selection. The whole thing is a crying fecking shame. If he'd kicked on from his recent goals the way he usually does in seasons past then we'd be perfectly set for our next run of games. As it is, there's a cloud over the team right now. Which is a terrible situation to be in at the start of such a tough month.

4190~~~
Bearing in mind the person making that suggestion, I suspect it's not going to be an issue at an actual football stadium any time soon...

4191~~~
There you have it, Pogue calling Rooney to be dropped, I've finally seen it all.

4192~~~
He should have really worked on his midfield game when he was given ample opportunity to play in that role. I just do not see him holding down no.9/10 for too much longer if he continues to put in lackluster performances. He should stick to Bastian like glue and learn from him if he wants to prolong his career at the highest level. Having the touch of a donkey does not help. His vision and passing variety is his only saving light.

4193~~~
If it was up to me, he'd have been sold years ago. 
But now with the current situation, I don't think we have a choice to stick with him until January at the very least. If he doesn't pick up his form by then, our season will be a write off in terms of challenging for the league and I'd honestly much rather the games go to Wilson. LVG though, seems to have a massive blind spot when it comes to Wayne, for reasons I really can't seem to understand.

4194~~~
I wasn't making a point, just observing the unfortunate situation, given that Gribbin just put in the worst performance I've ever seen from him.

4195~~~
Playing in centre midfield takes a lot of running, as much as playing as a nine. Scholes' understanding of timing and space allowed him to do it. Rooney doesn't have the same game intelligence. Rooney also lacks Scholes' close control and short passing. He will never be a centre midfielder.

Rooney will however score at Arsenal and be man of the match. I thought he was dreadful against Wolfsburg, really dreadful. He does look lost right now. Still, he always responds when seriously questioned. You just feel when everyone is writing him off he will explode. If Rooney doesn't star on Sunday then he really is gone.

4196~~~
I still expect him to score against Arsenal, despite his current problems. And that would be fantastic.

4197~~~
Damn right it is... <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

4198~~~
When Rooney missed that sitter yesterday, the camera showed LVG's reaction to it and he instantly went to write something down.

He must surely be dropped soon. Even if it's for a couple of games and him coming on as a sub - any other player would have been dropped by now.

4199~~~
He was abysmal yesterday. And I mean fking abysmal.

He couldn't trap anything to feet. He was tackled with his back to goal time and time again. A 19 yo French kid playing in a foreign league showed more heart and desire than Rooney, and was a million times better with his back to goal. Martial was holding up play for us, bringing others in. Rooney couldn't do any of this.

He was half assed jogging when they were dominating (after Schweini got subbed off...a terrible substitution and turned the nature of the tie). But yea, he wasn't tracking any of the runs and was giving away possession <i>so</i> cheaply. He has 0 pace, he is so predictable, there were moments when there were breaks on and he literally couldn't run more than 15 years before someone caught up.

He missed a sitter and his passing was fkin diabolical. They nearly scored off one of his shite cross field/along the floor passes that he was pissing around with just outside of our own box. He was utter shite. We were playing with 10 men essentially. 

I'd love to know what our Rooney lovers thought of yesterdays performance. <a class="username" data-user="21966, @UnofficialDevil" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21966/">@UnofficialDevil</a> <a class="username" data-user="61812, @Mrs Smoker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61812/">@Mrs Smoker</a> <a class="username" data-user="65492, @NessunDorma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65492/">@NessunDorma</a> .

4200~~~
"Wayne not happy with pitch, fire groundsman"

4201~~~
He actually stamped on the pitch after he spurned that chance. I couldn't believe he was trying to blame the pitch.

4202~~~
Good in first half, bad in second.

4203~~~
What did he do that was good in the first half?

4204~~~
I can't see him being dropped. Arsenal, Everton, City coming up, he's certain to start all three.

4205~~~
Ran well, pressed well, passed well (couple of lovely passes to Martial, one that almost had Depay in great chance, and a pass that enabled Mata to get a penalty).

Ridiculous miss also. But that was just in solidarity with Ronaldo and Chicharito. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

4206~~~
Last night was the ultimate drunk Rooney performance.

He was stumbling about like he'd just sank a litre of vodka.

4207~~~
Some people are still thinking that it's all about finding his form

Is it really all about form? What kind of form are you guys expecting he'll suddenly hit?

4208~~~
The name change seems to have done wonders for Smalling. Maybe Rooney needs a name change too.

4209~~~
He did some good things, but overrall I thought he was poor. A few good passes yes.
Overrall slowed the game down and lost posession more often. Running with the ball on the break and just doing nothing with it. Don't understand what his role in the team is at present.
I really do hope he finds some form, but atm he is a player that seems to be playing with 0 confidence

4210~~~
He hasn't been the same since the hair transplant IMO. Maybe they botched the operation and it's affected his brain in some way?? Could be nonsense but I think the club should investigate it

4211~~~
Got a 7 in The Sun <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4212~~~
His best season came right after the transplant, so if anything, he should get another one.

4213~~~
I know mate, complete farce.

Don't know if you play dreamteam, but his points tally = absolute fraud. No doubt biased scores to keep the masses of rooney-led teams happy.

4214~~~
he should have scored and lost the ball a few times - other than that there were also some nice passes and some good movement. imo an average game by him but not the end of the world. really hope he can up his game and form a partnership with martial.

4215~~~
Samson in reverse.

4216~~~
Hmm interesting. Well at least we've got to the root of the problem and know it's something to do with the hair transplant.

4217~~~
Had to google that....

According to the biblical account, Samson was given <a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">supernatural</a> strength by God in order to combat his enemies and perform heroic feats<a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson#cite_note-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a> such as killing a lion, slaying an entire army with only the <a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">jawbone</a> of an <a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asinus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ass</a>, and destroying <a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaanite_religion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a pagan temple</a>. Samson had two vulnerabilities, however: his attraction to untrustworthy women and his hair, without which he was powerless. These vulnerabilities ultimately proved fatal for him.

Rooney certainly has problems with women considering the granny incident so you might be onto something

4218~~~
He was also blind, so that explains Wayne's miss last night.

4219~~~
he was also scouse. coincidence?

4220~~~
Thread is screaming for some Tom fecking Jones

4221~~~
That's why I have kept him in my team, because even though he is utter balls on the pitch, The Sun still give him great scores every week. Comical really.

4222~~~
He always scores and finds form against Arsenal. This weekend is probably my last hope at this point.

4223~~~
Can see him retiring in several years and a lot of us forgetting what a great player he was. I mean Gary Neville was pretty awful for his last couple of years, but he was also injured quite a lot and rotated a lot if I remember correctly, so he's remembered as the marauding full back who's crosses were Beckham-like.

However I'm already starting to forget what a peak Wayne Rooney was like. Will anyone remember the great player he was if he spends another 4 seasons stinking the place out, after the 4 mediocre seasons he's already had? I genuinely can't imagine any fan that after 8 seasons of being poor-mediocre would remember him with anything other than disdain; regardless of records for goal scoring.

4224~~~
Please god not several more years of this shite!

4225~~~
I personally believe Van Gaal will finally admit defeat and let his ego be harmed by the end of the season. But it took Fergie 4 years to realise that Berbatov was a square peg in a round hole, despite most fans seeing it within 6 months. There's always the chance that managers with huge ego's that they stick by their convictions for 3-4 years before admitting defeat.

If that's the case we could certainly see another couple of seasons of him. Then if Van Gaal leaves and a new manager comes in the process could repeat itself, particularly as the Football world as a whole seems immune to noticing Rooney's bad form. Journalists, players and managers alike are still praising him regularly and giving him positive ratings irrespective (the latest of which was Owen & Scholes last night saying he wasn't at his best but he'll always come good) so you'd forgive someone for thinking he's still playing decent.

4226~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4227~~~
How did Rooney lose his PK responsibilities?  Didn't he let Chicharito take one against Brugge when he got his hat trick?  Can't recall any other PK opportunities between then and yesterday.  Not complaining mind, just curious.

4228~~~
Missed a penalty at Anfield end of last season (and quite a few others over the years).

4229~~~
Yeah but wasn't he on PK duties against Brugge just several weeks ago?  Thought he allowed Chicharito to take his PK in an attempt to get his confidence going.

4230~~~
Mata was not on the pitch at that time. He would've been the first in line. Herrera is probably second at this point (he was also already subbed off against Brugge).

4231~~~
Mata > Rooney > Herrera > ... who knows >

Mata was not on at the time.

4232~~~
Rooney and Mata played against Liverpool and Herrera took the Pen that day, who knows what the system is <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4233~~~
Rooney had lost penalty duty after missing one. Mata was the penalty taker but had been taken off, so Ander was next in line.

4234~~~
Nah, Rooney was injured and didn't play and Mata was subbed off 5 minutes before the penalty.

I'm sure if Mata was still on against Liverpool when we got the pen he'd have taken it.

It's about time Rooney was taken off penalties anyway. His record is crap.

4235~~~
I think at this point the order is Mata - Herrera - Young - Rooney. Some new players like Bastian, Memphis or Martial might be on the list too, but I don't know where exactly.

4236~~~
You mean his problem is psychological? Like, I did a bloody transplant but it's not working for the long term??? That should be considered indeed.

4237~~~
Rooney is at the back of the list because he missed his last penalty. It's a simple procedure for van Gaal - if you miss the next in line becomes the taker. Mata is currently it, Ander only took it vs Liverpool because Mata wasn't on the field.

4238~~~
The definition of insanity...

4239~~~
Ah right, I have a bad memory. I wonder if Martial will develop into our number 1 penalty taker considering how ice cold he is infront of goal

4240~~~
Given the cafe's collective Roondown about his performance against Wolfsburg, I thought I might be seeing misplaced passes and miscontrols galore... along with negativity in his direction of passing. 

Of course not. We have one appalling missed chance, and a very few minor errors. Not at his best by any means, but far from stinking the place out. 

Admittedly he did not link up with Martial directly as much as we might have hoped, but he did find many good passes to keep attacks moving, and there weren't any obvious missed chances to pass that I recall. Can it be that the harsh glare of the miss affected peoples' vision?

4241~~~
That's because he's mostly being at the wrong place and the wrong time, leaving his teammates unwilling to pass to him, even when they eventually do, he manages to screw up more than 50% of it

4242~~~
To be honest Rooney needs a really, really good performance to get "supporters" like the CAF of his back. He's not in great form but he's an important part of this team I still believe.

4243~~~
Neither were on the pitch at the time

4244~~~
Thats not a good thing, considering that



The next game after this is away in Merseyside where he is always a passenger. Imagine him in this kind of form, oh my...

4245~~~
So here's the punchline... apparently he's on the shortlist for the Ballon d'or.

4246~~~
There is usually a polarising omission in the England squad at major tournaments, and next year it's going to be Rooney in France.

4247~~~
Not a chance, he glcould only score two goals between now and then and he'd still start in some position.

4248~~~
Based on ?

4249~~~
Steven Gerrard.

4250~~~
Improve,  persistence is for youth.  We wait patiently for ronaldo back then, we persist with de gea,  but a 29 years old rooney who plays every match when fit is not something we hope will improve if we persists

At his age and condition he should be pretty much settled,  what you see is what you get, he's not going to improve alot.  Any 30 years old players will probably found his level,  a few anomalies where they play a blinder or a stinker,  but they're pretty much what they are. 

It's not about form as well,  2 years is a long time in football,  if he cant do it nomore he's finished.  What kind of players goes shit for 2 years and blame it on form? Do we have to wait 2 years just to have a few games of inform rooney? 

Rooney is finished at this level, he'll never be the same player we see 5 years ago just like falcao,  rvp are finished.  They might do the job, but nobody in their right mind expect them to be getting back to their form 5 years ago.

4251~~~
Was Hodgson supposed to drop Gerrard from the World Cup squad?

4252~~~
Rooney has made it onto a Ballon d'Or shortlist of 59 players. Staggering, this season or last... blows my mind. 
I can only console myself with the fact that based on this, I must be number 60 or there abouts! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4253~~~
I think he could with a three week "injury" and go off to dubai with a trainer.

He's in crap form and he must know it. It'll be affecting his confidence.

4254~~~
Honestly considering the slip and the effect it had on him he probably should've, despite the fact that it wasn't completely obvious just how done he was due to a decent season for Liverpool before that point.

Gerrard should've retired after Euro 2012 either way though.

4255~~~
Gerrard wasn't 'finished' at the end of the 2013/14 season, so he definitely wasn't awarded any special treatment by being selected.

Every top player has that season where it is apparent to everyone watching, that he is done at the highest level. From all indications, this is probably Rooney's season (still only October).

I doubt he will be selected as a starter next summer,if he fails to pick up form.

4256~~~
He is the captain and also the most experienced in the team.

4257~~~
So, player liaison then?

4258~~~
He has been playing fine for England mate. The last time I checked he has been scoring goals. Unlike, Gerrard who was a totally different case study.

4259~~~
Post was contingent on his overall form becoming/continuing to be shite.

4260~~~
He hasn't been shite for England though. Get it?

4261~~~

4262~~~
You asked why he wouldn't be dropped from the England squad. Anyways, carrying on...

4263~~~
:s

4264~~~
This is becoming truer with each poor performance (can we even call it a poor performance or it's his new norm and the good games that are now too infrequent are the outliers) but the worrying thing is that those in charge at Old Trafford are still waiting and hoping that the Rooney of five years ago will return. The fact that we made our transfer plans with him central to our designs makes one question Van Gaal and Woodward's ability to read trends and accurately predict whether a player's time is up, Fergie saw it two years ago but this lot couldn't or can't until it hits them hard on the pitch.

4265~~~
He was though. The slip affected him mentally to the point that it broke him completely, he was in no fit state to play for England at a World Cup.

Then from the start of last season it was obvious he was done.

4266~~~
he hasnt been club form shite, but nothing of note bar stepping up for a few penalties

4267~~~
It's really not that deep.

The slip was just a terrible moment in a decent season. Most of the players at the WC were gash.

You really can't (and shouldn't)compare Gerrard's 2013/14 to Rooney's current season ( based on the assumption that this bad form will continue till the end).

4268~~~
Woy would never do that..he is a weak weak yes man.

4269~~~
Thats something Fergie used to do..unfortunately the run of games in October is problematic.

4270~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJgoHsAFTTo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

The more I think about this, the more I think that Wayne is getting a bit lost in the transition to LVG's new United.  Not sure he's figured out how to play the 10 spot yet.  After all, he's a pretty good player to have the ball fall onto his right foot at the top of the box.  See link above... was just last season and he hit some real winners.

4271~~~
He stirred up an old hornet's nest with his 'I never asked for a transfer' comments and got a bollocking I reckon.
The documentary will be interesting given that Lineker has never hidden his dislike of utd and never misses a chance to stick the boot in. As captain of MUFC he should have avoided anything controversial especially at this stage in our season. I'm certain Fergie has plenty of power left in the boardroom and will have ordered an old fashioned hiding. He was showing signs of form before that came out.

4272~~~
I think Rooney will be ok soon,just a bit down on confidence imo.

4273~~~
We can't afford to carry any passengers on Sunday. For the love of God Mr Rooney, please show up.

4274~~~
I'm a critic of Rooney and I will explain why.

1. He is average. Not bad...just average. On its own, this is not a problem. But when when you combine this with (2), it becomes a problem.
2. He is undroppable. This means that we have no choice but to see him play, with no chance to see him subbed or benched. This is frustrating, as in some games it is like we are playing with 10 men. 
Falcao was this player last year, but still kept getting starts. Mourinho this year is not as forgiving and is not giving Falcao any EPL starts. I think Falcao started in the league cup when Chelsea scored 4. But Falcao scored a big fat zero. Rooney is basically following in Falcao's footsteps, 1 year later.
3. Now that we have Martial - a player who actually wants to score - we are seeing side by side performance comparisons and it really is showing up how poor Rooney is in comparison.
Martial, when he gets the ball, goes straight for goal and runs at pace.
Rooney, when he gets the ball, stops or back passes and allows the opponents to organise themselves.

On a positive/bizarre note: when Rooney first arrived at MUFC he was seen as a working class, uncouth scouser, who doesn't know how to speak. But from what I understand, off-the-pitch this guy knows how to talk to people and behaves in a way you'd expect of a middle manager (on his way to becoming a senior manager). His behaviour encourages people to respect him. Off the pitch (and I think this is what LVG means when he says Rooney is the best Captain), he is everything you'd want in a club captain.

Off pitch: 29 year old Rooney is actually pretty good.
On pitch: Not so good.

4275~~~
Controlling a football or running with it aren't really dependant on the manager's system.

4276~~~
The good thing (from our perspective) is that Wayne has the opportunity to prove his critics wrong each and every week, with a goal or two, one good performance or more. Cards on the table: my concerns about Rooney range from the perceivably silly and trivial (I wasn't best pleased by his removal of all United-related imagery from his Facebook page at the height of Wayne's problems with SAF) to the sensible and basically impersonal (concerns about his poor form's effect on the club's future progress); <i>but</i>...he can always silence my doubts - he surely has that within him still - and, as a United supporter, I'd be overjoyed if he shut me up. There are very few actual 'Rooney haters'; instead, there are many who, like me, just want Wayne to play in a way that befits his status at the club and in the press. We're not asking for the totally unreasonable, such as world-class performances every game, just a level above basic competence.

4277~~~
Its just more excuses.

The same excuses we heard all last season regarding Falcao and RVP's form. Hardly the managers fault that a player can't actually control a ball, no matter what system is being used.

4278~~~
Why not though? He demanded the big bucks and should be delivering the performances that he's being paid to produce.

4279~~~
That's not going to happen though is it. We overpaid to keep him for another contract cycle and are just going to have to get on with Rooney on the wane - hope for the best and possibly look at alternatives in the summer.

4280~~~
I just don't think it's fair to demand that of any player, regardless of their salary. No player in the world maintains that standard.

4281~~~
Excellent post. But I think there definitely are a handful on here who are basically pleased - even if they're not entirely conscious of it - when he's poor. Not because they hate him, but because they've spent a long time thinking and arguing that he's bad and have lost sight of the fact that it would surely be better for them if he proved them wrong with a run of excellent form than proving them right by playing poorly.

4282~~~
Funnily enough, despite my probable reputation as a Rooney hater, if I miss a game one of the first things I do when I come to the Caf is check this thread, in the hope that Wayne's played well. There's no joy at all (for a United fan) in being right if this negatively affects the club/team.

4283~~~
I can't stand the spud faced chancer but would still be delighted if he found his old form as that's a good thing for the club I love. I don't think he will though.

4284~~~
I say let him retain his place for this match. If he's still poor, throw on Perreira or Herrera for him in the 60th minute, and if they take their chance let them keep their place in the next match.

4285~~~
They're not finding fault though.  Rooney hasnt prooved them wrong so far. 

Could make a case if he's starting to picking up form.  But so far he hasnt.  He's gone to a new low every gamr

4286~~~
Personally I think he is done. When you consider all factors I don't think he will have another standout season again. May have the odd game here and there but even that seems like a reach these days.

4287~~~
I'm not just talking about this current slump, I'm talking in general. This handful of posters are generally happiest when he's in bad form.

That's not true. There's no denying he's been poor, but his last couple of games have probably been his best of the season so far. Yes, he missed that sitter against Wolfsburg but his general play was much better. And he's starting to show the odd good moment, like that excellent turn and counter attack against Sunderland. He looks much more comfortable behind Martial.

4288~~~
He needs to score more. He feels that need more than anyone else. He will eventually beat the club record. Then I feel he will leave for the US after mutually agreeing to tear up the contract.

4289~~~
I don't think he has it in him to beat the club record

4290~~~
A couple of matches in cups vs crap sides and Martial crossing it onto his knee. I see opportunity.

4291~~~
How far off is he? 17 goals is a large number. . He will struggle to score another 10 this season and stay beyond this season.

4292~~~
Its 15.

Even if he continues to stay shite he'll get there some point next season you'd think.

4293~~~
If he's still here next season...

4294~~~
If him beating that record somehow hastings his departure, them I'd be glad for him to do it this season.  On the other side, it would mean he would score 20 goals this season. I can't imagine the club selling a captain that had just scored 20 goals.

4295~~~
He will beat the record this season.

4296~~~
Yeah thats the only way I can see him not getting it.

4297~~~
If he stays yes eventually he'll get there.. but his only chance of easy goals is FA cup ties and the odd league game fluke. I can't see him scoring 15 this season.

4298~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4299~~~
Never really got the point/effect of these cliche, unwarranted, green smiley replies to an opinion/opinions.

4300~~~
Rooney has scored 20 or more goals in a season for us four times, to break the record this season he needs 15 goals I think? Which would put him on 20 for the season. Given he is currently on a dire run of form which he shows now signs of being ready to stop, you seriously think he will break the record this season? I think <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> is a perfectly valid response.

I'd love him to do it, added to the goals martial is bringing and our solid defence it would make us strong title challengers but it ain't likely mate.

4301~~~
Still doesn't make the response any less puerile. You are well within your rights to disagree with the prediction.

4302~~~
The only answer to delusion is mockery

4303~~~
5 goals in 10 apps would actually suggest that, even as the worst player in the world, he is still capable of scoring goals. But, i guess anything to whip out the simp smileys.

4304~~~
its not unreasonable to assume this. If we remain in all competitions, we have more than enough games. He is getting his form back. The goals will come.

4305~~~
Yeah. with 5 goals already as dross, any slight improvement from him and he will continue to increase his tally, especially with the quality around him.

4306~~~
Martial is already having a big impact. The understanding between the two will improve with each match.

4307~~~
We aren't going to play cannon foster like Brugge or Ipswich enough times this season for him to rack up the required  goals

4308~~~
Has a heap of critics to prove wrong and I really hope he does so. Here's hoping for a solid performance against the Arses.

4309~~~
I want him gone but I desperately  want him to do well for our sake.

4310~~~
Rooney supporters keep bringing up those goals at Brugge.

That team was so bad, that the manager (the previous week) stated that they will not be able to win the match as most of their first teamers are injured. This was one of the first times that I've seen a manager capitulate, on TV, 1 week before the game.
I'd go so far as to say that that team which we faced in the 2nd leg, would struggle to beat a league 2 side.

In the Ipswich game, the manager put out a virtual B team, making <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34265442" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">11 changes across the team.</a> Indeed, Ipswich came under criticism for using such a  weak side.

He did score in our last EPL game, but that was a ricochet which bounced off of his knee. He was in the right place at the right time, so I won't complain about that one.

Rooney cannot rely on lucky bounces or teams fielding their U21 or B teams. This is why I tend to look at EPL goals as the yardstick for a striker/goals. EPL matches rarely field B teams.
I believe Rooney has played in 6 EPL games, scored 1 goal. At his current scoring rate, he will finish with 6.33 goals for the season, which is abysmal, when you consider that Vardy (yes, the guy who was playing in the Conference a few years back) already has 7 goals to his name. Ighalo (who?) and Mahrez (who?) have 5.

As one of the highest paid footballers in the World. The Captain of MUFC. Undroppable. I expect far more than this.

PS: He probably will get the club scoring record this year, because we are going to be playing in all competitions and he will play in every game (undroppable). I also expect him to improve his form slightly.

4311~~~
What a performance by the Captain and our best paid player. Top 10 United leg-end.

4312~~~
Some of our players have gone invisible but Rooney has been worse. Passing poorly, movement is poor and he's been pushed off the ball which is bizarre.

4313~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's been so bad it's impossible. I fully expect his fans to gather around here and point out forward passes.

4314~~~
He's had as bad a season as Ivanovic has for Chelsea. 

Knee jerk to say he's finished, but he's doing himself no favours. He shouldn't be in the side. Simple as that.

4315~~~
He's become our very own Gerrard.

4316~~~
To add to his recent poor performances, he now looks completely spineless out there at the minute. He's not a captain/leader. He's invisible.

4317~~~
Steven Gerrard

4318~~~
He's unfathomably bad. We'd be better off playing with 10 men. How he has anyone left still defending him is beyond me.

4319~~~
I am finished with Rooney. I usually take a cautious approach with my criticism as I believe a player can still find form if he has shown glimpse of quality in the past, but he looks finished. He needs to get dropped then sold. We would have been better if we had kept Januzaj, Welbeck or Kagawa.

4320~~~
Don't worry lads, he always takes time to come to his own. It's around the corner.

4321~~~
Even when the rest of the team, to a man, are putting in some of the worst performances I hope I ever have the displeasure of seeing from them in a United shirt, Rooney manages to comfortably out-awful them.

4322~~~
Playing well IMO idk what people are getting angry about.

<span style="color: #ffffff">You gonna bite? I bet you are!</span>

4323~~~
Piss off Rooney. Just piss off.

4324~~~
Doesn't appear to want it as much as he used to. 

Lack of intensity to his game and that used to be his strength.

4325~~~
Probably done, isn't he? Stick a fork in him

4326~~~
The whole team is crap today but that doesn't excuse the fact that he is crap as well. Again.

No sharpness

4327~~~
Sack Louis, sell Rooney.

4328~~~
Still got more bite than Rooney's performance!<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

4329~~~
Rooney needs to feck off to MLS with the other past it players

He's finished as a top level footballer anyone who says any differemt is in denial

4330~~~
He's been poor all season. When the rest are poor as well, we look to him to raise his game as he used to. He isn't capable of it anymore it seems and he's a liability.

4331~~~
Yeah he's done sadly.

4332~~~
Never mind Rooney - Gary Neville is the personification of the Coronation Street theme. Depressing gonk.

4333~~~
He should come off for Fellaini.

4334~~~
Or just off.

4335~~~
I'd rather see Fellaini play than him. Honestly offers us nothing

4336~~~
The only thing he offers right now is the odd burst either on the ball or off it (pressing) but that's just not good enough for a PL team. He's literally a championship player if he can't offer decent passing, strikes on goal or intelligent movement.

4337~~~
Yeah, get out.

4338~~~
All you can do is sigh and shrug your shoulders, as you know he's going to continue playing for us for the rest of the season and provide nothing. Just depressing that he is our captain and almost a certainty to start every game.

4339~~~
Hahahaha love it. You could probably make a joke about his dinner habits but I actually like the guy so I won't. He just isn't up for it anymore it looks like

4340~~~
Still tries that silly chip.

4341~~~
Terrible performance all round so I wouldn't necessarily single anyone out.

However, we place extra responsibility on Rooney as he is our captain, best paid player and (supposedly) one of our best players and he has been dire all season....

4342~~~
Another shitty half of football. Actually another normal half of football from him.

4343~~~
He's actually showing some hunger compared to the rest of the team.

4344~~~
wow. that chip forward straight to the goalkeeper

4345~~~
Rooney is offering nothing to Carrick and Shweini offensively of defensively.

Just terrible.

Shame it took for us to got to 3-0 for him to show some "hunger"

4346~~~
This was the kind of game he'd relish. Where the feck is that Wayne Rooney?

Just get rid, what's the point in waiting for his form to 'return' when he's costing us games with his general ineptitude.

4347~~~
He is an important reason why our midfield is completely overrun. It was the same against Wolfsburg. He needs to sit out of the team for a bit.

4348~~~
We're playing shit as team but you expect certain individuals to step it up, took 44 minutes to do something worth talking about, just isn't good enough.

4349~~~
No ones playing well but just get him off please

4350~~~
We end up playing a two man midfield because he always has to be in the side. It hurts the whole team really.

We'd be far better off if we dropped him.

4351~~~
Just doesn't look like a captain. Poor, again.

4352~~~
Look at the difference between him and Ozil, can't believe he starts for Manchester fecking United, he's absolute disgrace.. thanks for being joy to watch in your early years, but you need to go, sell him after the game. 

What has he shown as a captain btw? everybody's tlking about him how he's leader but imagine what would Roy Keane do with us if we were 2:0 down, this would never happen. He's hiding like a little child, the only thing he does is arguing with referee..

4353~~~
He's so meek. Not sure he even cares.

4354~~~
What bothers me the most is his slow defensive play, his attitude is actually embarassing, I bet he couldn't keep Blind from dribbling past him, let alone stronger and quicker players. It's incredible how he is chasing shadows game after game doing terrible job helping the midfield. 

And before someone comes in with stats, I know he's won some balls in this half, but that was mostly by <i>intercepting</i> the play(and I am not talking about that part of defensive gamr) when our other players were pressing and the ball came to him.

4355~~~
Christ, when I think of how Cantona could pull off perfect chips even in the howling wind and rain...and Rooney struggles to pull off <i>one</i>, game after game. Yet <i>Eric</i> was never world-class, so I'm informed...

4356~~~
Get this sack of shite off and bring on Fellaini.

4357~~~
He's racing through adjectives to describe how poorly he is playing. You just know it'll be Martial off for Fellaini and not him though.

4358~~~
I could make an automated response in here after every game. He's that consistently crap.

4359~~~
What can be said that hasn't already been said? He's about as much use as tits on a bull these days.

4360~~~
Worst captain we've ever had. Pay him 30 mil and tell him to feck off.

4361~~~
Also pissed me off when Schweini was defending in the number 10 area and Rooney wasn't even on the screen. Carzola should be getting picked up by Rooney but he's not

4362~~~
We've had a bit of a cull since Van Gaal came in. If Rooney doesn't join the list of departees in the summer we'll be making a terrible mistake.

4363~~~
I think giving him the captaincy has depleted him of his tenacity. He needs to lead by example and play safer, something I noticed last year. Make someone else captain and give him the freedom to be more aggressive.

4364~~~
Had a decent last 5 mins, if that counts for anything..

I'm starting to have a genuine belief that he's got some dirt on van Gaal. There's no other explanation for his consistent selection despite his constant under performance.

4365~~~
Said it in the match day thread. He literally should have been standing on Cazorla after the first goal. Not only his overall play is bad, but his work rate is awful. Just loses the ball and doesn't bother running back.

4366~~~
No point targeting him because everyone has been shite. 


He is finished though.

4367~~~
Wish he would show some hunger like he did for the last 2 minutes all game.

4368~~~
I'd hate to bring up Money but the fact he's putting in pub level performances and he's still earning WEEKLY what it takes the average person 10 YEARS to earn is sickening

4369~~~
Survives again. At least he's on the left now.

4370~~~
LW Rooney now everyone will say he needs time as #9 and #10.

4371~~~
I was actually thinking Schneiderlin on for him. Bastian can move further up when there's space and Schneiderlin protects the back 4. We have no control of the game. I don't think Fellaini will change that and atm Rooney is a passenger.

4372~~~
He's been avoiding 50/50s since SAF was here. Still, that one can join the 'playing out of position', 'LVG's restrictions', 'His wife's pregnancy' and 'Hair medication making him impotent' toilet-roll-length list of excuses.

4373~~~
Out to the left wing. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Hopefully that's LVG edging him towards the exit.

4374~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4375~~~
Look a bit more angry this half. Not sure if that's necessarily a good thing.

4376~~~
He trapped a pass that was fizzed into him. I couldn't believe it.

4377~~~
It surprises me how we are near the top of the league while playing with such a massive deadweight. I think this should speak towards the quality of our team and less towards the lack of competency by our manager.

Most player who put in performances like Rooney for us this season would have been dropped or even substituted long ago.

4378~~~
He's not been anywhere near our worst player today. jeez. Find a new scapegoat.

4379~~~
I've noticed him more since he's been on the LW so, yea better than before.

4380~~~
Bit more involved now it has to be said.

4381~~~
Hes actually been one of our better players today.

4382~~~
No but he has been consistently poor before this game too, which is quite bad when he's supposed to be one of our best and most reliable players. People are reacting to the total of his contribution this season more than this one game.

4383~~~
I love how Rooney praise in 2015 now translates as "well he hasnt been as shit as usual."

4384~~~
Been the best of a bad bunch today

4385~~~
And "well he's not the worst player on the pitch"

4386~~~
Well that's daft. He's the only one to make anything happen today, why waste your time bitching about that?

If your car is broken, you fix it, do you still complain about it being broken?

4387~~~
People should just give up their hopes on him.This is already the best that he can offer.

4388~~~
If it's costing me £300k a week to hire, I expect it to work.

4389~~~
He's our best payed player and supposedly one of our best players. He's not a scapegoat. He's just been massively disappointing this season and the one before arguably.

4390~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4391~~~
Martial says hi.

But really, Rooney's not been as bad as some have made him out to be, especially after he's on the wing. For 300k per week though, you really expect more.

4392~~~
That is a misconception that most Rooney fan will try and say to defend his performance today. Mata and Martial looked more productive in our attack and Rooney's standard in this game is not even worth a complement unless it is based of that he has been better than shite, which is embarrassing from a player who is touted to be our main man in the attack.

4393~~~
He's not been great today as far as I can see. His touch is still poor. He's getting on the ball too deep to create anything. Just because he hasn't given the ball away as much as in recent games, this translates into him having a good game? He's been poor again. And yes, he may well be one of our better players today, but that's not saying much. He's a our highest paid player, our captain and a forward who has created nothing.

4394~~~
shite

4395~~~
Turkey is nice in January

4396~~~
only looked decent today because pretty much every other player on our squad was having a mare.

4397~~~
True. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's been shifted all over the field this past two seasons in an attempt to justify his selection and the "captain always plays" philosophy.

4398~~~
It's not even about the money, when your the captain of United you consistently need to play at a certain level, scoring a hat-trick against some second rate European team and an OK 45 minutes against Arsenal just isn't good enough. If the manager and the supporters are happy with what they're seeing then our standards must have taken a dive.

4399~~~
They should both feck off

4400~~~
He wasn't even 'one of the better', that's pure bullshit easily masked by the second half. He's been starting most of Arse counters, hasn't helped midfield and done feck all in attack.

4401~~~
Makes no difference whatsoever

4402~~~
His new position.

4403~~~
Oh don't get me wrong. I want him to feck off, with his undroppable status and shite performances. It's just I've come to the realisation that no matter how bad we look with him in the side, he'll still be in the side for 90 mins, albeit in different positions just so we can accomodate to him. 

It's a shitty situation, after growing up seeing Alex Ferguson sell first team players to play hungry youngsters, or leaving a supposed superstar like Beckham to play Solskjaer on the right wing. (And seeing those moves turn out to be great moves for <b>the club.</b>)

feck Wayne Rooney, his armband and his undroppable status.

4404~~~
True

4405~~~
Hopefully Everton fancy having him back

4406~~~
Inches wide.

4407~~~
Looks about as finished as Gary Neville at the Hawthorns in 2010.

4408~~~
Wtf was that over hit dribble and dive

4409~~~
I'd laugh if I wasn't so depressed over the result... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4410~~~
There's a lot of moments you catch that demonstrate that despite the idea he works hard (and he does when he wants to), when he loses the ball, he has an awful habit of just shrugging his shoulders and watching the opposition run away. That laziness isn't befitting of a leader.

4411~~~
If he gets injured the team will instantly improve going forwards.

4412~~~
He tries. Or something.

4413~~~
To get the ball back after he loses it.

4414~~~
The only thing you can say about Rooney is he 'gets around a lot' but what exactly is that? I would rather have a number 10 who is creative and/or scores. I'll give it to him he tries, always keeps running and urging the team forward - hes our captain i expect that. BUT with the state of the team we cant have passengers and thats exactly what he is at the moment

4415~~~
It will be a 'Van Persie moment' like last season. Van Gaal does not look willing to drop him at the moment, so we have to hope he remembers he is still a professional footballer and start playing like one.

4416~~~
He was as bad as the rest in the first half. Better second half thiugh

4417~~~
He's actually looked better out wide this second half than Memphis has for most of the season. In an ideal world we'll drop them both, but our squad isn't good enough to do that.

4418~~~
Started yet another counter, saved by a crossbar.

4419~~~
If only that was true. It genuinely doesn't seem like he does 99% of the time.

4420~~~
Waste of space

4421~~~
We need someone to take him out like Phil Bardsley but permanently.

4422~~~
Got rid of the wrong striker.

4423~~~
He was shite. Best league performance of the season?

4424~~~
At this moment in time, a disgrace to UTD's history. He should go/retire before his 'legacy' is jaded.

4425~~~
Just not good. Him and Carrick need to be phased out not starting in the big games.

4426~~~
His best game in ages. Im being serious.
Im not saying he had a good game, just that he was shitter in his previous games.

4427~~~
It's funny I'd say that was one of his better performances this season.

4428~~~
Well they got made captain and vice cpt instead

4429~~~
Sell him for goodness sake. Try and find some club in the MLS that takes the overpaid fecker.

4430~~~
MLS

4431~~~
Agreed, and I really dislike the bloke. He works quite hard, the problem is that his body's declining. He doesn't deserve a place in the starting eleven, and to be honest his contribution on the pitch might be a bit better if he came on as a impact sub.

4432~~~
I'm as critical of him as anyone but I thought he did a lot better today, at least he was in the game for most of the second half this time.

4433~~~
He did well in the 2nd half, actually looked hurt by the result. Credit to him for that but he isn't good enough anymore. Herrera should be our 10.

4434~~~
Awful again today. It will be best for the team if he's dropped or gets injured. There's only so many chances you can give someone. Even if we just pretend he's injured

4435~~~
If he has to play, play him on the wing and play another midfielder.

4436~~~
He was bad and needs to be dropped. Not suggesting he won't ever regain form but for now he is a massive hinderance

4437~~~
He did play with some fire in the second half but things just are not coming off for him.

The spirit is willing but the body and mind are not is a perfect term for rooney this season

4438~~~
It was like playing with 9 men in the first half. Abysmal stuff.

4439~~~
This.

4440~~~
Some players can cope with the gradual regression in ability because they see it coming. He seems to think that he is the same player he was 5 years ago. Even his crossfield balls are terrible these days. That run near the end where he just sprinted into the defence with the ball summed it up - far slower and doesn't have the close control to deal with it like Mata does.

4441~~~
He's been poor in every single game. He's one of our biggest reasons why we look poor upfront. Really time to bench him - we should have done that some time ago

4442~~~
This. Playing him centrally takes away a place from one of our better players. Him replacing Memphis doesn't really harm us as they've both been terrible.

4443~~~
Got slaughtered today but was no where near the worst, Carrick made him look like Bryan Robson. His standard 5/10 fare but no worse.

4444~~~
Was probably our best player today along with Martial. One of the few who looked like they could be fecked actually, he went past players actually too and had some nice touches and that one decent shot. Absolutely no way he should be criticized at all for today.

4445~~~
Thought he did alright in the 2nd half. 1st half passed him by. Wasn't the worst today which is an improvement.

4446~~~
Better in the second half, although still lost the ball a lot and had his usual collection of crap first touches. But his performance in the second half did make me wonder if he should be moved out to the left for a while. Rooney - Herrera - Mata. Thoughts?

4447~~~
Hope he gets a bad dose of diarrhea while on England duty or something. 

Keep him out for a couple of games

4448~~~
Agree fully. Not a fan of Rooney these past 2 seasons but he was actually up for it today. One of the better players for us today.

4449~~~
Did better than Depay on the left. Needs to shoot more.

4450~~~
He wasn't bad today, but we still needed an actual attacking midfielder there. Seemed less of a hindrence when moved out wide, and contributed a little more, as the 3 man midfield didn't include him.

4451~~~
Amazingly enough he wasn't the worst player on the pitch today. 

Even more shocking is he can still sprint, although he was only running in a straight line I was afraid he wasn't even capable of moving with some pace anymore. Too bad he doesn't show this more often.

4452~~~
<i>He's a worldwide football superstar</i>, nearing the level of Messi and Ronaldo in terms of fame, and above Muller, Lewandowski, Sanchez etc; <i>where are his 'superstar' performances?</i>

4453~~~
Did better than Depay isn't much of a compliment.

4454~~~
It's time we start to replace him not just for the long term but for the short term as well. He is so out of form it's crazy he still gets picked.

4455~~~
exactly. first half was pathetic, pulled his finger out in the 2nd as Arsenal were smoking cigars

4456~~~
Looked a little better in the 2nd half, couldn't be much worse though.

Not sure what he brings to the team to be honest. Doesn't look like scoring, doesn't look like he's going to create much and today he should have been stuck on Cazorla to stop him playing.

4457~~~
He'll get the abuse as he's the obvious scapegoat but he was decent today. We had far worse performers in the team.

4458~~~
Expecting absolute pelters for saying this, but he was our best player under the WhoScored rating system.

Thought Martial was probably our most dangerous myself, but after that, you're struggling to say anyone was clearly better than Rooney.

4459~~~
But he will be because it's trending to criticise rooney for everything.

4460~~~
He's been his usual shit today, but to be fair others were worse, so that's something, I guess...

4461~~~
Robert Lewandowski - 5 goals in 9 mins 
Sergio Aguero - 5 goals in 20 mins
Wayne Rooney - 5 goals in 9 months

4462~~~
He wasn't great but better than some others 

Everyone wants him dropped. I doubt it would have made any difference to today's result 

Maybe if we still had robin van Persie though...

4463~~~
He is the 100 lb albatross around our neck...the white pele, successfully ransoming the club for 300k/week and made captain.  The sooner LVG realizes that he hasn't played anywhere near well enough to justify a starting role the sooner we can find someone to play the 10 position to better effect.

4464~~~
So true. Wasn't that bad today but shouldn't be playing in every game.

4465~~~
The white Heskey

4466~~~
Yeah, the last valid argument for those that still want him in this team. It's ok that he's nowhere near good enough as long as we find someone else who has been playing worse than him after each game!

4467~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4468~~~
When he was agressive and running at defenders, we saw some of the old Rooney. Needs to do that more often. Not sure dropping him will help any.

4469~~~
Put the effort in and wasn't as bad as recently but stil pretty poor. There aren't any glimpses of his form returning.

4470~~~
I don't get the flak he's getting from some on here of his performance today. I've been a harsh critic of him this season but he was good today from about thirty minutes on. At least he was constantly trying things and showed a decent amount of passion.

4471~~~
Didn't think he was our worst player today but almost every game that passes is more evidence Ferguson was right to try and offload him in 2013. I don't want to hear another pundit or read another comment about how he's still a 'world class' player because he's not and his play does not justify his huge wage packet whatsoever.

4472~~~
Did well today. He set up some chances and should have shot more.

4473~~~
"but better than some" ffs is that a real improvement or did others fall below the rooney line? he's shit

4474~~~
I agree with this 100 percent

4475~~~
Compared to his previous performances he at least looked like he had some desire in the 2nd half. But unfortunately this is not good enough. Anyway the whole team needs to take stock after this result.

Just wonder if LVG will ever drop him?

4476~~~
The anger he showed when he was kicked down after struggling the ball really looked like frustration with his own inability to do the things that used to come easy to him. 

Looks like his body is out of shape and lags long after his instincts. When he barged into the Arsenal player was another of those moments.

4477~~~
I have been a fan of his, I have defended him for a very long time but no, he wasn't good today, he hasn't been good once this season.

4478~~~
Fellaini and Smalling were both clearly better then Smalling.

So true

4479~~~
Good on the wing. Should start there. Mata as the 10 and Valencia on the right wing.

4480~~~
Everton up next <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

I don't think he'll be showing up anytime soon

4481~~~
It's depressing how bad he is.

4482~~~
Thought he was better today, looked like he had some desire at least

4483~~~
Because we were shit, the difference is that Rooney has been his usual self, while is teammates joined him.

4484~~~
If you look at him now and a picture of him even 2 or 3 years ago, it's clear that's he improved his fitness and his diet, the problem is he's getting older and eventually abusing your body will catch up with you. I can't fault his effort today, it's just that his body is failing him.

4485~~~
Awful today, finding it hard to defend him now days.

4486~~~
Maybe I went over the top when I said he was good today, but it was certainly one of his better games this season.

4487~~~
Showed some desire in the second half but there's no getting away from the fact that he looks past it. These days it's painful watching him.

4488~~~
We didnt need him to be slightly less worse than Depay. We needed him to be much better and he wasnt. That said, him on the wing his far better than anywhere else so far.

4489~~~
That is not true at all. Yes he has lost pace and that is understandable to a certain extent but his piss poor first touch are not as a result of him getting older.

4490~~~
Which is sad, because it wasn't good.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4491~~~
Stick him on the left and ship him off at the end of the season.

4492~~~
He might have improved but he isn't doing enough on the pitch to be first pick for every game, surely even his biggest Rooney apologist can see this.

4493~~~
It wouldn't be so depressing if he wasn't for some inexplicable reason garunteed the shirt every game. And it's not as if we don't have the option to play someone else at 10 either or switch the system and play three central midfielders like we should have been doing this afternoon. Each time he loses the ball or hits a wayward pass I have the words 'the captain shall always play' ringing in my ears.

4494~~~
Great player for us over the years. 

He's finished now though. I don't think that sharpness is something he can get back. He needs to go at the end of the season. The MLS is made for him

4495~~~
I can't believe anyone is defending him, being less shit than Memphis and Carrick were today does not equate to playing well. His first touch has a 20 yard radius, he has no short passing game and can't control the ball properly when trying to run with it.

4496~~~
Better today than he has been I thought, but he was still bad. But so was everyone else.

4497~~~
Pretty much kills every attack with his first touch. If by some miracle he actually manages to keep the ball, its taken him so long that the momentum is gone.

He wouldn't start for any other team in the top 10.

4498~~~
I was going to suggest him playing on the left before the game, and now I wish I had so as not to seem reactionary. But I think if he must play, then out wide would be best for all concerned. It means play won't go through him centrally, hence we won't have to suffer his complete incompatibility in the middle. Out wide at least there's more allowance for error, i.e. it won't be as detrimental to our play.

Would also allow us to go back to 433 which I believe to be our strongest formation with the given players.

Let him compete with Depay who's been off form for weeks now.

4499~~~
An honest question, if he is playing this badly, and it is an known fact that he plays even worse each season in Merseyside, how badly could it be in the next game away at Everton, especially coming from an International window where Woy will still play him? I think it could be quite ugly.

4500~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> You killed my spirit.

4501~~~
Don't even think it. Hopefully we can win without his input (whatever that might be). Must say LVG needs to know now he has to be dropped if he's not offering anything, and feck off to the marketing department if they're the ones who want him to play.

4502~~~
Coupled with that Scouse crowd trying to wind him up...Like they did with Fellaini last season....<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>..Ok, ok...Ill stop.

4503~~~
He was one of our best players in the 2nd half, drastically improved over the first half where the majority of our players were bad.

4504~~~
I have given up on him being dropped..So its not going to happen and we just have to deal with it.

4505~~~
Going after Rooney today shows just how agenda driven some posters are on here, there were atleast 5 or 6 players who had far worse games than Rooney and in the second half he was the only player how showed any kind of hunger to get back into the game. I know he has not been good this season but blaming him today when atleast half the team was playing like donkeys is just silly.

4506~~~
He received the lowest rating out of all the outfield players in today's match, which I believe was uncalled for.

4507~~~
I think Rooney was at his best today. I mean his current best. That's his level nowadays. 

Rooney still has quite a support within the club, from many fans and in the media. Therefore, LVG is reluctant to drop him. LVG is afraid that he could lose the dressing room and become an easy target for Rooney's friends in the media if he puts the latter on the bench. But with Rooney in the team he won't have much success on the pitch either...

4508~~~
I agree that there were worse players but he's the highest paid player, captain, our supposed talisman etc. etc. And the other players who were worse have played much better at points this season whereas Rooney has been poor in most games. If he strings together 4-5 good performances he'd get cut a lot more slack.

4509~~~
His best attack today was when he failed to control the ball which ended at Schweinsteiger who almost scored. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4510~~~
I agree with most of what you say, problem was why he didn't show that hunger in the first 30 minutes.
The game was over by the time he bothered his arse.

4511~~~
Seriously, I'm not taking the piss or being sarcastic, why do we think LVG is persisting with him? I've honestly got nothing beyond he's hoping he might start playing well again.

I will concur that he wasn't too bad today, within the context of the overall performance at least.

4512~~~
A shell of his former self. He was dire in the first half, along with most of the team. In the second half, he was clearly trying to pull the team back into the game, but aside from a couple of steals he really didn't have much to offer. He'll have more good games for United, but it really is starting to look like the writing is on the wall.  Dropping him might make sense, but we really don't have anyone to fill his shoes. Plans need to be made to start phasing him out if the team, and the next two transfer windows should reflect that.

4513~~~
That people cling on to him trying harder or being better than other players today says just how far the expectation has fallen. 

Gone well past some bad form and his performances over months suggest he's done - the odd moment aside, he's offered very little. That he's still first choice for a manager who's declared Falcao, RVP, Hernandez, Welbeck (madness) and Nani as being not good enough, would suggest it won't be long before he's gone. Forget Neymar, Mueller etc, Charlie Austin would offer more.

4514~~~
he put all his bargaining chips on Rooney, and is left with egg on his face. Sent falcao, RVP and Hernandez packing for him. LVG could never have imagined he would be this bad though. If he wants to win a trophy in the next 18 months he has to get him out of the team, but maybe he might just leave it as Giggs' problem and avoid the carnage

4515~~~
I get your points lads but the second half of the game was at exhibition level due to a dominant Arsenal side sitting back and cruising to the full time whistle with the result in the bag. With possession and attacking momentum conceded by choice, if Rooney didn't start performing better it would have been a complete travesty.

Now with that said, it does not excuse the fact that in the first half he was abysmal and a big catalyst to their success from our perspective. Not the only one granted and it would be unfair to pinpoint the entire result on his display as others failed also but his lack of movement, control and awareness was one of the key drivers for Arsenal over running us in midfield.

4516~~~
I wish he had the same mentality as Neville.

Neville knew he was finished and rather than carrying on being a hinderance on the team he retired, wish Rooney had that mentality because he needs to leave the club next summer

4517~~~
Even without RVP and Hernandez it's not as though we don't have other options. Herrera could replace him directly or Mata could move infield with Young on the wing. Even Fellaini or Pereira!

4518~~~
Bitterly disappointed today, it's ok Ian Wright sitting there on Radio 5 saying us fans always blame him when the chips are down, but today the game just passed him by and it's becoming a common theme. 
It's already been mentioned on here how it's frustrating that he seems to be guaranteed a start, but the best he deserved today was to be hauled off at half time.
This man is our captain and top earner, it's about time he backed it up again.

4519~~~
TBF they are hardly setting the heather on fire.

4520~~~
The lies your problem and the majority of Rooney's defenders, it's just not enough for Rooney to look better than six of our players or to deliver something close to the minimum acceptable level of performance. He is our talisman, our captain and his performances have to reflect that because there is no middle ground here. In games like today's he is the one we are supposed to look to for inspiration and leadership. If he can no longer do that then he is no longer fit for purpose and the weakness Van Gaal is showing right now explains exactly why he was a default choice for this job because if any one of the usual suspects were available he wouldn't be here.

4521~~~
point being he put all his faith in Rooney as his 9, and after a month is shown up by a 19 year old. Van Persie would have made a better contribution, but that's all hindsight

4522~~~
Don't wish injuries on players. But really hope he misses the Everton game because we know what we'd get with Wayne at Everton.

4523~~~
the new signings that have just arrived must be thinking wtf?

4524~~~
Stats:
3 shots
2 on target
0 in the box
39/49 passes
79.6% completion
7 short passes failed
3 long passes failed
1 chance created
1/3 crosses

4525~~~
There were glimpses of the old rooney here and there today, still rubbish overall, but there's still hope.

4526~~~
Gonna cause a problem with his teammates for sure. They get their arses hauled for any feck ups but not Rooney. It's human nature that this will start causing resentment amongst the group.

4527~~~
Most of those passes/shots would have been after the damage was done. We had tons of possession after 20 minutes because Arsenal sat back so the stats don't really tell the story, although they're not amazing anyway.

4528~~~
I know mate I know. See my post above that. I left the stats on their own as I'd already made my case today. And have done in every match so far too. If only Fergie had his way after Madrid.

4529~~~
Should have sold him to Chelsea. Hindsight is a wonderful thing though. I hated the idea of him going there are the time.

4530~~~
talisman

4531~~~
Yep, Everton away next.......

4532~~~
Has he given Martial a chance yet? Like set him up

4533~~~
People are actually saying 'he did well today'.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

How many times did he give the ball away, get muscled off it and started Arsenal's attacks for them. I've had enough of him now, I really wish Fergie stayed one more season, because we'll be rid of him. No! Moyes the inept cnut had to ride in and convince him to stay.

4534~~~
Take away the Brugge game and he has 2 goals in 10 games, one to a Championship side and the other bundled in off his knee which he didnt know about. Even his England goals were penalties. He doesn't look a threat at the moment.

4535~~~
Yeah I think he did just before the first half ended, that was the first time I noticed him do some thing.
This is what a lot of us are banging on about but a lot of people take this the wrong way and think it's a dig at Rooney. Was watching the documentary on Cantona after the game and I think it was Bruce who said whenever we were down or looking for a goal we all turned to Eric. This is the role Rooney should have and it's why some supporters like my self aren't happy with his performance. He's suppose to be our talisman. but from what I have seen Martial looks a better fit for that role.

4536~~~
Actually think he wasn't too bad today, especially in the second half. Confidence or no confidence, when things aren't going well, Rooney doesn't shy away from the ball like Mata, etc. He tried to force the issue in the second half. Unfortunately, nothing much come of it.

4537~~~
Game over, that's the problem.

4538~~~
Strange comment.. Mata has been one of United's better attacking players this season. Rooney easily the worst.
1 away league goal in a calendar year.

4539~~~
He only got a little bit more into the game as Arsenal were sitting back and inviting pressure. Which did work out pretty well for them as they could have scored at least twice from those chances. Rooney was shite overall. A little less shite in the second half but still. He is holding us back atm

4540~~~
Hmm...so I must be one of the few that thought he did OK today. Certainly wasn't amongst the worst performers and not the reason we lost the game. I thought he looked much better on the left than centrally. Certainly a better option there than Memphis at the moment.

4541~~~
It's not strange at all. All of Mata's good performances have come when the team have played well. Not taking anything away from his performances, because he has been brilliant in the last few games, but when the going gets tough, he's non existent.

4542~~~
1 away league goal in 18 months actually.

4543~~~
Well, the games against Swansea, Southampton, Wolfsburg were pretty difficult and Mata was one of our best players in all of them, unlike Rooney who was one of the worst...

4544~~~
Yeah he does. You need to watch him more closely.

I've seen vacating the number 10 area hoping the ball goes wide for him to get on the end of a cross.

...and Mata shies away from the ball??!

4545~~~
We were always in control in those games, though, and didn't go 3 nil down in any of them.

4546~~~
That's bollocks. Watch the games again.

4547~~~
Swansea - We were the better team. Swansea scored two in like 10 mins. Other than that, they didn't do much

Southampton - After first 20 mins, we were easily the better team. 

Wolfsburg - Once they scored, they dropped off and allowed us to have the ball. 

Arsenal - Battered us in the first half, went 3 nil up in 20 mins.

4548~~~
feck me, he's an utter joke. Thats beyond disgraceful.

Can't wait for the day he leaves, I really can't.

4549~~~
I don't get how he is still in the team. It's utterly baffling. LVG has been quick to both criticise and drop everyone else for less yet Rooney gets away with it game after game.

It's also fecking infuriating to hear Neville criticise everyone but Rooney. He was absolutely spot on in everything he said today but refused to call out Rooney on another abject display.

Rooney is done as a top level player. He's not a Giggs, Scholes who can contribute on a reduced scale - to be honest, you can probably draw conclusions with his lifestyle and how he's abused his body over the years.

No away goal since November 2014. 1 league goal since April 2015. Today was not a poor performance, just a continuation of what's been going on for a long time.

4550~~~
Absolutely fecking horrific. I remember arguing with some idiot on here who kept saying that he was likely to get over 20 goals this season

4551~~~
The was a moment in the first half, at 2-0...we were just starting to get some sort of foothold in the game, Martial or Mata had it down the right channel, and passed it inside to Rooney, who's first touch was hopeless. Ramsey nicked it off him, Rooney then chased him and won it back...and then proceeded to lose it again. I thought that sort of summed Rooney up these days. He's just utterly hopeless on the ball.

A few minutes later Arsenal made it 3.

4552~~~
Not only 20 goals but 20 LEAGUE goals! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4553~~~
Surely those stats aren't right?

4554~~~
Rooney supporters; 

"Not the worst player" 

"Has started showing the odd good moment" 

"Had some nice touches" 

Jeez take a second look at yourselves. Kagawa got butchered for far less and I am still of the opinion that we should've kept him and sold Rooney. We don't pay him 300k/w for the odd good moment or to not be crap. Get him out.

4555~~~
Its incredible how low people will drop their standards in order to back Rooney. Its the exact same things we heard all last season in regards to Falcao and RVP. Now look at them.

You could probably find 30 odd other PL players that would put in better performances for us, if given the game time Rooney is being afforded.

4556~~~
When the players were walking off after the full time whistle the camera went on to him walking off with Carrick and it looked like he was unhappy about something that had happened out there, perhaps what one of our players had done? Did anyone else notice this? Do we have any lip readers who can make out what was said?

4557~~~
Actual performances aside, there is no way this lad should be captain IMO. What exactly does he bring to the table for the role? He appears to be struggling to inspire himself to consistently decent heights and so how can we rely on him to do it for the entire team. 

Someone needed to calm it down for 10 minutes after the first goal and whilst I'm disappointed Schweinsteiger didn't do so I'm not at all surprised that Rooney failed to fulfil his duties as captain and seasoned pro by slowing it down and settling the team. He decided to show a little fire in the second half when Arsenal were toying with us but it is of no use to a, by then, thoroughly disheartened/beaten team.

Our senior players collectively let us down today, 45 minutes of Rooney pissing in the wind doesn't make a blind bit of difference to his overall culpability and I have yet to see him do anything worthy of the armband (anecdotes about a rousing speech aside).

4558~~~
I read somewhere it was words to the effect "Well that was a bit shit wasn't it". Don't know how accurate that is as I didn't witness it but apparently it could be heard on a certain broadcast.

4559~~~
Was he referring to his performance?<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

4560~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He doesn't strike me as being that introspective.

4561~~~
A
April 2015 sorry. First part is accurate

4562~~~
No I didn't think so. No doubt he's probably blaming everyone else<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>
Maybe he'll get injured on England duty?<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

4563~~~
Watching him live today made me realise just how far the lad has fallen, no fight left in him, was a ghost on the field today.

4564~~~
Hodgson would make a good example by dropping his ass showing LVG what has to be done.

4565~~~
Its a fecked up world when you got United fans wishing "Wayne Rooney" our own captain to get injured during International break to prevent him from playing for us a while. But its even more fked up when you realize its totally fair, as its the only way to get him off that field as the manager won't do it.

4566~~~
I know it's bad. I wouldn't dream I would wish that on one of our players but...
Find myself wishing Smalling wouldn't be called up cause I'm afraid he'll get injured, yet on the hand not bothered if Rooney's called up. I know, it's not good but can't see any other way he'll be left out.

4567~~~
If we're not going to play him uptop as we believe that Martial can get us the goals we need to be successful then we might as well sell him in Jan. Moving him around isn't going to help us with anything. He's lost a step, so his play as a second striker is really limited at this point. Moving him out wide today was nothing short of pointless.

4568~~~
Why aren't the press no longer slaughtering him when he hits bad form? Why aren't they firing questions at LVG regarding his performances?

Is it because he's England's captain? Give me a break.

The media only report on positives when it comes to Rooney nowadays.

Oh, don't forget to tune into BBC One tommorow evening to watch the documentation on Wayne's England success and broken records. 

Quite a bizzare turnaround.

4569~~~
Don't be afraid to think that, cuz everyone is secretly wishing that. Its the sad, but fair, truth. He has gotten 242402230 chances, and LVG had 3238423920523230 chances to take him out. Its totally logical that fans eventually start thinking like this, even tough they nobody truly wishes harm on him ofc.

4570~~~
Probably cause he's England's captain. Even Neville won't criticise him - it's ludicrous. 
Ain't tuning into BBC either. Feck it. I'll still be upset with the whole result and don't indulging him<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

4571~~~
One reason is it's a bit hard for a reporter to write England's leading goalscorer is actually pretty shit.

Another reason is that a lot journalist and pundits don't actually understand football. They were calling for Rooney to play number 10 so he can get on the ball, run around a bit and be passionate. Then when he plays #10 and looks shit, they blame LvG and his 'negative' system.

4572~~~
We all know it's bad. But then you would have to ask yourself how and why Van Gaal has not unleashed upon Rooney the same kind of hell he gave to Mark van Bommel at Bayern Munich. Van Bommel became shit and was finished, so he was kicked out of the team as the right decision. If there is a pattern that goes with his own past, Van Gaal should not hesitate in pushing Rooney out of the starting XI by all means.

The media are ass-kissers with barely one brain cell each. If there was any form of intelligence in the country's football media business, Rooney would have been crucified long ago.

4573~~~
Waduh bang, gak salah liat?

He gives away possession cheaply on <b>several</b> occassion. Cheaply, he simply pass the ball to them. He's always clogging up the midfield, the way he's standing he's standing behind 2 defenders and probably won't get anything, he never makes himself available for a pass. 

Look at Sanchez, Aguero, Martial, that's what's a striker supposed to do. All he does these days is ping it back/sideways and pretend to run, and hides away from the action.

4574~~~
If it tooks him 9 months just to show us that "at least he has some desire today" he deserves to get sacked, and terminated.

4575~~~
I remember that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Mata passed to him for a give and go, Rooney completely missed the ball and it went to BFS. I could not stop laughing at how bad he has become.

4576~~~
With the Euros coming, Van Gaal can speed up the termination process a lot quicker by denying Rooney those important playing minutes, which would force the player to terminate the contract and get somewhere else in January. After all, Rooney doesn't have many allies (nor he should have) in the dressing room with the way he performed since last season.

4577~~~
The way all the players talk about him, I really highly doubt that. I think Rooney is without a doubt one of the most appreciated and loved players in the dressing room, which makes it even harder for LVG to drop him. It's not just about football, there are many things to consider.

4578~~~
What could happen in the worst case? That Van Gaal creates a John Terry/Steven Gerrard-type of controversy/malaise and invites a mutiny if he decides to drop Rooney? We have to remember that United is not a club to build personality cults with players that easily compared to other clubs.

4579~~~
Something like that yeah. Obviously I'm not 100% sure and maybe there are some players who are truly annoyed to see him play week in week out. I just think that if it was easy to drop Rooney, LVG would have done it a long time ago. He is stubborn but surely not blind. Everyone can see Rooney has become a true liability, LVG needs to show some big balls now.

4580~~~
Part of the problem is that the options are not great. I mean dropping Rooney means Fellaini (God no) or Herrera or Wilson ( can he really trust Wilson instead of Rooney?) or Pereira ( again can he ready trust him to replace Rooney? )

4581~~~
Herrera for number 10 as a regular (or at least until we find better elsewhere), Wilson as Martial's striking partner if we throw the kitchen sink in order to grab a goal late in the match, Pereira as the secondary option to Memphis on the left. If we want to get rid the last few elements of archaic football we have in the side, we have to live and die with players who have plenty to prove. Better that than persisting with a liability who is clearly losing it.

4582~~~
The curse of the captain.

4583~~~
I'm not going to jump on Rooney's back, but his form is so far off where it needs to be that something needs to give.

I'd take him out of the team for a decent spell and let him physically and mentally recuperate. What's more, let's try to change his psychology and make him realise that his place in the side isn't a given - has he ever been more comfortable at both club and international level in terms of being assured of his place?

Problem is, we've got massive games coming up and Van Gaal isn't going to dethrone his captain, so the whole debate is elementary.

It's a bit depressing that we currently have this millstone around our neck and, despite it being quite clear that something needs to change, our manager will keep things exactly as they are.

Captain's privileges.

4584~~~
Before we played Arsenal I thought Rooney would use the opportunity to prove his doubters wrong. Instead, everything people have been saying about him was proven right. He has had bad periods in the past and recovered, this looks different. He looks genuinely gone.

4585~~~
I was one of the people who thought that Rooney would have a good season this time around as he will never be in midfield. But looks like he is really losing focus along with form.

4586~~~
LVG post match comments about him are a joke.

4587~~~
What'd he say?

I thought he was dogshit in the first half. One of our worst. Improved in the second when he was out of the center. Would rather him than Memphis out there. Would still like both out of the side though.

4588~~~
I've never felt about a United player how I feel about Rooney, utterly pissed off.

Just want to get the season over and get him sold. Can't believe he is undroppable, even if LVG refuses to see it you'd have thought Giggs would say 'come on, we've got to drop him'.

There is a myth around Rooney that he is a world class player who changes games. He hasn't been that for years now and often makes the team worse.

I'm sick and tired of watching him in our team and the so called pundits gracing him as a football God, Scholes was at it in midweek saying he'll turn it on at the weekend, Merson thought he would be the best player on the park against Arsenal. What a joke, people need to wake up.

4589~~~
Something about him his being captain more important than his performances good or bad.
I am beyond fed up with him. He's shite. And him being the conductor of our attack is killing us imo. When your captain, talisman and highest paid player is by far and away your worst player on the pitch for months and seems to get picked regardless, it sends the wrong vibe to the team regardless of if he's liked or not. I can't wait till he feck off. Beyond a joke now.

4590~~~
thought van gaal dropped van bommel at bayern who was captain then. surely if this abject performance continues he'll drop rooney.

4591~~~
A team carrying it's captain. I thought it was supposed to be the other way round.

4592~~~
The big question still remains how and why Van Gaal has not yet told Rooney the good old "f*** you and kiss my ass". This is a lot worse from Rooney than how low Van Bommel got back then.

4593~~~

4594~~~
It's the club kissing his arse and/or something in that contract of his. Only Ed Woodward can put a stop to this.

4595~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

How can Rooney get more than Walcott? Is his agent paying these idiots in the press to do this shite?

4596~~~
The game vs Swansea was pretty even. They were creating great chances already in the first half. 

We had more possession than Southampton after the first 20 min. till the last 20 min. but weren't threatening before Mata stepped up. He created a good chance for Memphis and then contributed to Martial's first goal. Besides, we didn't create more chances than them, they had more shots on target. 

Against Wolfsburg Mata won and scored the pen and assisted the winner after we were a goal down in a crucial game. 

Besides, even if it were true that we were in control in these games, it's not as if Mata didn't contribute to our dominanance but only utilised it. We were "in control" partly because Mata was palying well...

What's your criterion of being in control? Having more possession? Then we were in control against Arsenal after they scored their 2nd goal. And what's your point anyway? That Mata doesn't play well when we don't have a lot of possession? Isn't it quite natural for a forward to be more useful when his team plays with the ball?

4597~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's actually quite funny. Walcott did the damage when it mattered  and Rooney's performance improved, if you can call it that, when the game was dead, the Sun can't seem to grasp that. 

The media don't want to be honest about Rooney because if his place in the United XI starts to be questioned then so would his England place and they can't do that to the precious captain before the Euros. Next season, after England have failed at the Euros and his performances for us have been crap so we buy a new striker, Rooney is in for a rude awakening.

4598~~~
Even when he was good Evertoon was usually a write off. So expecting more of the same at Goodison. If you don't laugh, you'll cry.

4599~~~
Maybe Rooney played better in the 2nd half, but my god our standards have sunk to an all-time low if some think that is good enough. It says something when Giggs looks in better shape than the team captain.

4600~~~
He was bad, but LvG wants his captains qualities on the pitch. Wayne is never a captain, he cannot drive the team on, all he does is argue with the refs and a captain should be able to organise the team, as they get sod all help from the touchline until it's too late. He does not have the intelligence to do that.

4601~~~
You did see the end to that game? We were hanging on for dear life.

4602~~~
The Sun grading him a 7, Jesus wept.

4603~~~
If he is saying we were in control in these games it was despite Rooney not because of him.

4604~~~
I think he was trying to praise Rooney for not hiding in tough games unlike Mata. Lol.

4605~~~
I will give that, he does try to get involved like he used to. His effort is never in doubt, but unfortunately the legs aren't willing anymore.

4606~~~
Thought he was poor first half, but actually pretty good second half, best I have seen him play for a while.

4607~~~
Beneran, gak salah liat kok <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Maybe 'good' is exaggeration, but at least he showed that he cared and displayed some kind of willingness to get stuck in. Good enough compared to the Rooney of yesteryear? Of course not. I believe he's past it and I think it's only going downhill for him from now on. As a matter of fact, so far this season I've given him an average rating of 4.3 compared to the Caf's 5.4.

That said, I'll give him credit when he does well because yesterday he was definitely one of our best players in a very bad bunch.

4608~~~
Second half was probably the best I've seen him play for at least two years, probably since his second half sub appearance against Swansea in Moyes' first game. The issue is, despite this, I still gave him a 5 out of 10 for his entire performance, which is close to the best he can do at the moment.

I do not apologise that I've been secretly hoping he gets injured, or at least suspended for a few. This is what it's come to.

4609~~~
A lot of people are criticising his goal scoring, which is obviously justified, but I haven't seen many people mention how poor his creativity is nowadays.

He has played a combined 975 minutes in the league, europe and league cup this season. He has one assist and that was when Walker tackled him and scored an own goal.

Last season he played 2877 minutes in the league alone and managed five assists, Young did the same in 800 less minutes, Di Maria managed twice as many in 1200 less minutes.

These are shocking stats for a player who is supposed to be a creative force. He was pathetic as a #9 at the start of the season so we signed Martial, but that should have forced Rooney to the bench. Moving him back to #10 instead was a cowardly decision.

4610~~~
I think he's goals is the least he's been criticised for.

4611~~~
<b>How come Rooney has become so unfit?
</b>
He always was erratic with his first touch and passing, and often took time to get into the grove. This season also his passing and first touch are improving but the decline in his physical abilities is shocking! He was completely bullied on the ball by Arsenal players (this is important to repeat... Arsenal playing bullying physically!). Defensively also he was completely useless. I don't know how it has come to this, at age of 29. This is Anderson level of fitness this...

4612~~~
All reports say he's been in the best shape fitness wise he's been in years. I just think he's not physically neat he was when he was younger. It's like his body can't keep up with his mind. His, acceleration, touch, dribbling, physicality have all gone. I don't think its an issue of fitness. In the last year, more than one player has called him the hardest trainer.

4613~~~
I saw him lose a physical contest with Borini the other day and then complaining to the red. my first thought was My God is this Wayne Rooney?

4614~~~
I have been saying this for ages, he looks years older than he actually is. It might as well be his dad out there playing. I think it has caught up on him, starting playing very young and the body type he is would take it's toll earlier than most players.

4615~~~
So, assuming LVG is being honest, neither goals or performances matter when it comes to Rooney. What an utterly ridiculous situation. Only someone with the footballing intelligence of a Schweinsteiger could justify inclusion on the mere basis of presence and nous.

4616~~~
The way he constantly argues with the officials annoys me. Every single time he/we lose a 50/50 or give away a freekick he is in there yelling. Focus on your own game Wayne.

4617~~~
Feck me, may the lord have mercy on our souls.

4618~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Anybody know Ed Woodward? We need him to step in asap and stop this<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4619~~~
Ahhh just everything about how he plays football nowadays bugs me. Just when I thought I couldn't be more pissed at him he returned with his chip, where he passes the ball to the opposition keeper with options all around.

This so called good second half against Arsenal, I didn't see it. He certainly was involved more but again his sloppy touch and zero creativy was on display.
The chance Schweinsteiger got, came about after Rooney miskicked the ball. He lost the ball when Ox hit the bar. And just what is the point of his signature long balls to the right? They are always aimed straight at the winger, not into his stride, so if the pass is successful the winger has always been closed down. He also takes close to zero chances on the ball, making him very frustrating to watch. His critical loss of physical attributes, added to the way he's playing the game, make him absolutely done at Premier League level. 

He is still in this media bubble, Van Gaal never subs him and always talks him up, the match going fans sing his name like always. It makes me wonder, does he actually realize he's playing crap?

4620~~~
To be honest, looking at the squad it'll probably be him and Kane starting both matches.

4621~~~
He must have some clause in his contract that he must play every game, that's the only reasonable explanation for being picked every week after the shit performances he's put in in the last 7-8 months.

4622~~~
I remember having a similar opinion of him last year. And the year before. I bet I'll be airing similar opinions next year and the year after too.

4623~~~
Good question. Would he even care if he knew? I don't know. This isn't a criticism but I genuinely feel that Rooney sincerely believes he's above all, and he seems to be intent on consolidating his legacy. I think he's so intent on this, he's forgotten that as an active player you still need to give 100%. I think without him realising it, he's lost his desire. Basti may be older than him and won more, but he still has the desire, if not the physicality of old. His ego and the constant media crap of praising him plus the club putting him on a pedestal is just distorting that image he has of himself even more. So he might think any criticism is just crap or fickle fans complaining.

Seeing the egos of Gerrard and Terry and the trouble they can cause when they're no longer the player they were, I have really no hope that Rooney is going to change that trend and I'm not looking forward to this.

4624~~~
Can someone gif one of his long, aired cross field balls from inside our own half to Valencia half way inside the opposition's half, a ball that takes an age to arrive at Valencia's feet who then doesn't trust himself to run in the direction of the opposition byline so instead turns back and plays the ball 20 m behind where he just was.

Do you think before you make those passes Wayne (Wazza)? Answers on a postage stamp.

4625~~~
In the way the press have asked Mourinho about Terry and Ivanovic and Wenger about Ospina, I was hoping that this week a journo / media would directly ask LVG the question on Rooney's form.

He looks like a fan who's won a competition to captain the team for a day.

Absolutley rubbish in all aspects.

4626~~~
So on one hand you are saying: 

And on the other hand: 


So he is fit but physically lacking?

4627~~~
The press are shit scared of asking Van Gaal hard questions I think. He'll do his "that's a stupid question" routine, stare the journo down hard and instruct the media person not to allow that journo to ask a question for the next 3 press conferences.

4628~~~
We heard rumours that there was a clause in his contract that he should be captain. When LVG came in we thought that's not true, LVG will surely pick RVP etc etc. Yet, he's the captain. I don't know, but I believe there are some clauses in his contract that will cost us and always playing when fit could possibly be one of them. Yes, for all the brilliant people running United, they might just have made that mistake because at that time, we were crap with Moyes and the marketing men could not abide Rooney leaving at that point as well. Rooney and his agent had us by the balls, it's therefore not inconceivable that we acceded to his wishes one of which might have been playing all the time. Ed Woodward, not a football man, would not have recognised that Rooney was already declining so probably thought nothing of agreeing to this. Moyes who should have known better didn't care as he only thought of himself and his position at that time and wanted an ally in Rooney. SAF couldn't have any say because of his history with Rooney and the fact he'd chosen Moyes who was proving a disaster. All those things happening made it a perfect time for Rooney to get what he wanted.

So yeah, I can believe we've agreed to something stupid that's now costing us big time.

4629~~~
Lol. I don't think you understand what I am saying. His match fitness, in terms of lasting 90 minutes might be at the best it's been in ages. But his body cannot physically do what he has done in the past.

4630~~~
I think there may be something in that...I mean, he went to SAF said if you don't play me I'm off, and then Moyes comes in with a new bumper deal for him and I'm sure Rooney must have asked for a clause saying 'play me if I'm fit' or something. I dunno, it sounds pretty straw clutching but I can't think of any other reason why he hasn't been dropped.

4631~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4632~~~
I really believe it, have for a long time and trust me, I don't do conspiracy and nonsense. But looking at everything overall, it is rather puzzling given everything that is happening with his form. It's right there in front of everyone's eyes an you cannot tell me that experienced coaching staff that we have cannot see this as well as us little lowly supporters who don't have their technical knowledge etc etc? Not only that, if playing him all the time continues to cause us problems and Louis is still not dropping him, then that would just solidify my belief about his contract. It's crazy to think that LVG would sacrifice his final job in football on account of an out of form player. That is madness. No way he would deliberately do that, so hence I believe his hands are tied to some extent here. 

Best get Jones to tackle him in training cause I can't see any other solution here.

4633~~~
I would genuinely love to see the kind of game he has to play for Van Gaal to drop him. It would be absolutely horrific.

4634~~~
I think until he scores a hattrick of own goals, then pulls of the captains armband and stuffs it down LVG's throat, he's pretty safe.

4635~~~
Have someone already come here and pointed out forward passes, productivity and hard work?

4636~~~
He will start every single game when he's fit. Has he been benched even once under van Gaal?

Ferguson had the balls to drop him and would have sold him if he hadn't retired. Moyes have him a 6-year record contract. Who thought it was a good idea to keep Rooney here until he's nearly 34? It was never likely that Rooney would be good at 33 or 34.

4637~~~
I don't buy into the idea that Rooney's contract states he must always play.

It would be an utterly ludicrous thing for United to have agreed to, especially as it wasn't a short term deal but one that means he will be playing with us until he is almost 34.

Also if Van Gaal was genuinely being forced into having his team picked for him in such a way I'm sure it would have come out by now. He would realise he looks like an idiot constantly picking the same underperforming player and it would be leaked to the press. Hell, he is so honest and blunt he would probably have just said it himself the first time Rooney had a bad game. Instead he constantly raves about Rooney and talks him up more than any other player, is that something that Rooney's contract says the manager must do as well?

4638~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4639~~~
Van Gaal seems very impressed with Rooney indeed.

These forward passes though...

4640~~~
It's very unlikely he has a clause like that. Going by what LVG says about him, he genuinely rates him as a player, captain and person. I do think his patience will eventually run out though.

4641~~~
Yeah, I didn't. My point anyways was about his competitiveness physically in the PL. Anyway can you call somebody fit even if they last 90 minutes if during the whole period they are hardly running or stretching themselves?

4642~~~
It's not LVG's patience I'm questioning anymore. It's his sanity and sense.

4643~~~
exactly, he is dropping a complete bollock with this. the whole world can see it and how it can be fixed

4644~~~
it was a ludicrous deal fullstop. Players over 30 supposedly got yearly extensions to observe their progress

4645~~~
That's typical of the media: they will give a share of more or less deserved shit to England internationals when they play rubbish for the national team, but they will keep quiet on their performances at club level because they don't want to hear the truth.

According to people who watched the Sky broadcast from yesterday, even Gary didn't have the balls to start the discussion on Rooney. For me, it says a lot about how England internationals are overprotected at club level.

Regarding that 6-year deal, the only thing I will say about it is that Moyes deserves every single bit of profanity aimed at him by everyone for bending over like a hooker in dire need of money.

4646~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4647~~~
Well, that's probably the best analogy I can find about Moyes on that particular case and I also laugh (or cry) about it as well. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4648~~~
I still can't stop laughing! Great line that! 
Just wondering if United's PR people ever have a peak at the fans' forums. Can you imagine them reading this thread?<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4649~~~
They do. I know that for a fact.

/ITK

But they do.

4650~~~
Seeing your captain play shite week in week out will be detrimental to team morale so something has to be done. He always plays terribly against Everton away anyway so it's the perfect time to drop him.

4651~~~
If you're not kidding, please can you ask your sources to have a word with Ed to help us out here and order LVG to put Rooney's arse on the bench? Thanks<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4652~~~
Agreed. But who's gonna tell LVG Rooney's history of playing shite against Everton? Not Giggs I don't think. Our best bet is him picking up an injury during the break (as horrible as that sounds).

4653~~~
Probably this, as the new contract was under Moyes he must have inserted whatever clauses he wanted, as SAF would not have allowed that

This is theoretical of course, but it seems to be the most likely, Moyes did set us back a good bit

4654~~~
Its becoming absolutely pathetic how bad he is. Right now he'd make a premier league worst xi.

4655~~~
I'm not kidding. 

And yeah - I'll ask him. He's an utter idiot, though - can't promise anything. He only cares about noodles.

4656~~~
????<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I hope the 'idiot' referred to is not Ed Woodward as we're depending on the bastard<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4657~~~
It's definitely something like that, it's not possible that everyone on our bench is blind for his performances. I mean, even people like Pogue and NessunDorma admitted he should be dropped. I think it's probably something to do with sponsors or like you said his contract.

4658~~~
If it is the sponsors, it will be to their detriment to have a player going downhill so quickly representing them.

4659~~~
Oh, you're serious?

Well, then - that's different. 

I've no idea about what Woody does. But I do suspect he's keen on noodles. 

As for PR people and such - people who are paid to care about the overall image and impression of Manchester United, the brand...yes, they do follow what goes on around the old Internet, including the Caf.

The Caf is probably the most talked-about and visited United forum around - so they do pay some attention to what goes on here. They're largely idiots, though, according to my definition of the word - the ones I know in that capacity. They don't have a clue. They look at "fan response" in a completely different light from what you or I would. 

If I were to venture a guess, based on what I know, the more blatantly stupid anything you write on here is, the bigger the chance that some twat employed to monitor "fan response on social media and Internet forums" is likely to register it. And they're far more interested in how you feel about Chevrolet than about the crossing ability of Antonio Valencia.

4660~~~
No I wasn't serious. But it's a shame if no one picks up on sensible comments.

Edit - Have to say their marketing team seem great to me even if they're PR people aren't so great. I still can't get my head around how they've made Rooney marketable especially at this time. Completely baffles me<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4661~~~
I can practically guarantee that no one does that.

It has nothing to do with why they're monitoring a site like the Caf in the first place - completely different worlds.

4662~~~
Very good point. Furthermore, Rooney's main sponsor (Nike) is no longer involved with United, so it shouldn't matter.

4663~~~
The manager will surely at least discuss with his staff the prospect of using 4-3-3 with Rooney on the left and Herrera in the middle three, I think it would also benefit Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin.

It will be more of a 4321 with Mata and Rooney roaming in and then Martial roaming wide, push the full backs high up for width.

Memphis also benefits from having the pressure taken off him, let him come on off the bench for a bit in the last half an hour.

4664~~~
I think it's harsh to be overly critical of him yesterday. Don't get me wrong, he's useless and the sheer sight of him makes me want to blind myself, and I'd love to see him put on the bench... in a local park, but he wasn't alone in being useless.

4665~~~
I realize that I sound like a hater but Rooney in particular is one of the worst players I have seen in a long time, as an advanced player he is always in position to press, he should always push forward, he should always support the attacks but he never does it, I'm 100% that he doesn't respect the manager's instructions and I don't understand why he isn't in the stands.

4666~~~
I think that's what VAn Gaal meant by the players didn't follow instructions. We were set up to press but some players decided not to.

4667~~~
But with Rooney it's always the case, I'm almost sure that it's the reason why SAF wanted rid and I supported the manager, when Moyes decided to change our organisation and create a system Rooney friendly I also supported it because he is a good player, but now we are playing a system that realize on disciplined and intelligent players and it seems that Rooney isn't disciplined or intelligent.

4668~~~
Van Gaal did say : "We have to do better as a team. The defence starts with the attacker."

So Martial/Rooney.

4669~~~
Mediawatch on F365 reports that The Sun gave Rooney a 7 rating and Walcott only a 6.

<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

4670~~~
Are you being serious?

4671~~~

4672~~~
How on Earth?
Rooney wasn't the worst player on the pitch against Arsenal, but for him to get more than Walcott (who was rampant against us). This makes no sense.

4673~~~
Just watched that documentary on him... Miss how he used to be really <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Hopefully he can get back to a decent level, he's still young enough that he shouldn't be declining so much. His general play has been hugely improved the last few games with Martial there IMO, just still nowhere near what it used to be. Not sure what it'll take to get him back if it's possible at all. Don't think our style is doing him any favors though. People forget how good he has been for us over the years with the way they shit on him after every game really. He's a United legend, but obviously needs to up his game. Rooney's one of the very few players I've always held hope for that he'll come back from any bad incident, or that he'll stay at United, that he'll basically come through the rough patch. If he does again this season, then we have a shot at winning the title I think. Would be huge for us.

4674~~~
He has been a great player for this Club, but that shouldn't mean he is immune to criticism. If he went out the door next summer he would have had a great career to look back upon for Manchester United.
RvP already started to decline in his second year with us at the age of 30, Rooney is soon turning 30 and it's not unthinkable that he is just not up to the level anymore.

I think most fans would love if he suddently started banging goals in.

4675~~~
Well there is criticism and I criticize him as well, but people on here go way over the top unecessarily and just revert to saying it's a shit performance even if he puts in a decent one these days. The majority on here just don't like him, or at least that's what it feels like.

4676~~~
lol, apart from the initial bit about the Arsenal game being his best performance in 2 years, I'd agree with Rozay. He deserved a 5 out 10 and yes, as extreme as it is, I would actually wish him injury to get him out of the team. It'd be better for the team, the manager and arguably the good for him too. Some time out whatever the circumstance will be good (in an idealistic world).

He hasn't had a sustained decent performance (in a pressure setting) for a while. Not for his standards or for Utd. He is a non factor and that's being harsh but also truthful. If his name was Kagawa, Herrera or Januzaj with those performances, he'd get the same amount of criticism AND massive media attention.

4677~~~
It's funny, the older he's got and since having his kids he's become much less aggressive. I do think this is linked, he always used to play better when angry and fired up. I feel that now since he's matured and has become a role model he feels he has to behave at everything he does. That's taken some of the fire out of his performances and I unfortunately don't think he will get that back.

If we think back to his last truly good performance, it was probably against Spurs. That was when the press were giving him stick for getting knocked out by Phil Bardsley. Only then did he feel like he had to answer for something and really gave it 100% IMO. Since then though he's just going through the motions these days.

4678~~~
I've been saying this for a long time now. Angry Rooney > calm Rooney. He needs to play on the edge.

4679~~~
you are talking of aggression. He still has that. He is just devoid of confidence. This is where Fergie was so good in helping players.

4680~~~
He lost the anger and fire after he did the metatarsal at Chelsea in 2006 to be fair.

Never been the same player since.

4681~~~
They can see it with their own eyes too.

4682~~~
That's partially true, but he's been a great player after that injury also. He was sensational for us up until that injury. Never been one to hype the England NT but they would have gone for with a Rooney in the pre-injury form. He was our main bright light during our barren spell between 2004 and 2006. Hard to pick a favourite moment from that period, but I'll always remember his assist with the outside of his foot to C.Ronaldo during a 4-1 win against Bolton. That was pure genius.

4683~~~
Out of both qualification matches due to ankle injury.

4684~~~
Yeah, that's the part I'm mainly referring to. Which is bollocks.

Rooney had quite a few top quality performances in the first half of the 13/14 season, most notably Real Sociedad at home. Which is much, much better than the Swansea game that was mentioned in Rozay's post. I honestly don't care about Rooney... I already knew he was on the decline, as did many on here, and that's why I wanted him to play as a centre-forward for us where he's less detrimental to the team. And now he's reached a stage where he doesn't even look like a decent first team option for us, which is sad because he's <i>only </i>29.

Moving away from that, the thing I don't understand is people saying we're better with Rooney in the team (even when he's in poor form) because he's a leader. I seen that mentioned several times last season and this season... yet his performances suggest the opposite. He looks more like a dejected figure who struggles to hold the ball, especially down the channels, which is ironic because in the last couple of years he's been in great shape. At least under Moyes, he had the drive to fight for the ball and he was quite close to returning to his 11/12 form where he would play poorly but that wouldn't stop him from scoring/assisting goals. However, when your body fails you and you're in a comfortable position of starting every game regardless of form, no amount of drive is going to help you out.

4685~~~
Looking forward to the 'needs a few games under his belt to get in form again after an injury layoff'.

4686~~~
With Terry - Mourinho has benched him. So Terry has got the message.
With Gerrard - he was also benched and eventually left because the manager told him he wouldn't get much game time.
Rooney - he starts every game, even if he is carrying an injury. Totally undroppable.

An even better excuse is that because Rooney was great 5-10 years ago, so he should get game time, today.
Maybe we should sign up Shearer, after all, he was one of the best finishers 20 years ago and we desperately need a finisher. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

4687~~~
To be honest England fecked him up by bringing him to the World Cup in 06 against Fergie's wishes and Rooney himself alluded to it in the documentary that he wouldn't have gone with hindsight.  Also I actually think it was the injury against Bayern that really screwed him in the end.  He just never seemed as explosive again despite having a brilliant second half of the season as a 10 in 2011 behind Hernandez.  Again England brought him to the World Cup in 2010 despite the fact he clearly wasn't fit to be there.  Couple this with being a regular starter since 16/17 in an intense league and it's easy to see that his legs may have just gone.  Don't get me wrong he may well burst into form this year and answer some of the critics but it's really starting to seem like his body isn't up to it anymore.  I just really hope he breaks Charlton's record before he's fully finished because I'd love to see it done in my lifetime and IMO he deserves it for his service and past performances for us.

On the aggression this, it may be true but I can't see LVG encouraging that type of behaviour.  He can't bare us playing on his for small periods of time let alone encouraging his captain to play more off the cuff.  For what it's worth I still believe he was by far our best player under Moyes barring De Gea.  Obviously it's not top level but if the others had performed as well as he had that season we wouldn't have ended up out of the top 4.

4688~~~
Well, the football pundits all seem to agree that Rooney is the best striker in England and must play for club and country.
There are many fans on here, who believe that is definitely one of our best players.
So not everybody shares your view.

I, however, do share your view.

4689~~~
He does receive more criticism than other players on cafe when he has a bad game, but do you really expect anything else considering his status at this club? He is undropable, clubs most paid player, captain of the club, van Gaal said he even helps him pick the team ffs, and yet he is our worst player this season. And what's worst, not once van Gaal said a bad word on his performances or subbed him. And I don't need to tell you his status in the media, they simply refuse to say anything bad about him even when he is clearly worst player on the pitch and plays like a drunk. Instead, they always focus their attention to other players. That's just baffling, I don't think there is single player in the world who gets that kind of threatment from his manager and media. Even Ronaldo and Messi are criticised in media(from their club's papers actually) when their form is bad, but not our Wayne. 

Thing that people don't like him doesn't have much to do with their perception of his performances on the pitch. He also receives more praise for a good game than any other player, people love to comment Wayne Rooney is all.

4690~~~
I just think the pundits are saying that crap to be politically correct in front of local viewers. Also, fans who support him seem to judge his current form on his past record. His current form is not a blip; it's been horrendous for a long while now. Hamann was right in pointing out his decline. I don't know what goes on behind the scenes but for LVG to continue to consider him undroppable or sub him off, it baffles me. Now whenever he takes a few good touches or connects with simple stuff like passing he gets praised ; that should tell one heaps about how shite he is.

4691~~~
You can't expect the English journos to be honest as England have yet to find his replacement as the figurehead of the national team, and the pundits are mixed between his buddies and those that are hoping LvG continues to be oblivious/forced to play him as they want us to do badly. It's the same with all the Giggs as manager stuff rattling around from his cronies in punditry and abu journos.

4692~~~
I suspect notwithstanding his somewhat less than impressive club performances, that Rooney will continue to be Hodgson's first choice as striker.

Whether he deserves that uncritical privilege remains to be seen.

4693~~~
He has the testosterone levels of a 62 year old man. It's no wonder he lacks aggression.

4694~~~
He's not even the best striker in our reserves team

4695~~~
Of course he deserves to be England's striker, he's the only player who scores consistently for them. Since Hodgson took over Rooney has scored 22 goals for England, next is Welbeck on 13, then Lampard on 6. However shitty he is in the build-up play, he sticks the ball in the back of the next far more often than anybody else, and that's a pretty important part of football.

4696~~~
Oh really. And how many of those goals have actually been scored in a major tournament?

4697~~~
England games (and goal scorers).
vs Estonia, Walcott, Sterling
vs Switzerland, Kane, Rooney (pen)
vs San Marino, Rooney (pen), Brolli (og), Barkley, Walcott 2, Kane
vs Slovenia , Wilshere 2, Rooney
vs <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/republic-of-ireland" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">R. of Ireland, no goals</a>
vs Italy, Townsend
vs Lithuania, Rooney  Welbeck  Sterling  Kane

So in the last 7 games,
Rooney has scored: 2 penalties, 2 in open play
Walcott: 3 in open play
Kane: 3 in open play

<b>Based on the above, his international goal scoring form is as good as any of his English peers.</b>

Lets take a look at his league form:
(name: goal count)
Vardy: 7
Aguero: 6
6 players: 5
...
Rooney: 1

<b>Based on the above, his EPL goal scoring form is terrible.</b>

4698~~~
look at the calibre of teams he is playing against for England

4699~~~
I think his record is supposed to be better than any other England's forward considering he is the only one who plays there regulary for England. Last time Welbeck was starter, he was scoring at better rate than Rooney.

Just my two cents, I am not critisiseing him considering I don't watch that much of England recently, I just don't think your logic is correct there.

4700~~~
I said before the Wolfsburg game that it was an important week for Rooney and he needed to show he wasn't just a flat-track bully now. He was poor both games and now is back to square one with an injury. If LVG can't handle this situation correctly it could cost us the entire season.

Rooney needs to play his way back into the team now. We can't keep handing him starts in the expectation he'll come good after a run of a few games, because his body is at the point where it can't handle that any more. He needs to rediscover his sharpness in training. If, somehow, he's fit for the Everton game he can come on as a sub for that. And if he makes a positive impact then he can earn himself a spot against City. Otherwise not.

4701~~~
he'll be fit for Everton, no doubt about that. Even if 80% fit he plays. when Moyes played Bayern in the away leg he stayed on for 90 mins when he couldn't even kick the ball

4702~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4703~~~
Of the 3 goals scored by England at tournaments under Hodgson when Rooney has been playing, he has scored 2 and assisted 1.

4704~~~
Are you counting qualifies? Because I'm not.

4705~~~
No I'm counting WC14 and Euro 12. Although Rooney was our top scorer in both of those qualification's, and this one, and in fact every qualifying we've had since the last time we failed to qualify.

4706~~~
Athletes are like cars. Some last longer than others, but eventually they'll have too much mileage (game time, injuries etc) and they'll be finished.

This was the case of Falcao last season, and sadly looks like it is with Rooney now. He's been in decline the last few years, but this season has been awful. 

I think he'll leave United after the Euros.

4707~~~
My point is though, the fact that he's scored most of his goals against cannon fodder teams shouldn't be discounted.

4708~~~
Of course he has, but that's true of all players simply because it's easier to score against poorer teams. The truth of the matter is that we've been poor for the best part of a decade now and have been completely outplayed by every good team we've come up against in tournaments during that time so expecting him to have some sort of stellar record would be ludicrous. It's not as if we have other options banging down the door either, Sturridge is a crock, Welbeck is injured, Kane can't buy a goal for Spurs and Walcott is only scoring against the same cannon-fodder that Rooney is being derided for scoring against. Rooney may be in decline but he's still the most likely player to knock in a few goals for us next summer imo. After that we should look ahead, but a major tournament is not the time to take a gamble when we have a solid, if unspectacular goalscorer already in the team.

4709~~~
Fair enough. But England aside, he really should be dropped for us. There's no possible defence against his form which has been going on for longer than this season.

4710~~~
Probably although we don't really have many options do we. Our wingers are needed in defence and Herrera is injured, it's pretty much down to Fellaini or Wilson.

4711~~~
I don't have a subscription but I would appreciate if someone can post or inbox me the write up. Mathew Syed writes very well.

4712~~~
For whom? You've made him unsaleable by now.

4713~~~
Everton

4714~~~
No way they'd come close to his wages. You'd be stuck paying 70% of them.

4715~~~
MLS.

4716~~~
It's not always that simple.

Some players receive a part of their contract as a severance package (aka a loyalty bonus) when they are sold while others forfeit it to force a move (which is generally beneficial to the player anyway).

If we received £20m from Everton for Rooney, we might need to give Rooney £18m of that as a contract payment meaning we'd only get £2m, so where is the benefit?


The benefit is that he's off the books and paid up using external money.

So while we don't benefit from much of a transfer fee, we have used the money to tie up his contract and can offer it elsewhere.

That scenario beats having him here stinking out the place for 3 more years and paying him for the privalige.


So if Rooney had 3 years left at £200k a week (£10.4m a year, £31.2m total) and we agreed to receive £20m from Everton for him and agreed an £18m loyalty package with Rooney, rather than being £31.2m down in 3 years, we'd be £2m up meaning we'd be £33.2m better off than had we not sold him.

That way Rooney gets £18m+Everton contract and he's no worse off either.

Everyone benefits in one way or another, none of this "paying 70% of his wages" business.

It's not an ideal situation, you'd rather profit from selling such a high profile player but that's what you get for offering a 28 year old such a long massive contract when there is a good chance he will decline hugely before its up. Cheers Moyseh.

4717~~~
He's a must in the first XI against Everton. Even if he cannot run we should just stick him out there and ask him to just be present.

4718~~~
If Rooney leaves it will be like RvP last summer. Sold for a small fee to a team in a much weaker league.

4719~~~
With his contract, I doubt we'd get more an £5m. A free transfer is even more reasonable.

4720~~~
Your logic is sound apart from the fact there isnt a snowballs chance in hell we get £20 million for him.

4721~~~
I really don't see him being here at the start of the 17/18 season, and if he doesn't do at least somewhat better by the end of this season I wouldn't be surprised if he left this summer.

4722~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So true.

Over time, as the rancour fades and the rawness makes way for something more appealing, it can be easy to forget just how caustic and acrimonious it was for <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/wayne-rooney" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wayne Rooney</a> when he cut himself free from Everton, the club that are imprinted on his soul, and discovered the hard way how there is little in football that appals supporters more than rejection from the players they cherish.

One of Rooney’s worst professional memories was the time shortly before his transfer to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> when Everton had a home game and, once the theme to <i>Z Cars</i> had died down, hearing the Gwladys Street End, where he had once been thought of as one of their own, singing about him again, but this time “there’s only one greedy bastard”. The interview his agent, Paul Stretford, set up with the <i>Sun </i>added to the malevolence given the poisoned relationship that newspaper has with Merseyside. Graffiti was daubed over Rooney’s walls and, even after he had left Merseyside, the unpleasantness rumbled on because of a dispute over the house Everton had bought for him and his family, close to their training ground, as part of the agreement when he signed his first professional contract.

His parents had moved in and Rooney had to buy the house and repay Everton everything they had spent on the mortgage. There were two years to find that money, according to the account in Rooney’s book, but he claims <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/everton" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Everton</a> tried to force him to pay early and threatened to turf out his parents.

Rooney, the Everton-daft kid who was taken to his first match in nappies, wrote primary school letters to the imprisoned <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/02/wayne-rooney-everton-duncan-ferguson-testimonial" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Duncan Ferguson</a> and grew up with posters of Anders Limpar on his bedroom walls, was a pariah and still remembers the night he was watching television as viewers texted in messages saying he was never a “true Blue”, calling him a “Judas” and worse. Rooney watched the messages flashing up on the screen then took his phone and texted one of his own: “I left because the club was doing my head in – Wayne Rooney.” A few minutes later, the Sky presenter made an announcement: “Would the people at home pretending to be Wayne Rooney please stop sending text messages?”

They have made their peace, or at least the process is well under way, and every one of us who has grown up supporting a team should appreciate how unsatisfactory it was that everything should end so dismally in 2004.

Everton’s crowd were hurt by him because, in short, they cared about him. It is almost always the same when a prized player wants to upgrade from a proud, emotional club, especially when it is a local boy who has come through the ranks, but now some of the politics and spite have made way, it will be intriguing to see what happens next.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/19/david-moyes-everton-wayne-rooney" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">David Moyes</a> always felt that Rooney would go back to Everton at some point in his career. Bill Kenwright, the club’s chairman, has said the same and anyone who watched the BBC’s documentary on <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/06/rooney-man-behind-goals-poems-gary-lineker-karaoke" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Man Behind The Goals</a> – an entertaining though plainly PR-managed, no-warts-at-all kind of event – could see how natural and comfortable the England captain was on his old turf. Rooney might have spent a lot of time away but he still thinks enough of Merseyside to make absolutely certain his children were born as Scousers in Liverpool hospitals, rather than allowing their passports to be stamped with Manchester, and even the most diehard Evertonian might have to accept the player had valid reasons for wanting to join a club of United’s stature and ambitions.

Would he ever return? It would not be a surprise here for various reasons even if, first things first, a player with Rooney’s competitive spirit presumably wants to believe he is capable of better times at Old Trafford, where his form has become a legitimate point of scrutiny. Rooney has done most things for United but he has never won a trophy as captain. He is still talking about playing in the World Cup in 2018 and, having received a personalised golden boot from Sir Bobby Charlton at Wembley on Friday after <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/08/wayne-rooney-england-switzerland-euro-2016" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">overtaking him as England’s record scorer</a>, the next chase is to establish himself in that position with his club as well.

Rooney is third in United’s all-time list of scorers with 235, two behind Denis Law, and gradually reeling in Charlton’s total of 249, even if it is taking a little longer than he might have anticipated, with only one in his last dozen Premier League appearances. The <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/26/club-brugge-manchester-united-champions-league-playoff-second-leg-match-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hat-trick against Club Brugge</a> in the Champions League playoffs should not be overlooked but, without wishing to be too negative, they were moderate opponents, currently sixth in the Belgian league, whereas in the Premier League, away from home, Rooney has the rather undistinguished record of scoring only once in the past 18 months. His form has waned to the point the <i>Manchester Evening News </i>ran a comment piece on Saturday encouraging Van Gaal to leave him out when United visit Everton next weekend.

He is certainly not the player he was, which we should probably expect given that he turns 30 within the next fortnight and has already crammed an extraordinary amount of football into his life. Rooney has had the kind of career that will earn him the respect of every professional in the sport and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, not a player who hands out compliments too easily, was absolutely right to note how unusual it was for a footballer to spend so long at the top of the sport.

<b>Equally, we should trust what our eyes tell us. Rooney’s deterioration has been pronounced enough to leave the distinct feeling that he is suffering the effects of playing so much so young (the equivalent, at the same age, as two full seasons more than Ryan Giggs, with a much more crash-bang-wallop style). There is no point dressing it up: in the worst moments, he resembles a champion boxer who has had one too many fights.</b>

At the highest level, there is little evidence that he can trouble defences in the way he once could, and when that is clearly the standard that Louis van Gaal wants to attain it is perfectly reasonable to wonder how long the United manager can tolerate these diminished performances. Until now, Van Gaal has always given Rooney unwavering support, but his treatment of Robin van Persie should be a reminder about what can happen when an old favourite fades.

The next level down is another matter and, though Everton are plainly more than a club of seconds and castoffs, they have a habit of going after players from Old Trafford who are either perceived as being on the way over the hill (Louis Saha, Phil Neville), or having never made it up the slope (Darron Gibson, Tom Cleverley). Rooney’s colleagues have certainly been given the impression he is entertaining the idea about finishing his career at Goodison and clearly it helps that the rawness has subsided a little, and he can go back to his old ground next weekend without the same levels of opprobrium he has encountered on his other appearances.

For now, Rooney’s first priority ought to be justifying Van Gaal’s perseverance with him. We are talking about next summer, at the very earliest, or more likely the following year before Everton explore the idea properly and, even then, it will not be straightforward when the player earns £235,000 a week, roughly three times Everton’s top earner.

“Once a Blue, always a Blue,” his T-shirt said. If it does come down to money, it might be that Rooney has to prove that again and, in the process, perhaps change the opinions of those on the Gwladys Street End.

4724~~~
Yeah. £5m maximum and that's even a push.

He won't leave though. People are dreaming if they think he will. He's here to stay until 2019 and will be a first team regular until 2017 at least - and if Giggs is the new manager then he's the first name on the sheet until 2019.

4725~~~
Just to highlight how much football he's played. Giggs started early and was hardly injured. That is staggering.

4726~~~
I enjoyed this typo.

4727~~~
You lot are dreaming if you think the current rooney will start ahead of lukaku

4728~~~
this crossed my mind, would he automatically just walk into evertons side anyway in a years time

4729~~~
He wouldn't get in now. Nevermind in a years time. 

Oh Jesus thats true isn't it?

*Shudders*

4730~~~
Shit.

4731~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> First word that came to my mind too.

4732~~~
It can't be great for the team either knowing they will be dropped for their form but other's wont..

4733~~~
Not only that but LVG is, apparently, breaking his cardinal rule of not fielding unfit players when it comes to Rooney. Strange behaviour indeed.

4734~~~
Only one man can save us now... Its up to Phil Jones.

4735~~~

4736~~~
Everton will be hoping he plays

4737~~~
Playing with poor form and lack of match rhythm. Awesome!

4738~~~
It is. And realistically van Gaal has at least until 2017 and he prolongs then maybe even 2018, then Giggs will very likely step in to replace him and get at least a year. Rooney's contract runs out in 2019 so he will definitely be a captain and a definite starter until then because no manager other than van Gaal and Giggs will be in charge and neither of them would ever drop him under any circumstances.

So it's basically 10 players + Rooney for the next 3 and a half years.

4739~~~
We'll be a much better team when he finally leaves, unfortunately doesn't look like he will anytime soon, out of form, out of fitness and just out of his league when compared to a bloody 19 year old, needs to have an extended break from the first team, being captain shouldn't make him undroppable if he's playing shit.

4740~~~
Three and a half years and we will replace him <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4741~~~
Plus the new contract Giggs will reward him with.

4742~~~
I think he will ask to leave himself at that point. I can't see his body being able to sustain Premier League pace at 33. Then again he doesn't even have to sustain pace, he just has to be on the pitch because no possible action of his would ever lose him his place in the starting XI.

Thinking about this, it's really counter-productive because Rooney himself would probably rather not be undroppable as it'd decrease pressure and add motivation.

4743~~~
<a class="username" data-user="34598, @NextSeason" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34598/">@NextSeason</a> 
Thanks.

4744~~~
Somebody joked about this. Short of Rooney scoring an own goal, hat-trick, he won't get dropped. In fact even if he scored an own goal hat-trick, LVG and Rooney supporters will somehow suggest that this is a good thing and therefore must continue to play. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Martinez will be ruthless. If Rooney is bad, he'll bench Rooney. England legend or not.
In any case, I can't ever seeing Martinez saying yes to Rooney joining Everton. Martinez wants to keep his job.

4745~~~
You don't seriously believe that do you? Are people being tongue-in-cheek here or do they actually think that Rooney with performance levels of the last couple of months will be United captain for the next few years? I'd wager that he'll be sold in the summer if he won't up his levels this season sharpish.

4746~~~
I think that his recent performances are exactly the evidence why he will absolutely never be dropped by van Gaal. He's reached his bottom level and he's still the first name on the team sheet, no one else gets anywhere near this level of leeway.

4747~~~
<a class="username" data-user="8145, @Sarni" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8145/">@Sarni</a>
Yes, so far, so...erm, unbelievable. Two hypotheses I'd like to throw out there.

Rooney has been absolutely terrible. Not in just in terms of the player he used to be, but full stop. But that cannot continue. He is better than what he's shown so far. Surely, if any player would suffer this massive dip in performances without improvement, they'd do the honorable thing and retire. I think he'll improve (not greatly, but enough to contribute something to the team).

If that doesn't happen, and picking him keeps messing with the balance of our side, carrying a passenger Rooney, Louis will at some point drop him. It's still early in the season, he may see something totally different in training that gives him a reason to keep selecting him. But Rooney won't be able to go through a full season like this starting games, nevermind seasons beyond this one at United.

4748~~~
What is going on here? Surely LVG is committing suicide with his job by constantly playing Rooney - this makes no sense, and whatever else he may be, he's not stupid. 
Sooner rather than later, the dressing room is not going to be so rosy. Human nature being what it is - there's no way his teammates won't get pissed off with this favourable treatment, especially when some of them end up cleaning up his mess on the pitch. It's hard enough playing your own role, and then having to pick up after someone who is not contributing is just crap.

I hope to God we win somehow, irrespective of Rooney. It's just shit!

4749~~~
I hate to say it but I don't think Rooney and 'honour' will ever meet...

He's not Eric Cantona who recognised this and didn't let his ego get in the way of doing the right thing for himself and of course the team.

4750~~~
He hasn't done well for Utd his season (well... for the past 2/3 seasons if truth be told)
He never does well against Everton. 
He shouldn't play this weekend. 
He shouldn't be shoehorned into a team to accommodate him 'cause of history.... if that was the case we'd still have Cantona in the starting XI.. and the rest!

4751~~~
He will play. Best make your peace with it.

4752~~~
And he'll be shit. And we'll moan. And his ever-decreasing number of supporters here will remind us what a fantastic player Rooney is, and that he is better than this (despite that 'this' is what Rooney has been showing for a year or so). It is an insane situation.

4753~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Too right.

4754~~~
Preach.

4755~~~
Hope Jones turns up, Rooney is a waste of space most of the times.

4756~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Too true.

4757~~~
I really hope that we are not playing Jones as a second striker.

4758~~~
That depends on how long Everton will be able to hold on to him, and then there's also Barkley.

4759~~~
So we'll hate him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A shit knight.

But yea, it's 100% that he'll fecking play against Everton, it boggles my mind how nobody at the fecking club protests about it, it's not even about his form this season which is abysmal, it's that he's always abysmal against Liverpool and Everton.

4760~~~
Meh.  Even moptop is better than him atm

4761~~~
Sir Alex recons he'll be back on the goal trail soon and we have to wait. Normally I would agree but as bad as his goal scoring form is, it's not the worst part of his game right now.

4762~~~
Have some faith!

4763~~~
I think this is the main for thing for me. You can totally understand players going through rough patches in terms of goalscoring. It happens to pretty much everyone. The problem I have with Rooney, his general play is just really poor. Which hasn't been the case in the past when he's been in a rut. I mean, he's seemingly got not first touch anymore. His passing is erratic and sloppy, overhitting, under hitting or just using the safe option and passing back.

Had he been playing well and just not scoring then I think far more people would understand that. What we're seeing at the moment is just terrible, and he's seemingly untouchable too which just rubs me the wrong way.

4764~~~
Yeah, I am sure he will score a few goals over the course of the season. But the problem is that he just stinks up our game right now, which is the main issue.

4765~~~
Rooney has so many other problems than not scoring. His first touch is probably one of the worst of his career. His passing to opposition frequency has increased.

4766~~~
Does anyone have a gif of when he tried to dribble Ozil?

4767~~~
A shit knight <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4768~~~
You guys should pay attention to the language used when he signed his contract;

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Rooney extends contract</b></span>
<b>- New deal commits striker to United until June 2019
- Player has "outstanding chance" to become club's all-time goalscorer
- Ambassadorial role after retirement</b>

<b>Wayne Rooney has committed his future to Manchester United by signing a four-year contract extension, keeping him at the club until June 2019. Wayne will also become a club ambassador when he retires from the game.

</b>


He is going to break our all time goal scoring record, he will retire at the club, and when he does he will still be the face of the club. It's really scary but Rooney is a lot more than just a player now. He's the face of the entire organization and they will keep playing him until he breaks the record and retires here.

4769~~~
He might be the face of the club at the moment but, rest assured that history will make sure SAF, SBC, Giggs, Best even Eric will be the face of the club and Rooney will be behind them. 

I believe that to be a fact. He could break all the records in the world and he'd still be behind those and maybe one or two others. And that's not me being a "hater" I just get that feeling and it's so strong, that I'm certain of it

4770~~~
I don't get how a 4 year contract runs to 2019 when he signed it in 2014. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

It doesn't matter anyway, Manchester United is much bigger than Rooney, there's no way the club will sit there scratching it's arse as he stinks the place out week after week affecting the clubs chances of winning anything, what needs to be done will be done.

4771~~~
Amen

4772~~~
As much as I keep hearing this - we have had much more marketable players than Rooney in the past who were sold on. Beckham comes to mind. I don't think Rooney is that at all but I know it's get said often enough.

Rooney is on the slide and I just pray that if it's permanent we can work something out financially to see him bugger off somewhere else.

4773~~~
Its an extension, so likely he already had a deal until 2015 and they added 4 more to it after he bitched about going to Chelsea.

4774~~~
I knew it would haunt us the day he signed that bloody thing. The club was at such a low point that they could have given him Old Trafford if he wanted it.

4775~~~
The wages, as much as some will dismiss them, are extraordinary when you consider the performances. I mean he's getting paid for going about like Kevin Kilbane and I do feel like I'm being harsh on Kilbane as I type that. 

I mean Torres wasn't on that sort of money at least when he took a dive.

4776~~~
Rooney has been a fantastic player for this club.  He's made moments of history that will always be in our memories. And his past years were a joy to watch.

However it's all being stained with these recent years of poor perfomances and just looking like a shadow of what he was...barely a shadow...a blurry image in the distance that you think could be a dustbin.

There's been too many games at the start of this season where he has been a complete wreck or simply par, to the point where you feel we're handicapping ourselves (which is so embarassing looking at the big picture of who he is).

I've argued with friends about him and he is pretty much indefensible, the only retorts seem to be 'hes not been that bad' or pointing the finger at other players also playing bad, or bringing up the point of his goalscoring record. 

Lets cut the BS and talk about the present, stop avoiding the focus of him simply not stepping up and delivering.  I dont want him breaking goalscoring records playing like a bag of poo stumbling over the finish line and pissing all over the toilet like a drunken fool whos been chucking back pints all day.  Surely no one wants to see that...

4777~~~
That makes sense, like any contract though it will be far from unbreakable.

4778~~~
Probably Jose would do us a favor and take him in January.

4779~~~
Rooney isn't really marketable in 2013 it was reported that he earned 3m$ from commercial endorsements

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/02/22/wayne-rooney-signs-104-million-contract-with-manchester-united/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbad...-104-million-contract-with-manchester-united/</a>

4780~~~
just like Van Persie, if its clear they aint wanted...

reading that reminder post above though, the thing about the ambassador role might make it awkward

4781~~~
I haven't posted much about Rooney lately as I've been critical of him before and I see no point in saying I told you so over and over. However, what annoys me about Rooney these days is that up until the 80th minute, he can stroll around the pitch not looking bothered to chase down a single ball, which he has mostly misplaced himself. Then, with five minutes left of the game, most of the players happy to not run more than the bare minimum, he suddenly wakes up and sprints around. Is that his way of proving to the critics that he works hard, because really he hasn't. 

There are still people talking about Rooney being world class, as class is permanent. In my opinion, he probably never was world class. He was at Tevez level, which is a great player, but not world class - same with Benzema. Currently, Rooney is below average for a team like United. We have more important and better players in defense, in midfield and now a 19 year old in attack, and of course Mata. There are probably a good handful of strikers in the PL that would contribute more to our team than he currently does, and there are probably equally many better suited to the 10 position in the league than he is. 

We should judge him on what he is now and how he plays now. Some may regard him as a club legend and some won't. Either way, I doubt many will argue that he has shown, over the last three seasons, that he is worthy of recognition in the same vein as the great players of other top teams such as Ibrahimovic, Robben, Aguero, Suarez, let alone Ronaldo and Messi.

4782~~~
He's on pretty much every advert for the premier League over here. Rooney is far more famous in North American than Aguero or Sanchez or Hazard. Probably Asia too.

4783~~~
Soon or later reality is going to catch up with people at the club, particular the management, and he won't survive another really bad defeat like the one at Arsenal. He has been given enough game time to play himself out of the team and a few sections of the press are already turning the heat on his performances. He won't last another three months at this level forget about three and half years. Anything else would be institutional suicide.

4784~~~
Being famous is useless if you can't monetize it and Rooney doesn't monetize his fame.

4785~~~
he has just become England's all time goalscorer and will crawl to the united one. Plenty of marketing left in him

4786~~~
Ofcourse it would help his marketability if he wasn't ugly as sin.

4787~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I tried no to say it but now that it's out, Rooney will only be used for cheap phones, technical sportswear and Sports TV Membership. That's nice but not enough for a club like United, his marketability isn't big enough to justify a place in the team, it's not even enough to justify his wage even when he was at his best.

4788~~~
So he's signed up to be a club ambassador. Most ambassadors work overseas. MLS is still on.

4789~~~
If Mourinho is still employed that would be a good way to put the final nail in his coffin.

I guess he could come back in an ambassador role after he's had a few seasons in the MLS.

4790~~~
First time I've ever said this about a United player, in my 25 years following them but, he cannot start this game.

He is a disaster anytime he goes there. Even that 4-2 in 2007, he was still woeful for the vast majority. 

We've lost the last three times we've gone there. After the Arsenal match, we cannot afford to piss about with him at Goodison

4791~~~
He's gonna start, we know this and we know there's feck all we can do about it.

4792~~~
Chop his dick off and name him Reek until he starts performing to standard.

Wayne "Reek" Rooney 2015/2016 Performances

4793~~~
You'd wonder if LVG is even aware of his record there, as he doesn't currently seem to be aware of his disastrous contribution to the team.

4794~~~
He's starting tomorrow, I have made peace with it. He's starting against City next week too. I have made peace with that too.

4795~~~
He's starting every game he's available, might as well get to work making peace with that as well...

4796~~~
The least we can ask of him is that even if he isn't amazing he can at least not kill off our attackes and not give the ball away.

4797~~~
If only there's a bet om rooney starting we'd be rich

4798~~~
Let's see how your peace holds up when we are tenth having lost three in three next week, this team is not strong enough to carry passengers or play against twelve men in the big games, sadly tomorrow and against City there is a very high chance that he will either be a passenger or that he will hinder our play so much that we will effectively be playing 10 against 12.

4799~~~
Can't wait for his next biography and documentary to help me forget about his upcoming ineptitude.

4800~~~

4801~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

I have included him in my prediction team. Hope i miss out on a point.

4802~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4803~~~
Believe me when I say I want him dropped , and preferably sold this summer, but he has been putting out terrible performance week in and out and nothing has changed. I am one of those who isnt surprised by how poor he is now, as the signs have been there for a while now, and the goal scoring has masked that in the past. 

But the manager doesn't want to drop him for whatever ever reason, and We just have hope that the other players can compensate for his presence on the pitch. Against the bigger clubs, that means we will have to play out of our skins, but with smaller ones especially at home, we will get way with it.

4804~~~
Yes, he is. Its life, Martial needs to improve in hitting Rooney with footballs, to get him more goals.

4805~~~
Isn't this ironic that his only league goal came because Martial was at too tight an angle to finish and had to use Rooney to score <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4806~~~
Loved the headlines after that game..it was almost like it was the beginning of some great resurgence..but its sad too..We United fans deserve so much better, much better than this.

4807~~~
when I'm at old Trafford and he tries his long pass to the right, a little piece of me dies inside. While everyone around me gasps

4808~~~
He can't even do that well anymore either, they seem to be getting intercepted much more frequently than they were in the past.

4809~~~
That's because it's so predictable and every PL defender know he's going to do this. Hell even I can anticipate exactly what he's going to do much less those professional footballers. It's a sad state of affairs imo.

4810~~~
Valencia just smiles and gets on his bike.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Okay, grin..not smile.

4811~~~
Fecking hell, just remembered I've got to watch him all over again tomorrow.

4812~~~
Considering that even at his best his performances in Liverpool were shocking, I'm guessing he's gonna put in a performance Saturday that we won't easily forget. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4813~~~
Fixed <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

4814~~~

4815~~~
That's just cruel. In 4 years he'll just be dumped in the centre circle where he'll casually graze for 90 minutes before being wheeled back off. Broadly similar I guess?

4816~~~
Balls to that.

4817~~~
Oh feck off Louis

4818~~~
Turn him into a coach then, Louis. Sooner or later LVG is going to have to judge Rooney's pluses & minuses as a <i>player</i>, not as a liaison officer or lieutenant.

4819~~~
This is weird...  Does he holds the dressing room or something? 

Ed wouldnt flinch if lvg drops him.  He's becoming our terry i guess.  But that doesnt make sense as well,  most of the old guards are gone, there's only carrick,  valencia,  young. No way the like of shaw, bfs, memphis, and our new players looks at him with awe,  even bfs looks pissed with him at times.

4820~~~
we can only hopelessly watch on as he starts again tomorrow and inevitably has another stinker.

rival fans must be loving this and rightly so.

4821~~~
He is going to play every single game when fit under van Gaal and Giggs. His performances don't matter at all.

4822~~~
What influence?

4823~~~
Books the nights out and organises the karaoke. Great lad.

4824~~~
Maybe, just maybe, he should actually see what is happening himself(Gary-style). Not retire, but take himself out a little and get his head back in it. Cause this is hard to watch.

Then again, I really hope he turns it round today.

4825~~~
sigh.

4826~~~
LvG should remember what happened to the last guy who allowed his head to get stuck up Rooney's arse because it could happen to him too. Rooney is no longer the player in whose busket a serious manager should be putting all of his eggs in. Make him earn his starting place in the team and maybe, just maybe, we will get to see better performances from the team and eventually it's captain!

4827~~~
But the name aside and your arrived on the planet from Mars, you'd question is this the player about to break all these goal scoring records on current form. Rooney lucky this season about our limitations up front but won't have that luxury next year and that includes January.

4828~~~
Indeed, happy birthday to me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4829~~~
Put Rooney left in the front three interchangeable with Martial and drop Depay.

4830~~~
Anyone else having this feeling that perhaps today is the day he puts in a WC performance? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4831~~~
Clearly the cafe has better insight than the manager. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4832~~~
Some things are certain and one of them is that Rooney will play in the next game, van Gaal will praise him for his immense influence and Pogue will say he was fine and point out all the forward passes.

4833~~~
Obviously the Silent Dominator puts in top performances each week, but they are just invisible to the untrained eye.

4834~~~
Bizarre comments, really really weird. I hope, for the sake of our season, these comments aren't genuine.

4835~~~
Exactly. Never in the history of football has a manager made wrong, inexplicable decision based on a very dubious foundation.

4836~~~
I really really want him to improve because I'm so tired of reading all the hate aimed his way on here.

4837~~~
Not hate, just huge disappointment.

4838~~~
You have a point , The CAF does love to question the managers decisions . Just last season they were all up in arms about LVG's decision to play RVP and Falcao upfront as a strike partnership. Not a  single of them is complaining about that now. This too will pass, eventually.

4839~~~
Amen to that.

4840~~~
Certainly hope you are right.

4841~~~
Louis has lost his mind with Rooney<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> As long as he accepts that if Rooney does not improve he will more than likely lose his job then I guess it's his problem. Shame that us fans who pay to go to the matches, and pay for subscriptions to Sky/Bt etc will have to put up with this frankly weird stance on Rooney. Talk about suicidal<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Rooney had better make me look bad today after my comment, but sadly I don't think he will<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Carry on playing with a wrecked Rooney and we might not make top four.

4842~~~
Seems our captain has a new position.

4843~~~
Have to wait and see. Van Gaal did mention that in his press conference yesterday, though.

4844~~~
I am at peace.

4845~~~
I see everyone is complaining about our captain starting despite him being up there with martial as our best player against arsenal <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4846~~~
I still have hope, he can retrieve form.

4847~~~
He'll score today.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Or not. But one of the two will definitely happen. </span>

4848~~~
Don't mind him starting, just hope he actually plays well against Everton at Goodison for a change. Needs to pick up form, if he can 15 league goals, which seems impossible at the moment, then we'd be in a great position to challenge for the title. He scores in streaks though -- hopefully he'll get one today, then go on a run. Otherwise it will look bleak.

4849~~~
I think he'll be upfront with Martial on the left.

4850~~~
You are pretty much only person who thinks that. Even van Gaal finally did something with him because he was awful in first half and moved him wide after so many games.

4851~~~
Nice to see that you have a low benchmark for his performances as we do.

4852~~~
I should say well in comparison to the others. He was better then Memphis and young is injured. Not exactly sure who people would want to start above him today seeing as Memphis needed to go on the bench. Fellaini? feck that.

4853~~~
Well he still played better then the other attacking players and its not like we have anyone else to start ahead of him. Memphis needed to be dropped more then Rooney. Our only other option is basically fellaini as Young is injured. So he had to start

4854~~~
I dont disagree that Memphis should be dropped..but using his performance against Arsenal as justification for a start is just wrong. Both him and Memphis have been quite poor. 

For the record, Id rather have him than Memphis because he tracks back, especially against Coleman.

4855~~~
Well Memphis was terrible so that's not really good argument. Rooney hasn't played LW for about 6 or 7 years apart from 1 or two games per season, so I am not sure how exactly he started competing for that place again. I think that just shows how terrible he is as a striker or second striker this year because if he was at least decent we would play him there and Martial on the left for example. 

Fellaini? Why not, everyone deserves a chance, especially if we have player in our first XI who is our worst player this year and plays in same position as Fellaini.

4856~~~
If he's shite again today (which seems likely) and LVG doesn't sub him - I'm officially done with my support for the manager. He's a coward if he allows this nonsense to continue.

4857~~~
Predictably he's started but rather than bickering over what we can't change here is hoping he has a great match to shut us up for a week, at least.

4858~~~
If he is poor again and isn't taken off then questions really do have to be asked. I'm still fairly sure there are guarantees in his contract about playing time that hamstring the manager. fecking Moyes.

4859~~~
~20 minutes in and he looks much better on the ball - thank god for that. Maybe the rest over the international break has helped him.

Some nice movement and inter-play. Much better.

4860~~~
I have slagged him in the early moments but he looks much improved

4861~~~
Last 10 mins every time he has received the ball he has lost it, poor!!

4862~~~
Wayne's favorite RHCP song:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uh4fSKE6b-A?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4863~~~
He is still poor.

4864~~~
Has WR completed a pass today?

4865~~~
It's sad watching him play like this.

4866~~~
Yeah, seems like his start wasn't kept up in the game. Passes are very poor again.

Although in his favour, he's not the only one.

4867~~~
He is holding back Manchester United.

4868~~~
We should not have to shift Martial out wide to incorporate Rooney. Martial is a better striker and a more  viable threat to opposition defenders. We should not be rewarding bad performances as it does not send a good message to all the boys and girls watching us play.

4869~~~
Martial wasn't in the box and he chose to pass. A great run and he executed a good pass (for once) and Martial should have scored (granted), but simply put, that is the clearest indicator of a player short of confidence. A striker would always shoot in that situation and it didn't look remotely like he was ever going to.

EDIT - Same again in the attack just before the close of the half. Always looked to pass instead of heading into the box with one thought on his mind - shot. In the end a poorly executed through ball after dallying.

4870~~~
Much better today, despite losing possession a few times he's more involved and a lot more lively, encouraging to see.

4871~~~
Three times he's had freedom to run at the backs and he didn't look like getting past them either time. Offered nothing but killing our attack time and time again. 

MSL please.

4872~~~
Maybe it's just because we're winning and I'm not feeling so critical, but I don't think he was that bad really.

4873~~~
Started well and then someone flicked the shit switch.

4874~~~
He's actually putting in some effort today, unlike against Arse. 


Still, not good enough in that position. Martial is being sacrificed on the wing to let Rooney play there.

4875~~~
Nah it was a pretty awful angle and he had the keeper committed, good pass.

4876~~~
Started well and then someone flicked the shit switch.

4877~~~
First 20 minutes or so he looked at least sharp, very sloppy after that though.

4878~~~
He's been alright.

4879~~~
he was alright in first ten minutes  then came to complete shit again, LVG should get a grip and bench him, starting every game with ten men is not good philosophy in my view...

4880~~~
Started well but his sloppiness half way through the half onwards was shocking really.....just so fecking careless with what should be simple passes.

Was at fault for breaking our rhythm on a few occasions

I'm finding it hard to defend him anymore. But we only have one other striker sadly

4881~~~
He's been OK... But very worrying that he isn't shooting when through 1 vs 1...

4882~~~
Given the ball away a lot but done some good things too. Excellent foul to create the first goal.

4883~~~
He's doing better today, which is good to see. We can cope with Martial playing wide in the odd game, as we don't really have other options with Memphis out of form and Young injured.

4884~~~
He started off really well and has looked threatening throughout the half, but the moment he loses the first ball, it's like his confidence completely goes, which then turns into losing it twice, three times, etc. He just needs to relax a bit more because he can do it. There was a moment when he had like three players around him, he took it down and popped it off. Was class play. He's playing a lot better than he has though, especially as it's against Everton. Fancy him to score today. Hope so anywa.

4885~~~
His passing and touch is all over the shop but a rather encouraging performance.

4886~~~
Who should be starting ahead of him as the #9 seeing as he's much better atm

4887~~~
Started running at players again. A lot better but still a little sloppy at times.

4888~~~
Only a complete idiot would have tried shooting there.

4889~~~
At the very least, Martial should have made a much stronger shot.

4890~~~
He went to shit as the half went on.

Stated well though, and set up Martial superbly.

Can't see him being subbed, but hopefully builds on the good stuff from the first half.

4891~~~
Anyone else think he looks rather awkward dribbling? Tbf he's done alright so far.

4892~~~
The Martial chance? Don't think he did anything wrong at all, left him with a wide open shot on goal.

4893~~~
He hasn't been terrible. I'd rather see him swap positions with Martial though.

4894~~~
He was still in comfortable shooting range and a decent angle to even slot it near post still...

4895~~~
Piss poor

4896~~~
The standards here have dropped alarmingly low. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4897~~~
Great finish.

4898~~~
Indeed

4899~~~
Course he'd score after i posted that <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4900~~~
hahahaha oh dear

4901~~~
He finally shoots and scores! Good lad.

4902~~~
Well done lad!

4903~~~
Reminded me of him former self a bit, that goal <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4904~~~
Finally. He was due a performance after 10 years of stinking up the place against that lot. Well-taken goal.

4905~~~
He hadn't been 'piss poor' anyway.

4906~~~
Credit where it's due, that was a nice finish. 

He looked leggy as feck when he actually broke through though, I thought the defender was going to catch him.

4907~~~

4908~~~
Lovely goal.

4909~~~
Good goal. Do it every week, please.

4910~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4911~~~
Thought he had another there

4912~~~
I like the second half Rooney today.

4913~~~
He's been very good today.

4914~~~
He started poorly, got better and scored!  Must feel nice to have ended such a terrible drought.

4915~~~
Almost 2 there

4916~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

4917~~~
He really, really hasn't. The amount of times he gave the ball away and spoilt our attacks was ridiculous. 

Good goal, no arguing with that, but he was poor up til then.

4918~~~
Nice.

4919~~~
He's done what has been missing in his game, which is a bit of aggression and directness. Wouldn't be surprised if he knocks in another goal or two.

4920~~~
Very happy for him... good second half.

4921~~~
He hasn't been very good at all, this is just overexaggeration but he hasn't been terrible either and has shown glimpses of quality. Scored a good goal too, can't complain about his performance too much today but he still needs to be much better.

4922~~~
Yep.

He has lost possession on occasion but looks as dangerous and lively as he has for months and actually looks like he can have positive affect on the game.

Far more encouraging so it's a a bit shit to see our fans on here still trying hard to criticise him.

4923~~~
A bit of aggression doesn't undo repeatedly losing possession. 

Like I said, he scored a very good goal and he's looked a bit more lively since, but to say he's had a very good game is just wrong.

4924~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4925~~~
Well argued.

4926~~~
Completely agree. He's been poor afterwards too. Still, typical Rooney, score and praise and forget the other 88 mins.

EDIT - But I am pleased he's scored obviously. I hope this goal and confidence kicks on and develops into a hot streak of form.

4927~~~
Martial would have done more with the chances that Rooney has had today. He will actually run at defenders and take them on. I've seen Rooney abort several runs today. He just stops, turns, and passes backwards, unable to take on a man.

4928~~~
Especially since we've only played 77 so far.

4929~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4930~~~
Goal masks another below par performance but a step in the right direction.

4931~~~
Which is all we can ask for realistically. Its not like he's going to suddenly become Rooney circa 2010 again.

4932~~~
Rooney: 187 goals in 415 PL games
Andy Cole: 187 goals in 414 PL games

4933~~~
Very impressive considering the various positions he has taken up throughout his career.

4934~~~
Took the goal really well, overall though he's been average... good and bad in equal measure I'd say.

The one thing that has disappointed me is how much has gone backwards, Martial and Lingard saw little of it until the very end because he couldn't really involve them like he is capable of... Can only really remember one (delightful) Hooked ball to lingard over the top.

4935~~~
Was a good performance today. Credit where credit is due he held the ball up well, played sensible passes and made some fantastic runs.

If the rest / bollocking worked then fantastic, I'm sure we would all prefer to see an in form Rooney. Hopefully he keeps this up over the next couple weeks.

4936~~~
Now we watch if he can carry on and improve. 

Really sloppy first half but came alive after the goal, which was well taken.

4937~~~
Sloppy at times but he had a good game. Probably his best of the season so hopefully we see some more of it. Really good finish for his goal.

4938~~~
He's still mostly a negative influence on the flow of our attack. The goal will make those who still believe in him forget all of that. His hold up play is not something you can count on, he will look for the backpass more often that set someone else up. It was a performance you'd get from Hernandez, a goal but overall not good enough to warrant the lone striker role.

4939~~~
Good performance from him, based on his pervious matches.

Also, moving Martial to the left didn't effect his performance so wouldn't surprise me to see this formation next match.

4940~~~
Its so hard to believe in Rooney these days. You hope he'll kick on after scoring. It was a very well taken goal, and his short passing did seem to improve after that, but he's threatened to burst into life for years now e.g. Bruges (A). God knows if he will. I hope so.

4941~~~
Good goal, but the rest of the performance was pretty meh.

4942~~~
Took a lot more set pieces than Andy Cole and never had to play for Blackburn, Man City or Portsmouth.

Lost the ball a few times, but what I'm best pleased about is that today he always looked like he was going to threaten.

I said when the first half finished that I fancied him to score and he did. Unlucky not to get more than one, but there was signs of improvement today. Just hope he can build from this.

4944~~~
Even without the goal I thought he looked much sharper. Long overdue.

4945~~~
Howard is covering the angles and it would have been hard to slot it near post. Meanwhile Martial is central with practically an open net, if he gets proper connection on his strike it is an automatic goal. Its simply ridiculous to criticize him for passing as any player with half a brain would have passed it.

4946~~~
I missed majority of the game so can't really comment on his performance, but it's really weird that majority argue that "he played well <i>considering his form". </i>It really shows how standards have really dropped for him.

4947~~~
Happy that he's scored the goal.

4948~~~
Much better n the 2nd

Please go on a run now wazza it's really needed

4949~~~
Hasn't seen most of the game but still bouncing in for a dig at Rooney.

Stay classy Redcafe.

4950~~~
Great finish for the goal, but doesn't excuse the 20 times he lost the ball and the 3 goals he should've created/scored for me.

4951~~~
Very promising and he was very good after his goal. I'm hoping he is back for good because it means we will be benefiting.

4952~~~
The goal wasnt that impressive. It was gifted to him by Yagielka and Howard (getting beaten at the near post by a tame shot from the edge of the box)..
But the performance was better in the second half. 
Hope he kicks on..

The lack of pace when he runs with the ball is still a problem.

4953~~~
Very good performance overall. First 30 minutes was very good, got sloppy, then the second half was very good again. More of the same please. Huge goal for him though, away to Everton. He's clearly lost a bit of pace but he showed today how he can still give us a huge impact.

4954~~~
He could have had at least one more. Perhaps 2 more. We will get his form back.

4955~~~
Much better second half after three or four horrific unnecessary ball losses - to use LVG-speak - in the first. Linked much better with those around him and clearly likes playing with Herrera and Martial.

4956~~~
Between about 20-45 minutes he was really poor (except for that one run) but in the second half he was good and took his goal nicely. Considering both a) how dreadful he's been generally this season and b) that he's normally awful at Goodison and it's often like playing with 10, I thought today was an improvement.

Don't get me wrong, he's got a lot of work to do to convince me 'he's back' or anything but today was at least a performance heading in the right direction.

4957~~~
Rooney playing upfront instead of Martial is pure politics. HE IS feckING SHITE.

4958~~~
A decent performance and, other than that spell in the first half, wasn't the hindrance he has been for much of this season.

Not sure about those calling it very good but it is a performance to be built on and the best I can remember him playing at Goodison for a long while.

4959~~~
Needs 14 goals for the record. Has at least 35 games to get them in. Currently scoring at a rate of 1 in 2, so it looks doable.

Thought he played quite well today. And over the last two seasons, i'd say he's actually running with the ball much more than he was in his mid-20s.

4960~~~
This!!!!

4961~~~
Shite first half, as good as hes ever been on Goodison in the second. Promising, but for me at least hes not out of the dog house yet. For a player on his wages, this was decent, not a benchmark performance

4962~~~
Really?

4963~~~
His second half was much much better than anything he's showed this season.

4964~~~
It's not a dig, it's just an observation which is pretty easy to notice.

4965~~~
Scoring from set pieces is such an overated quality.

4966~~~
Of course it isn't. And no, your aren't obsessed. Carry on.

4967~~~
Half of the regulars on this thread if he does break the record this season:

*gif removed, please don't post non football gifs in the football forums*

4968~~~
Could've had three with some fire in his belly.

4969~~~
He is better upfront, it's not good enough for the moment but maybe he can play a big part for us this season.

4970~~~
He was much better 2nd half. He took his goal well. Still a few sloppy moments and he's definitely lost that burst of pace, but he wasn't poor and didn't hold the team down. Yeah perhaps our standards have fallen, but that's just the way it is atm with Rooney.

4971~~~
Was good today, let's hope he can kick on.

4972~~~
This is who Wayne is these days. A sad sight really. He's not terrible but damn, where did that freak of nature go?

4973~~~
He is a striker, not an attacking midfielder or a winger.

He must play only as a striker

4974~~~
The 1st half was probably the worst I've seen him play. If he won't be subbed after that he will never be dropped. He improved after the goal but should've taken the 2nd chance too. Overall 6/10, a bonus point for the goal and a great volleyed pass.

4975~~~
Below par? It was by far the best I have seen of him this season. His movement was exceptional and he had Stones and Jagielka doing Chuckle Brothers stuff for much of the match. Not only that, he scored a very well taken goal to put the result beyond doubt. Not a world class performance by any means but certainly a lot more like what I expect of a Manchester United striker. Well done Wayne.

4976~~~
Happy. He's devilverd complete shite so far. He was anything but shite today.

4977~~~
Did well today but he still looks slow and unable to effect games like he did years ago.  Happy he took his chance and really wish he had gotten the second.

4978~~~
Such highs and lows in a game. Solid start, went to absolute shite after that and did well again in the 2nd half. Very nicely taken goal.

4979~~~
Much better today, well taken goal and now hope this means he'll regain some confidence and form.

4980~~~
Good performance...and after seeing his documentary, I have to bow down to the fact he's given his whole career to us...and even at this age still scores and frustrates like any player. He's the captain and the manager feels that is right for the team. Yeah..sure he messes up, but the focus on him is huge. I'd rather still have him at United than anywhere else.

4981~~~
Much better today. His short passing is annoying, but credit where it's due, his movement was really good and it was a class finish for the goal.

4982~~~
Still not good enough for me but was happy to see him put the game to bed with a nice goal. Hopefully he can make more contributions like this and get himself into form. The frustrating thing is we know how good he can be but we haven't seen it for a long time now.

4983~~~
Says the guy who came out of nowhere in this thread posting about 20 posts after decent game from Rooney. I can't remember you posting at all in this thread earlier this season.

4984~~~
Just about acceptable, but given how utterly shit he has been this season and his usual standard at goodison I'm happy with that.

4985~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4986~~~
Progress. Let's call it that. Great goal though!

4987~~~
Took his goal well and was decent for the first 20 minutes, but all I really see is a past it striker keeping a better, younger striker out of position.

4988~~~
I'v criticised him many times this season in various threads, I can recognise when he's made a good contribution to a game though. Not outstanding but his performance, for once in recent months, actually justified his selection. You haven't even seen the game, surely you should be happy about this?

4989~~~
He gives away the ball 12 times. 

If that's what we expect then yeah,  fair play

4990~~~
What does everyone make of this piece by Ogden.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/wayne-rooney/11938351/Like-his-idol-Mike-Tyson-Wayne-Rooney-on-ropes-at-30.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...l-Mike-Tyson-Wayne-Rooney-on-ropes-at-30.html</a>

4991~~~
Not really. But taking penalties makes it easier to boost your goal total. Given Rooney's reputation over the years it serves to remind how good Andy Cole was.

4992~~~
Had to stop reading when he brought in the irrelevant and tired 'Gerrard always gave it his all' bullshit.

4993~~~
isn't it what everyone is unquietly thinking?

4994~~~
Finished well and moved the ball a bit better, but it's insane how much his legs have gone. He just can't run.

4995~~~
A no.9 losing the ball a few times, who'd have thunk it eh?

4996~~~
I thought he looked raw, but I'm glad he got his goal.

4997~~~
He was decent. Let us hope that he might hit some form.

4998~~~
What we have seen today I think is the best he can do

He has to play as a striker, with only one duty, score a goal, stop.

He has no the legs to do more duties or other roles.

4999~~~
I guess he did very well today and good overall contribution.

5000~~~
I dont think the constant changing of positions over the last few years have helped him really, out left, in behind, upfront, midfield. 

It was probably a bit easier when he was younger but he's approaching, or has arrived at, an age where he needs to start altering his game and I think he'd benefit from having a nailed down, definite position. 

All in all I think he did well today, but that didn't stop the usual weapons you get in the match day thread slaughtering him at half time.

5001~~~
Agreed.

5002~~~
Scored a goal so which will inevitably cover over his performance...(Was a well taken finish mind)

But he was utter utter garbage. He's just so bad its laughable. The amount of moves that broke down with him was just ridiculous. Team would pass it around nicely, keeping possession, it get stop Rooney and bang, the move would break down. Offers no physical presence up front, no hold up play, no pace, poor link up play. If anyone thought that was a good performance, then they're living in a life of complete delusion quite frankly. He stood out today like a sore thumb, in a team keeping good possession and looking very comfortable on the ball. 

Had to be handed his goal on a plate, which is pretty much the only way he scores thesedays.

5003~~~
Really good finish for his goal, did Howard.
Could and should have had another goal or two (although one he did set up martial for it).

Other than that, whilst is performance can be described as better, it certainly wasnt good.

If hes just being judged on goals, fair enough, but ultimately he needs to do much much better otherwise we may as well just sign a goal scorer who offers nothing else and it will suit us better if thats the case.

5004~~~
He's a sad sight Wayne. And this is who he is now days. Some will say he's out of form but I don't think that's the case.

5005~~~
Utter utter garbage?

Woah, thread, you still deliver.

5006~~~
Today was an improvement, but it wasn't great either.

His first half bordered on woeful, and while the second was better (with a great finish to boot), watching a 33 year old Phil Jagielka catch up with him on the counter was a sad sight.

5007~~~
He was shite. A goal handed to him on a plate doesn't change that. 

The difference between Marcial's performances upfront, and Rooney's today, is night and day. And its that level that the kid has shown that we should be expecting, not just lowering our standards because its Wayne Rooney. He's not good enough anymore. Simple as that.

5008~~~
If he can consistently deliver 6/10 performances like that, with a goal here and there, I'd take that, given he has to play. 

It doesn't feel right saying he had a good game, or he played welltoday, because I still remember what Wayne Rooney playwell actually looks like, and it is levels above what he showed today.

That said, in the context of him not being that good anymore, today was a good performance, at least in the second half, and came on the back of a good (again, relatively ) se on half against Arsenal, so I am starting to feel more optimistic that he can consistently reach a level where he is useful to the team.

I never expected, or believed he was capable of getting these 20+ league goals he promised this season, but I'd take 12 and an average performance level of his second half.

5009~~~
1 goal away from Dennis law now, 14 needed for the record.

5010~~~
The way Jagielka caught up with him when he was through.. If that had been Martial it would've been a certain goal.

5011~~~
He runs like he's in treacle these days. He was nearly caught for the goal too.

He has touch of the Falcao's about him.

5012~~~
Jagielka IS officially the fastest player in the Premier League. Just in front of Richie de Laet, that speed machine.

5013~~~
Very poor again, the goal doesn't paper over any cracks IMO, we are literally carrying him week in week out. 

Every single time the ball is played into him you feel he is going to give it away. Every pass he receives, on the floor, back to goal, on the angle he gives it away nearly every time. They are absolute basic basic mistakes.

When Martial put him in (great ball too) the lack of pace & poor execution when finishing looked like a player who was literally in his late 30's & ready to hang them up. 

I hope somehow he can find a bit of form, we potentially have the foundation of a quality team and we cannot carry misfiring players especially ones on £300K a week!

5014~~~
100% spot on. Every single word of it.

5015~~~
Judging by how much you defend him today one would think he had a perfect game. But anyway, I'll judge it when I see the whole game, but from what I have read here, I won't be too excited about his performance.

I am always happy when Manchester United player does well. Even if I don't like him, he obviously has to play even when he is worst player on the pitch, so for the team I hope that he improves otherwise we are fecked.

5016~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/ic5r" width="560"></iframe>
I mean his control was excellent for Herrera's goal for a start, but that would be giving him credit for something.

He was a 6/10 today, not awful but not great.

5017~~~
Rooney was fine today - no better, no worse.  He played an important part in the lead up to Schneiderlin's goal and scored one of his own. It's undeniable that he contributed to the result. I do think that he's a respected leader in the team as well (I doubt any within the squad take issue with Rooney's captaincy). 

That said, it's becoming patently obvious that his best days are behind him. He just doesn't have the pace, power or explosiveness that defined his play in his prime. That's not surprising, given his advancing age and the number of miles on his legs - from a young age, he's played a lot of football for club and country. He never did have a world class first touch or short passing ability, but both of those appear to have declined as well. He no longer has the ability to overcome technical shortcomings (which I don't mean to sound overly harsh, as he was hardly poor technically in his prime) with physical attributes. In my opinion, all of this has also clearly dented his confidence. It seems as though he doesn't trust that he can bury the chances that come his way. Top strikers make even half chances look easy somehow. He's lost some swagger. While he's still respected by opponents, he's not feared. 

Rooney needs to be replaced. A top striker is required, even with Martial in the team. Rooney can still play a valuable role as a respected elder statesman, but he shouldn't be our main striker next season. This is, in part, why I think RVP was sold. He and Rooney are at very similar points in their careers. Given that Rooney is English and (arguably) a club legend, he was the correct player to keep. He has more to offer in terms of teaching young players about the Manchester United way.

5018~~~
I thought he was good. I have been calling for him to go up front with Martial wide for a few weeks now, so it was pleasing to see. Of course he wasn't the Rooney that we want but people are looking for anything to criticise him on. Was over the moon to see him score.

5019~~~
Under no pressure.  He lost possession  more than the whole time team combined.  

But yeah,  rooney can do no wrong for u

5020~~~
I don't think people are looking to criticize him, it's that his level has become so low that some are praising him for the basics most forwards at PL level should be able to do. The fact is he's done as an elite forward and holding this team's potential back with his automatic starting role no matter how he plays.

5021~~~
I thought it was a mixed-bag. That's probably promising though considering he has been just plain awful in other matches.

5022~~~
I think that goal was a huge confidence boost for him. Was poor for quite some parts of the game but made some intelligent runs and was quite a threat. He needs goals and I think that confidence and passing will be back.

5023~~~
He didn't look like himself in the post match interview. Looks like he's devoid of confidence.

5024~~~
If he loses the ball through tackle, that is a different story. Rooney loses the ball by been unable to complete a pass. That is criminal at this level. Anyway, if he plays as #9 against city, we will be punished. He will pass to Toure and Toure will run at our goal.

5025~~~
At the moment, I have no doubt people want to see him perform badly to strengthen their argument. I don't mean they actually want him to play bad and just totally screw things up for him and the team but people jump on every touch of his and point to it as a fact that he is past it, over paid, no good etc.

As you say, the future is without Rooney, so a good performance by Rooney would rightfully see him selected the next game (not the captain privilege debate) on merit. But because people want to see the future, Herrera, Martial, Pereira etc, I think many want to see Rooney not perform at his best.

5026~~~
Realised his pace had been shot recently...

5027~~~
What a terrible picture..they could have used another one surely.

5028~~~
He's been awful all season and the performance yesterday wasn't anything special so it's not a huge surprise that many are still tired of his untouchable place in the team. Looking at it he still looks lacking any mobility and running and still gave the ball away cheaply numerous times against Everton, the goal doesn't gloss over that and I do think most simply see that we need to move on without him or we will just tread water.

5029~~~
I genuinely think he himself is baffled with how bad he has been. And I think he's worried if he's in decline like any normal person would.

5030~~~
No his performances sealed the argument weeks ago, the fact is that he has regressed and consequently his selection should reflect that - he has to earn his starting bearth just like any other player because he is no longer good enough to mask the technical deficiencies that ruin our build up play nor are his team mates good enough to carry him. Treating him like a prime Rooney is only hurting the team.

 Fwiw I believe a bit of complacency had crept in but yesterday he was genuinely trying and he got just reward with a goal and some good bits of play. Hopefully he gains more confidence from that performance, which overally was good, and raise his standard from the junk he'd served up till yesterday.

5031~~~
Hopefully he'll hang up his boots at the end of the season, before he ruins his legacy any further. I think that the boxing analogy is quite appropriate - you always see these great boxers who keep fighting again and again even though they are shot. Wayne is fast becoming another Steven Gerrard where he is holding the team back because it's so difficult for the manager not to play him.

5032~~~
and again today on Sunday supplement one of the guys is completely baffled by the supposed question marks over Wayne Rooney, and its simply down to him not scoring goals as he selflessly contributes so much to the team

5033~~~
He's still scored more than Costa and Kane combined, and only 2 less than Aguero (who got 5 of his in one game).

His all around play has looked insipid at times, but his scoring rate isn't actually that bad.

5034~~~
It's baffling how anyone could come to that conclusion.

How can anyone be shocked at the criticism Rooney has received this season? He's been woeful

5035~~~
it underlines how clueless and ignorant some of them actually are at their job, for people supposedly having their finger on the pulse

5036~~~
This is the sort of thing that won't help Rooney. Arse-licking is dangerous. Glad he scored yesterday and showed some effort - but overall the same old problems are still there and imho they won't be going away. Hope that doesn't cost the team...

All I know is Rooney is a very lucky boy - has the manager seemingly in his pocket, and magnificent team mates who outwardly at least, seem to support him even if it means (1) one of them needs to be sacrificed so he always gets to play (2) putting up with him messing up their attacks (3) getting special treatment whilst everyone else's arse is subbed/benched if they make mistakes.

5037~~~
He wasn't brilliant, but wasn't so bad as some are trying to portrate him. He played well in patches, was good for about 20min, then went to being bad, then started to play good again after half-time.

Still he managed to participate in build-up to first goal, set up chance on which Martial didn't capitalise and scored one goal himself, not bad input IMO.

5038~~~
Made a couple of nice runs and was decent in patches but absolutely abysmal during that patch in the latter stages of the first half, repeatedly giving away the ball and breaking down our moves. Hopefully, the goal gives him something to build on from here.

5039~~~
It's a scouse thing, as a breed they are incapable of not living in the past

5040~~~
Wayne Rooney hit back at critics who have questioned his scoring record after grabbing his first away league goal in 11 months to help Manchester United to a 3-0 win at Everton. Rooney, England's record goalscorer but struggling in the Premier League this season, scored United's third goal on his return to Goodison Park. And when asked whether he considered his drought to be over, Rooney snapped: 'It depends what the press thinks, they call it what they like. What matters is what my manager and team-mates think.'

Rooney's last away league goal was way back on November 22, in a 2-1 win at Arsenal, and his performances this season have been questioned. 'Criticism does nothing at all,' he said. 'I'm a strong man, I've had it throughout my career. I just have to keep working hard and try to help the team be successful.'

Rooney's goal, his first at former club Everton since 2007, took his Premier League tally to 187, level with Andy Cole and behind only Alan Shearer in the all-time list.

United manager Louis van Gaal said: 'You always doubt him. You always say that he can't score. I am very happy for him. For me it's not important if he scores. He has to be an attacking point and do his job in our defensive organisation also. But when he scores I'm happy and maybe this is a start of many goals for him. He needed this goal today.'

(<i>Daily Mail</i>)

5041~~~
it was important for RVP, Wellbeck, Falcao and Hernandez to score though. Even if not scoring fair enough if he helps the team tick over, but a lot of the time his general game looks detrimental to the team progressing

5042~~~
He had a good game yesterday, it was nice to play with 11 men for a change.

5043~~~
I would actually give him less stick if he came out and acknowledged his poor form. Both this interview (see Steve J's post)  and the one after the Sunderland match he brushes it off as outside noise. If he said he needed to improve I would be more hopeful, more understanding. For now I actually think he is content with his form, showing exactly the mentality being undroppable is bound to give you.

5044~~~
He admitted to being blow par after the Villa game, and it didn't stop people slaughtering him.

 If anything, it'll just give his critics ammunition.

Interviewer: So Wayne, many people think you're shit at your job and need to be sacked off. How do you feel about that?

Rooney: They're right, of course.

If he gets defensive at the amount of stick he's taking, then I don't blame him. Most people would I reckon.

5045~~~
Yes. Really.

5046~~~
To be fair to Wayne, that is probably his best ever performance at Goodison since that famous win in 06/07. Credit where its due.

5047~~~
Best game in the league since Spurs. Even though he wasn't great, I'll be happy if he delivered these sort of performances 7/10 times instead of 1/10.

5048~~~
He set up Herrera for a descent chance and Martial for a chance that should have been a goal, he also made some good runs in behind their defense one which resulted in his goal and people are still saying he was piss poor? Some people on here are just ridiculous in their agenda driven assessments of certain players.

5049~~~
My only agenda is making the blind sees

5050~~~
You're not a member of the Rooney hate brigade then  and all the sheep that follow the same old posters that whatever he does is wrong, he even got criticised for scoring the goal by some moron on here. Did well today, better than in previous weeks.

5051~~~
Id rather be a seeing sheep than a blind Shepherd

5052~~~
"Shit - Rooney didn't play as badly as he's done over the past few months today. feck it, instead of praising him or actually getting behind the player and hoping that he can build on this, let's just shit on him some more and continue dragging him through the mud. feck hoping he continues to improve!".

5053~~~
Rooney was better than usual, it's still not good enough but he doesn't deserve particular criticism. Mata was poor though.

5054~~~
He also played an important role in Herrera's goal. Held it up well in the build up and split the defender to give Herrera so much space for the free header. His movement is always brilliant imo, even if it's creating space for a team mate rather than himself.

5055~~~
Think blind sheep would be more appropriate. According to whoscored.com Pass success rates PL this season - Rooney 83.1% Martial 72%
I think Martial is an amazing exciting prospect by the way

Rooney keeps giving the ball away don't you know and contributes nothing to the team, baa baa baaa baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

5056~~~
I don't hate Rooney at all, but that stat means absolutely nothing, the main problem with Rooney is that almost all his passes are useless, he doesn't try to create something dangerous, he multiplies the insipid passes and misses some of them.
Martial on the other hand is guilty of trying to accelerate with every touch, he tries things that he doesn't master yet.

5057~~~
Had a good first 20 minutes, shite for the rest of the first half. Bit better in the second but still poor aside from the goal.

Low standards if you didn't see it like that. I was very happy to see he had proved me wrong in the first 20 minutes but alas, it was not to be.

O and can the Rooney lovers stop making out like we 'hate' the man himself or something. We're just calling it as it is - in regards to his on-field performances.

5058~~~
I'm not sure if people 'hate' Rooney - that's quite a strong word - but there are a handful of them on here who clearly have taken a personal dislike to him, and relish the criticism.

5059~~~
He didn't seem as lethargic as usual yesterday. Maybe he's slowly starting to regain some form.

5060~~~
It's a bit pointless and kinda stupid, but take away the goal, and it's still the same Rooney we've been seeing recently. Poor touch, poor passing, laboured, lethargic. He's still got a long way to go before he justifies the permanence he's afforded.

5061~~~
The main criticism on here is that he keeps giving the ball away, that is incorrect - I do not favour any player in particular , I support the team and don't like having to defend players against unwarranted criticism from our own "supporters" - but people with obvious agendas really annoy me and yes you can criticise a player when he doesn't play well, and Rooney has had some poor performances this season but yesterday was not one of them

5062~~~
Herrera has averaged 1.4 key pass per game this season, and Rooney has averaged 1.3 key passes per game. Martial is on 0.8, and Depay is on 0.5.

So Rooney's passing is more likely to fashion a goal scoring opportunity than Martial's or Depay's is, and has about the same likelihood as Herrera's.

Only one of those players gets consistently hammered for his passing being apparently shite, though.

5063~~~
Same with the 'Our attacks always break down on him!' type stuff.

Rooney loses the ball via a bad touch an average of 1.5 times per games. For Depay it's 2.1, and for Martial it's 1.6.

Only one of them gets hammered for it.

5064~~~
Oh I agree, I have criticized him after some of his games, but when the next game comes I'm behind him and when he does well I'm happy.

5065~~~
It's only due to the position he played, you can't have bad touches and bad passes while creating nothing  when you play between the striker and the midfield. Rooney's passing is fine for a striker, it's not great but it's acceptable.

5066~~~
However, I would agree that he's looked ineffective in quite a few games this season. No quibble at all there. And if we had someone unarguably better - an Aguero or a Suarez or a Lewandowski - he'd probably be dropped, and rightly so.

It's just that I know, from previous seasons, that half the people having a go at him over his form would still be having a go even if he was playing quite well.

Because from some of them, it simply *is* agenda driven.

5067~~~
Rooney's passing compared to the league's other big name strikers:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s2.postimg.org/z489zgra1/passing.jpg" src="http://s2.postimg.org/z489zgra1/passing.jpg"/>

5068~~~
He's been playing poor for a long while. If it wasn't Rooney he would have been out of the team a long time ago. 

Regardless if people have agenda against him or not. For someone who is the face of our team he is playing well below expectations.

5069~~~
Captain and top scorer for a side that could go top of the league on Sunday. Might he actually be doing *something* right?

5070~~~
Rooney wasn't playing as a lone striker, unlike the players you mentioned and once again is passing isn't exceptional but for a striker he is fine. And lone strikers have pretty bad passing stats.

5071~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So being captain automatically means he's a big contributor? What nonsense are you typing? He has 2 goals in 9 league games. It's hardly anything to brag out about.

5072~~~
Nicely taken goal and he wasn't as bad as in previous games but not getting carried away.

5073~~~
It's just all i'm hearing is how much he hinders us. But apparently not enough to prevent a manager as experienced (and as ruthless) as Van Gaal from not just playing him, but playing him as captain. And apparently not enough to prevent us being in title contention.

Again, perhaps he *is* doing something right, and perhaps his manager and team mates - y'know, the actual experts -  recognise that more than his detractors do. Which is why they keep praising him.

5074~~~
Those stats are bullcrap. 

He pass to the opponent 12 fecking times last night under no pressure at all. 

Key pass my arse. 

Go on show me the heat map,  make a youtube compilation of all his pass this season and it'll look like footballs bloopers collection

Translation:

'They undermine my argument, so i'm simply going to refuse to accept them and swear a bit'.

Maybe it's just that you notice / remember Rooney's bad passes more than other players', because you're sat waiting for him to make mistakes so you can jump on them.

I'd say that's much more likely than the companies who compile these stats having got them badly wrong.

5077~~~
Can we lock this thread? I'm up for it.

5078~~~
He's got an average rating of 5.3. By biased United fans!!

5079~~~
As I said, he's not been great. But then he does have a fairly vociferous anti-fan club on here, who probably race over to the thread to down vote him after every game (while those who just see run-of-the-mill 6 or 7 type performances don't bother voting - I know I don't).

5080~~~
This.

5081~~~
that cant be true surely? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> But he played well, and not as shit as Memphis!

5082~~~
'Roon-eh! Roon-eh! Roon-eh! You're sh*t, f*ck off!'

5083~~~
Not a chance ? Surely this place hasn't gotten THAT bad.

5084~~~
Just goes to show this criticism goes beyond player performances, it's actually personal in some way. Don't get it, i will back any player who wears the red shirt esp a player that his given a lot to the club and pretty much his career , we have no control over team selection it's upto the manager so we should be behind him.

5085~~~
No he actually does make a lot of bad passes. He does make some good ones too though at time. Good he got the goal, should have actually had 2 but hopefully that gives him some confidence and he kicks on

5086~~~
Why would you want to lock the thread?  We have a right to discuss his performances especially given he appears to be undroppable, our captain and on massive wages. This is not North Korea.

5087~~~
I just fecking hate his performance. People have bad days, i dont slag darmian for his mistakes because he made it one game in 10, while rooney has been playing shit for 18mths and people calling it agenda to state the bloody obvious. 

At the moment he's a turd,  when he scores a goal you might find some burger patty inside the turd,  a tiny bit of it, but some people lap it as if he's all wagyu patty.  He's still 90 percent turd with 10 percent patty inside.  I still call it as it is, a turd

5088~~~
There's no denying that Rooney has been dreadful this season, but he did score a nice goal yesterday.  His form is still far from acceptable for a player of his reputation and wages, but I'll take improvement for now and hope better will come.

5089~~~
My stream was in and out, and I missed the first 20 minutes, but I thought he looked quite good. Much more direct and decisive. His goal was very well taken and he didn't do much wrong on the second breakaway - just good defending and keeping.

5090~~~
People forget how much we are paying this guy otherwise they wouldn't be talking up this performance as if it was the reincarnation of George Best. Is this really how far we have fallen? For a guy that gets paid 250k rising to 300k his performances in  2015 have been<b> UNACCEPTABLE </b>because when you demand such a wage and undroppable status your performances should speak for themselves not relying on fanboys posting bogus statistics in an attempt to defend the indefensible. What did his stats do for us when we were being humiliated by Arsenal? With him there is no middle ground because we pay him way too much and the moment he slackens then the RVP/Falcao treatment ought to be applied, period! Berahino or Mane could come and easily better his output and performances, of the last two years, at a quarter of what he earns - that's simply not good enough because such a wage should be reserved for a player that can single handedly transform us into PL and CL contenders.

5091~~~
Loads of people don't want him to beat the goal record meaning they don't want him to score. That is far from calling it as it is, its quite clear a chunk of people on here just don't like him.

5092~~~
Nobody has talked up his performance that much at all.

5093~~~
He looked sharp yesterday, missing both the England games seems to have done him a favour. Perhaps what van Gaal said in his press conference made him realise that he isn't a guaranteed starter.

5094~~~
Great example of how to use stats in a completely useless way

<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

5098~~~
Nonsense, to be fair. I've <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/posts/18281282/">said</a> only today that 'he's not been great', <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/posts/18280444/">that</a> 'His all around play has looked insipid at times', <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/posts/18280900/">that</a> 'he's looked ineffective in quite a few games this season', and that 'if we had someone unarguably better . . . he'd probably be dropped, and rightly so'.

Hardly talking up.

On the other hand, i've also pointed out that his goal scoring record hasn't been that bad; that his passing stats actually compare quite well to the other big name strikers in the league; and that given we're challenging at the top of the league, his performances perhaps haven't been quite as bad as some like to make out, and he may at least be doing *some* things right.

I would call that a fair assessment, in stark contrast to a lot of his critics, who go way overboard in attacking him.

5099~~~
thats about how I see it too.

5100~~~
It is! 

He has scored just 2 goals in 720 games playing as a CF in Premierleague this season. One of them was against shittest team in the league which wasn't even a shot but it bounched of him. But even if it were the nicest goals you'll see that's just 2 goals in 720 minutes which is really poor for Manchester United striker. 

He also didn't score in 90 minutes in CL he played.

5101~~~
Martial hasn't scored in 6 starts now for club and country .... that's 0 goals in 540 minutes ...  is he shit too?

5102~~~
That post was directly responding to a post on his goalscoring record

5103~~~
I think you'll need to compare their performances first and check that he played wide in half of those games. Also, his all around play was on another planet in comparision to Rooney. He actually asisted few goals too, some of them were incredible assists.

I have no idea how can someone defend Rooney by mentioning Martial, Martial is much much better player than him this season it's not even close.

5104~~~
If I was Rooney fan I would actually be ashamed of even mentioning Martial here.

5105~~~
he did better in the 2nd half. still looks a bit meh.

5106~~~
There are a lot of positives at United right now but his death grip on the side and the looming possibility of Giggs as the next manager are like two dark clouds hanging over the club.

5107~~~
Spin it like that if you want. But on the other hand, he has 6 in his last 8 appearances, and 6 in 12 overall.

So I stick by saying such numbers aren't 'that bad' - Harry Kane wouldn't mind them, i'll bet.

And I wouldn't put it past him to keep on chipping in to the extent that, by the end of the season, he'll have a more than respectable tally.

5108~~~
Yeah, keep on masking his performances however you want as long as it pleases you. You can ask him to be his PR. If you can keep spinning things like that in his favour, I am sure you'll make him feel very special.

5109~~~
He has 6 goals in 12 games, and 6 in his last 8. There's no spin involved at all. Those are simply the raw numbers. And they aren't 'that bad'.

Not great, but not 'bad' either - indeed, before Messi and Ronaldo crazied everything up, a 1 in 2 scoring ratio was regarded as the benchmark for good strikers.

I'm sorry if you don't like it, but perhaps Rooney wouldn't need PR men like me if certain United fans weren't so insistent on behaving like City and Liverpool supporters towards him.

5110~~~
4 of those 6 were against championship level sides, Jamie Vardy is the top scorer in the PL yet would anyone think he is good enough for United? Trying to use purely goals without context and ignoring shitty overall play that hurts the team, as the basis for an argument is pointless.

5111~~~
He has 2 goals in 720 minutes in the Premierleague. 0 i 90 minutes in CL.

Was great discussing with you, cheers.

5112~~~
I haven't seen anyone say that. I've seen plenty (including myself) question if he'll get enough goals this season to break the record.

5113~~~
But then i've openly criticised his all around performances - or at least some of them. I was just saying that his scoring ratio isn't 'that bad', because it isn't.

Some people absolutely will not tolerate even vaguely positive things being said about him at the moment, though, and so are taking issue with what are basic facts.

5114~~~
He looks physically finished. And I mean completely shot. Seems like his body has to carry his legs instead of other way round.

5115~~~
Yeah, okay. That's correct if you choose to discount all the other games in which he's played and scored - which doesn't smack of an agenda at all. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

12 games, 6 goals, at a 1 in 2 ratio. Could also say he has 6 in his last 8, and has scored in 3 of his last 5 games, including 2 of his last 3 in the league. So if anything, his goal scoring form shows signs of picking up after a poor first four games.

Not great, but not terrible either - unless you're determined to trash him.

5116~~~
Steady on you make him sound like a hybrid of Ronaldo and Xavi.

5117~~~
How about the facts of 1 goal in 11 months away from home or 2 goals in 8 PL starts? those are the facts of his ratio against top opposition, not second tier cannon fodder used to pad out stats for an argument. You are talking about agenda but the only one showing an agenda is you.

5118~~~
What part of 'if we had someone unarguably better . . . he'd probably be dropped, and rightly so', which I said only a couple of hours ago, are you struggling to understand?

I'm fully aware that we haven't seen him produce his best form consistently for a while now - even with the potentially mitigating circumstances -  and that there are better strikers out there.

On the other hand, i'm simply not having it that he retains *no* redeeming features as a player at all, and is 100% not good enough for us any more, because I don't think that's been proven yet.

He still has something to offer in terms of experience, game smarts, graft and - yes - even skills and goals.

You can talk about cannon fodder all you like, but Kane and Costa have faced some poor-to-average sides this season as well, and haven't scored as many as Rooney. I don't hear anyone writing them off for good.

Anyway, Mr Expert, perhaps you're wasting your time talking to me. It's Van Gaal you need to be convincing that Rooney is utterly shot, because he continues to play him and speak highly of him.

I think in first half he was bad in possesion, losing the ball and i agree made a few passes straigth to the opposition but he played with energy and was constantly on the shoulders of the defenders something i was missing from Rooney. Don't forget he broke the offside trap 3 times yesterday.
I think LVG talked to him about that prior the match and he worked on it. In the second half after the goal he was better in the possesion also.

One think i can't really decide is if he is slow or fast. I saw 2-3 sprints this season from him when i thought "wow he is still fast as hell" and he regulary is one of the fastest players but then there was a sprint against Jagielka who i think is not the fastest and he failed to beat him to cut infront of him and throw him out of the game. Did he little miss-control the ball during the sprint, is Jagielka fast or what the hell happened?

5121~~~
Better and better every game.

5122~~~
I understand it perfectly, I was simply calling out the fact you are padding out the stats as some basis for a defense for a player who has been shit all season, constantly pointing to other players struggling does not make him better either. I also would suggest checking the Kane thread, the "one season wonder" stuff is back in play. As for Costa, I'd say Chelsea are a splintered unit in general but his hold up play is still good, which again pertains to the fact that using goals alone is not a good basis for an argument, which is what most are saying.

As far as him still having something to offer, I don't see what, certainly not as a starter. His first touch is awful and his passing is either backwards or sloppy, more of our attacks die at his feet than with any other player. 

The last line suggests you are getting tetchy which is always weird on a message board, if LvG isn't just playing the standard PR game and actually still thinks he's a top player then I dread to think where Manchester United will be once he's done. Thankfully looking at how he dealt with RvP gives me hope that he sees it but right now he can't do anything about it, so he's keeping the water calm until the summer when he can offload the biggest piece of dead weight we have left.

5123~~~
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree - although again, I don't think it'd be a major surprise if the club are looking for long term replacements. But i'm sure you'd love to be proven wrong and to see Rooney captain us to further successes, right?

Starting against City on Sunday.

5124~~~
Again with the attempt at being snide, I always want us to win so yes, I am hoping we win on Sunday. As far as the other part goes, I don't care about individual players, I care about United, so if Rooney suddenly starts performing like the Rooney of 5 years ago then yes, I'll be very happy.

5125~~~
Van Gaal on Rooney after the Everton game:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-uniteds-fantastic-wayne-rooney-6656229" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-uniteds-fantastic-wayne-rooney-6656229</a>

5126~~~
His hold up play for the second goal was phenomenal.

5127~~~
There was a whole thread on it, another where 138 people also said he isn't a United legend. The potential all-time leading scorer not a club legend? Yeah, not personal at all.

5128~~~
His scoring ratio is terrible. 2 goals in 9 league games, one of which was actually being hit with the ball, for one of the focal points of Man Utd front line and a player who is supposed to lead us is terrible return.

He was better yesterday but there is still a long way to go. A performance like that from any other player wouldn't have been praised so much and if Depay played like that he would probably still get slaughtered, but because Rooney has got us used to very low level, we are now happy to accept that as a 'great performance'. It's good that he has finally found the net himself and that will hopefully give him some confidence, and some of his moves were encouraging but this is not a player that will lead us to success at the minute in this form and hopefully he carries on improving.

5129~~~
And this pulling out stats at every opportunity to somehow prove that he is better than everyone else because he has a 1.53739% higher completion rate and 0.74939 more forward passes at a 1 degree angle a game is getting tiresome. You won't convince anyone that he's somehow been as good as any other striker in the league and having a better record than Kane and Costa, both of whom have contributed next to nothing this season, is the least we should expect. Truthfully, given his role in the team and his wages we ought to expect him to be on Silva/Aguero level. 

If he plays like yesterday for the rest of season I won't exactly cry myself to sleep that he is automatic starter because it should be sufficient. He should not drop anymore below that level though.

5130~~~
Failing to control the ball and giving away possession due to a poor first touch won't show up in the passing stats, whereas winning a header from a goal kick and failing to reach a teammate with it would. If those two things would've been factored in, I'm going to guess that Martial's passing stats would have a bit more context and Rooney's losses of possession would show up more. 

And that's why you can't just cherry-pick one statistic and say "Ha, I told you so!"

5131~~~
I think the best we're going to get with Rooney from now on is performances like we saw yesterday. 6/10 displays, hopefully with a decent number of goals.

I'd still like to see us go and buy a top class striker in the Summer but after the start to the season Rooney made, I'll take 6/10 performances every week.

5132~~~
Wilson I feel is really going to step up next season.

5133~~~
Sufficient for what?

5134~~~
Tbh I've been critizing his performances since the start of the season (hard not to), but the game against Everton he played slightly above average.  Nothing exceptional but he was decent.

Which like someone said, is about the top level we'll see from him now.  

He does seem devoid of something nowadays though...

5135~~~
Yup. Considering Rooney was dispossessed and had the most unsuccessful touches in the team with his 6 combined ones. Of course the more you try to dribble the more likely you are to lose the ball which is Rooney's issue. Martial had 7 successful dribbles last game and Rooney has made 7.2 successful dribbles this season all together in 8 games.

I don't think his passing has been bad or that he's lost the ball more than anybody else, it is just what it seems like as he has a tendency to misplace a pass for no reason what so ever in what seems like every game he plays and it bothers people.

Personally I don't really get him these days. I can't pin-point why he is playing? To score goals? No? Beautiful link up play? Not that either? Physical hold up play? Not even that? He's not even good defensively these days and Herrera completely outpressed him from the striker position and there were vasts quality difference in the way Herrera harried his opponents compared a jogging Rooney. 

He makes the least damage when he's played upfront though.

5136~~~
Yesterday was at least a 7/10... More fair would probably be 7.5/10. Incredibly harsh to say 6/10. His all around game was good bar a 15 minute spell in the first half, he made runs in behind even if he looked a bit leggy, scored a goal, created a few chances and generally did well as the lone striker. That's the type of performance we should be expecting from a player with his reputation, and it's what he should be capable of consistently putting in, instead of being a stand out one. Hopefully he can keep up that level.

5137~~~
See, this is the problem. He is the captain, focal point of our attack and by a distance the highest earner at the club. Even against Everton he was well below the level we should be expecting from him but because he was so terrible previously, people think that this was somehow a performance worthy of a player of his status. It still wasn't.

5138~~~
I'm really glad Rooney always looked to try and run in behind their back 4 against Everton. Last week when receiving those kind of through balls, he would go out wide and look for a pass instead of trying to score himself.

The Rooney that turned up against Everton isn't his best form but still a very good player if he can show that week in week out.

5139~~~
Spot on, mate! 

This forum seems to be full of people who are keen to criticize Rooney, no matter what!

5140~~~
If I had to explain his performance against Everton (which was better, not good enough though), I’d say the midfield trio and Martial on the left (who was a vast improvement on Memphis) created much more space for him and he had a little more time on the ball. It might be a false theory though.

Interesting thing, I think van Gaal rarely speaks about his performance in footballing sense, he would rather praise Rooney for his contribution in different aspects of the game, like his role of the captain and so. I don’t think he’s happy with him at all.

5141~~~
I disagree. In the end it's a stat but you have to see the big picture. Martial was very dangerous and created a lot of chances, took risks. He went past players, was creative and also helped out a lot on the left side which means he had to clear the ball plenty of times, especially when Everton were pressing a bit.

Rooney on the other hand was a bit better than in recent games but you just expect much more from him as well. He's supposed to be our star player, but look at his performances over the last 2 year. Compared to the star players (and highest earners) at other top clubs, it's just not at the level it should be. He's living on past reputation and people are right to crizisize him! He's still not playing at the level his status and wages would say and LVG would be only right if he buys another striker to add extra pressure next summer.

5142~~~
Absolutely, he got his first away goal in the league in eleven months on Saturday, he's bang back in form now isn't he?

5143~~~
Unfortunately this is spot on. It seems most of us are resigned to him being a fixture in the team and are desperately looking for whatever little he can offer us at the moment.

Although tbf to Rooney, he did make a couple of threatening runs off the ball in the last game (the one where he laid it for Martial, the one where he scored and another which I can't really remember) and if the team can function more cohesively like it did against Everton, then perhaps he might at least be a decent goalscorer without messing up/contributing minimally to our build-up phase. It was rather disheartening to see him being shot of pace too, he had lost his explosiveness some time back but still retained semblances of his speed over long distances last season, but I'm really hoping that's due to him just returning from that ankle injury (although we haven't exactly seen it in earlier games this season). 

Still think there are some decent finishes in him, although fluffing chances against Swansea and Newcastle was it? makes me question that, and if we can provide him with a fair amount of service, then we can expect a reasonable amount of goals and the least amount of damage from him.

5144~~~
Eleven months. Eleven fecking months. There's no defending that from a player on his wages.

5145~~~
Judging by this photo and text, Wayne will be central to United for some time to come:

5146~~~
His legs are gone. For his first goal he barely kept ahead of the defenders and then had another chance where jagielka caught up to him. Isn't Jags older...that lack of raw pace is his undoing it losses him precious few seconds to make decisions. We need someone with more pace who makes defenders back off a bit afraid of being turned. Which in turn creates space to make incisive passes, defenders don't fear that with him and can press right up to him. That ability of defenders to harrass him is probably a large factor in his performance issues.

5147~~~
Well I would say he is probably a better player now then Best was when he was 30 years old.

5148~~~
Tbh, a better keeper than Howard, and he wouldn't have scored. Howard was already on the floor diving the wrong way before Rooney had raised his tree trunk of a leg to shoot.

5149~~~
Average number of times per game Rooney loses the ball through an unsure touch: 1.5

Average number of times per game Martial loses the ball through an unsure touch: 1.6

(Depay 2.1, Herrera 1.4, King Carrick 0.3)

5150~~~
But of course there's no personal animosity involved in any of this, you understand. Oh no.

5151~~~
Oh come on - you have to agree that Rooney is a bit thicker boned/bigger than your average footballer.

5152~~~
Thought that was exactly what the caf was expert at - bringing out useless stats to suit their argument
I have only one thing to say:
<span style="color: #ffffff">Baaah!!</span>

5153~~~
That's nonsense, of course.

He's been poor enough in recent weeks to merit a lot of justified criticism. Really don't see the need to throw in completely made up criticism too. Weird the way people seem to take such relish in belittling a Manchester United player.

5154~~~
Sad.

It wasn't a great shot. He basically shot above Howard who I mentioned had already dived/gone to ground. Look at the goal here: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.footytube.com/video/everton-manchester-united-oct17-378185" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.footytube.com/video/everton-manchester-united-oct17-378185</a> (go to 8:02min).

It wasn't in the corner, it wasn't a chip, it was Howard diving too early.

5156~~~
Happy.

5157~~~
This sums it all up perfectly

I am a Rooney fan and a Martial fan and a Herrera fan and a Wilson fan and a Mata fan and a Rojo fan , shall I go on, find anything in common; oh yes they play for United, ever consider supporting the team and not be a fan boy just for one day with your own particular fanboy fancies

5158~~~
Tbh, the replays showed he basically shot at Howard who had gone down far too soon. Another similar situation was when Martial set him free with a wonderful pass and then Rooney could not muster even a decent shot on goal - a weak toe poke is all he could provide. He seems to have lost a lot of pace. Jagielka caught up with him quite easily and he is not the quickest.

Overall I was not that impressed by Rooney. Yes he was better than the last few games but that shows how poor he has been rather than how good he was this game. He kept mishitting passes, losing the ball regularly. If we had a firing LW, I would gladly see him get dropped to the bench with Martial taking his place.

5159~~~
It was a routine finish. The type of thing you see him do all the time. Sat the keeper down and clipped it over time. Certainly wasn't bad keeping. It was a good, composed finish.

5160~~~
Love the way people <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/13/phil-jagielka-fastest-player-everton-leighton-baines" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">don't even let reality get in the way</a> of Rooney criticism these days. Great stuff.

5161~~~
I said in the summer that Rooney will pull off the trick of lowering expectations so much to the point where any performance that isn't terrible will be praised, and seen as evidence of some sort of renaissance.

The Wayne Rooney that plays at a level where United would consider signing him is long gone. The list of better strikers in the PL isn't limited to just the likes of Aguero, it would include the likes of Ings, Berahino, Diafra Sakho and even Jamie fecking Vardy. None of those are top players, but would have served the team better, and that includes last season too for those who want to label it as 'he's been poor this season'.
That is correct. For all his criticism, which has been very justified, the one part of his game that isn't in question, and probably never will be, is his ability to do what he did against Howard. He can finish, the question is that the rest of his attributes have declined to the point where he won't get enough opportunities to showcase his finishing.

His second goal vs Croatia in Euro 2004 was similar in how he sat the keeper down and sent him, and there have been many since. There was one for England a few months ago, can't remember against who, in the game Wilshere hit a screamer and got MOTM. When he's through on goal, he takes them like spot kicks. 

I haven't hid that I don't particularly rate the player he is today, but given time and space, I trust him.

5162~~~
It's a drop in the ocean. 

I literally have never seen such a lack of objectivity as on Redcafe.

5163~~~
Smalling's average rating this season is 7.1 - there's no way Rooney was at that level.

Whether people are harsh or not on their ratings is another issue. In terms of this forums ratings he was a certain 6.

If Rooney is a 7 then the likes of Rojo becomed a 7.5 or 8, the likes of Smallng/Schneiderlin become 8.5's or 9's and Herrera becomes a 9.5 or 10, the latter of which is the kind if rating reserved for truly special performances.

We should be expecting a higher level than that. The one v one chance where he allowed Jagielka to catch up and shot poorly was the kind of difference between a 6 or 6.5 performance and a 7 or 7.5.

5164~~~
Probably all true. Seems beyond the point of recovery now as well which is a shame and quite difficult to understand... Whether it's age, the amount of football he's played or a confidence thing.

5165~~~
Last run was the great ball from Martial from a full back position all the way up to Rooney I believe? He did offer some runs in the game that was great to see even if they have to be taken with a pinch of salt as Everton were some goals down which makes it a lot easier to attack. His runs were good against Everton though once we were ahead and had space to attack. Over longer distances he still looks pretty quick even if Jagielka was quicker for that one chance from Martial. 

I think the worst moment for me was when he was free against one or two defenders and decided to shoot from the right hand side from 35-40 yards away almost like he had no confidence at all in creating something real. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5166~~~
Science.

5167~~~
Common sense.

5168~~~
Everyone fancies some players, you can't like everyone the same, that would be really stupid and boring.

5169~~~
He deserves criticism for his performances when he plays like pub player (which tbf was more often than not this season), but to criticise him when he's been involved in build-up for 2 goals, scores one himself, and sets clear chance for Martial is just ridiculous as people try so hard to find something they can moan about.

5170~~~
I was caught between these thoughts when watching. It doesn't look like a great finish, but how many times do we see players shoot across the keeper leading to a routine save, and then when watching the reply we think why not just put it down the side of the keeper. It is easy to shoot at the space but as seen by Rooney's goal, a keeper can't dive full stretch when you put it at his side.

5171~~~
I'm disappointed that he didn't screw the white ball back, with a touch of left-hand side.

5172~~~
I dont critize him for the goal and his good doing at goodison. But i dread the people that claims he's back and having a great game. He doesnt apart from the goal.  His play bar the goal and the pass is atrocious.  That's my beef with him. 

For me personally he doesnt need to score goal to win me over. Enough that he do the basic right i.e being in the right position, holding up ball,  and not miss passing the ball everytime he receives a pass.  When he start doing that then ill admit he's picking up form. 

It's the basic. Anyone can score an odd goal playing for Manchester united, but a striker of his calibre shouldn't fail to pass to a teammate 12 fecking times in a game under no pressure.

5173~~~
He was fine for the most part on Saturday but lets not stretch to crediting him with being 'involved' in the build up for two goals.

5174~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5175~~~
The one thing I don't get with the media love in with Rooney is that when he was younger, and genuinely a fantastic player, the media seemed absolutely desperate to jump on his back at every possible opportunity. Yet as he's got older, and worse, he's suddenly the golden boy who can do no wrong. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

5176~~~
for all the pages and endless threads on the Rooney debate, this needs carving in a rock for all to see

5177~~~
I am sure some are actually bigger fans of individual players than they are of Manchester United. The biggest frustration with Rooney is that he would be more tolerable if he was just a back up, but his perma starting spot drags the team down.

5178~~~
I don't think there's single poster here claiming he's back or that he had a great game, even those who give him some credit for performance still acknowladge he played good but in patches, not for an entire match.

He made few smart runs behind defence, one resulting in him scoring (being in the right position), he did hold up ball, passed it to Scheweini before Herrera scored (holding up ball), and he did set up clear chance to Martial which Martial didn't score (passing to teammate), not enough?


He did try to win header which prevented their defender of clearing the ball and 2 sec later Morgan scored, if not I doubt their defender would miss clear header and gave ball to Smalling. He also did hold up ball with defender behind him, gave it to Schweini, made a run to the box dragging Stones slightly out of postion which Herrera used and scored. Now that aren't clear assists but it's something, not like he stood still while everyone else played their part.

5179~~~
Three good bits of play alongside a shower of shit touches, terrible passes, and awful hold up play?

No, that's not enough, its not even close.

5180~~~
Watched the whole game again on MUTV last night. It seemed to be everytime a move broke down it was because of Rooney. His passing has gone to pot.

According to Garth Crooks it's Ander and the new players we have bought having to learn LvG's system that is making Wayne play so badly. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

5181~~~
All part of the narrative. He's the elder statesman now, and his captaincy of both United and England gives him a fair amount of clout.

Few journalists will care to admit it, but they are better for keeping Rooney sweet.

Jason Burt at the Telegraph went through him like a bulldozer the other week, in fairness.

5182~~~
Thats because it did. The first half particularity, he was awful.

Even when he does control the ball it takes him ages, so by the time he has it under control the momentum of the move has broken down. He's a shell of the player he once was. He makes controlling the ball seem like some sort of impossible task.

5183~~~
In our team, he's more out of place than rednev on a hen night.

5184~~~
The same Ander who was man of the match, they all drag Rooney down to their level. twats

5185~~~
He has a point. Wayne has to sacrifice himself and he's taking one for the team, definitely.

5186~~~
Poster said hes not doing basic right, but he does, although I agree its not enough but dont make it seem like hes just standing there while everyone else do miracles.

5187~~~
He's not doing the basics right though. He's constantly miss controlling the ball, or taking an age just to get it under control. Giving the ball away, or under hitting passes. These are basic things that he should be able to do in his sleep. And not just a few times a game, but 90% of the time.

5188~~~
This is completely true. He needs better team mates.

5189~~~
He's a counter attacking player through and through.

He plays on instincts and when he is confident his instincts shows that he is a very intelligent and excellent player.

When he plays at a slow pace and has time to think he never plays well. He over thinks his next move and can easily miscontrol or feck up the easiest of passes. 

Rooney is not the striker for a possession based system. He doesn't have that quick speed burst anymore but is still very fast when on the break.

I really do wish LVG would be more flexible with tactics. Our counter attacks vs Everton were excellent and Rooney showed he still very good on the break.

5190~~~
90% of the time, where did you get that information from?

5191~~~
Apart from that time renown pace merchant, post-ACL recovery, 33 year old Phil Jagielka gave him 3 yards head start and still got back at him?

He's better on the break, good is pushing it.

5192~~~
felt he was better Saturday because we were more direct...a throwback to the Fergie days.

5193~~~
A better DM than Barry wouldn't let Herrera unmarked into the box. A better defensive set up wouldn't leave Schneiderlin unmarked at the far post. You can say stuff about all the goals like this.

5194~~~
The phone-in on Talksport now is that Adrian Durham thinks Rooney is back to his best. That's asking for trouble.

5195~~~
Well you'd expect a striker playing for a top level team to be able to do the basics like controlling the ball, most times would you not? It certainly shouldn't be this complete lottery where you just haven't got a clue where the ball will end up when its played to Rooney. 

Players like Suarez, Neymar, Benzema, Aguero don't have this problem. Most times their touch will be excellence, hence why they are top players. Even our very own Martial has shown up how bad Rooney is these days. He's simply not good enough anymore for a top level team. If we aspire to be among the best in Europe again, we need top players. Rooney ain't that anymore.

5196~~~
I think I'm going to have a breakdown.

5197~~~
He didnt win any header last game,  he pass to the opposition 12 times.  Feel free to watch the game again and correct me if im wrong. 

God forbid if it was the back 4 doing that every game we'd have been relegated. 

And this is not an isolation of bad game, he has been this bad the whole season. 

Can you simply accept that he's that shit without needing to label everyone saying the obvious as rooney hate brigade. 

Even darmian has better passing than him,  nobody in the team are so inept at keeping possession more than him, the closest you get is memphis, at least he lost the ball trying to dribble. Rooney loss the ball very cheaply as if he's playing for everton.

5198~~~
No. It's asking for people to get wound up and phone Talksport to rant. You know, the way that station makes its money?

5199~~~
Where on Earth does this persistently expressed idea come from? Because it certainly doesn't come from the media itself.

Granted he has his admirers among the sports writing fraternity - and he's been a fantastic and successful player, so why shouldn't he have? - but he gets plenty of criticism as well.

Here's The Mirror's John Cross <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/england-must-bold-avoid-flopping-6619792" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">calling for him to be dropped</a> from the England team a couple of weeks ago (apparently Sturridge and Welbeck should be starting ahead of him).

Here's The Telegraph's chief football writer, Jason Burt, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/wayne-rooney/11929349/England-are-a-quicker-stronger-and-more-athletic-side-without-Wayne-Rooney.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">basically saying</a> England are better without Rooney, and he should be dropped.

Here's a recent article from ESPN's Iain Mcintosh <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2664296/wayne-rooney-on-wane-as-mufc-striker-prepares-for-everton" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talking about</a> 'Rooney's decline', and how 'there's a growing sense that England are a better team without him'.

Here's the Manchester Evening New's Stuart Mathieson <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/sport-opinion/wayne-rooney-should-lose-manchester-10204515" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">arguing</a> he should be stripped of the captaincy.

All of these articles are from the *last few weeks* alone, and the list is by no means exhaustive.

Indeed, this idea that he's some untouchable golden boy with a coterie of deluded apologists surrounding him is ironic, given that it's become just one more stick with which his many critics try to beat him with.

5200~~~
It's working.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Everyone saying it's a heads gone moment. Durham actually said he was brilliant.

5201~~~
Yup, that was the one. He did well to breach their offside trap/lose his marker but yeah, your point is a valid one in that Everton were behind and needed to get back into the game, which gave him more space to work with.

5202~~~
Honestly the goal puzzled me too. Howard hasn't committed when Rooney looks up then down again. The only argument I can see is that Rooney looked left to fool Howard, but he has his eye on the ball again before he knows that Howard fell for it. Maybe I'll give Rooney the benefit of the doubt, but I still feel it's really poor by Howard.

5203~~~
If Martial had scored it, we simply *would not* be having this conversation. It would be regarded as a tidy little finish, and that would be that.

5204~~~
Fair enough, I didn't see any of those as I very rarely see any papers thesedays. The TV media generally seem to refuse to criticise him though. Good to see he's getting the criticism he deserves from some sections of the press.

5205~~~
So this 90% is completely made up? Nice to see that kind of objectivity on the Caf. Oh and I know he's not good enough for what United needs up-front but that doesn't mean I'm going to making up informations just to fit my agenda. He had decent match against Everton with noticable contribution, don't think anyone can deny that apart from few people who won't give him any credit whatsoever.

Where did I call anyone rooney hate brigade? As I stated he's been poor this season more often than not, I'm not blind to see how poor he is at times, but also if he does something good then I'll give him credit for that, you should try that as well.

5206~~~
It's Rooney playing for us mate - not Ronnie O'Sullivan<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5207~~~
I don't listen to this. Are united fans calling in and blasting Durham for his comment?

5208~~~
Yes. Other clubs fans as well. They have gone completely over the top about Wayne, yes it was better but nowhere near the standard we need from him.

5209~~~
Agreed 100%.
If he can continue playing like he did 2 days ago, then I'll have no complaints.

For those expecting a captain's innings - this is unlikely to happen. The performance against Everton is as good as it gets.
And given that he is undroppable, we should be thankful that he isn't too bad, but merely average.

5210~~~
Quasi-psychic stuff like that is so tedious. I'm talking about a very specific event and I have no interest in your little feud. I know Pogue has played as a gk a bit so his opinion on Howard could be interesting.

5211~~~
You only support certain Manchester United players then? How strange.

5212~~~
Should have known ABUs wouldn't miss this opportunity to slate a United player<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Seriously though, they (Durham & Co) need to be more realistic. It was good that he scored for sure, which I'm obviously happy about - but the rest of Wayne's game is nothing to shout about at the moment. It's madness to 'over' praise him - otherwise he'll never accept or face up to his current limitations.

5213~~~
It's true, though. And while you may only be interested in it as an isolated event, the only reason the subject came up in the first place is because some were trying to paint it as a fluky finish that didn't warrant any praise.

5214~~~
Indeed.

5215~~~
Jagielka is an excellent athlete and very fast at sprinting back.

5216~~~
I think he shaped to put it in the far corner, then opened his body at the last moment to lift it into the near post instead. Howards's a quality keeper.  He won't dive out of the way unless there's an element deception.

5217~~~
Well yeah, anyone saying he's not a 'legend' is being silly. His goals guarantee him that status, never mind the PL titles and CL wins. Also part of the best football United have played since 2000, in the period of 2006-09.

I did however question if he's in the top 10 best players to play for Manchester United - which was met with anger despite it being a pretty fair position given how many great players we've had at the club.

5218~~~
I sense sarcasm in this post. 

For the record, Jagielka was logged as he <a class="externalLink" href="http://gu.com/p/43abe?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fastest player in the PL </a>in November last year.

5219~~~
I never quite realised how reliant he was on his pace in his younger years. I randomly came across a video of our game at Goodison in 2007 in that 4-2 win - the last time he scored there before this weekend. Poor touches, careless is still all there but he was electric back then constantly buzzing around at top speed.

His striking ability is probably still there but he's just too slow to get into position to get off a decent shot. Same happened to Gerrard, the trademark screamers stopped when his pace as he was too slow to get into position for them.

5220~~~
I may be wrong, but the other four don't pass back to the midfield or defence anywhere near as much as Rooney does, so obviously the stats would be inflated in his favour. The others are very much forward-facing as strikers, whereas Rooney has tended to pass back and sideways more often than not.

5221~~~
Is he really being criticised for the finish? He put it in the net, you don't get points for style.

5222~~~
I meant fan<i>boy</i>, obviously.

5223~~~
Fair enough.

5224~~~
You're stretching really badly. He fouled their player on the first goal and got away with it. Him running is the least he can do. Everyone is involved in all our goals if you're going to those extremes.

5225~~~
How many goals do people reckon he'll get this season?

6 so far isn't too shabby. He is our top scorer. Though 3 in one game against weaker opposition.

On course for at least 20 (the pre Ronaldo-Messi tally of a decent striker). But whether he hits that is another matter.

5226~~~
Can definitely see him maintaining a 0.4-0.5 goals per game record over the course of the season, which isn't bad at all and what he's always done. Doubt he'll go through a 10 game drought again this season, but then again he might not get a hat trick like he did against Brugges to inflate the stats a bit. You could argue he should probably be on 8-10 this season with the sitters he's missed. If he stays in decent form then he should end with over 20 goals for the season I'd say, which would be enough to give him the record.

5227~~~
He'll get 20 goals by sheer quantity of games and chances created (maybe 0.4 a game) - he should have comfortably had 2 against Everton for example. Though I have a feeling he'll continue to score the bulk of goals in games that are already won and/or against a lower standard of opposition.

The question won't be his statistical goal contribution - but his overall in game contribution, which I don't see improving.

5228~~~
Yet that faul led to the mistake from defender which resulted in Uniteds goal, should have said to ref himself that it was faul if he was proper captain. Yep, De Gea shouted to Rooney "jump" but he was so far away that only Rojo heard it, and said to Jones, who yelled it to Schweini and after all 10 players heard magic word, finally Rooney jumped and made faul that led to the goal, you're right about everyone being involved because no way he would do something like that on his own.

5229~~~
Well we had to do the work to get the corner in the first place didn't we? You're right though. Rooney's foul and running were key elements to our goals and evidence that he anyone saying he wasn't great should be flamed at the stake.

5230~~~
Sounds like a cunning plan Blackadder .

5231~~~
Shown improvement which is good for us as he obviously will never be dropped. He's definitely on the decline though I want sure at first but it's clear to see he's amere shadow of his former self even at 29.

5232~~~
Again, as said in response to other poster already, who said he was great in that match? Decent at best but with noticable contribution, is that so hard to acknowledge?

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It was cunning plan as a fox who's..., well you know the rest <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5233~~~

5234~~~
No. That's why I already acknowledged it after the game. Crediting him with being involved in two goals was stretching for reasons to defend him. His own mother would struggle to have come up with that.

5235~~~
So Rooney has been kind enough to wait for others to play well, to show him up. What is it these media people are actually defending, simply the England captain?

5236~~~
It sounds like a bit of Stockholm Syndrome from Herrera, especially with his recent quote about The Great Captain:

5237~~~
You know there could be a reason his teammates, manager, opposition players/mangers appreciate him?

5238~~~
He's a nice bloke?

5239~~~
What does this even mean? Rooney's playing poor on purpose?

5240~~~
Feck knows, it's Garth Crooks.

5241~~~
And yet he was involved at some point, just like Martial for second goal who was fauled and didnt even touch the ball yet him coming to recieve the ball made Colman moving out of position and creating Rojo space which he used to deliver perfect cross for Herrera. Martial didnt asissted directly but he played his small yet important part, at least IMO, just like Rooney. And what whould be my reasons to defend Rooney, he was our worst player for a majority of matches this season, dont think I dont see that.

5242~~~
Just like Rooney is frequently tagged as one of the fastest in the league? He doesn't catch Rooney of 5 years ago, not a chance, let alone a young Rooney

5243~~~
Like I said. Every player was involved at some point so it was a fairly redundant statement.

5244~~~
He's claiming that Rooney's poor performances are due to lack of service from Herrera and/or having to play in deeper positions because Herrera hasn't been good enough in those roles. 

It's just complete bollocks. Herrera has easily outperformed Rooney since he joined us and has been the main victim of Van Gaal picking Rooney no matter what.

5245~~~
One of the stats is indeed 'Total Forward Passes', if you cared to look at it.

5246~~~
We would. We'd say 'Howard made it easy for him' or 'Howard dived way too early' or 'Martial got a little lucky there' or my favourite, 'That's how you do it Rooney!'.

5247~~~
That wasn't my point in fairness. Passing stats for a striker is pretty much the equivalent of goals stats for a defender. It isn't really their job. The only one that should matter is goals. The others are forward facing in the sense that they attack the opposition. Rooney, is nowhere near as direct which is reflected in both his goals output and his passing stats.

5248~~~
I think it means he's playing poor on purpose, because the rest of the new signings are still adjusting to the philosophy (even Bastian) which is in turn making Rooney look poor. And while Herrera looks good sometimes picking up the odd man of the match, anyone who's played the game will tell you its really down to Wayne's selflessnessfullyness

5249~~~
Watched the game finally, and just want to comment on one situation. I can't believe some people actually praised him for that pass to Martial when he was one on one with Howard from right hand side. He was in much much better position to shoot than Martial, how can anyone see that as a good decision by him? 

It would be smart piece of play if no one was there but there was Coleman marking Martial, two players in front of Martial already(on goal) and it was slow pass so Howard was already back on goal when Martial took the shot.

He should have taken a shot, no one would blame him if he missed that.

5250~~~
You are wrong. One of the stats is forward passes per match. Costa is the only one with a higher average, but hes only played two games. Some people are so desperate to have a go they'll ignore facts.

Hes actually first or second in every stat in that list. Considering three are chances created, forward passes and key passes i'd say you're talking nonsense.

Rooney has seemed to be awful this season but he has 8 goals in his last ten matches for club and country. Not a horrendous return.

5251~~~
Putting those figures into context though you have 2 International penalties, a hatrick vs second rate opposition, a single goal against second rate opposition and a ball that bounced off his unaware corpse from a Martial pull back.

5252~~~
I agree, but hes still put the ball in the back of the net 8 times in his last 10 games.

Another way would be to say he got a European hattrick, scored two international goals and got a great poachers goal from a Martial cutback.

5253~~~
Rooney played from a deeper position, he played the #10 role, he is bound to have more forward passes, also unlike the other players mentioned he was supposed to feed our striker which he didn't do effectively.
Rooney is good as a striker, he is a very good finisher and his technique suits the position but he is a liability deeper, because his positional sense is doubtful and his technique inconsistent.

5254~~~
And if the other way of saying it reflected his performances more accurately his match rating would be far higher than 5.4 - truth be told people would be singing his praises and saying "he's back" if his hatrick were at Arsenal, his Ipswich goal were against Newcastle and his 2 International penalties were screamers against Swansea.

Truth be told no one could argue with the following statement accurately reflecting his season thus far: racking up numbers against shite opposition, stinking out the place against decent-good opposition and a decent finish vs Everton. Oh and 2 penalties in dead rubber games for England.

5255~~~
The only really good opposition we've played is Arsenal and Everton. The whole team was awful in one game, he scored and played quite well against Everton. Hes had a pretty poor start but he is slowly improving, whilst still scoring goals, at this point in time against fairly crap opposition. Still scored 8 in 10. However you want to say it, those are the figures.

5256~~~
Winning titles involves your big name players making the difference against the decent-good teams - the likes of Newcastle, Swansea and Arsenal or how Herrera turned up against Everton, or Martial vs Southampton, or Schweinsteiger vs Liverpool, or Smalling in 5-6 games so far, hell even Mata inspiring the win against Sunderland.

When Rooney inspires the team to a win he'll go some way to getting credit that doesn't resemble: he's been awful but at least he's scored 4 goals against terrible oppositiom and a couple of penalties for England. If he had 15 goals in 10 it wouldnt matter if 14 were scored against Ipswich, Brugge and San Marino; so why use those stats to try to mask the fact that he's been dreadful when it's mattered.

5257~~~
I'm not saying hes not been poor
I'm not trying to mask anything. I've said several times hes been poor. You clearly can't be reasoned with. Its a little too black and white for you i think.

5258~~~
I think he means you are trying to polish a turd with Rooneys goals this season

5259~~~
My only point is that there's no reason to say "not a horrendous return, 8 in 10" without giving it context. Of course it isn't a horrendous return, in fact in a 55 game season he'd be scoring 44 goals and winning every individual trophy going, but we all know that's never going to happen because of the context of his goals.

The 8 in 10 statement alone comes across as quite disingenuous; as if you were implying irrespective of his form he's still been prolific. Naturally that wasn't your intention so I apologise if my post came off as adversarial.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> very succinctly put!

5260~~~
Haha. He'd have been slaughtered for shooting from a difficult angle when Martial was better placed in the middle.

5261~~~
He simply does have 8 goals in his last 10 games though. You can say some were pens and some were against lesser opposition, but so what? That'll always be the case when strikers go on runs. And Rooney is currently in one.

5262~~~
I'm not disputing the fact, I'm saying that irrespective of the fact he's not been prolific and has been wholly terrible over that period. It's like using clean sheets this season to praise Mignolet... Ok so what? He's still awful.

I just don't see what bringing it up proves or illustrates? That even when he's playing like a Championship striker he can... Score like a Championship striker?

5263~~~
This thread has turned into a pitch for buying Vardy iun January.

5264~~~
Exactly. People just need to stop using statistics and open their damn eyes to actually watch what goes on during the game.

5265~~~
But pretty much everyone who has pointed out that his scoring ratio this season isn't too bad has also said that his overall play has been lacking in a lot of games.

However, if he can still score at a reasonable rate while playing badly, that bodes well for if/when he starts to pick up form - and there are signs that he is starting to.

5266~~~
Except that 3 of those 8 have come from a single game against injury riddled second string opposition, 2 from international penalties, and you can see how important context is.

5267~~~
As I said last night, scoring runs will always involve goals against soft opposition. That's the nature of a run. If he goes another 5 games without scoring, then by all means tell me I was talking nonsense.

But maybe he'll keep up his current 1 in 2 ratio, or even start to better it. I guess we'll see.

5268~~~
Yes, but his scoring 'run' has exclusively come against soft opposition, with the possible exception of Everton if you're going to count the third goal in a three - nil win as important.

5269~~~
That goal he scored was important tbf. Everton were pushing for a goal, which would have guaranteed a nervy end. That goal killed their remaining hope of getting something.

5270~~~
If he hadnt scored those goals, you would have complained as well. Nobody is saying that he's been Lewandowski like, but his return has been decent even though he isnt in the best form of his career.

5271~~~
Rooney has 8 in 10 games for club and country, did you know?

Honestly that's not even a great goalscoring stat for a player of his supposed quality.  Then take out one game and 3 goals where opposition bent over.  Siddenly you're on 5 in 9 not looking great. Oh and then 2 international penalties...I mean goals are goals but still, facts dont say the full story ._.

5272~~~
If you take away all of his career goals he's scored 0 in god knows how many hundreds of games. For a player of his quality and on the wages he is on, that's absolutely shocking and an insult to us fans.


._.

5273~~~
It's a valid point thought - if we're looking at his performances this season on stats alone, you'll say it's a good season so far based on his return i.e on numbers alone. If you actually watch the quality and type of goals and his performances, it's a totally different story. I mean, the player's worth should be a marriage of the two, and not one or the other. I'm in the camp where his performances have been shocking and the type/quality of his goals aren't far behind. A hat trick against a pub team, one off his knee that he didn't have a clue about, and 2 penalties.

.________.

5274~~~
When you choose numbers to suit then yeah maybe. 2 league goals in 8 games. 1 away league goal in the past 12 months.... Numbers can be represented in many ways tbh.

5275~~~
Yea, but conversely, you can be putting up low numbers but your performances are encouraging or you're creating or you can actually see the player is playing well etc.

5276~~~
I agree. I believe we can ALL see he isn't particulalry playing well.... enough said.

5277~~~
You forgot to sign off with this .____.

5278~~~
Again not playing well is one thing. Everyone has their purple patches.  But rooney not playing well is championship level at best.  That's worrying.  We need all the pts we can get,  and him not doing the basic hurt the team so much that his occasional goals against cannon fodder wont help.

5279~~~
Haha I had no idea what that was all about, so I backed away from the keyboard slowly....

5280~~~
I realised how bad that post sounds, throwing numbers about here and there.  But in reality, its a good point.

You say 8 in 10 is a decent turn around.

Break it down -
3 goals in 1 champions league qualifier game.
2 penalties in 2 international qualifier games.
3 goals in the other 7 games

And its not just the goal stats, its the manner in which they are scored.  None of them have made me feel like 'wow classic rooney goal, hes back'.  They feel empty man.  Basic goals.  Its not consistent basic goals, and neither inconsistent world class goals.  Just average average goals.

5281~~~
Rooney fans using goals against Brugge, Ipswich and two penalties against Switzerland and San Marino as a sign that everything is okay is the last act of a desperate argument.

Quite frankly, I'd rather he's scored 0 all season but actually been playing well, and not looking like a has been footballer who can barely control a ball.

5282~~~
its like this for me, don't really care about his goal tally now. just whether his general play holds the team back

5283~~~
Exactly. It's the same stats argument that would see David Silva dismissed as mediocre.

5284~~~
Greatest striker alive

5285~~~
nah, he's shit

5286~~~
Forward passes though....

5287~~~
This. Exactly this is what I've been trying to say <a class="username" data-user="65492, @NessunDorma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65492/">@NessunDorma</a> mate.

5288~~~
No you haven't, because never have I argued that 'everything is okay'. That is simply an outright fabrication on your's and Sam's part.

I've conceded his poor overall form a number of times, as has pretty much everyone else who's pointing out that his scoring record is still quite decent (which potentially bodes well for the rest of the season, if he can start to produce some better form to go with it).

But the likes of you and Sam don't seem to get it, probably because you don't want to get it, because 'getting it' would involve conceding that he's done some half-decent things among the not-so-decent things this season as well.

And you simply do not want to give him a shred of credit at all. The mob are out with their pitchforks, and they must have blood.

5289~~~
What half decent things has he actually done before the Everton game? Save scoring 3 against injury ravaged Brugge and 1 against Ipswich.

I remember him being pretty horrendous save for being not horrible for 45 mins against Saints. I'm more than happy to give him credit if actually does something worthy of credit. I acknowledged his part in the Everton game and would hope he builds on it. For the most part, he hasn't played like a someone contracted to be the star man of the club. No where close.

5290~~~
He almost scored against Tottenham.<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

5291~~~
And give up the moral high ground from the Evra/Suarez row? Never!

5292~~~
Grow up.

5293~~~
Can we add that half to the catalog of poor performances this season? 

Watch Fellaini now come on for Herrera while Martial remains shunted on the wing, all to accommodate Rooney.

5294~~~
Need to get Martial up top. Rooney's movement just isn't suited to this formation.

5295~~~
But he's the captain!

5296~~~
He offers absolutely nothing. Two centre backs in their thirties and he's just as slow as them. This team will never progress with the preferential treatment he is given. We stand no chance with him leading the line.

5297~~~
Him up top makes us blunt.

5298~~~
Get him off.

Who am I kidding? It won't happen but I think i've said that at HT in every game this season bar Everton

5299~~~
Martial should be playing through the middle, Rooney is ideal opposition for their ageing centre backs.

5300~~~
Only God knows why LVG is insisting on playing Rooney all the fecking time even at the expense of us getting a bloody result! What is going on?!!!!!!<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

5301~~~
Since when did he become our Messi? Why can't he actually press people himself instead of telling other players all the time to do that while he just stands there all the time? What kind of tactics is that?

Btw, I am not blaming him for that, it's obviously van Gaal's decision, but feck me if there is any logical reason for that. If we need instructor on the pitch instead of players who actually do something why don't we play van Gaal instead of him, he surely knows better to do that.

5302~~~
His acceleration is absolutely dreadful. No pace op over 10 yards.

5303~~~
Not only is he detrimental to the team he is also making Martial struggle because LvG insist on Rooney playing in 'his best position'. Rooney is now the David Moyes of footballers. Sure, he might win you a match or two once every other century but overall he's pretty shit.

5304~~~
He needs to run the channel, drop off and keep making moves away from the centre backs. He's done absolutely none of that so far.

5305~~~
At one point, Martial had 3 players around him and they left Rooney completely unmarked. Says it all <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5306~~~
He does nothing. Would rather play Martial up front and play Mata or Memphis wide.

5307~~~
Can't we play him at right back instead if he has to be on the team sheet.

5308~~~
It's actually sad to see a player of his quality putting in these performances.

5309~~~
He really is a fecking waste of space.

5310~~~
It's painfully obvious we should play Martial in the middle. LvG is a bloody moron for being this stubborn and pigheaded.

5311~~~
Should we hire a plane to fly over Old Trafford on Sunday with the message 'Rooney out plz'?

5312~~~
This Rooney centric focus is killing us here. I don't think he's been terrible tonight but his presence in the team as a striker forces Martial further away from goal and it's not working right now (61 mins). Throw in Herrera, who excelled as a 10 just a few days ago, also being moved from position and it makes no sense. Martial and Rojo have barely spoken a word to each other and that combination is suffering.

Just don't get why the need to pacify one man is insisted upon at the clear expense of the full capability of the team. It's not pragmatic.

5313~~~
I missed the first 20 minutes of the game and saw the rest of the 1st half and I honestly didn't notice him for about 10 minutes. He can't be fully blamed tbf as we're sh!te in general tonight.

5314~~~
That's how you head a ball Rooney you useless tosser.

5315~~~
He needs to be sold fat bastard

5316~~~
I wish Malcolm McLaren would stop selecting Ronnie Biggs. What a swindle.

5317~~~
Absolutely diabolical footballer.

5318~~~
fecking horrendous and I don't give a flying feck what he did in the Everton game. He is fecking finished and he isn't good enough to start at this club, or any other top 4 club for that matter

5319~~~
He's god awful. 300k for that dross.

5320~~~
His wages are completely irrelevant, he's just dreadful.

5321~~~
They're relevant in that he's being paid the wages of someone who should be a team star player and main man. He's not just a standard squad player playing poorly; he's someone who should ideally be our best player.

5322~~~
He wasn't as bad as usual. He just did nothing.

5323~~~
He was so off the pace it isn't funny.. got caught flat footed so many times. Bad first touch, poor hold up play, flat footed and he seems to have even lost that fiery spirit that he used to have.

5324~~~
Good lord that was awful again.

5325~~~
If he was being paid less would it make it any less frustrating how shit he's become?

5326~~~
I'd love to see how we'd perform without him in the team at the moment, he's not offering much

5327~~~
He is at Falcao's level.

5328~~~
No, but a player on that kind of wages should not only perform a lot better for himself, but also carry the team when it's not performing.

5329~~~
Nah, but the reason he <i>is </i>being paid highly is because he was, at one point, our best player and vital to the side. He wouldn't be anywhere near his current wages if it hadn't been for his previous form, which is of course the level he's fallen from.

5330~~~
He's never been the quickest but these days it looks like he's running with lead in his boots.

5331~~~
He does absolutely nothing. He's just completely useless.

It's so frustrating. And it means Martial is stuck out on the wing.

5332~~~
I'd be embarrassed if I was Rooney going into that dressing room. That was abysmal. RvP at his worst was <i>no way</i> that dire.

5333~~~
Shouldn't be in the team, simple as that. If he has any kind of injury lay off he might not be able to get back into the team.

5334~~~
I wish he would bog off and never come back and he can take his besotted manager with him.

5335~~~
Abysmal

5336~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> well put.

5337~~~
He justified the contract he was offered with his previous performances, yea, I just don't see it as relevant to the situation now. 

People keep saying a guy on those wages shouldn't be so shit, but it shouldn't matter, if we were paying him £100k a week he should still not be playing like this.

5338~~~
Noone should wish for an injury for a player on your own team but it's increasingly looking like the only way for LvG not to select Rooney. Even then you could not be guaranteed that Rooney won't play. Like I said, the David Moyes among footballers. He's worse than Gibson.

5339~~~
We genuinely appear to be playing with 10 men. He's lost his pace, his touch, his awareness it seems at times. And nobody in the mainstream punditry wants to acknowledge it. Mad.

5340~~~
He's absolutely fecking shite.

5341~~~
Going to do Chandler Bing's dance when he's dropped

5342~~~
Knew he would got a lot of stick on here, but I'm unsure what he did wrong? Barely got the ball played through to him.

5343~~~
God, he's just so poor. You'd have thought scoring on the weekend might give him a boost, but nope. He barely fecking moves anymore, he doesn't even fight like a dog how he used to.

I'm seriously close to just giving up on him.

5344~~~
Wasnt terrible, he just does nothing. Eehrmm.. well

5345~~~
He's terrible. I don't want to wish injury on anyone but if it's in his contract that he has to play then what other options are there? Might try and trip him up when he's in Waitrose.

5346~~~
I think people's problem with him isn't that he was necessarily doing much <i>wrong</i>, but more that he wasn't really doing anything at all. Even if he wasn't getting too much of the ball, he's a player who often just manages to find a way to involve himself in the game.

5347~~~
RVP wasn't. At all. But it'll be said that he was for some bizarre reason. 

I'd take RVP over Rooney now 10 times out of 10.

5348~~~
He offers nothing. 

This is just who he is at the moment.

5349~~~
Wow, he must have been shite today, after reading all this comment. Unfortunately, the only way I see Van Gaal dropping him is if he gets an injury. He has been piss poor for a long time, so people expecting him to find his form must also expect Falcao to become one of the best striker in football again. 

What is most troublesome is that Martial was once again shifted out wide to incorporate Rooney.

5350~~~
I'm one of his biggest critics, but to be fair he hardly got any service in the first half. 
Doesn't excuse the fact that he let another game pass him by and the fact that not 1 forward ball played into him resulted in us retaining possession or starting an attack from it. Movement was fairly atrocious too.

5351~~~
Oh I agree 100% but people on here seem to think that this season's Rooney is like last season's RvP which is nonsense.

5352~~~
The problem is he doesn't have the technical ability to fall back on. Once you take the pitbull nature out of Rooney, you're left with an abysmal player - the player we're seeing now.

5353~~~
People keep saying this but there is no movement from him. It is like he is scared to run in behind. The difference between us with him up top as opposed to when Martial is up top moving around is absurd.

I don't think he is past it as a footballer, but he is not a central striker anymore - nor has he ever been to be honest. He was always best running at defenders but he has lost the pace. He needs to find where is best for him on the pitch now, but it certainly is not as a main striker.

5354~~~
Okay I understand that point... if he drops deeper to get involved in the play, he gets slated for not playing as a 'proper' striker. It's difficult to play well as a striker the way we are set up. We struggle to pass the ball with any purpose in the final third.

5355~~~
Wasn't terrible at all tonight. He barely got a kick and was anonymous so it's quite hard to judge

Often a forward in away games will be left totally isolated and in turn ineffective and that's what happens tonight

That's not excusing his poor form in general though

5356~~~
it's actually mental. I'm watching RTE at the moment and they're saying Rooney is finding it hard to perform as he isn't get the service he wants? it's not just English media it seems. It's blowing my mind how much everyone in the media is making excuses for him. It's like everyone here is on another planet to everyone else. 

I'm so sick of coming to this thread game after game giving out about the same things, but he is absolute garbage.

5357~~~
Martial has sometimes been finding a way to do so.

And besides that, even when Rooney does get onto the ball, it's hard to ignore the fact that he's beginning to look more and more lethargic whenever he's on the ball. He's slow, lumbering and nowhere near as dynamic as he was in his younger days. Granted, even Rooney in his prime had games or spells where his touch went to shite, but it seems to be the norm at the moment which makes it a lot more concerning.

5358~~~
He truly is terrible an absymal player. We were playing with 10 men. Thats why it was so easy for Cska to defend when your CF cant hold the ball up and bring others into the game then you can spend all your time focusing on marking players like Martial out of the game. It's just useless.

5359~~~
meh - undroppable by LVG.

5360~~~
Not true regarding tonight. He just managed to feck up everything whenever he had the ball. Remember the situation late in the game where he had an easy header to Fellaini for him to completely miss the ball? Sums up Rooney anno 2015. Give him an ambassador role at the club instead. Pay him 400k if he retires today. I don't care how much money the club has to spend, I just want him as far away from the team as possible.

It's been mentioned quite a few times that it's sad to see such decline with a Manchester United legend, which is true, but it's way past sad and more in the infuriating category.

5361~~~
Martial says hi

5362~~~
Wasn't shit but offered nothing, so I guess he was shit?

The legacy of Wayne "Reek" Rooney, lives on.

5363~~~
Lowest pass percentage of the team is flying about on twitter. Doesn't particuarly matter to be honest, it's the fact he isn't stretching defences that's the problem for me. Just looks a weak link in a promising side for me.

5364~~~
God, I pray for the day we see a front four of Martial, Herrera, Mata, Memphis/Pereira/Young/Lingard.

5365~~~
"Rooney is no good." - Scholes

5366~~~
Been a massive supporter of Rooney for as long as he's he been with us, but I cannot make even the slightest argument for him starting in this team anymore. Once upon a time, you fancied him to pop up with a goal even when he was playing poorly, but is that remotely true now? What is he offering at the moment, honestly? His runs back to cover for defenders out of position? Is that what he's paid to do?

At the very least, I think most would back experimenting with lineups without Rooney. We'd get to see how a non-Rooney-centric lineup could perform and it might even light a fire under him (not that I think desire is his issue at the moment). Today wasn't his worst match in a United shirt, but it pains me to say that matches where he is even average are becoming less and less frequent.

5367~~~
Did he say that?

5368~~~
He just isn't up to scratch any more and worse than that he knows it which only exacerbates the problem further. His lack of belief/confidence means that we have a once effervescent player hiding in his shell. 

I actually feel sorry for him now, he needs to dropped as that is the most compassionate thing to do all round.

Maybe he can contribute if not played every minute of every game. Maybe?

5369~~~
Absolutely sick to death of him stifling the team. It's so infuriating that we could possibly have a very good first 11 but the simple inclusion of Rooney ruins everything.

5370~~~
Not going to waste my energy on this has been

5371~~~
It's become embarrassing for him because Martial has shown him up horribly by looking dangerous in every game he's played in, he can't have the excuse of blaming the players around him anymore. He has a bad relationship with the United fans, so if he's not playing well on top of that he gets no leeway.

Tonight wasn't his worst performance this season, but that shows just how terrible he's been. It is the straw that's broken the camels back though. I'm sick of him to be honest.

5372~~~
He did but then Scholes and Rio blamed Martial, Herrera and Lindgard for not running in behind and making Rooney look bad <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

5373~~~
Now we have seen Martial as a number 9 Rooney's problems can't just be blamed on lack of service, Martial created chances for himself and the ball didn't bounce off him half the time. Rooney's problems are his own doing.

5374~~~
Honestly said that? At least someone in the media said it.

You know what, I don't hold this against him, in a way I hope he beats Charlton's record and I believe he will but I wish he was doing it in some style. Going out gracefully like Giggs or Scholes did, adapting his game. Still contributing like Lampard did when he broke Chelsea's record. If or when he breaks the record, if its like this, scoring the odd goal among crap performances, it'll feel a bit flat I think.

5375~~~
Well said,he was dreadful again tonight.Van Gaal needs to drop him,he's afraid to sub him at the moment.We will not move on until we bring another striker in and ship him out.Poor Wayne is burnt out and the team is suffering now.

5376~~~
Really has to finish his chances. He's getting into some decent positions now but approaches them without any of the experience or quality he should do.

5377~~~
I preferred him under Moyes, he played a lot more aggressively and scored/assisted around a goal a game. Under Van Gaal he's been at his lowest productivity wise. In games like this he would drop deep and not let the game pass him by but maybe now he is instructed to not drop deep.

5378~~~
Two very different players, Martial is fantastic is just a shame we have to play him out wide at the moment.

5379~~~
The Norwegian commentator went on about how slow their centre backs were, and there in the second half Rooney had a clear 40 yard run against the slowest of the pair, and he lost! People still go on about him being one of the fastest players in the league; it's right up there with the Yeti, isn't it, as far as myths go. 

He may not have misplaced as many passes today, but he looks completely uninterested. What does he have on LVG to not be dropped? Impressive!

5380~~~
We don't have to, you know...

5381~~~
Playing with him as our main striker is genuinely a handicap. The attackers we could deploy and the football we could play if it weren't for Rooney makes it all the more frustrating to endure. City are without Aguero I believe but we'd be doing them a huge favour if Rooney was to play that game.

He's been shite for a long time now - I've wanted him gone for a while now. The first time he had a sook he was in blazing good form, granted he was worth the hassle. Second time it happened Fergie knew he wasn't worth it and tried pushing him out. Fecking Moyes

5382~~~
Not quite, I assumed more people would be watching the BT coverage. He said "Rooney is no good" then took a deep breath and said "at this role" or something.

5383~~~
The problem with a lot of you guys is that you expect something from him..His terrible performances are simply the norm for me, and because he wont be dropped, its up to the other 10 players to step up.

5384~~~
I've given up on him. It really is a sad sight seeing Rooney being reduced to the garbage he is now.

5385~~~
The standard excuse now seems to be "he didn't do anything wrong", but that's only because he isn't doing anything at all. I could play for United right now as a striker and not do anything wrong. Jog around a bit, yell at someone every once in a while and play the most simple ball possible.

He doesn't create anything or look even remotely dangerous and as our lone striker you've got to think that's probably a bit of a problem. He's played in multiple positions this season and been just as ineffective so position isn't the problem either. He needs to be benched.

5386~~~
He needs time out of the side... For his own sake as much as anything.

5387~~~
He appears to have these spells just before contract talks. Maybe United should offer him a extension....

5388~~~
I hate to break it to you...but LVG would never do that

5389~~~
Yeah because he is United's 3rd highest goalscorer ever, England's top goal scorer ever and at one point possibly the best talent this country has ever produced...are people wrong to expect better that 90 minutes of lack of movement, poor touches and lack of pace? People are more than allowed to feel a bit let down.

5390~~~
Or he's quite simply not good enough any more?

5391~~~
Forever sounds like it'll suffice. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Seriously though, he's become our Gerrard. What baffles me the most is for some reason i've seen fans who reside in England in social media and the like praising him? Saying he's our best and most influential player and I can't help but laugh a little, as harsh as it sounds he's become a joke of a footballer, makes it all the more frustrating when he's one of our most paid players and he is holding us back from playing some younger and tbf better players.

5392~~~
how does he always have a gun to the club's head? its mindboggling what's a stake in elite level football and he gets a complete free pass for years service

5393~~~
Too much sense there. Ease up a bit!

5394~~~
Hmm... feeling a bit drowsy. Could explain the sudden expression of sense.

5395~~~
Oh lord no. A reduction more like!

5396~~~
Well I'll be damned. I didn't know we shouldn't be expecting things from our highest paid player and captain.

5397~~~
At that state, finish i six pack of beer and you'll be president, or prime minister. President sounds cooler though.

5398~~~
He played well for a while under Moyes - most notably before he got the big fat contract given to him by Moyes. After that it wasn't anything special from what I remember - certainly not enough for a player of his supposed stature. It's not LVG's system (even if LVG fecks up at times) - it's Rooney - he's just done. These things are certain to happen sooner or later for an athlete. The problem is he doesn't want to recognise that he's lost most of his powers, and worse, he is undroppable by LVG which is holding our team back. This is a big big worry.

5399~~~
The majority of those goals and performances came during a time when he was a much better player..He's no where near that now, and his current performances in this season show  exactly that.

5400~~~
Don't know what the feck it is. Must certainly be a clause in that contract that states every time he doesn't start when fit, United are liable to pay him 'x' amount of pounds. It must be something like that. It's shocking that we're kissing his arse like this at the expense of our very expensive team! Absolute madness.

5401~~~
Or Arguably our worst player this season..there are different ways to look at it..At least he's consistent.

5402~~~
He's been shite for a long time.

5403~~~
Silent domination, what bullshit. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Surely his time with us is coming to an end. We cannot expect to have any sort of decent sustainable results with him as captain and leading the line.

He's been amazing for us 2004-2013, but he is a shadow of his former self now. A hollow shell of the man he was.

Here is a nice tidbit from the Beeb that puts it into perspective:

Shocking.

5404~~~
How long will we have to endure this passenger in our team?  Are we talking months?  Years??

5405~~~
236 goals, not yet 30 years old. Is he really done? Surely not.

5406~~~
Wayne in the past would come up with a moment of genius, even when he was having a bad game. That has gone. As I have said he needs everything on a plate and you cannot even guarantee he will make the most of it.

5407~~~
Their CBs are slow as feck and he couldn't beat them for pace. Fecking shambles. I'm angry just thinking about it.

5408~~~
nobody doubts what he has done in the past

5409~~~
Yes..Certainly for a team with any genuine aspirations of silverware.

5410~~~
He was playing in a poor team, under a poor manager and still scored 19 goals and assisted over 20 goals. Look at his productivity under LVG, 14 goals in 37 appearances last year, 6 goals in 13 this year and no assists. That's a huge difference. He's taken the advice of 'save your energy for scoring goals' a bit too literally and plays with no aggression any more, jogs around when pressing an opponent. 

Under Fergie and Moyes he would drop deep as well if there was no service and try to help the team. Think back to our 2-2 draw at White Hart Lane under Moyes and recall his lone striker performance. Maybe he doesn't have that license to drop back under Van Gaal.

5411~~~
I agree. In Moyes' side he really did bring some attacking impetus. When he was out, it really showed.

But remember, this was before Herrera, Martial, Memphis and Mata. Our attacking players then were Valencia, Welbeck, a really poor version of Young, a rather past it RVP and a poor Fellaini.

5412~~~
Radamel Falcao. 205 goals. Not yet 30. Is he really done? Surely not. You know why? Because how you play now is completely irrelevant if you got great stats to show from your career. Also even if you have been shit for two years you just don't lose your quality. Bulletproof theory.

5413~~~
This actually shocked me a little tonight. I know he's awful and all that, but tonight he looked like a 40 year old man trying to play football at the highest level. In a way, it was a bit sad. I know I'm strongly against him still being a big presence in our team, but even I could not help but feel a bit sad. Never easy when an athlete comes to the end of their time. But his <i>'undroppability'</i> is going to ruin our bloody season....<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5414~~~
Herrera can't play ten and Martial can't play up front because of this nothing player playing those roles. It's not just how ineffective he is, it's how he's road blocking other players that's really pissing me off. He must be as sweet in the dressing room as people say because if I was them I'd be furious.

He's an itch you can't scratch.

5415~~~

5416~~~
Until Van Gaal thinks it is actually impacting the team or an unfortunate injury. Right now United best striker is a 19 year old French kid hardly anyone had heard of 2 months ago.

5417~~~
most certanly our worst plaer in the squad. How on earth is he guaranteed starter, while shouodn't be even on the bench?

Mr. VG show some balls ffs!

5418~~~
Since Moyes and Fergie he's declined drastically. We see what happens when he drops back and starts getting in everyone's way. He fecks things up so quite frankly he really shouldn't have any sort of 'roaming licence'. The problem is we have is now he doesn't fit anywhere.

5419~~~
He should be made to wear our blue and white strip from 96 cos he is playing like a tesco value striker

5420~~~
So Martial and Memphis when he plays don't have pace?

5421~~~
he needs pacey players around him to control a ball?

5422~~~
Why do these pundits keep making excuses for him?  Needs to be playing no.9....oh no, he's shit there now...needs to be playing no.10.....If all else fails they trot out the old "works his socks off"

5423~~~
This pundit doesnt

5424~~~
Come on Scholes, we can't be accommodating a 30 year old player at the expense of everyone else, more than we already are (sigh). He's got some pace around him - he just can't do what he used to. I cannot believe these people can't see how bad Rooney is and it has nothing to do with who is or isn't around him.

5425~~~
TBF, I dont care what his age is, if he was playing like this at 24, I would want him out the team. Its not good enough. Id rather he goes out wide and we put Martial up top to stretch teams.

Fellainis hold up play was better than him as well.

5426~~~
He means that..he means..ah feck it, Even Scholes knows the truth and was the first to say it years ago.

5427~~~
The number of articles about Rooney are increasing..I think in a way this will make getting rid of him even easier at year end, if LVG chooses to take it.

5428~~~
I think he's frustrated with himself too.

5429~~~
They distract the opponents, giving Rooney more time to control the ball maybe? Thats the best I can come up with.

5430~~~
His buddies scraping the barrel to find excuses for him. He made a couple of decent runs tonight but he is basically the Tom Cleverley of strikers at this point, just offers next to nothing, like toast without butter.

5431~~~
Lingard, Martial and then Memphis for a bit. Our slowest guy Mata didn't even get on the pitch. It's a lazy excuse, from a shite pundit.

5432~~~
Over reaction don't you think

5433~~~
looking forward to Garth Crooks' evaluation of things <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

5434~~~
It's a justified reaction; Rooney has been woeful too consistently for too long. We must drop him.

5435~~~
By the way, I don’t think his pace/lack of pace is a problem. He could be Bellerin-eque fast and that wouldn’t take him far with lack of motivation and especially shit first touch.

5436~~~
Your opinion, they disagree




Ita just your opinion.

5437~~~
He loses more than 60% of his duels. Tired of this shit.

5438~~~
Another very good game of him sacrificing himself by being poor for the sake of other players.

5439~~~
In addition to what has already been said, does anyone get really annoyed when he thinks that one of his duties as captain is to spread his arms at the ref whenever one of our players goes down, no matter how soft it was?

5440~~~
We might have been able to accommodate Scholes' lack of pace, but accommodating Rooney's lack of ball control is an entirely different proposition.

He said some seriously stupid shit post match. Essentially blamed everyone else but Rooney for Rooney being shit. Rio got in on the act too.

5441~~~
Awful yet again. A 19 year old who plays on the wing scores a harder chance than the one he got. I would be embarrassed if I was him, but then again, he lost his drive, no passion anymore.

5442~~~
Why is he playing the full 90 minutes again?! Why?!

5443~~~
How much is he worth for United marketing-wise? I can't see any other reason than his famous name for not being dropped.

5444~~~
Fair play to you for not giving up on him yet. 
I on the other hand would welcome a niggling injury to him.

5445~~~
Because him and LVG have some sort of special relationship.

5446~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5447~~~
Atrocious again, meant to be leading the line and was rarely an option to be hit with a ball, coasting around the place standing flat footed behind defenders when our midfielders were looking for options, getting rid of him from the club is the most urgent piece of business we need to look after in the immediate future.  He earns the same money as Ronaldo and messi, it is stomach churning watching it.

5448~~~
I genuinely can't help but feeling that he's costing us points now, CSKA were nothing special, I really think we could have beaten them with Martial upfront.

5449~~~
Weird thing to say as Rooney is still playing as the main striker, while Scholes was a playmaker in deep midfield. 
There's always an excuse. I wonder if there's any high-profile person brave enough to criticize him?

5450~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> which people is that mate?

5451~~~
Scholes talking nonsense. Him giving the ball away, not capable of controlling it so many times and making no runs whatsoever is all down to others. He offers nothing whatsoever... unless you're on the opposition team.

5452~~~
The problem for me is his movement in the box. He massively struggles when there is limited amounts of space, he just doesn't know how to move and work space from a defender anymore.

I watch the best in aguero, lewandowski and Suarez and their little 5 yard movements in and out, working the channels and generally making gambling runs to the front or back post is just another level to what Rooney offers these days. 

Yes if he's in space he can usually time a forward run well, but right now we rarely get that. We need a proper striker who works space, is comfortable in possession and doesn't mind moving regularly. 

Oh wait we do in martial <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

5453~~~
So poor again, it really is like playing with 10 as people have said. Honestly, from tonight's performance I can remember a shot as the keeper closed him down, a weak header right at the keeper, a free kick which was so laughably bad Fellaini couldn't even reach it and just a bunch of times he gave away the ball to CSKA.

And it not just that he continues to play, it's that others such as Martial and Herrera have been/are still denied the chance to play in their best positions because for some completely unjustifiable reason he's protected by van Gaal from being dropped. I fully expect him to start again City and give us another performance of 'silent domination', let's see if he proves us wrong.

5454~~~
We've been over this so many times, but I honestly can't get over it. What other player that LVG has managed, has ever gotten the same treatment, despite offering nothing to a team? I'm honestly curious. Even SAF hauled him off, and that was when he was a great player.

5455~~~
Maybe LVG thinks he cant get rid so...ah forget it. Going to bed.

5456~~~
It's absurd. He's so blind to it, it's surreal. The coaching staff seem to agree with it, I mean how can they all not see what all the fans see? What am I missing? It's mind-boggling. 

LVG even called Rooney his best captain ever ffs.

5457~~~
been defending Rooney, but it doesnt seem that keeping playing him is gonna get him out of his slump, maybe he needs to join memphis of the bench for a while

5458~~~
He was pretty anonymous again. Not a blatant liability like he has been, where we play with basically 9 men due to his his poor touches and passing. But a liability in that we essentially played with 10 men.

5459~~~
When did he say this ? He's living in some fantasy land he if thinks he will be leading the line next season let alone for years to come.

5460~~~
The problem with Rooney is he's reached the point where he can play 10 crap games in a row and then one half good performance and the media will say the ten games were a blip and base their evaluation of him on the 11th game and what he was 3 years ago. I can only assume that either a) LVG is the same or b) he doesn't want to drop one of the few leaders* we have left.

*I've never been convinced that he's a leader tbh. He gives out to his teammates and appeals but that's all I've ever seen him do that could be described as leadership.

5461~~~
Right now, I would put Smalling and Schweinsteiger a hell lot higher than Rooney in the pecking order of people who can take the armband on a permanent basis. At some point, we will have to stop and think a second about who should wear the armband while being a real go-to player on the pitch.

5462~~~
O


Oh yeah, totally agree but in reference to your point, there's a reason people expect so much from him, that being it.

5463~~~
Is Scholesy that afraid to throw rocks at his buddy even when the latter is playing like crap? He shouldn't be.

5464~~~
I wonder if those lads in balaclavas still have their crowbars? Perhaps they could show up at Rooney's house again and offer moving help?

It really beggars belief how useless he's become.

5465~~~
He's wank, we might as well play with 10 men because playing with Rooney is like playing against 12 men at times.

5466~~~
what do professional coaches and former players see in him that we don't see? I'm truly at a loss.

5467~~~
Ah... Forget it. 

I wonder what giggs view on his cronies continually being shite

5468~~~
I would love to see the team reviewing footage of the games. They must just sit there in an awkward, uncomfortable silence as they watch Rooney give the ball away, fail to press, and not pose any sort of threat behind the defence. I have no idea if Van Gaal would actually highlight it, and if he does then obviously there are no consequences for Rooney failing to remedy it.

5469~~~

5471~~~
Does anyone feel as if he often forgets all the basic fundamentals of football sometimes?

Like looking up before crossing a ball? or making runs?

5472~~~
Just listening to the latest UWS podcast and the contrast between the support from the match-going faithful and the abuse he receives in here is quite telling. 

Everyone accepts he is not firing but why not <b>support</b> him rather than write him off and hang him out to dry?

5473~~~
AMAZING SKILL SHOW!!*


<span style="font-size: 9px">*Actually just a video of a few tap-ins and some slow motion close-ups of his face. Oh, and he does a couple of backheels.</span>

5474~~~
Hes been poor recently but hes still been better than memphis.
Correct me if im wrong but hes our top scorer too isn't he?

I agree his future doesn't look great (i'd be surprised if he tops Bobby Charlton tbh)
but still think he'll have his uses this season.
Think people are exaggerating how poor hes been too.

5475~~~
He was repeatedly beaten to the ball by Russian central defenders. Generally damn near the slowest group in Europe, and they're all well into their 30s now. 

His legs have gone, and he isn't going to adjust his game like Totti. I don't think his skills have dropped off a ton, as much as it is his mobility. He just can't get open without the ball or carry it forward when he gets it. Without that in his game, he's not effective. There are players who are, but he ain't one of them.

We simply have to move on. He needs to be sold in January or the summer, even if only for a pittance to PSG, MLS or some other acronym. Getting his wages off the books will basically equal what the attacking replacement and new LCB we need. 

Martial up top and Memphis-Herrera-Mata behind him, with the best attacking player we can find in the summer pushing one to the bench when everyone is healthy. 

Either Wilson is the new 2nd choice #9 or we find another one; A Hernandez or Diouf style 3-7M pound punt on a hungry young player with some pace our scouts like to compete with him would be fine.

5476~~~
Because a seasoned veteran like him should know a hell lot better than anyone else how to pull himself out of the hole. I have seen other seasoned veterans at United able to get back on track after a slump, but people just don't have that same level of confidence with Rooney when it has been a few years in a row that he has been shite. The last time I lost faith in a long-serving veteran player when Gary Neville was in his last few miles for us; Rooney is walking close to that kind of situation.

5477~~~
Match going fans should basically never boo the players. It's not going to help anyone's confidence and it doesn't make anyone want to play for us. I think booing a manager is an acceptable last resort when the club needs to know he's lost the support of the fans and so can in theory be defensible, but that's about it.

But this forum? Rooney isn't reading this.

5478~~~
Indeed, throw in some pre-season clips to pad it out a bit as well. As a side note, including a slow motion shot of his spit flying across the screen was a sight to behold.

5479~~~
What grates my teeth more than his shite performances are the people who continually make excuses for him. Why does Rooney, at centre forward, need fast players around him? Did Van Persie have that when he was scoring goals en route to our 20th title?

5480~~~
Hell no!

5481~~~
Poor, as expected from him now. Could not hold the ball up for toffees. Cannot believe he is supposed be our #9 when his ability with his back to goal is as bad as I have seen from someone playing at this level.

5482~~~
If LVG remains at the helm, I am pretty confident Rooney will be our captain and first choice #9. I even expect LVG to come to the first presser of the pre-season next year saying "Rooney says that he can score us 20 goals and my captain always plays".

5483~~~
Hopefully he goes home and does this next year.

5484~~~
I just don't understand why LVG doesn't instruct him to not come back and collect the ball in midfield areas. We have midfielders and we have Herrera, Rooney doesn't have to be the hero, the "playmaker" too. I hate it how it is portrayed in the media that when Rooney does that, it's because the midfield isn't providing with balls. Maybe if he stayed up front a little more, he'd received more goalscoring chances, like any normal striker would.

5485~~~
Annoys the hell out of me and its one of the main areas I feel is apart of this bad form.  Basically not nailing down the fundamentals of the #9 position:

- Poor positioning due to trying to be involved with the play far too deep
- Inconsistent first touches, most of the time just shockingly bad.
- Agility and pace to get away from players and keep distance from them is very rare nowadays.
- A lack of instinct, thinks far too long on the ball slowing down any attack.
- Power.

Martial was born for that #9 position...sick of watching Rooney butcher it.

5486~~~
I have no idea who's quotes they are. But I know it's just my opinion.

5487~~~
If Rooney had a decent (not great) first touch and stayed up front more, that would make the team much better just like that and that is with his lack of pace and power. He's a very annoying player to watch playing football.

5488~~~
Lunatics who show some stats "proving" that he faster than Robben etc. He never was and certainly isn't now. We would have been better of with Hernandez.

5489~~~
Rooney's continued inclusion in the first team and the media cover up of his poor form is bordering on suspicious now. In any other industry, we'd be asking questions about nepotism or corruption at this stage.

5490~~~
I'd be surprised if Rooney could read anything to be fair. 

/joke

5491~~~
For sure, I was just pointing out Wayne's career trajectory. He ain't no middle of the road performer. He's surely earned the benefit of doubt.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/19/only-manchester-citys-sergio-aguero-has-scored-more-goals-than-arsenals-olivier-giroud-in-last-three-seasons-5448619/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/19/only-...olivier-giroud-in-last-three-seasons-5448619/</a>
 In this form for sure.

 Wayne hasn't had a major injury since his ankle in 09/10 if memory serves me correctly and we know the story with Radamel. Considering that,is it far fetched to suggest that Wayne is going through he's worst run of form in a United jersey and that yes he has peaked but he's still a much better player than what we seeing.

edit: having done some research, I came across this. 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.the42.ie/rooney-out-three-weeks-731516-Dec2012/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.the42.ie/rooney-out-three-weeks-731516-Dec2012/</a>

It seemed innocuous enough at the time but maybe this is the straw the broke the camel's back.

5493~~~
Well it must be true then. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5494~~~
And just like that he is shit enough to make his band of apologists disappear into the forest again, this guy has had too many false starts this season perhaps it's time we all admit that the "good times" aren't coming back ever again. The sad thing is last night he wasn't that poor, he was just ineffectual - a nonety in the match.

5495~~~
Rooney should be in peak form at this stage of his career.

Not only has his touch, passing and movement deserted him, but his on-field demeanor seems to suggest someone just doing a job. Just don't see the passion and hunger in his game.

5496~~~
I've read this week Herrera, Lingard praising his ability and leadership. A tactical breakdown in the 'van gaal tactics' thread also praised his controlling of 'the press'. Maybe as fans we are missing something?

5497~~~
That's a very interesting thought.

I wonder what the players really think about his form and his status? Someone like Schweinsteiger, player who just won the World fecking Cup and was playing for best team in the world is substituted at half time yet Rooney keeps starting games and leading our team while he is our worst player this season. How would anyone feel in his place? How would you feel if you have captain that's actually stopping you from playing decent football every single game and ruining your chances of winning games?

They must be pissed off, but they obviously can't say nothing about it.

5498~~~
Yes, those seem to be his outstanding qualities now. Leadership and good to be around. He has a worrying influence in the press as most of them do not want to see his decline.
It's just a pity he doesn't have a single outstanding quality anymore that is visible to the average viewer.

5499~~~
If I was a player in the dressing room and I'd see LvG making excuse after excuse for Rooney, I'd lose faith in the manager. Especially when we have clear evidence that Martial is a better #9, and Herrera is a better #10.

5500~~~
Probably. There is a reason we're just fans.

I think for a few years it a lot of fans didn't understand what Carrick did but fergie and pundits loved him.

Don't think its quite the same with Rooney.

5501~~~
Because on this board we are discussing about things, there is literally no point pretending that everything is good and Rooney will without any doubts be good in the future.

5502~~~
Funny how the fastest players in the world are almost entirely made up of the most famous players at the top clubs.

5503~~~
All I can sum up about Rooney is he is not the most technical player at the club, not the quickest, not the best passer, probably not the best finisher either. Continuous 4 or 5 out of 10 performances. Plus he physically looks like time is catching him up in his 14th top flight season. Obviously LvG loves him and speaking to the press and captaining the squad he seems very good but really does that warrant him playing week in week out? 

No.

5504~~~
You don't piss off one of the influential players so early in the season else you risk a revolt. We've seen that happening already with Moyes. You just smile and hope that there's still enough juice left in the player to get you through the season until you send him to Turkey in the summer.

5505~~~
Re his peak age, this is a player who burst onto the scene at the ridiculous age of 16, and has played a whole lot of football every season since. 

I really do think it's just a case of his rise and fall having happened a few years before it does for most players.

5506~~~
So is Scholes basically saying that strikers just stand around waiting for the chances, while everyone else should work their butts off? You look at the best strikers and they work their socks off making runs to provide options for passes. Rooney used to, now he doesn't, as has been said he is that protected that he has lost the motivation.

5507~~~
I think that Van gaal is doing what he did with Van Persie and Falcao, he is exposing him as much as he can, so next season Rooney will have no ground to complain about being ditched.

5508~~~
Exactly, his decline has begun. Only way is down.

5509~~~
Cannot see this set of United players downing tools if LVG if decided to drop him.

5510~~~
I can understand Scholes POV. A lone striker's primary job is that of scoring goals, the rest is a bonus. If Rooney can't work his butts off anymore than he shouldn't do it and focus on his main job. Unfortunately, Rooney had never been a fox in the box or particularly creative either.

5511~~~
As far as I'm concerned, last night was his third United performance in a row where he actually looked like a professional footballer. That is all I can ask of him at the moment. Overall, the situation is that he is so obvioulsly not good enough to be here, and needed to be replaced a while back. I also don't like that Martial is now becoming a winger because of him. That said, it is what it is, and if he is to play, then the least I can ask is him not effectively playing in defence for the other team, which he has done on many occasions of late. Last night was not one of them, so I'll have to chalk it down as a 'good performance'.

5512~~~
He definitely isn't the fox in the box. RVN, Lineker were that. Wayne did a lot of his work outside the box. I can just see this getting very messy in the end.

5513~~~
I disagree. Rooney has a lot of influence on and off the pitch. He's been here since age 17 and is also Ingerlund's top star. Sub him and you'll have the class of 92, the media and probably the English contingent at United (most of whom are struggling to justify their role at United themselves) at LVG's throat

5514~~~
There is this one pensioneer who wouldn't give rat's ass what that mob thought and would have done something much worse to Rooney had he stayed on. If LVG is too scared of off-pitch factors to do the job then he should do the honourable thing and hand in his resignation because the club is leaching money, the team points and his team mates chances just to indulge him. In terms of the big picture this is an shit state of affairs and completely unacceptable.

5515~~~
So why does Rooney get 2 years worth of exposure and Falcao and RvP get one each? He was pretty awful last season too.

5516~~~
It will.

Its stressful being a manager these days. As SAF once said players were emotionally tougher in the past. It was also tougher to become a legend at a club and those who achieved such status, would have done anything not to spoil it. In matter of fact most legends retired long before they became a burden (ex Cantona) and those who didn't, moved to smaller clubs were their experience was of better use. I remember being shocked when Keane caused such a mayhem with that famous interview. While he did had a point in the team being weaker than it should be, it was evident that the biggest problem at the club was actually him. We had the only DM in the world who couldn't run any more. Nowadays its becoming common for players to overstay and those who are forced to leave tend to throw a fit. Not to forget how many players expect to remain involved within the club despite having zero experience in their new job whatsoever. Its strange because they all leave football as millionaires and therefore they shouldn't expect the club to nanny them for the rest of their life

5517~~~
I believe he's about to be benched. It would take balls to do that for the derby but LVG has them and if it's not this weekend then it will be happening shortly after.

He'll be benched, or subbed off at half time, and that will see a very rapid exit of Rooney from the club I think. We all know where he's going.

5518~~~
Because, he has been at the club for 11 years and he will be a legend of the club, it's logical to have more time for him. Also Falcao wasn't our player and RVP was on the last year of his contract, it was easier to not keep them.

5519~~~
I guess you're referring to the one who kept a DM and a fullback in the team despite they couldn't run anymore. The only pensioneer who frustrated the most talented young CM in this generation because he insisted in playing two nearly 40 year olds, a fat guy from Brazil and one of the most average midfielders United had ever had.

SAF may never have shown bias to Rooney but he did showed bias to others. LVG is much more ruthless than an ageing SAF.

5520~~~
At this point I would play Lingard on the left, until Young comesback, and Martial upfront with Herrera and Mata completing the quartet.

5521~~~
Lunatic!

5522~~~
The whole Rooney conundrum is kind of sad to be honest. Never seen anything quite like it as a United supporter. Scholes retired when he declined a bit, came back, did well and when his play dropped further, just left the game for good; Giggs gave us plenty of excellent performances even at age 40; Neville hung up his boots when he knew the time was up. But it never snowballed into a situation where a top, top player struggled for multiple seasons, and put in underwhelming performances on a consistent basis. Watching the rapid deterioration of not just a modern United legend, but a great of football as a whole makes for unpleasant viewing. In a sense, Wayne's entire career kind of mirrors Raul's. He too was a regular starter at a massive club since age 17 or 18, playing 40/50 games each season, frequently in the latter stages of Europe. Rooney similarly, burst onto the scene at 16, transferred to United at 19, and when fit, he's pretty much been a fixture ever since.

Raul's physical decline was quite evident in 2006-2008; despite the goal return in subsequent seasons, his play had progressively gotten weaker and in the last season, the wheels pretty much fell off entirely. You got the sense that his brain processed everything, but his body and legs just couldn't keep up. All the wear and tear of 600 appearances with Real Madrid by age 29; on top of 100 caps for Spain was catching up with him even in 2006, when other players his age were in their peak. Rooney has followed a really similar trajectory. Early bloomer who has a meteoric rise to the top, almost 600 appearances in club football, 100 caps for England. Both record scorers for their national team, and chasing the ghost of former greats - Di Stefano for Raul, and Charlton for Rooney. Guess their bodies aren't conditioned to operate like Ronaldo or Maldini's.

Let's just hope Rooney catches up to Sir Bobby this season, as unlikely at it may seem right now. For one, that would mean more points for United, so it's mutually beneficial. And, if the club operates rationally with the long term view in mind, we can have a clean break with no hard feelings come summertime. If he doesn't, then there's always the chance we could keep him around for romantic reasons, and coming agonizingly close to the club's all time scoring record. One has to wonder why more players don't pull a Cantona though. Much classier than being actively pushed out, or becoming a shell of you former selves - which is what happened to Stephen and Casillas just this summer. Why leave with bitter memories, or end up being run out of town by the management (not that it seems likely with Wayne); when you can go out at the very top.

It's a 100% legit operation mate, wouldn't want to second guess their research.

<span style="color: #ffffff">lulz</span>

5523~~~
Really? I thought RvP had a year to run on his contract?

And in that same vein - why get rid of other players who have been here but under-performing? Fletcher, Welbz, Nani etc

What LvG is doing is simply illogical.

5524~~~
Its all about balance. There's a limit to the chopping and changing a manager can do in one year else a genuine attempt in getting rid of the deadwood may easily degenerate into a revolt. In 12 months LVG got rid of Rio, Di Maria, Ando, Cleverley, the darling of Manchester,  Fletcher, Falcao and RVP ie 3 legends of the club (Rio, Fletcher and RVP), 2 homegrown talent (Cleverley and Welbeck (Im not adding Fletcher here as I added to the previous list)), one of the most liked people in the squad (Ando) and 2 big names (Falcao and ADM - same rule apply for RVP). Selling Rooney would have taken things a bit too far

5525~~~
Agree with that. He's improved recently and is now average rather than rubbish. I think he can improve a little bit further and put in a string of good performances for a month or two before becoming poor again. Much depends on the game vs City though. If we lose and he contributes nothing...

5526~~~
Well he was winning league titles with that team so I guess he was justified.We will never know, tbh, the reasons behind his dogged loyalty to certain players but it can be argued that most of the players he kept around whilst they weren't good enough for a starring role they were great squad players to rotate around a really strong core.

5527~~~
where's that?

5528~~~
Because they had cheap contracts, it's easier to get rid of them because someone else will give them an equivalent contract, Rooney don't have a cheap contract which means that Rooney won't move, unless you give him for free. For Nani there was no coming back he was out of the club and the team for too long.

5529~~~
Agreed.

The end is nigh for Rooney and once he's benched he'll want out.

5530~~~
We will never know, tbh, the reasons behind his dogged loyalty to certain players but it can be argued that most of the players he kept around whilst they weren't good enough for a starring role they were great squad players to rotate around a really strong core.[/QUOTE]

He kept on winning titles however his actions hurt the club big time as the team had to endure a rebuilding process which we never witnessed since the 80s (when SAF came to the club). I bet both Moyes and LVG would have loved if they had Pogba in the team instead of Cleverley

5531~~~
Back to Everton.

5532~~~
He has the club by the balls, its painful to watch.

I'm not even convinced LVG could drop him even if he wanted to, our marketing team would have a meltdown considering he's the club's goldenboy <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>.

Fergie's contract did not entail building teams for Moyes and LVG though. Fergie made his decisions, won as a result or in spite of them depending on where you are looking from, so it's up to LVG to make his because he will live or die by them.

5534~~~
Absolutely sick and tired of watching him. Got slated by many on here last season for seeing something that the majority are finally noticing. He's past it. A few goals here and there wont change that.

5535~~~
His form is a big worry. It's not just that he doesnt score goals anymore, he cant do the simple things right either. He cant control a ball, cant pass it properly, he doesnt make good runs etc. LVG should really drop him but I cant see it as things stand. He's a big reason why we're not performing well

5536~~~
I think there is probably pressure from the board to play Rooney given the enormous investment the club made in him under Moyes.

The funny thing is he has been so poor his value will have dropped considerably now.

5537~~~
How can he be the club goldenboy when he doesn't earn much on publicity and sponsorship? How can he be marketable when it concerns the club but not marketable when it concerns himself?

In my opinion, Rooney isn't marketable, he isn't a goldenboy and concerning the shirts if he leaves tomorrow the club will sell the same amount of shirts but with a different name.

5538~~~
You see, fans called me out, possibly fairly, for me saying that I wouldn't be entirely adverse to him being injured. Just for long enough for us to actually show that we are better off without him anyway. I stand by this.

Knowing our luck though, Herrera will get injured at the same time and we won't be able to show anything.

5539~~~
Rooney jerseys sell more than any of other our players, he's pretty much central to all our promos and is not only United's, but also England's most iconic player right now across the globe. Our marketing dept would hence have a panic attack if we dropped him.

5540~~~
In what way is he?

For instance I bet you Martial shirts are seriously outselling Rooney ones these days for a start (along with both Schweinsteiger and Depay)

5541~~~
Not true.

And he's on the verge of losing his England place.

5542~~~
Unlike Cantona or to a lesser extent Neville, Rooney is not someone who has that self awareness to do that plus he is on a massive contract. I think  Villa away is the only match he admitted he was poor. I assume he believes that the rest of his performances this season are acceptable.  It's  not helped by the bubble (media or internal) that he inhabits validating this ,even though his performances, especially in the last 2 or 3 years has been on a downward trajectory

5543~~~
I assume it was Di Maria followed by Rooney, but now Di Maria has left its Rooney surely?

5544~~~
In the short term. Rooney is the 4th most well known footballer world wide (Or something?) and the first name on the back of the shirt in Asia, as well as the most recognisable outside Europe.

P.s I am not arguing this is a good thing I just feel LVG will have had his hands tied re Rooney, as would any manager we could have bought in.

5545~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2660482/memphis-depay-shirt-sells-the-most-in-the-premier-league" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.co.uk/club/manche...ay-shirt-sells-the-most-in-the-premier-league</a>

5546~~~
And it took maybe the worst individual performance I've seen from a Utd player before he'd even admit that.

Of course he's not going to come out and be 100% brutally honest about his own form, but the way he's spoken after games where he's scored is very worrying. He seemed to think he'd answered his critics after the Everton game.

The whole situation is just a mess, it's so frustrating having to watch him every week either be terrible or do nothing.

5547~~~
From July to September. Of course a new shiny signing is going to dominate shirt sales over a summer transfer window. Look over a slightly broader period and I'm sure Rooney would be topping the list.

5548~~~
Media might be covering for him now but if he fecks up for England next summer they will ruin him. 

As for this club performance, It has got to point were we just have to live with it, he won't be dropped or subbed anytime soon.

5549~~~
I'll have an even tenner with anyone here that, barring a remarkable turnaround and a flurry of goals, he is benched for an EPL game before the end of November.

5550~~~

Building a team for the future had always been the aim of the club else we would have been buying short term buys instead of young players. LVG's work will be enjoyed by the ones who succeed him (Martial, Depay etc).

5551~~~
He should play on the left and martial centre(assuming he has to play). I think him on the left will solidify our midfield, the problem with him is Our system sparkles when someone will pla on last man and look to get behind but as strikers get older they do this less and start taking the ball shrt and to feet. He did it against everton and we played well, he did not do it today, he blocked herrera's space and his holding up of the ball has never been great. Martial/benz/lewa would be the type of strikers our systems require but i dont think rooney can do that job. He should realise this and drop to the bench or Lvg should play him on left and martial centre. This will also keep depay out of the team who is even worse than him. We can use rooney to work back and not loose martial's threat in the same. This is all assuming he has to play, for me i would play lingard left until ashley cole comes back(Cant believe i just wrote that, what the feck?) Its the  weak spot in our team and if he has to play, make him play there.

5552~~~
Yep agreed that the further you go back this will be the case. However it is a reality is that his star is now on the wane for both club and country. 

I don't believe for a minute that team selection is influenced by revenue from shirts.

5553~~~
This just in... 'Undroppable' Rooney is ineffective again. 
In an unshocking effort (the word 'performance' overstates what he does on a pitch now) yet again, Rooney had maintained his underwhelming stats for another 90mins. Proof that essentially 10man Utd are carrying the significant weight of their unmovable (and rarely moving) captain.
Some sections of fans believe Rooney is outlaying a considerable chunk of his ridiculous wage on Derren Brown, who convinces LVG that misplacing passes, having zero ball control and a complete inability to shoot, are qualities you want in a captain and lone striker.
Its gone way beyond a joke, but the harsh reality is that the only thing that will keep this has-been out of the starting XI is injury... And harsh as I am, I'd never wish a player* injured.

* Luis Suarez & John Terry aside!

5554~~~
You are right as he is no doubt a well respected and liked player but surely the buck will stop by the end of this season if his performances don't pick up, which quiet honestly I do not believe they will, which is sad but that's the life of a footballer especially one who starts so young. Just hope he is off to pastures new or just happy to be a player on the bench and earning a lot less money able to continue the chase for Bobs record..

5555~~~
Come on, no one gets that? The infamous Paul Scholes Quotes.

5556~~~
It seems evident to me that time is running out for Rooney, LVG has been switching him around so much in the last few weeks that he's clearly not happy with his contribution. To be fair to Rooney, I'm not even sure I can fault his effort, it's just clear that his body is starting to give up on him. It's shocking to see how much pace he has lost when I watch old videos of him at Everton.

5557~~~
Needs dropping desperately.

Must have a contractual clause or be blackmailing somebody. Aside from that my only hope is perhaps LvG wanted to get through this month of bigger games before making the changes, giving the younger/newer guys a slightly easier run of things to start without him. Hopefully after the Derby he'll get dropped as we don't then hit a big team (at least in the Prem) until Dec 28th.

As for supporting him as mentioned earlier, he has been. Lets face it, Rooney's control, short passing, long shots and mobility have been piss poor for 3 seasons now. He's got by on his long game, tap-ins (still has fairly decent positioning) and been let off alot because of his changing roles, which to be honest, should never really be an excuse for "world class" players. He's been supported plenty, but there comes a time when the team comes first, and if were going to climb out this 2-3 year rut, we cant be carrying players because of long service.

As for his speed and being placed high in the list, thats down to top speeds, not general quickness. The difference being, Bale and co hit 30mph in bare seconds and blow people away. Rooney takes 80 yards to reach speed. He does have good top speed, he just takes so long to reach it he only does so about once a season on a full pitch counter, and at the end he's almost falling over himself. Over 5-20 yards he's laughably immobile.

5558~~~
Ferguson's culling of Keane was brutal, but it was so necessary. I feel the same is needed here too.

5559~~~
We are a football club, first and foremost. Our on pitch performances should drive everything else.

5560~~~
Van Gaal isn't stupid. I think there is an element of biding his time before pulling the trigger.

It's easy to sit on an internet forum and call for Rooney to be dropped, but dropping your captain, the captain of England and club posterboy, in mid-October is a massive decision that will have ramifications, for good or bad.

This is Van Gaal's last job and he doesn't want to lose it. When he feels the time is right then Rooney is gone, and I think that time will come sooner rather than later.

5561~~~
Rooney wont be here next season if he doesn't score 25 goals.

5562~~~
shit if fergie was here rooney would have been off. fergie didn't feck about in dealing with players.

what a great time to sell him

5563~~~

5564~~~
Should have been sold yes, but Moyes didn't have the balls. TBH I don't care about the past, he needs to go after this season.

5565~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> my response was at 6am in the morning, forgive me.

5566~~~
Are we really still discussing him?  He has been rubbish and will only get worse after another off season of chips, beers and fags.  He is the biggest reason we are toothless because we are always trying to fit him into our system when he is well past it.

5567~~~
Absolutely and it's bonkers for people to even think that any player gets to play simply because we sell a lot of shirts with that name on the back. This club is not run by complete fecking idiots.

5568~~~
Apparently Memphis has sold a high number of shirts since he got here..He wasnt really a big star before he arrived..Perform well and United can make you a megastar..This is one thing I have always said:  Its not a coincidence that the two most marketable stars in football in the last 25 years(and arguably ever) both made their names at United. Beckham and Ronaldo. The marketing department will know that too.

5569~~~
Just before the second half started, I saw Fellaini warming up so I was wondering who he was coming on for. Surely an attacking player since I expectedFellaini to play high up the pitch. Then I say Herrera, so it wasn't him, I saw Martial, it wasn't him also, then Lingard. I then  started to get excited, HE SUBBED OFF ROONEY! HE SUBBED OFF THE CAPTAIN! Then I saw Schweinsteiger's name come up on the board. I was fecking gutted.

5570~~~
Schweinsteiger had a poor half tbf

5571~~~
I know. I was just desperate for the My captain must always play to be bullshit.

5572~~~
You lot are a bit laughable at times. Anytime Rooney misplaces a pass people go on about how poor he is and how he should be dropped. Yet when he does something good you lot don't mention it. You're blinded by anything good he does because of the hate most of you have for him. I came on here after the Everton match and you would have thought he was terrible in this game by what some were saying.

Now I would much rather see Martial upfront with rather Memphis on the left or Rooney on the left but some of the stuff people say now has no logic. I don't think some actually analyse the game. People will be blind to to the bad things our others players do but will criticise Rooney as soon as he fails to complete a pass. As I said before I would rather not see him upfront right now but you lot go way over the top.

There's hardly any rationale behind some of the things people say. He is the main scapegoat right now. He will get the blame for everything. What annoys me more than anything is those that truly what him to play badly so they can prove some sort of point or just to see him dropped.

5573~~~
Some of the past supposed  CAF scapeoats include Cleverly and Jonny Evans ...funnily both are long gone..perhaps, just perhaps people are watching him poorly regularly and are discussing his performances in the Wayne Rooney perfomance thread.

I find it quite funny that people go on this agenda driven talks, almost to divert attention. if you think he is playing well, then defend the performances, this is a performance discussion thread after all. Not claim people have an agenda. People just do not like a poorly performing player starting every game, probably due to certain standards they hold for our players. <b>So what is your opinion on his performances then ? </b>

5574~~~
Great post and I believe it's van gaals actual thought process at th moment.

5575~~~
On the whole this season? He has been poor. He should have been dropped or shifted to the left so Martial can play upfront in my opinion. But I don't think he's completely useless as a lot say and I don't think he's been terrible in all the games he has played as someone would make you believe. 

I don't think he should start just because he's captain but it should be based on performances. I think Rooney does some good in matches but I would agree he's been poor on the whole. Divert attention... from what? I said in that post I think he should be dropped or moved to the left.

5576~~~
Name your charity <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Believe me, if he's not injured or suspended he will play in every game.

5577~~~
From what you just said. Should a Man Utd captain and highest paid player be spoken of in those terms. He should be inspiring the team with his performances. 
Our captain should not be seen as not being completely useless.

5578~~~
Looked a bit lost at times last night but not his worst game.

Still it must be galling for him to watch Martial so at ease with his finishing (that header is stupidly good) with how he's struggling at the moment.

5579~~~
I'm with you on this one tbh

5580~~~
True, He was good against a pub side quality Brugge, a championship ipswich and Everton. Every other time he has played this season he has been dire.

5581~~~
Can't see it. Unless he has a couple of Aston Villa level of shitness performances.

5582~~~
A taker!

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.charitychoice.co.uk/manchester-carers-forum-16870" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.charitychoice.co.uk/manchester-carers-forum-16870</a>

Ten quid. Obviously if he starts scoring he's not getting dropped but feck it no caveats from me. I'm saying he's benched before the end of November. If he bags a load of goals and doesn't get dropped I'll happily stump up a tenner.

5583~~~
He hit his peak physically at a very young age I think, he was already a grown man when he was a teenager. He should be in the prime of his career right now and terrorizing defenses, but instead he's having almost zero impact on games and becoming a detriment to the overall performance of the team.

It's sad to see. LVG should give him a couple of games off and see what it does to possibly rejuvenate him, but we all know that's not going to happen.

Though I do believe he has tremendous leadership qualities and is an important figure in the dressing room - all of the players seem to really like him and respect him. Within LVG's philosophy those types of qualities are very important to him, which is why I think Rooney will always be in the team. Also from a tactical standpoint, he does press well and keeps the forward line disciplined - which LVG obviously loves even more.

5584~~~
I was so upset watching the first half last night that I almost turned the tele off, which I haven't done during a United game in ages (not even during the shambolic 3.0 defeat at Arsenal). I could see straight away that there was no movement up front and that the ball kept having to go sideways and backwards because there was no threat from our striker, allowing CSKA to double up on Martial and press us back into our own half when we had the ball. Rooney not only allows teams to adopt this strategy because he has no real pace to speak of any more, he also contributes to the problem by constantly coming towards the ball and never using what little pace he does have left to spin off defenders and run in behind. It's like watching Falcao these days. Both players are spent.

The pundits don't want to say it because they all know and revere Wayne Rooney, but they all identified the lack of movement and pace up front without directly pointing the finger at the one man responsible. Contrast those comments with the comments we, as the fans, and pundits have all made during and after games when we've played with Martial as the no.9. Because Martial stretches the game with his pace and great feet, teams have to give up space to our more creative players, like Herrera and Mata, in those pockets between the midfield and defence otherwise Martial's running behind and in on goal. Rooney backs up our play and kills our fluidity.

5585~~~
See the difference is in the standards that we hold him as our captain, talisman and highest paid player, not being useless is way too little a base to guarantee someone the 'first name on the team' status. We shouldn't pay someone up to 300k a week and make 'not being terrible or useless' the defining standard, that's a waste of resources and we could be using half of that to pay someone to do what we expect from him. Either he plays to a standard befitting a 300k player or fecks off, simple as, because there is no middle ground when you are paying someone that much.
That is exactly what you attempted, putting forward an anti Rooney agenda as the reason why he is being criticized for his efforts so that we discuss the supposed agenda when the issue is quite clear, we should be getting more from him.

5586~~~
Still don't understand how people can defend him. 

Absolute dross.

5587~~~
The media will still build him up in hopes that he will come good and inspire England in the summer. They are of course beneficiaries of his form picking up and the media could care less about United's performances whilst he goes on with his search for resembling top level footballer again. (Of course excluding former United players, but they are all his mates) After that tournament, I believe we'll see a more neutral assessment of his performances. 
I see nothing in his game that makes me think he'll improve to the required level of a Manchester United starting player, let alone our star and highest paid player. We'll have to endure the lack of criticism until he's actually playing for a team they support, England, and then I believe his cover will be blown.
It's getting to a ridiculous level now, the favoritism he's getting from van Gaal, I don't think I've ever been so jaded and cynical about our own player and the situation he represents. We won't reach our full potential as a club whilst the fast declining Rooney is an ever present fixture in our side. It is as simple as that for me, but I feel so little hope about this situation changing in the season ahead. 
I don't want to be bashing him, I loved him once as a player and I would be pleased for him to break our goalscoring record (couldn't care less really who holds it), but he's just so obviously fallen off that I can't believe this is allowed to go on.

5588~~~
I don't think Falcao was completely useless for us either..but can a club as big as United afford to have players that are playing just above completely useless especially with that player being captain and talisman?  

He's not been terrible in every game, anyone who says that is lying. But collectively looking at his season, his performances have been quite bad. What irks people further is that he never gets dropped. A lot of people would have much less of a problem with Rooney if he was deservingly sitting on the bench, with a cameo here and there. But to see him in the team week in week out serving dross annoys a lot of us. Its not us making him a scapegoat, seeing as people have been complaining about his performances, even when the team itself has been performing relatively well. The pointing out of an agenda just serves to divert from the main issue at hand, people don't want to see Rooney in the team because his performances don't warrant it, just like they wanted him in the team all the time in the past when his performances warranted it.

5589~~~
I guess we shouldn't expect any better from Jamie Jackson but...f*cking hell:

<i><b>Wayne Rooney at 30: a golden goalscorer but always a team player</b></i>:

5590~~~
Jackson might be right about some thing there. His record his great, he's Englands top goal scorer. But what good is that for us at the minute? He's shite now and that is all that matters to me because my team has titles to fight for and we are fighting with a handicap.

5591~~~
Away to Leicester on the 28th then. He has 7 games to find some form and start scoring on a regular basis.

5592~~~
I've tried to support Rooney this season but it's just not happening for him. He really looks done.

5593~~~
The cb didnt habe to do anything.  Just stand there.  Rooney wont cause a problem unless they're down a goal and pushing up. That alone changes the whole balance of the team,  no wonder we cant find space to pass.  He's clogging up the whole am position by offering nothing and not being a threat

5594~~~
That's probably the harshest point, our opponents don't care about him and have no respect for his abilities. Memphis and Martial have been closely marked while Rooney is given total freedom.

5595~~~
Agreed 100%.

We saw recently that he was "injured" for England's 2 games, yet, before the 2nd game even took place, he declared himself fit for the next MUFC game.
I think Hodgson realised that Rooney was in bad form, so dropped him.
LVG doesn't want to do the same, though.

And for those suggesting that Rooney is being made the scapegoat: This is not true. He is one of the highest paid players in World soccer. He is our captain. He is undroppable. He does not need to prove his match rhythm. He is the first name which goes on the team sheet. 
Given all of the above, I expect him to be one of our best players...not one of our worst. Am I asking too much?

5596~~~
I dont think ours care either.  They only pass to him when they literally have no other option.  Mostly it's sideways even back to darmian or shaw. They're pro they know he's that bad.  But he's a senior figurehead afterall and most of our best players are newcomers and probably wont want to stir drama

5597~~~
I can see this getting brutal by the end of the season. When our fans start to groan every time he loses the ball through a poor pass, groan when he misses a simple chance, groan when every heavy touch results in lost possession. It would already be happening at many clubs around the world and despite how loyal our fans are (see Moyes), they'll come a point where frustration boils over.

My betting is an important fixture Feb/March.

5598~~~
Am in the same boat. Been so used to people that have been put off by him making any small thing into a big thing, even though with my own eyes I was seeing pure crap from him this season, I end up thinking he wasn't that bad because so many people were talking about how bad he was playing. But, have pretty much reached the point of joining in with the masses and begging for him to get dropped. 

Though I do wonder who does deserve to play ahead of him. Depay does not to me because he seems a lot worse off and even though he needs to be given time, right now we are in a crunch of games that even though Rooney is dross, Depay is even more so. Maybe after the City game, LVG can look to move Martial back to the middle and give the likes of Young/Depay/Lingard a shot on the left.

5599~~~
As long as Wayne Rooney is a starting striker for United, we won't be winning anything. He's simply not good enough anymore.

Thats the painful, but obvious, truth.

5600~~~
I agree completely, if LVG has anything about him he will offload Rooney in the summer, RVP and falcao were dumped because they weren't offering much, weren't worth their wages and best days were behind them. All of that is true for Rooney and he should be treated exactly the same.

5601~~~
I tend to agree. I think he should be dropped and as I said on a whole this season he has been poor. I understand why some are getting annoyed because even I'm annoyed that he isn't getting dropped despite poor form. 
The only reason why I brought up the agenda thing is because people have been unfairly criticising him ever since the transfer request and I think there's a bit of that in the criticism he is receiving from some and not all obviously. 
As I've said he deserves criticism for the way he's playing right now but I have an issue when people overlook any thing good he does on the pitch then will jump on him the first time he misplaces a pass. Plus the worse is people that are willing him to fail, that's my biggest issue. 

For the last time I think he deserves criticism because he's been poor on a whole but some of the things people say, just doesn't sit right with me. After all he is still our player.

5602~~~
In the Everton game he lost the ball easily over 5 times. Not super intense pressing or in awkward tight spaces but generally open-ish play. He does this regularly AND can't control a ball without doing something productive and has no movement towards OR off the ball. 

I don't think you realise how detrimental that is to a TEAM game. A good pass is equally as important as a player, who recognises the run/ability to receive it. The criticism of Rooney is not reactionary or exaggerated. He's literally been giving almost every opportunity and support to find his form/game but he's still dire. Position changes, players accomendating him, non-stop minutes, shielded criticism and public support from media, manager, players etc. 

Sure you can criticise LVG's tactic but that is mutually exclusive to Rooney's form. People are nott saying things because he's been bad for a month or two, he's been bad over a year.

5603~~~
If Rooney is past it, then he is past it, it's one thing to suggest he should move on or be relegated to the bench. It's another to see the disrespectful drivel that is spewed by a bunch of neckbeards on this website.

It's absolutely disgusting to see the hateful, vitriolic bullshit that a large number of people spew out here. Whatever your feelings are about the business side here and Rooney angling for better contracts, the guy has been a warrior for United. He has played wherever he had to play to best support the club, often to the detriment of his own statistics. He's a club legend, one of the best to ever play for United and the people that are bashing him are fecking disgraceful.

5604~~~
Starting to believe it's a commercial thing now at this stage....

"Ohhhhh WAYNE ROONEY!!!! He has scored the most amount of goals in a Manchester derby! What a hero!!!...Oh England's brave Wayne Rooney!!"
Aguero is about 1 or 2 goals behind him, in such a short amount of time and it's never mentioned....Bizarre...

"Oh he loves scoring against United"
"He's scored the most in a derby hasn't he Martin?!"
"You're hanging on by a thread Gary....A Rooney thread!"

Anyways, he's done compared to what he was

5605~~~
It's absolutely reactionary and it absolutely is an overreaction. Rooney is catching disproportionate stick compared to anyone else. Our problem this season hasn't even been at the striker position. Has Rooney been good? No. Has he been as bad as people say? I honestly can't answer that and neither can you, why? He has gotten almost ZERO quality service all season. The fact Martial has done well despite that is a testament to the talent Martial looks to be. However, you can't blame a guy who has had virtually no quality service.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jduZjsWdQhU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Do you have any idea who kept that goal alive? You can probably guess since this is a Rooney thread. The pass out to Martial? Guess who it came from. Wayne Rooney. The pass into Rooney? Was a sloppy, high ball that was dumped into him. He controlled it, in traffic and played it out, keeping the move alive and seconds later a cross comes in and we score. How many people commented on that in the match day thread? Two people. Two people commented that Rooney helped save the move that led to our second goal. Did he get any credit for it? Not really. He did get shit on the remainder of the match however!

5606~~~
Well said Sir. I feel ashamed to be associated with the majority of posters on here.

5607~~~
True and well put buddy

5608~~~
I think a lot of the anger is justified but aimed at the wrong person. It should be lvg getting it for his refusal to bench Rooney, it's not like the bloke is going to say sorry boss, I'm not going to start. Secondly seeing as how his best performance of the season came after a 10 day break how has lvg not realised Rooney can't play two games a week every other week any more. Even if this decline is perminant and the plan is to get rid in the summer by rotating and resting him we would probably get a more productive and effective Rooney than running him into the ground.

5609~~~
It's not like we're creating plethora of chances, no, but he's still had his and still usually failed to score them miserably. Take the Tottenham match for example, the goal he failed to score exemplified that he's either in a huge form crisis or simply (and more likely) simply done as a striker (footballer?) at the very top level and we were yet to find out.

You've highlighted two things he's done right in this match, fine, but Everton match was one of his better matches this season in the league, if not the best. On a flipside you could make a point that he should've scored his second when he was going 1v1 with Howard but Jagielka (who's by no means a sprinter) caught with him.

Out of all matches he's played this season he's had maybe 3-4 matches where you could call him from average to good. In the rest it's hard to label him anything other than shit and in most cases our worst player on the pitch. Given that 1) he's our captain 2) he's our highest paid player 3) he's meant to drag the team (up, not down as he does nowadays) it gets pretty problematic not to blame him. What's even more problematic is that our manager has no balls and is afraid of dropping him and now on top of that we're shunting our second best attacking player this season out to the wing in order to accomodate Rooney there.

5610~~~
so the latest excuse is.........he needs pace around him.

5611~~~
The likes of Scholes, G Nev and Rio hanging out of his arse and providing him with excuse after excuse after excuse whilst criticising every player that wasn’t a United playing during their time is almost as awkward to watch as another laboured, slow and clumbersome Wayne Rooney performance.


All three continue to talk about pace, power, inventory, attacking intent, risk taking, beating man, crisp forward passing, chance creation, movement etc etc etc


Isnt that exactly what a modern attacking player provides??


Although Rooney isnt incapable (or hasn’t shown otherwise for a year) of providing this he is the one who is offered the excuses.  Where ever he’s played the excuse is he should be played elsewhere.  Even the Arsenal game, Memphis was (quite rightly) slaughtered where as Rooney was defended at every possible opportunity despite allowing Cazorla to run the game.


Martial plays is moved out of position to accommodate rooney yet he still gets a goal and troubles defenders.  Mata is played wide and despite his lack of pace (and that of those around him) scores goals and creates chances.  Ander Herrera plays the number 10 makes chances, moves the ball quickly and scores goals.


Play inform players in their best positions regardless of age, salary experience etc and we have a squad to compete for the league.


Continue shunting players into foreign positions just to try to find a place for Rooney to look decent (lets face it thats all he was against everton – despite it being by far his best performance of the season) and we’ll be 3/4th and some way off the top 2 again.

5612~~~
1. Wow. Can't believe that excuse is being made still when it comes to Rooney. We might not have the midfield we once had but are you seriously blaming his shit performances on lack of service?! Fact is, he can't control a ball anymore (and by that I don't mean every single ball he receives), he's slow, lethargic and he barely gets into good positions (Everton match was very positive in that regard). Don't forget he's virtually unable to beat a man anymore. He might still possess a high top speed but his lack of acceleration is seriously harming his play. The thing is, everyone would love to see him back to his old best, but let's realise it, that will never happen. Such has the decline of Wayne Rooney been. It's a shame that the abuse gets directed at him (I'm guilty of this) when it's not his fault but LvG's, but as long as LvG continue to select no matter how many times he's one of the worst players on the pitch, the more abuse he will get. And that happened to the likes of Gibson and Evans too. They might not have the United CV Rooney has, but atleast they aren't seen as the top dog in terms of status and contract. And back then we could actually afford to carry lesser players because of the other players we had. Now it's glaringly obvious that we need a talisman upfront but instead we get a legend way past his expiry date. 


2. The pass out to Martial came from Bastian. Not a particular good pass I must add. Yes Rooney controlled the ball under pressure when it was played to him (such accomplishment!). He then passed it backwards to Schneiderlin who squared to Bastian who in turn directed it wide out to Martial. I'll make sure I'll be on the lookout for some more genius Rooney involvements in the coming matches. And I'll be the first to praise Rooney if he manages to complete a pass under pressure.

5613~~~
Based on what?  his pace? his movement?  his finishing?  his touch and ability to hold the ball up?

Why anybody in there right mind would move martial from centre forward to wide right to accommodate Wayne Rooney is absolutely beyond me.

Managala and Ottamendi will be praying he plays up top on sunday

5614~~~
For what uts worth, mitten says he ll be dropped soon if he doesnt improve and Lvg is thinking about playing herrera behind martial.

5615~~~
Martial looking dangerous and threatening up front has thrown the service excuse out of the window. It's nonsense.

5616~~~
1. Plays as a striker for five matches without contributing anything. "I think his best position is no.10".
2. Plays five matches as a no.10 without contributing. "Would like to see him get a run of games as a striker". 
3. Plays another four matches as a striker before he finally scores. "Proves his critics wrong. Shows he's still a class player". 
4. Next two matches he's back to his usual "retirement-worthy" level. "He lost a bit of pace, but he can still deliver those fantastic passes in a midfield role". 
5. Ends of being our worst player after a few games in midfield. "He s constantly being played out of position". 
6. "No matter where you play him, he will still work his socks off". That's true – at a pace of -0,65mph. But he still works his socks off!
7. Back in a striker role, but he still underperforms. "He gets no service. On top of that, we need more Englishmen around him as he can't understand those Spanish guys."

Rinse repeat.

5617~~~
Potentially lethal if you ask me.

5618~~~
Harsh but accurate <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

what can you do but laugh? Never has one player had so many excuses made

5620~~~
if this is true, and I hope to god there is a shred of truth in it. It would probably do Rooney the world of good and give him something to prove again

5621~~~
Absolutley bang on.
The frustrating aspect is for the first time in years with have a strong, quick and clinical number 9 who comes in and despite no pace around him, the team being slow in the build up, few chances created etc etc he scores goals, looks a threat and is clinical infront of goal.  What do we do with him?????? Move him wide left!!!!  Pathetic!!

5622~~~
I'm sure that he is close to be benched and it will be the end of his career at United.

5623~~~
Please link to the article?

5624~~~
Good to hear and it's going to happen sooner rather than later as there is no sign of him recapturing some form.

I really do think this is the beginning of the end for him at United and that it will happen very quickly

I'd rather have Tom Cleverly in center mid than our Wayne up front. That's how bad he's got.

5627~~~
I don't know why but it's like he's forgotten how to move in the box and create space. He runs in straight lines and when inside the box he Just stands there with his back to goal, and really struggled to shield the ball.

It's like night and day compared to when he was a few years younger.

5628~~~
His movement has never been great when compared to real number 9’s.  He’s also very selfish in his movement.  If he does make a run / movement its with the intent of him getting on the end of it.  You’l never see him making an overlap or any type of movement to create for others.


He’s doing a brilliant job of proving wrong the statement.....”you don’t become a bad player over night”

One of the best United has ever had? Do you mean top 10 by that or top 50? He's been class but he hasnt been at the very top in his position for more than 2 seasons. He's been outstanding for many seasons in a row, but in terms of real peak he isnt close to my too 10 even.

5631~~~
Thanks.

5632~~~
If he is going to drop him, I don't think it'll be for this game. We can only hope he comes up with a moment like that overhead kick..he was playing terribly in that game before that moment as well.

5633~~~
Ouch

5634~~~
Im torn, i want him to do well and scores, but if he scores he'll play even longer and every goal he scores buy him an extra 10 games of being shite and ruining the team. 

It's like last year under moyes,  would love to finish 4th and the cl,  but that would mean 6 years of moyes... 

A very unpleasant dillema i tell you. 

I'd rather he play well and no goal rather than an odd goal against lesser team and not playing well. 

Off course playing well and scoring is what we all want him to,  but 18mths is too long for purple patches,  i fear that he's finished this time and it's not just form. He's like a bouncing ball, his ceiling is getting lower with every dead cat bounce he makes

5635~~~
A rebuttal to that Jamie Jackson article that was nothing but drivel.

5636~~~
Hardly "nothing but drivel". 

Even with all the nit-picking over stats at the end of his career he'll up there with Rooney and Henry in terms of PL goals and has a good chance of finishing second to Giggs in the most PL assists ever table. That's a remarkable achievement which is getting lost in all the tedious fecking hating over the bad form he's going through for a while now.

It's also worth bearing in mind that he wouldn't be the only player to have a bad season or two, around the big three oh, only to reinvent themselves and remain productive at the highest level for another few seasons after that. I really hope that happens, if only to so he can ram all the comments of the United fans gleefully declaring him finished at 29 years old right back up their fecking holes.

5637~~~
It was overly romantic nonsensical drivel. It's not even a fair comparison ffs. To base an article off of that is ridiculous and shoddy journalism. And that's not even nit picking stats. It's just a misrepresentation of stats. If you want to make comparisons of where Rooney is at at the same age as Shearer and Henry at least make it truthful! That should be the bare minimum for a stats based piece, surely?

Honestly Pogue - do you really think we'll see the Rooney we saw 04-10?

5638~~~
No chance. Even if he does become an important player for us he'll have to reinvent his game and become a different type of player to what he was in his youth. In the same way that the 30+ Giggys didn't go flying down the wings any more. I'm thinking (hoping?) that his recent woes are part of this process and that he'll have an Indian summer once he's refined his game to adapt to his waning physicality. Might be a pipe dream, though. Time will tell. He may have a physique that ages badly but he's always been a very intelligent footballer, which is a big help for any player aspiring to have a long career at the highest level.

5639~~~
There was a spell, I think when he was about 38, when Giggs suddenly started being able to beat players again. It was weird. The game that sticks out was one against Man City where he absolutely bullied their right back for a good 45-60 minutes.

5640~~~
Yeah, true. I remember that. I was mainly thinking of the "Sack Fergie, Sell Giggs" era when he'd lost a yard of pace, couldn't get away from defenders and looked like he might be finished. Probably a very similar age then to what Rooney is now.

Basically, I'm really hoping Rooney takes up yoga!

5641~~~
30 today!

<span style="color: #ffffff">Lol</span>

5642~~~
Firstly I agree with others that yes absolutely LVG should get criticism for his continued insistence on playing Rooney i.e not giving him the best chance to make an impact (off the bench/rested for a game) AND tactics. I've always said this and I'm pretty sure most others have too.

That ends there.

For me, performance on the pitch is the only thing I care about (you know unless they're a super cnut off the pitch) so the contract/transfer/quotes saga don't affect my opinion of him at all when I'm watching the game.

So now we can judge him purely on performance on the pitch. Is he a bad player? No if you was to compare him to other players in the premier league. Is he arguably Utd's worse player? Yes, yes and yes.

You could argue Memphis, Darmian, Valencia, Fellani and Young have been the ones consistently 'worse' (this is me stretching it to make it fair and give you an indiction of my rational thinking). However, they can all be 'excused' or have things put into context because new league, young/inexperience, not a lot of game time and being asked to played out of positon.

They have all got criticism and stick whenever they have performed badly but they've all been playing very limited minutes. Rooney does not get disportionate stick, he's get consistent criticism (which is completely justified) and that is more apparent because he plays every single game of every single minute.

What does 'quality service mean'? If you mean fantastic balls crossed into the box every 5 mins, defence splitting 1-on-1s through balls, square balls for tap-ins etc, then yes I'd agreed with you that Rooney hasn't received this. However, this isn't the 90's/00's anymore and although with the talent in our team, we should be expecting to be creating those sort of chances consistently, it should have no bearing on how we judge him because there are many other things he can do/provide.

Like what? Making runs off and towards the ball, receiving the ball in tight spaces/back to defender, playing 1-2s, attacking the channels to force the space/pass, beating a man himself etc etc. For every 1 thing of these he does 'well', he fails 3-4 of them. How can this be a Utd standard player?

I don't care about what he did in the past or am hoping he recaptures his early youth explosiveness, I simply ask for a team player, who can make effective plays on his own merits; is that a big ask?

5643~~~
ESPN FC publish a piece on his decline under the headline "Remembering Rooney at His Best". A career eulogy on his 30th birthday.

5644~~~
Not going to happen.

Physically shot? Right, focus on the other sides of your game and re-invent yourself.

But wait..

Rooney's all round play is pretty average if not, downright shite (passing, first touch, movement, even leadership).

So no, it's very unlikely that's on the cards but hey, don't let any of that evidence get in the way of the dream of him shoving it all back in our faces.

5645~~~
Nailed it.

5646~~~
15/16 may in the end be a lost season for Rooney and it's clear that it's all down to a lack of fitness.  The man has played 700 games for club and country, very few of those games for less than 90 minutes.  And he just doesn't take care of his body the way Beckham, Scholes, Giggs, Keane and Ronaldo did (does). 

The answer is that he has to play fewer games this season and use his time between games to concentrate on attaining genuine top fitness for a professional footballer.  Two matches a week for him right nowi is complete madness and will result in continued dire play and eventually in a significant injury.  Louis can gear up for a treble run next season by getting Rooney fit this season.  We've got the squad to put on a great show week after week without Rooney twice a week.

There's no defense for his current horrid form.  It's embarrassing.  But Roo hasn't forgotten how to play football.  He just needs to re-energize his mind and body.  He owes it to the club to acknowledge this and take the time he needs to pull himself together.  He can buy himself two more great seasons with us if uses this season wisely.

5647~~~
Mate. You missed the part where other players either have to play out of their position or get benched because of "Captain always play".
8/10 <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

5648~~~
To be fair, one argument would be that he brings leadership to the pitch. He is always pulling the strings, calling out to his teammates - retaining shape, pressing efficiently and maintaining discipline. He is vocal with referees, and is one of the few players who ups his work rate and desire (to whatever sad results) when the score is against us. No other player can replace that.

A starting lineup of Martial in front of Mata, Herrera and Depay would look great on paper - but who's the leader there? Who brings the mental aspect into the game? Martial is a teenager. Mata is too nice, Herrera isn't assured of a starting place and needs to be pulled back when pressing or calmed down when tackling, and Depay is 21 and off form and new to the league.

Smalling looks promising as a future captain, though this is his first season where he is performing at such a brilliant level, but you need a leader up front, too. One would think Schweini can provide the leadership further down the pitch, but he is still new to the dressing room, is the first German in a United team, isn't guaranteed 90 minutes every game or even a start every game, and still needs games under his belt. Maybe next season.

I am in the #dropRooney camp, don't get me wrong. Just providing counter arguments.

Edit: Just for reference, I'm listing out players who I think bring leadership in attack at other top teams, be it in terms of leading by inspirational example, or simply providing the maturity and calmness (or the fire, when necessary) for others to bounce off. 
Arsenal: Sanchez
City: Aguero, Silva, Yaya
Chelsea: Costa, Hazard
Bayern: Muller, Vidal
Barca: Mess, Neymar
Real: Ronaldo, Benzema
PSG: Zlatan, Cavani

5649~~~
The golden standard for praising Rooney now is he managed to control a high ball under pressure during the build up to a goal that was provided by a superb cross from Rojo.

Just let that sink in.


Now you can come to the conclusion: he's shit.

5650~~~
..What? 

He doesn't do any of that.

5651~~~

Watch the gifs in that lengthy post. :P

5652~~~
His leadership qualities are overstated. You seriously cannot be telling me that it is enough to compensate for the poor quality of his football.

5653~~~
I am saying he is the only leader we have on the business end of the pitch. And I don't think they are overstated. Underrated, more like.
But I agree, it doesn't compensate for the shit he doles out every week these days.

5654~~~
What, he has passed 30? Time to head out to the retirement home in the States old guy.

5655~~~
Can still see zero quality service BS being spouted in this thread. Martial has proven its bullshit. Martial doesn't have two heads. Martial was looking our most dangerous player with the same service. Rooney was still poor when he dropped to the No 10 position. 
Some have given examples of players that have gone on to reinvent themselves, Giggs being the major one. First, those kind of players are in the minority. Second, we can't afford to wait for him to reinvent himself. It's not as if his poor form just started this season also. This team can't carry passengers for a sustained period. I trust LVG to make a judgement at the end of the season concerning him.

5656~~~
And rightly so. He is the club captain, the highest profile United player, on huge wages  who plays every minute when fit despite being poor this season.

5657~~~
You're either blind or ignorant.  Go ahead clip out everytime he touches the ball in that game and we can count together how many pub player passes he make. 

You choose the best of him and discounted the rest.

He's not going to shove anything down anyone's throats at all..its the same thing you see when other great players have shown great decline in the past, their fans holding on to the diminishing hope that somehow , anyhow, they will turn it around and go back to whatever great level they once showed.

Just go to the Falcao and RVP threads, they were still people saying similar things even near the end of the  last season. Shevchenko, Torres too when it happened to them, people just cant seem to comprehend that their hero is no longer what he once was, in the face of insurmountable evidence. Its a coping mechanism, at this point whatever supposed level Rooney will get back to simply isn't good enough for a club of our stature. His perfomances almost every week tell that better than I ever could.

5659~~~
He's the worst of the lot of that front four this season, so he is certainly not leading by example, we need that more than him being vocal.

5660~~~
What I was thinking. If I was one of our other attackers on he end of a Rooney rant, I would give him a piece of my mind right here on the pitch.

5661~~~
Would get dirty very quickly, and you would just get yourself dropped. 

Deep down,even Rooney knows he's playing crap. I wouldnt risk my spot as a player to do that. He's far too protected at the club. Its all politics, but sometimes you have to choose your battles. I'd praise his long balls instead. 

"Nice one captain, best side to side passes I have seen in a while"

5662~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's worse.

5663~~~
But subtle.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>


But it could possibly encourage even more of them.

5664~~~
Happy 30th birthday Legend!

5665~~~
Shearer had an extra 6 games per season for a long time, too.

Nonetheless, Shearer's scoring record is incredible. Banging them in way into his thirties.

5666~~~
That's a weird logic. You're implying that the forwards don't see enough of the midfield to be influenced by them. 


Good job Rooney is there to tell them what to do, Schweinsteiger and Carrick's letters, phone calls and emails keep getting intercepted by the opposition.

5667~~~
I'm interested in what the Rooney haters think we should do with him. Let's assume he doesn't get any better than this, which I grant you isn't very good. We strip him of the captaincy and put him on the bench? OK. Then he sits there for the next 3 years on a very big contract sewing dissent and sapping morale. So we have to pay out his contract to stop a PR disaster involving the England captain, and he goes somewhere else on a free.

Well maybe that's what it will come to, but it's such an extreme thing to do, we have to give him every chance to show that he can get his form back first. He is only 29 after all. Also Depay is the one who would force him out of the first 11 and he's not ready. So I think Rooney gets the season to prove himself.

I would add that I don't think Valencia or Carrick or Fellaini are really much better that Rooney at what they do at the moment. Some people are just against him because of his Knutish behaviour a few years back. That's fair enough but won't be a factor in LVG's thinking.

5668~~~
It's his stupid contract and it's our fault. At the time he was given that, his performances were never worthy of it. He's been on the decline physically since 2010 (despite his numbers in 2011-12), so it was just daft from the club. Currently he's keeping the likes of Herrera out of the side and shifting Martial (a much more effective striker) on the left side.

It will be a real tender moment for the club because of all that but it <b>HAS</b> to be done. It's spineless not to.

5669~~~
Well all of them have been dropped recently but when Rooney plays poorly he is just given another position at the expense of someone else. I really could care less about his transfer request anymore, it's just a player that isn't good enough to warrant his undroppable status.

5670~~~
I don't like how you use the term "Rooney Haters" like those of us who want him gone or benched at least have some personal vendetta.

5671~~~
Season to prove himself. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

When did he become 18 again?

5672~~~
I think he has until January. LVG will buy another attacking player, of that I am sure.

5673~~~
Does it have to be that way? Not everyone is a hater, and it invalidates any response that one would give while already being classed as a hater. If that was true, then the 95% of the Caf would qualify as such. 

The solution is simple: Sell him, you've hit the nail on the head why we dont really have any other choice. He'll sulk if he where dropped, so we'll have to get rid of that element . 

With him in the side, we will most likely fail to win trophies, especially as the focal core and  that costs us money. So we are going to lose money either way. We've taken a massive hit on ADM, we can absorb one more hit. Financially, especially with the new premier league deal, we can afford too. 

As for Valencia and Fellaini. Valencia has been decent when he has played, and Fellaini has hardly played (one of the consequences of playing in the captain's position, and having Herrera ahead of him). They are just easy targets. 

Its not Depay that will force him out of the team, nothing is stopping us from going out and improving ourselves, and to get back to the top we will have to sign better quality players. What you want us to do is to settle, but if we have serious ambitions of winning anything in future, we have to make this hard decisions. It was a hallmark of Fergie's regenerations of his squad, with Bruce, Ince , Keane  examples of players brutally forced out for the good of the club.

5674~~~
Happy 30th birthday to the legend!

5675~~~
Loaded phrase I agree. Rooney critics then.

5676~~~
I'd love to sell him to be honest. I'd give him away if it were possible. But the problem is that no-one will pay such absurd wages and therefore I suspect he will see out his contract. We're kind of stuck with him. Di Maria we were able to recoup a big chunk of his transfer fee and he wanted to go. This is much harder.

It's really Moyes legacy for being weak and giving him a new contract in the first place for the sake of expediency, after SAF had correctly put him on the path marked 'exit'. I really think our best bet is to give him enough time to recover form or establish beyond all doubt that he's not good enough to play for us any more. Then hopefully his pride will send him to join Slippy G and Lampard in the sunset home for famous has beens.

5677~~~
But Gerrard only wanted to leave after he was benched..from the quotes in his biography..he couldnt stand being a sub and that is when pride stepped in. Had he been playing every game , he'd still be at Liverpool. They was that quote where he said that he had to stop himself from assaulting Rodgers after being told he would be on the bench. Indulging Rooney with even more  game time will not see him want to leave, its the fear of being benched that will instead. 

We have given him many chances, have moved him around different positions to find one he could do well. and he's struggled everytime.

5678~~~
Couldn't give a feck. The reason I want Rooney moved on is that he is  on the irreversible decline and United have better options now in the no 9 and 10 positions. He can stew on the bench  or feck to somewhere who will be happy to pay his wages. The only thing that matters is the success of United. Not potential negative headlines in the soar away Sun

What happens if he's form does not pick up? Give him another season? Can a club as big as United afford to carry him to the end of this season let alone 2 or 3 or more seasons?.

Valencia, Carrick and Fellaini are now, basically squad players. Rooney is the club captain, highest earner at the club, is at the fulcrum of the attack ,is the first name on the team sheet, and has been poor this season.

The problem with fanboys like yourself is that you are too interested in finding  hidden agendas and the motives behind why people would want him dropped and/or sold instead of staring at the bleeding obvious.

This.

5679~~~
The problem with being jammed on send is that you don't address the obvious problem. No-one will buy the fat feck and he won't go. He'll just sit on the benches on massive wages pissing everyone off. We'd have to pay off his contract or accept a really disruptive squad player. If I was managing, I'd hope he finds some form and then try and move him on while he's on a high.

5680~~~
I understand your points and think there is a valid concern about his impact/attitude were he to be placed on the bench but surely a continuation of the status quo is going to have undesirable effects as well.

Keep playing an under-performing player who displaces at least one more worthy player in the team. This includes shifting around other players to mask the actual problem. How long will ambitious, driven players be happy to be snubbed or forced to accommodate a player that is inhibiting the team as a whole? Herrera doesn't want to be on the bench, Depay doesn't want to be on the bench, Young doesn't want to be on the bench and Martial doesn't want to be on the bench but some players have to be on the bench and I would prefer it be the ones contributing least (Rooney IMO).

How long are a team going to be happy following a captain that doesn't merit his inclusion? There will already be resentment growing somewhere and it will lead to some unhappy players in the long run.

The only question is who are we going to disappoint and what kind of culture/example is to be set? 
A club willing to compromise an entire team to keep a fading starlet content.
Or a club willing to look to the future and face the growing pains of confronting the reality of a starlets decline.

I know which I'd prefer and the longer anyone gets a free ride (picked for anything other than form/contribution and/or current ability) the more difficult it will be to deal with any such issues in the future. If Rooney is a starter next season he will have either miraculously rediscovered some quality (we can all dream) or LVG will have sown the seeds for his own failure and probably alienated a fair few other players as a result.

5681~~~
What if there's no form to get back to?

Has anyone of his backers thought of that?

5682~~~
He played with a lot more fire and determination and that was primarily down to him being in great shape physically (arguably his best condition since the second half of the 10/11 season), but then it would be disingenuous to suggest that a different playing style would make him look like a better player. He played as a #10 against Sunderland and produced a decent performance, but ultimately it was nothing special, and I fail to see what dropping deeper would enable him to do since he looks physically weak when he tries to hold up the ball. Rooney has no excuses now. He's not being played out of position. He's had a consistent run up front for a few months and he's only managed to produce two top class performances (against Tottenham and Club Brugge).

5683~~~
He wasn't <i>that</i> good under Moyes, feck sake. If I hear that nonsense one more time. The whole team was shocking bar a few moments.

5684~~~
I remember last season when Rooney, Falcao and RVP were all misfiring (or playing average) - many people began to think our system was not conducive to scoring goals.
Falcao was got rid of. He has played for Chelsea and scored a grand total of 1 goal (Rooney is on 2).
Last year RVP was constantly injured, so could not get a run of games to improve his form. RVP, this year, with a better injury record, has scored 5 goals.
So, last year's weak/average players are once again proving weak/average (in different teams/positions).

Martial comes in, immediately shows good movement and scores goals. 
Mata (despite his lack of speed), is creating goals. 
Memphis is the only other attacker (apart from Rooney) who is proving weak, though he can be excused as he is young/inexperienced and his best years are ahead of him.

IMO, RvP, Falcao and Rooney, who were all average last year, should've all been shipped out. 2 of them left, but we're still stuck with 1, very big, dead-weight.

The problem for LVG is that he did not buy a quality attacker, as he put all his eggs in Rooney's basket. Furthermore, LVG has not helped matters by saying things like, "Rooney is the best captain he ever worked with" and "the captain shall always play".

I actually think it might be good for Rooney to be given a "holiday" for 2-4 weeks, so he can come back fresh and raring to go.

5685~~~
Your analysis is shit, more like. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5686~~~
Remember when Dwight Yorke was getting tonnes of shit from critics and supporters and then he randomly used Arsenal as his own personal sex aid and played like prime Brazilian Ronaldo? Rooney needs a performance like that tomorrow.

5687~~~
Yeah the dogs in the street know (I love that phrase) the clock is ticking pretty damn loud. I still think he'll get a pass till the end of the season because of the politics. But I could be wrong. Depends if he gets worse or stays the same. I find it hard to imagine he'll get better because he's too slow.

Sad because I quite like him. Don't care about the City stuff.

5688~~~
So true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Its like the Liverpool boom-bust cycle.

The Rooney fan club wont be having any of that. Despite the fact he's been slowly regressing ever since 2010.

He was probably just about the best of a bad bunch in the first half of the season, but was as shite as anyone else after Xmas. 

Its just the last desperate attempts of hope that the Rooney fan club still hang onto. Truth is, he hasn't been a great player for at least 4 or 5 years now. And now he's finally hit the wall thats been a long time coming. He's done. As done as Falcao and RVP were.

5689~~~
Definitely, it's all a bit silly anyway. He was good in the first half of the season and produced some top class performances tbf (Real Sociedad, Bayer Leverkusen, and Tottenham, for example), but he was atrocious in the second half of the season, with the exception being the Olympiacos game at home. Our system under Moyes was archaic and focused mainly on individuals rather than team work, which partially explains why Rooney looked a class above the rest.

5690~~~
I dont believe rooney can get back to his 2011 level. Not a chance. 

If he can't do that in 4 years what differenfes does a couple more games does? 

If he still has it in him he would have shown it, forget scoring goals, drought can occur to any top player, but failing a 10 yard pass several times per game is not acceptable. 

He's like scratchy coupons, you know the odds are shite and its a waste of money,  but somehow you still wish the next one is the 100k scratchy 

He doesn't even press these days,  he just stand in a difficult position as if he doesn't want thr ball, and neither is his teammates wants to give him the ball. 

You can count and compare how many passess he receives today compared with past. Player like bfs would be pissed with his incompetence, in a possession football passing and positioning is everything,  it's like phalanx,  one weak link will make the cycle broken and he's more than a weak link. 

Either he's benjamin button or he peaked at 26 and his body can't react as fast as his brain tolds them to.

5691~~~
Made me laugh.

5692~~~
Somebody did an interesting poem about him, about a month ago on these forums.
Basically, it commented that when he was a 17 year old kid, he had the physique and playing ability of a man in his late 20s.
In his late 20s, he now has the playing ability of a teenager.

BTW, did anybody pick up on the headline which MOTD mentioned, in tomorrow's news papers. Apparently LVG is now saying that Rooney cannot be the main striker at MUFC for much longer. Perhaps LVG is beginning to soften the fans up, for him being sold next Summer.

5693~~~
Van Gaal:

Ugh, that sounds like LvG's workaround is going to be allowing Rooney to stink up midfield instead of the forward line.

5696~~~
As long as he's in such poor form (if you want to still call it form) he'll be a problem wherever he plays. I hope LVG is saying that cause he wants to motivate him for the season - if he says the same things by the end of the season, I have some doubts

5697~~~
apparantey one of todays headlines is Glenn Hoddle wanting to see him moved into a new role <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

5698~~~
As what? Goal keeper?

5699~~~
Impact Sub, I hope.

5700~~~
He's going to score today.

5701~~~
Hope you're right.

Anyways, Sky are convinced he will because it <b>WAS</b> his birthday <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

5702~~~
I'm basing this on nothing but gut feeling tbh.

5703~~~
Better than, <i>"City can go back to the top, UNLESS THE BIRTHDAY BOY, WAYNE ROONEY, CRASHES THE PARTY!!! Or, will a teenager get the headlines?! </i>(Martial)"

That was actually said by the way. Ridiculous

5704~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5705~~~
I know. Spoofers in that studio...

Take it from someone who knows, you're not guaranteed to score on your birthday

5706~~~
Don't know if it's idiots on Twitter messing but, some people are saying he has been dropped today <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

5707~~~
Perhaps they gave him the bumps. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Anyway, good luck today, Wayne.

5708~~~
I hope he has a good game today, because this is definitely not the game to have a bad one.

5709~~~
They're taking the piss. No way he'll be dropped for this game.
In any case, if he has anything good left in his game, today's the day to show it....we need everyone working hard to win today.

5710~~~
I swear if that happens I'll break his leg myself.

5711~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Don't worry, his teammates would probably do that. No way will they keep supporting him privately if he's getting unjust privileges at their expense. Human nature dictates otherwise.

5712~~~
I hope so.

5713~~~
Rooney will play today no doubt but I do think he'll be dropped soon unless a miracle happens.

5714~~~
Or he could just score a couple of goals

5715~~~
<i>In a surprising turn of events, Louis van Gaal has handed over the management of Manchester United to versatile all-rounder Wayne Rooney. "Let's face it, this is the only position we haven't tried him in, aside from The Wheelbarrow," said the Dutchman, "I just hope he selects me for the next match."</i>

5716~~~
He could but he also needs to up his overall performance. Lets hope he scores today eh?

5717~~~
He has a good record against Shitty, lets hope so!

5718~~~
Come on Wazza time to step up today. If he starts playing well we will start flying.

5719~~~
A hat-trick to kick start his season would be nice <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5720~~~
I agree, that if he has a good game here it could kick start everything for him. If not it could be awful for him. I seriously hope it goes well for him.

5721~~~
That's really unnecessary.

5722~~~
You're right, chief - it wouldn't make any difference to his play.

5723~~~
It really isn't, if he gets shifted back into midfield despite proving that he is utter crap there last season, not to cover injuries, not because others aren't playing well but purely to shoehorn his broken down worn out ass into the side in yet another position it's how I feel.

5724~~~
Another silent domination ?

5725~~~
Wishing injury on a player is against Caf rules regardless of whether it's tongue in cheek or how you feel about them, so yes, it is.

5726~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5727~~~
Yep me too as when he plays well he's quality and apart from maybe DDG our best player but not seen it in quite a while.

5728~~~
I read that. Sometimes so called "experts" astound me.. how can he think that Rooney will be better as a #10 when he's got the permanent first touch of a Moose now? If we absolutely have to play Rooney then the #9 is where he does the least damage..

5729~~~
The thing that's really annoying me at the minute is how Martial is being shifted to the left despite shaming Rooney with his performances upfront this season.

The idealistic part of me says that if Rooney were a REAL captain then he'd be honest that his level of performance isn't good enough and asked to be benched for a few games.

5730~~~
Yeah I would hope this happens as well but unfortunately the reality is the footballer's ego won't allow it...

Rooney could start though by asking his ex-teammates and media buddies to stop blaming the rest of the team for his crap performances. It's really quite awful that. No worries for them to be biased towards him - it's their perrogative - but to throw his teammates under the bus to make their point is pretty low behaviour.

5731~~~
For those thinking he might get dropped:
He is the first name on the team-sheet. And he has reached a point where if he isn't doing well in the NO.9 position, he will be shifted around the pitch to accommodate him.
He is undroppable.

Given that we are stuck with him for this season, I hope he does well today and the rest of the season and then gets sold in the Summer.

Being undroppable must have its own pressures that few players have ever experienced.

5732~~~
Well in that case I apologise and change it to wishing he was just somewhere else.

5733~~~
I don't get this whole undroppable thing. If he is in bad form he should be benched. I thought the whole LVG philosophy was about what is good for the team and no the individual?

5734~~~
See now that I can agree with <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5735~~~
It really doesn't. 

If you are not feeling well playing every game or you think you are underperforming then you simply admit you think it would be the best for your form to skip few games, I am sure every manager would understand that.

5736~~~
Remember that Derby where he stunk up the place for 80 odd minutes with the touch of a brick wall and repeatedly giving the ball away but then popped up with a bicycle kick to win it? 

Well I can hope.

5737~~~
Playing as striker but somehow getting in the way of BFS in our own half. 

Hasn't played too badly thus far though.

5738~~~
Is there anything we can say at this point that hasn't already been said? He's a hindrance to the team and there's feck all we can do about it until LVG grows some balls.

5739~~~
Great pass to the corner flag.

5740~~~
...taxi

5741~~~
That pass/cross/whatever it actually was just about sums him up right now.

5742~~~
He is so so bad. Its like playing against 12 men.

His first touch is what I'd imagine it would be like if you chucked me onto the pitch. Ball just bouncing off all over the place.

5743~~~
Poor

5744~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> awful.

5745~~~
Jesus, I was coming into this thread expecting to see praise.

I have been one of the biggest critics of Rooney this season, but I think he has been very good so far.

Playing with that classic warrior attitude, and actually running at the defense.

5746~~~
People talk about him being "not as bad" as other might say but it must be slightly demoralising to the rest of the team having to play with him right now. Knowing any good play that ends up with him is probably going to be wasted. 

Even Valencia is looking more dangerous than him.

5747~~~
Not letting Kompany bully him like he usually does, so that's good.

5748~~~
Do join us in 2015 where being a top footballer means a bit more than that.

5749~~~
Hes past it. This is one of the worst United performances i have seen in years. He loses the ball with every first touch and every pass leaves his teammates chasing a loose ball.

5750~~~
Martial would be better as#9 though.

5751~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5752~~~
This is one of the hardest fought matches of the season, what do you want from him? Scoring over head kicks every game?

He's done as well as any of the other attackers on the pitch.

I also wouldn't classify him as a 'top' footballer anymore. So I'm trying to be relative to what level I think his skills are at.

5753~~~
He's City's best defender.

5754~~~
Just goes to show how low his standards have fallen when you see him getting praise for another performance like this.

5755~~~
He's he makes me sick. He's a huge hindrance to us and has been all season. 

How on earth do the coaches not see this? How the feck can he be unstoppable.

5756~~~
I think this is hands down his best performance this season.

5757~~~
let's sign usain bolt then. he's faster and probably will love to play for us

5758~~~
He could stay up front.

He could pass the ball better.

He could control the ball properly like the rest of his teammates. 

He could think a bit more when he's on the ball. 

I don't know what 300k/wk gets you these days but I don't think it's too much to ask. 

I really don't care if he's a "warrior".

5759~~~
He could obviously be playing better, but so could all of our players so far.

5760~~~
Genuinely don't know how you can be of this opinion. He's been absolutely dreadful.

5761~~~
How about just occasionally killing the ball within say 2 yards of him when he receives the ball?

5762~~~
And people try and pretend there's no agenda on here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

'absolutely dreadful'? Really?

He's been fine, not great, but ok. Nothing much to complain about.

5763~~~
I think his delivery has been good from set peices. But City just aren't the kind of team you get a lot from that.

5764~~~
I can see this thread is going to scapegoat central then if we don't win. 

People with huge agendas not willing to give Rooney any credit whatsoever.

5765~~~
I'm really liking the energy he's bringing to this game, but...

The last 4 United attacks have ended up in Rooney just losing the ball.

5766~~~
Anyone know his pass rate so far, it must be shocking.

5767~~~
He's not been as bad as he's been previously, but he's a million miles from 'very good'.

5768~~~
Nah, Martial's often been looking a lot more dangerous than Rooney, who's been fairly poor again.

5769~~~
He has at least been involved, which he isn't always. He has broken our attacking a lot of times though, and made poor decisions when receiving the ball

5770~~~
He breaks up more United attacks than the opposition do.

5771~~~
I agree with this. The moment he fecked an easy control with no one around him just represents the player he's become.

5772~~~
Credit for what exactly?

5773~~~
One of my biggest annoyances, side from when he loses the ball needlessly, is that he has to bring the ball backwards every time because his first touch is too poor to keep defenders away, so he has to run away from pressure. That means that he ends up with his back to goal and no way of playing a positive pass to a player moving forward to develop the attack. Passing it to him is one step forward and two steps back, every single time.

5774~~~
Just fluke a goal Wayne. All will be forgiven.

5775~~~
We haven't had one touch in their box, I think. He's doing well to ensure that stays the case for 90 minutes

5776~~~
He is not bad, I don't think he deserves to be criticised more than our other players(apart from one or two who are playing well). But he had few laughable situations, and he has more to prove than anyone else though.

5777~~~
No first touch, sloppy passing and all around clumsiness, but he looks more energetic at least.

5778~~~
But he's still been largely ineffective. He hasn't even mustered a shot. Martial would be terrorising City even more so if he was playing in Rooney's position.

5779~~~
I'm far from a defender of his, but it's harsh to criticise him today imo. No attacking player on the pitch has done anything of note.

5780~~~
What does he actually offer us any more the snap shot out of nowhere is well gone, the burst of energy is gone, the desire to win is gone and  the body looks shot.

5781~~~
Awful Rooney is in the house again 

I counted 5 occasions in that half alone when he lost the ball and city countered easily.

He is a complete and utter liability for Christ sake martial has played great yet again but he's shunted out wide just so Rooney can play.

With martial at 9 we could win this

5782~~~
Oh come on he hasn't been that bad for fecks sake. He's been like every other player on the pitch today. It's such a cagey affair. May have lost the ball a few times but he's won the ball for us a few times too.

5783~~~
To be fair - this Rooney business has opened my eyes to just how low the standards are with some our supporters.

I often questioned this when plenty of our supporters wanted to give Moyes more time. 

Sorry but I want United to be successful, so I'll carry on my "agenda" against players who are not deserving of being in the first XI.

5784~~~
I don't think he's anywhere as bad as being made out. He's is occupying the defenders. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5785~~~
The guy isn't on a 300k contract to perform the same as the others, he is supposed to be a standout-player. Feck sake, some people need to raise their standards man.

5786~~~
Thought that was a perfectly decent half from Rooney. Lots of people jumping on the bandwagon.

5787~~~
That's the most disappointing about him now. His reluctance to shoot.

5788~~~
Aye, he should be our star player. Not a liability.

5789~~~
One of his best games this season. Technically he's still very poor, but at least he looks like he's working really hard and is trying to lead by example, effort wise if nothing else.

Naturally this isn't enough in the long run but it's much better than we've seen - a solid 6 I'd say.

5790~~~
Not bad at all, could have produced a good chance if Martial stayed onside.

5791~~~
Martial's been a class above.

5792~~~
If it's the miscontrol I think you're talking about, I just lowered my head in resignation when it happened. It was so poor - barely anyone around and it just bounces off his boot, straight to Kompany.

5793~~~
Thought he was shit this half, hopefully he will be better in the second one.

5794~~~
Yeah, standard derby game. He's certainly going to be an escape goat if we lose.

5795~~~
Clueless today, hope he can pick it up 2nd half. Confidence looks shot.

5796~~~
He's on £300k a week, "decent" isn't good enough.

5797~~~
I agree, but he's also lost the ball a few times. There's just no consistency when it comes to judging Rooney's performance vs another player at the moment. I'm far from saying Rooney played insanely great - but people are making it sound as if he's been an useless sack of shit this half. If you look at his data for that half, he'd have been one of our better players I'm sure. Unfortunately there's anti-Rooney glasses on which magnifies every mistake he makes by 10000.

5798~~~
It's that one yeah.

5799~~~
The one where he randomly decided to come back and contest Schweinsteiger for a ball was even worse. It went about 10 yards back to our own goal.

5800~~~
Not really Martial's fault, the pass was on earlier but he delayed

5801~~~
He's allergic to shooting.

5802~~~
Exactly.

He's not a young player trying to find his feet, he's the PL's best paid player, if he's playing poorer than half the team then there's something wrong.

5803~~~
Exactly

5804~~~
He hasn't been that terrible today. Not good but he's had far worse games this season.

5805~~~
The most notable thing concerning Wayne Rooney in that first half was surely the fact he had his head stapled.

5806~~~
Rooney has figured out a way to fool the speed guns. 
That is the only explanation. 
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/SAdh9YA.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/SAdh9YA.jpg"/>

5807~~~
Rooney's had exaggerated stats on FIFA for a while, mate.

5808~~~
The thing that irritates me most is we've been willing to try every combination up top except one which doesn't include Rooney. If I was Mata for example, I'd be pissed.

5809~~~
Are his teammates ok with him being undroppable? Memphis goes out of form and suddenly he's nowhere to be seen, same with Hererra. Rooney is perpetually garbage and he plays every minute of every game.

5810~~~
Of course they aren't.

5811~~~
Hes a long way from the player he used to be.  It should have been him for Lingard.

5812~~~
He's a master at giving the ball away. Won't be to critical cause I'm just tired.

5813~~~
James Wilson is getting fecked here a bit.

Surely he deserves a chance to see what he could do in comparison to Rooney (if we insist on not just playing Martial up front).

<span style="color: #ffffff">Assuming Wilson isn't injured or something.</span>

5814~~~
So frustrating, I can' believe the manager thinks he brings enough to the team.

5815~~~
This is so fecking infuriating watching him stink up every single thing for us.

5816~~~
Played to a dubious 6/10 in the first half, but has done his utmost to bring it back down to his usual 3/10 in the second.

5817~~~
He seems to get worse as games go on. Fitness is definitely not there.

5818~~~
That's it. He's fecking diabolical

5819~~~
An atrocity of a performance that should see him fined.

5820~~~
Martial as a striker would have won us the game

5821~~~
Still not good enough as main man for any team with league aspiration.

5822~~~
His form has been absolutely insulting. Just feck off.

5823~~~
Something has to give. I've lost my faith in Van Gaal right now over this.

We would have won that game with a half-competent striker in Rooney's place. 

He's robbing us.

5824~~~
Telling that his only two positive contributions were in our own 18. He genuinely ruined almost every attack that came to him.

5825~~~
So when do we start being more vocal at the ground that he needs to be dropped?

5826~~~
I cannot wait to read how his performances is going to be defended by his most hardcore fans.

5827~~~
He had an okay game. Wasn't as terrible as some of you guys are making it to be.

He even got criticized for not being able to shoot that last shot. Ridiculous. But I guess all the experts have some agenda and wont criticize Rooney because he's English and what not. Only you lot can see he is "finished".

5828~~~
Playing with him is like driving with the handbrake on

5829~~~
Pretty sick of watching him.

5830~~~
LvG pisses me off more than Rooney now.

5831~~~
Useless again. He has to be dropped, there's no reason for him to be starting. Lingard/Memphis on the wing & Martial up top.

5832~~~
Another player upfront, and we could have won. Everything he did today was borderline terrible. Fellaini, Lingard and Darmian managed to do more than him with half his minutes.

5833~~~
That's perfect.

5834~~~
He gives away the fecking ball under no pressure at all, and when he does something it is always a split second too late. Shambolic again from him.

5835~~~
Average rating of 4.5 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Works his bollox off and did well in protecting defence from their set pieces

5836~~~
Say it every week but I've fecking had enough. Ruins every one of our attacks.

5837~~~
Or trying to eat a burger with your teeth out.

5838~~~
you can see how well can Martial hold the ball up, the only think Rooney does is losing possession there, another stupid decision to play him despite being totl total shit, it's really hard to play 10 against twelve...

5839~~~
I can't really blame Rooney for being on the pitch, it is LvG who has to make the decision to put him on the bench.

Horrible Again today, not saying he was the worst or anything, but he offers us nothing as a forward other than a decent run behind the line each game.

5840~~~
He does not deserve to start a match for us. How he keeps getting chance after chance whilst shifting our best goalscorer this season out wide I'll never know. It is genuinely baffling.

5841~~~
Truth be told his two defensive contributions at the end are better than almost anything he's produced offensively in games that matter all season.

Probably brought his second half performance from 2-3 to maybe 4/10.

5842~~~
I'm somewhat ashamed of saying this, but if he were sidelined for a bit I wouldn't be too upset. It just seems like the only way he can be dropped is by injury.

5843~~~
He was just really average again. It's all well and good to say, "Well, he's had worse performances.", but if this sort of game is seen as being decent for Rooney then our standards for him have dropped to a worryingly low level.

He was slow on the ball, regularly interrupted our play, contributed little to our attack, especially in comparison to Martial who looked more dangerous from out wide, and his touch/passing continues to be average most of the time. The fact that Rooney was leading the line and we caused City so little danger wasn't much of a coincidence. He's just a bit useless at the moment.

5844~~~
or trying to masturbate without using the hands.

5845~~~
If rooney was a horse he would've been put down 2 years ago

Seriously I'd just sack him, 300k a week for shite performances week in week about. There's strikers in the championship better than him.

5846~~~
A nothing player, not only that he does feck all, but he also breaks up half of our attacks with his shit first touch and passing. Not to mention that we have to play our best attacking player out of position because of him.

5847~~~
Here's a fun fact, it's been 79 matches since Rooney last successfully held up the ball under pressure from a defender, his longest drought of his career.

5848~~~
He is fecking useless, passing when  he should have shot and finally taking a shot when he should of fecking passed it, waste of space as far as im concerned, does anyone really think he deserves to be at united, he has to sold off so united can be successful again.

5849~~~
You've described the archetypical English workhorse. High standards.

5850~~~
He's trying. Sadly failing though.

5851~~~
He tried hard and defended well, but thats about all you can say in a positive light.

5852~~~
Losing the ball under no pressure 15 out of 17, yeah not bad eh

5853~~~
He's being played as a striker, and he offers us absolutely nothing in the final third.

5854~~~
I actually wouldn't mind seeing the back of LVG if this pathetic pandering to Rooney continues.. City were there for the taking. I am sick of seeing Mata being used as a convenient scapegoat and being subbed off, Depay barely getting a look in and Herrera having no options in front of him, the man is a complete hindrance to the side.

What I don't get is that if he is physically not what he was, why on earth does he never pick up serious injuries anymore.. surely one should be fecking due by now.

5855~~~
Defended well when he had too, challenged for a few aerial duels and made 1 run any half decent striker should do. Apart from that was absolutely dreadful in possession and really failed to link our attack. 

It's no coincidence since he's gone back upfront we have looked toothless again, since martial has gone to the wing.

5856~~~
He put in some decent defensive contributions towards the end, but his overall performance up front was dire. He offered us very little in an attacking sense, despite the fact that he's supposed to be one of our main men.

5857~~~
Got this from Twitter: "@danielstorey85: 55% passing accuracy for Wayne Rooney. No shots on target. No chances created. Lost possession five more times than any other player."

But yeah, not too bad.

5858~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> THat mental image!!

5859~~~
Our greatest moments were definitely the ones where we played around him because it takes him a while to control a ball, if he does at all, and then another 10 seconds to turn to goal before giving it away.

5860~~~
Ah yes, the calling card of the top strikers in the league.

We're not Bolton feck sake.

5861~~~
Constantly ruins our attack. Slows our attack. What does he do that's positive for the team? He can't hold the ball up. He's no longer a threat aerially. His passing isn't great. He never even takes shots when in positions. Can't beat a man. Doesn't offer pace. No runs in behind. And when he does get in behind, he doesn't do anything.

He's getting worse and worse too imo. We can't carry him in the team and not suffer for it. We are suffering with him in the team.

5862~~~
Some good defensive contribution, to be fair to him. He was twice instrumental in us not conceding. But that's it really. Nothing he did out there that any other player couldn't do, on the offensive end. 

I wonder how we'd look like with Martial up top.

5863~~~
He works hard but he offers absolutely nothing going forward. I would love to see how good we'd be without him.

5864~~~
We completely controlled that game, but with someone like Rooney up top it doesn't matter because we are not going to score enough goals. Fecking infuriating.

5865~~~
Doesn't matter

I agree in general he has been poor and going forward today he didn't offer much, but he still helped his side a lot today and deserves more than 4/10

5866~~~
Normally he always gets a red card or injury during the season while he is playing decent/good... guess he wont miss many matches this season

5867~~~
Btw, he had a cool 54,5% passing accuracy this game. Pub players can do better.

5868~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Absolute nonsense.

5869~~~
When I see Rooney with a touch/header/pass

5870~~~
The English Xavi.

5871~~~
Half is generous. I've tried to be optimistic but we'd be better off just playing with 10.

5872~~~
4.5 is flattering as it suggests mediocrity.

He was well below the minimum standard, AGAIN. I lost count of how many times he lost the ball...it's now the case that it's a pleasant surprise whenever he gets the ball and manages to do something useful with it.

Useless sack of shit.

5873~~~
I'm a Rooney fan but this season enough is enough he needs dropped. Regret the sale of Welbeck as he'd be perfect replacement that was already here. The pace power and movement of him and Martial would have served us well. I don't think Rooney is the only one I think Mata doesn't contribute enough either.

5874~~~
Gonna soon cause a problem with the guys. No way are they happy with this. Terrible. Could have sworn he was free at one point and Valencia saw him there and decided to go elsewhere... none of them really trust him imo.

5875~~~
He did work his bollox off, but he is so out of form that I hate to say but our game might probably improve if he were suspended or injured and LvG were forced to play Martial upfront.

5876~~~
I'd work my bollocks off too, doesn't mean I'd be good enough.

5877~~~
it felt like he broke down every one of our attacks. terrible performance today.

seriously, what are we all missing? what does van gaal see in him that we all don't see???

5878~~~
Please jet off to the MLS sooner rather than later.

5879~~~
Got completely dominated by Kompany the whole game, yet he plays there for the full 90. Mata and BFS was meh, they get subbed, so why the feck does Rooney have this immunity.

Van Gaal has been/is pretty ruthless with players not performing, so its completely nonsensical.

5880~~~
He's a striker. No he doesn't. Maybe a 5 at best.

5881~~~
This. Absolutely this - they were there for the taking and we stuck the kid on the left away from where he's leathal - absolute madness from our coaching team.

5882~~~
Some are going OTT with the Rooney criticism. He's under the microscope and every mistake is picked on - sadly he isn't offering much attacking threat  at the moment and basic errors keep giving his critics ammo. He's not finished... yet; although imagine how good we'd be with an Aguero, Suarez <i>or even Martial</i> up front. I think there is extra frustration because LVG won't drop him and people are directing this at Rooney, rather than LVG.

5883~~~

5884~~~
He regularly gets dominated by Kompany...Pretty obvious he would be even more so today considering he's not that good anymore. Should have been subbed off for Memphis and put Martial up top, they couldn't deal with him.

5885~~~
Seriously, are people trying to defend the performances he's regularly putting in for us?

As our highest paid player and captain he shouldn't be praised for "working hard" in the fecking derby - that's the absolute, shameless minimum you'd expect of anyone, let alone what's supposed to be our leader.

He's done as a top player. Contributed nothing to our attacks and actually is a hindrance with his unwillingness to run in behind/attack crosses in the box.

5886~~~
A captain performance from him.

5887~~~
As a striker, who's supposed to win you games, he was a shambles again. Overall, he had moments of decent play.

5888~~~
Was his best league game of the reason and I rated him 4. Shows how bad he now actually is.

5889~~~
What a 'warrior'.

Our supporters are morons.

5890~~~
Our standards have dropped if someone like Welbeck is viewed as being an ideal replacement. He's got pace and power, but he'd be nowhere near good enough for our frontline.

5891~~~
I'm starting to think it was written in to his new contract that he must play in every game.

5892~~~
His attempt to take on Otamendi at the 56 minute mark was just soul destroying. Like taking candy from a baby.

5893~~~
I supported him during half time, and I stand by that. Second half, he looked a lot more tired and less effective than ever up front but he still put in a shift in defence for us. 

I'm annoyed he didn't get subbed because he looks fecking shattered. I think people go over board with the hate/criticism here but it does annoy me that LVG refuses to sub him.

5894~~~
Drop Rooney, Martial centre, win games.

5895~~~
Against Everton at least he was making runs in behind. Against City he sometimes just stood offside for a good 7 seconds before realizing that he was the target man.

5896~~~
I thought he had decent first half and didn't deserve much criticism but he was absolutely terrible in the second. He can't hold a defender on his back to save his life, it's like he has come from the softest league in the world straight into premierleague, you would think he never played at this level.

Yeah, he is really terrible at keeping the ball under pressure. I think even Hernandez could do better than him in that department, it's embarassing really.

5897~~~
really needs to be dropped or injured, think he could do with some time out and the team needs it even more.

5898~~~
He made some very good contributions defensively, granted, but it doesn't excuse the fact that his contribution in the position he plays in, and should be having an impact in, was woeful.

5899~~~
He'd be a big upgrade on the Rooney that we are seeing just now Cheesy. Not sure why you don't think that?

5900~~~
Falcao'd

5901~~~
If he really must play then play him wide. I feel angry and confused everytime I see him break up a United attack.

5902~~~
He needs to be dropped. It is time for LvG to stop being blind.

5903~~~
I honestly don't think we'd be any worse if we played Phil Jones up front. He needs dropped.

5904~~~
We desperately need him to stop starting games.

5905~~~
Barely. He's a hard-worker and has pace, but he doesn't offer much else. I'd rather we were playing Martial centrally (who's light years ahead of Welbeck, and playing a lot better than Rooney), with other players on the wing.

5906~~~
Otamendi had him in his pocket.

5907~~~
Probably won us a point by disrupting Otamendi's chance.

5908~~~
A lot of average strikers will currently be a upgrade!

5909~~~
I keep saying this. Got to be something like this as no one can tell me all these coaches don't see the bleeding obvious.

5910~~~
He loses the ball more times than any one in the team and yet not single out by Van Gaal. Preferential treatment.

5911~~~
And cost us a few because every attack kept breaking up when it went to him.

5912~~~
This can't go on.

5913~~~
His days of being a top class striker are over. He's so ineffective. He caused the City defence absolutely no problems. We will be a better team when Martial is playing as a striker.

5914~~~
You can understand if a striker looks bereft of confidence, it doesn't find it's way too far into the rest of the team but it can't be coming from your captain, he has no belief in himself right now on a football pitch, how can he be asked to lead with that being the case ?

5915~~~
He gave in 100% effort today but the quality of his football was piss poor. Some of his touches were Sunday league standard.

5916~~~
Get stats of other attackers from the same game and compare it then. He was not as bad as people are making him out to be. Like I said, if people are considering more than just this game I understand but this game alone wasn't that bad.

5917~~~
Quite frankly I don't give a shit what our main striker does for us defensively. It was always an added bonus before that he offered help defensively but when it gets to a point where that's all he offers then you have a big problem.

5918~~~
Think your missing what I said, we had and sold Danny. If we can buy a Bale then I agree with you. Plus Danny's link up play is excellent and far better than Wayne's.

5919~~~
Can't Phil Jones give him one of his specials during a training session to sideline him for a few weeks, that way we can actually experiment how much more improved we'd be without him.

5920~~~
I don't see it that way - he put in a decent shift today. People are overexagerrating as usual.

5921~~~
I'd prefer Smalling up front.

5922~~~
It was a bad game, though. He just offered absolutely nothing in attack. For one, Martial offered a lot more than Rooney. Mata and Herrera also had quiet games, but I don't understand how this is being perceived as a decent attacking performance from Rooney by some people when he was sloppy on the ball, created nothing, and regularly slowed down our play.

5923~~~
He's a very poor striker now and needs replacing next summer. If we have aspirations of winning things we need to bench him and play Martial up front.

5924~~~
Yes. I so desperately want him to go on a smashing run to prove all of us wrong but there is zero reason right now to play him as a forward ahead of Martial. LVG needs to man up and drop him

5925~~~
We would do much better with Jones upfront. At least he would run in behind and put himself about.

5926~~~
That's why he got 4.5.

5927~~~
1. His two best involvements of the game came near the end, when he was defending in our own box. For a centre forward, that's unacceptable.

2. He's falling over a lot. Give him some luscious locks and I'd be inclined to think Falcao never left.

3. There's no way in hell he was ever going to score today. He spent half the time running around in midfield giving the ball away and the other half cosied up in his defender's pocket.

4. Lowest rated player today. How many games in a row is that? It's getting comical. At least have the decency to ask for a substitution.

5928~~~
The through crossed my mind too but I really don't think United would be that stupid

5929~~~
Playing with Rooney is like trying to have sex without a cock. You keep thrusting, but nothing's going in.

5930~~~
I can't help but think what could have been if we'd played our new striker up front. When Martial gets the ball on the wing and prepares to run at the defence I feel excited, like this could be a moment of magic that could change the game. Unfortunately these days when Rooney gets it and turns to face their back line, I don't expect any of that which is sad because back in the day I felt like Rooney could inspire us.

5931~~~
He used to be a striker before he was a defender no? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5932~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5933~~~
I would rather spunk 50 million on Jamie vardy in January than have Rooney start upfront for us ever again.

5934~~~
He is the albatross around our necks.  Was barely involved in the match and I can't think of a single situation where he caused the City defense a single problem.  The longer he remains untouchable the longer we are an average side.

5935~~~
Was clearly giving everything but it just isn't good enough anymore. He offers us nothing up front and him playing means Martial is stuck out on the wing and completely wasted.

I'm praying that Van Gaal comes to his senses and drops him. It has to be close surely?

5936~~~
55% pass accuracy 
0 shots on target 
0 chances created 
0 take ons

5937~~~
I never used the words "decent" and I don't think it was acceptable but it wasn't half as bad as people are making it out to be: Finished, should retire etc. I also think he should be rested (genuinely rested. I think he needs a good rest). Martial obviously offered more than Rooney; he offered more than anyone else on the pitch so I don't see why it matters that much here. 

So yes. He first touch was kind of off and didn't create much but neither did any of our other attacking players. Still not satisfied but you guys are just going OTT and there's a reason the experts aren't criticizing him the the way you lot are.

5938~~~
Should have been a pen according to some concerning the newcastle game.

5939~~~
Again, Martial did.

The two players who didn't offer much were Mata and Herrera. Both of whom you could argue had poor games. So, if that's the level Rooney was at then, well, he had a poor game.

The expert thing has been discussed quite a lot, and there's a general feeling that a lot of experts are quite reluctant to criticise Rooney considering their own association with him.

5940~~~
We need energy up front. Yes Rooney will and can still score goals, but when the game gets dull you need that guy up front who makes the runs and gets the defenders on their toes.

5941~~~
I think some people have forgotten how world class players are like.

Rooney is probably the best paid striker in the league or maybe even in europe, players like muller, lewandowski and benzema are almost on half his wages, he's nowhere near performing at an acceptable level for this club, he poses no danger at all for defenders, the odd goal won't change that. 

The club should come first, rooney should compete with martial for that position, anything else is a farce.

5942~~~
So frustrating that our best player is stuck out wide so we can play Rooney.

He's dreadful.

5943~~~
By far our worst player today I genuinely believe we would be a better team with Fellaini up front insted of Rooney.

5944~~~
All right calm down <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5945~~~
Wasn't a good game for either strikers on both teams, defences were on point. Saying that we had a lot more of the ball, Rooney needs to show a lot more he was bullied by Otamedndi today, not often you would say that about Rooney. He should be dropped, it's time LVG showed that ruthlessness.

5946~~~
That's just ridiculous. Many experts have criticized those associated with them and besides, only a handful are associated with him. I mentioned in my post Martial had a better game then all the other attackers.  And again, you don't see people posting "Finished. Should retire" in the Mata and Herrera threads.

5947~~~
Watch, when young is fit Herrera will get dropped again and Rooney will be pushed back to CAM, then martial upfront. 

It's just going in a vicious Rooney like circle

5948~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck me

5949~~~
A week in Dubai.

5950~~~
OMG.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5951~~~
I can't laugh at it any more. It's unacceptable for this club to give a player total immunity to the axe. He shouldn't be in the team, and the fact he isn't even substituted really is disgraceful.

Absolute disgrace.

5952~~~
Aguero was more effective.

5953~~~
He's not entirely wrong.

5954~~~
The problem is that his ok form is about the best we can expect from him these days, and that's nowhere near enough.

5955~~~
Van Gaal has been pathetic in dealing with him. Even if he doesn't want to drop him, he should still be willing to sub him if necessary.

5956~~~
He's a complete waste of space. I don't care how good he is in the dressing room. How he unites all groups of players, how brilliant a captain is. 
He is a shit footballer. He needs to go far away and never show his lazy spud face around OT again.
I detest him.

5957~~~
Ermm just last week he had a pretty decent game against Everton I believe.

5958~~~
Yeah you're right, he's been on fire as of late.

5959~~~
Simply put, we are playing with 10 men when he starts. I've never seen a player reach such levels is shitness

5960~~~
shit

5961~~~
Hi, Wayne. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5962~~~
As was Silva.

5963~~~
Harsh. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I sort of agree though.

5964~~~
<span style="color: #000000">Relax, he was giving everything in United derby and that's all we need from our captain. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

No, seriously  he has passed it, cannot play football of top level anymore. He's an United legend but right now he needs to carry a plant wherever he goes, what a waste of oxygen </span>

5965~~~
He scored a goal from a defensive error and did sod all else. He had a 5 yard head start on Phil feckin jagielka and still got caught up!.

5966~~~
Feck me, I was coming in here to say he looked better (marginally better then his current form), but those stats are terrible. I think he was difference between us winning and drawing.

I wonder what excuse Scholes has come up for that performance.
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5967~~~
Isn't Jagielka one of the fastest players in the league at full speed, according to some statistic?

5968~~~
Aye, no other forward players did anything more than Rooney.

Jesus Christ, talk about brain dead statements.

Lingard did more than Rooney. Martial on the left side looked more like scoring (and he would have had to beat 2-3 players at least to do so).

This is just revealing how dumb and delusional some of our supporters are.

5969~~~
Young caused havoc.

5970~~~
Any ball with any player close to him and he loses it. 
Fails to make a 5 yard pass or a 50 yard one. 
Cannot run with the ball. 
Cannot play with his back to goal. 
Cannot hold up the ball to bring others into play.
Does not even track back well or press either from the top or when he loses the ball. 

Wtf is he in the team for again?

5971~~~
For a generation of United fans, we have seen a plethora of great strikers up top for this club.

Think Cantona, Yorke in 99, Ruud and his majestic brilliance, Wayne Rooney in 09/10 and RVP in 12/13..That is the standard, and something we demand at a club like ours. For all his supposed faults , Fergie usually did well in selecting his forwards.

Forgive us if we think that him putting a defensive shift makes him have a good game as our main forward. For me as United fan, I just cant accept such mediocrity, the above should be the standard, always!

Its a kick in the gut when a far superior striker is in the team, and being played elsewhere..I am not looking for silent domination, I want a proper forward. This man is not one.

5972~~~
I was backing Rooney the other day but I'm afraid the milk has finally gone stale. (Thanks to Claude)

5973~~~
He's taken to aimlessly throwing himself through the air like a sack of spuds on puppet strings.
Sell Rooney, sign Carroll.

5974~~~
Martial created our best chance of the game with a lovely ball to Lingard. It's not even about creating chances... it's the fact that Martial looked threatening whenever he had the ball, whereas Rooney struggled holding the ball up and constantly kept giving the ball away. Experts like Gary Neville like to criticise players like Mata more than Rooney, and I'm sure we all know why that is.

5975~~~
I don't care if he's usain bolt, with a 5 yard head start a striker for man utd should be away and scoring.

5976~~~
He wasn't even that bad today. Yes, he produced nothing and he kept giving the ball away but he had some passes completed and in some instances managed to control the ball with his first touch which is realistically as much as you can expect from him these days.

5977~~~
We should get Kane and Mane and bench him.

5978~~~
Don't forget to mention that he worked hard because that's a very important trait. More important than scoring goals.

5979~~~
Horrendous today. Reading that he lost the ball 5 times more than any player. Jesus christ.

5980~~~
Yep, if someone has the time to make a YouTube vid with Martial and Rooney's touches in the game, you'll see Martial constantly getting his nose towards the goal and taking on a man while Rooney runs away from pressure if he even manages to stay in possession. It's night and day between the two in terms of attacking mentality. We need someone who has the pace and technique to bring the ball forward leading the line.

Based on his performances compared to the others in his position this season, it doesn't make sense not to play Martial up front. Similarly, it doesn't make sense not to play Rooney on the bench. He's earned some time on his arse now.

5981~~~
Noooooooooooooooooo.

5982~~~
I say every game its an issue buy now its become a farce. Why is he playing?

5983~~~
Rooney is not playing great by any means, but Memphis hasn't been great either and considering both Mata and Herrera are getting games, the only player Rooney is keeping on the bench so to speak is Fellaini. 

It is up to the younger lads to get into the team and take his place...If Memphis puts in a few motm performances then he will take the left spot again and Martial will retake the central position, putting Rooney's position under threat but currently that isn't happening so like it or not Rooney is the best option.

5984~~~
I'd seriously let him go for free now that Martial is here.

I'm sure we'd get some takers.

5985~~~
He gave his all. I honestly don't think he is capable of more than what he showed today so he deserves credit for this game. It was similar performance to Everton but he did not get to have one-on-one with the keeper this time.

5986~~~
I truly hope he will be sold at the end of the season if he keeps this up. Or promote someone else to captain, but I don't know if LVG would do that.

5987~~~
He wouldn't even get in Villa's team at the moment. Truly abhorrent form.

5988~~~
He's holding everything back. It's pathetic.

5989~~~
"Wasn't that bad" ffs standards have dropped dramatically for a #9, gone are the days we expect the van nistelrooys, beratovs and sahas UTD. I'd be quite happy the see Wilson thrown in ahead off him ATM, I hope to God I don't see Rooney anywhere near the line up against Middleborough.

5990~~~
Tim Howard was very pleased by his headed clearance at the end.

5991~~~
1) Two wrongs don't make a right.
2) Not really. He's effectively keeping Depay (couldn't care less), Fellaini, Wilson, Lingard, Young and Pereira out of the team as our attacking options go. Martial should've taken his place up front and that gives place on the wing (or #9 for Wilson and Fellaini [I'm not a fan of him at #9]) for most of those players. 
3) Why would anybody have to put in MOTM performances if 'not worst on the pitch' level should be enough to bench a player who's playing like Rooney at the moment?
4) He really isn't.

5992~~~
Lost the ball 28 times today. 28 FECKING TIMES! More than anyone on the pitch.

5993~~~
Would never describe myself as Rooney basher but must say,never seen anything like it,when it comes to passing and first touch of pro player.Not even angry at him,i just can understand how its possible,spec. those situations when he doesnt have anyone around him.

5994~~~
Wow..

5995~~~
People are finally starting to notice he's been complete shit. Don't know how long it will take before we just drop him and there isn't a huge enquiry about it. Probably a shit season and bad Euro 2016

5996~~~
He is 30 playing like he is 40. He needs one of those long vacation to find his form.

5997~~~
Is that for real? Source?

5998~~~
LVG is living on another planet at the moment. How can he be so stubborn and shortsighted in thinking that Rooney has't been bad? 

Drop the fecking ego you narcissistic maniac.

5999~~~
Perhaps they bring it up each week because they are reasons for it, Louis.

6000~~~
He almost certainly means that he's sick of being asked about Rooney's form...though discussing it wouldn't be a problem for LVG if that form were anywhere near satisfactory.

6001~~~
You could make a video of his first touch set to the Benny Hill theme, absolute waste of time and the fact he is not only is undroppable but also unsubable is hurting the team at this point.

6002~~~

6003~~~
You'd still manage to throw the ball in the net even after that Tim.

6004~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6005~~~
A very apt analogy.

6006~~~
Not sure what some expect Van Gaal to answer in public about Rooney...

6007~~~
It's the same things over and over again. Poor hold up play, first touch, and passing. No system in the world is capable of killing any of those traits. At least under Moyes he played with explosiveness and went past players, but there was no way he could have kept that up. The most annoying thing is that we still have fans who think he's not to blame. We either have to build a team around him and add in pace, blame our wingers/midfielders for not creating chances for him, or play him as a #10 (he's better than Ozil of course). 

Falcao and Van Persie were poor last season - while Rooney got away with the same amount of criticism they received - but he can't hide now. He's only had two top performances since the end of last season. Which is shocking.

6008~~~
yes he is <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6009~~~
Yep. Though to be fair, the media gets a bit obsessed with certain people, like with Gerrard etc and everything - good or bad - is always about them. Never the team, only those individuals. So in one way I understand LVG being sick about it. However, he needs to realise that this is a valid line of questioning. But like you say, if he had anything good to say he wouldn't mind. Needs to grow a pair before all this causes dissent in the dressing room. And believe me, it will eventually.

6010~~~
No I think that's fair enough, but I expect more from Rooney. He's obviously never been gifted with a quality first touch, but I expect him to hold the ball up better and bring others into play. Completing only 55% of your passes is terrible. Against Everton he looked threatening and made a couple of excellent runs and could have scored two. Today he was abysmal.

6011~~~
He has no problem calling other players out, Rooney shouldn't be an exception.

6012~~~
Not as sick of it as we are enduring that sub-par shit week-in week-out. How dare LVG dismiss it like that!? 
He has no respect for the fans, clearly.
He's teetering very close to the edge that Moyes was tipped over!

6013~~~
I've just heard that on Talksport. That is not good.

6014~~~
Who did he call out ?

6015~~~
I genuinely believe that van Gaal does not see his performances as poor or sub-par. He's in love with the player and his work rate.

6016~~~
Where did yu get that stat? Sounds absurd.

6017~~~
No one in this particular game but he certainly has in the past.

6018~~~
BBC.

6019~~~
BBC.

6020~~~
Was so hard for him today. I was at the game and sometimes there were no options at all for him.

6021~~~
Correct thing to do. You don't single out your player in public no matter how bad they play.

6022~~~
Personally, I can't remember the last time he made me hard.

6023~~~
Are you being serious or sarcastic?

6024~~~
Serious.

Three times in a five minute period today he had the ball and was ready to pass but literally NO options. No he didn't play well at all but I can't imagine others doing much better.

6025~~~
Who ?

6026~~~
Cheers. I suppose he completed some forward passes though, so he was OK (according to his fans).

6027~~~
I'm not going to go dig through old quotes of LVG's, I know I've heard him criticize various players after games for losing the ball etc.

6028~~~
Wouldn't Martial have been better at 9? I would have even have taken Rooney out wide.

6029~~~
Mata and Young, I am sure he said something after one game, which tbf is unusual.

6030~~~
They wouldnt,if he wasnt English,same shit with questions for JM about Terry.If we win 10:0,Ander 9 and Rooney 1,they would ask something like " Lui,your captain scored a nice goal today,do you hope he keeps it in same fashion for future games?"

6031~~~
Martial would have done better. Not even a question.

EDIT: Wilson might have stretched them more. Mata would have had better passing as a false 9. Fellaini would have won a few headers. DDG might have trapped the ball once.

6032~~~
You'll easily find him commenting about individual mistakes, like Martial's handball against CSKA, but very rarely when the entire performance was shite and when a player has struggled for some time

6033~~~
He needs to be sold in the summer but the problem is who'll be the takers with those insane wages.

6034~~~
Just gotta make sure you put Rooney in your line up prediction every game. At least you get one right.

6035~~~
At this point. Let him leave for free. Sell him to PSG or someone else with more money than sense.

6036~~~
Utter crap, no longer surprised. 
Rapidly loosing faith in Lvg

6037~~~
Some of the press are catching on though

6038~~~
Let him go for free I say, that the least we can do for the years of service he's put in. Not good enough now, we are utd, we are 1 of the richest clubs in the world, we do not need to cash in on him. If he kick up a fuss a says he wants paying out his contract then and only then we should be looking for a fee.

6039~~~
For me this is becoming the biggest problem I have with LVG. I think we are dropping points with his handling of this so called captain.

6040~~~
I think he still has 2 and half years contract to run, no ?

6041~~~
Rinse and repeat every game.

6042~~~
This is just an opinion not fact. If you ask me,, with a decent striker on the pitch we would have beaten Swansea and Man City. He's costing us points.

6043~~~
He signed a 5 and half year contract in January 2014, so it runs to July 2019

6044~~~
I don't think he actually played much worse than his "silent domination" vs City last year.

6045~~~
Maybe we could loan him to Everton and pick up his wages in return for Stones.

6046~~~
Might as well have kept Falcao...

6047~~~
This,
He was ok in the first half but he was just dire in the second.
Maybe he does need a rest as someone said previously.
He looks jaded and worn out.

I'd like to see him hang around and take on a giggs / scholes role as a squad player.
He's lost a few of his strengths as a player and they're not coming back but he can adjust his game.
He won a lot and has been a geat player for a 10-12 years, most of it with us and has endless experience in just about every situation.

He shouldn't be a nailed on starter anymore, his form doesn't warrant it but ...
I dont see any reason why he cant continue to be a good part of the squad.

He cant play 3 times a week anymore. His touch when he's tired is horrific.
Pass the captaincy onto Smalling and make use of him as a good squad player (getting dropped has often done his form a lot of good and its overdue at this point).

Dropping him wont help his confidence but it has to be done.

6048~~~
The sad thing is we do have one in Martial, but LVG wants Roon<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I could cry.
If you get beaten by the better team you hold your hand up and say we got beat fair and square. But to be deliberately holding ourselves back like this is incomprehensible.

Woodward's office is not far away from mine, maybe I should stand outside and beg him to sort this out<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6049~~~
Why would he leave £45m that he's owed over the next 3 years?

6050~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://media.giphy.com/media/TW8Ma1a8ZsZ8I/giphy.gif" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/TW8Ma1a8ZsZ8I/giphy.gif"/>

6051~~~
Jesus...£45M? Thanks Moyes. Make sure Rooney gives you your cut<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

6052~~~
Starting to believe there is a clause in his contract saying he has to play every game. Its getting beyond a joke now.

6053~~~
Give me a break! Do you honestly expect him to slam Rooney in public. He deserves criticism for fielding Rooney, but he's hardly disrespecting the fans.

6054~~~
Sick and tired of him. People saying that he deserves credit for putting in an okay shift game after game where he performs like that need to have their heads checked or removed completely. LVG has been pathetic in not daring to drop or sub him either when we could be exploring our options with younger players and enabling Martial to play at centre forward.

6055~~~
We're royally stuffed.

6056~~~
Why? 

Because you keep picking him, Louis.

6057~~~
I don't expect him to slam Rooney in public, I expect him to take him to one side and explain that he hasn't been performing well lately. That he's going to drop him for a game or two. I expect him to look at the same brutal displays we look on at and recognise that Rooney should be taken off instead of any number of other players that consistently out-perform him.

He is constantly dismissive of other players after good performances, Mata, Hererra and even Memphis after the Bruges game. Good performances immediately followed by LVG quotes citing how they could also do better and improve, yet when he's straight up asked a genuine question about his shit captain, he is "sick of it"!?

I'm a fan & I think it's disrespectful. 
When he shoehorns Rooney in a central role while pushing our best player and only striking threat out to the wing, dismissing any questions about the same, I think it's disrespectful.
When his stubborn, arrogant and persistently failed team selections cause dropped points to feed the ego of a has-been on more money a week than most of his fans will see in their lives, I think it's disrespectful.
Giving Rooney 90mins week in week out while every man and his dog can see he contributes nothing, that, is disrespectful.

6058~~~
I think you're being a bit precious, I'm sorry to say.

6059~~~
As van Gaal's philosophy is built so much around possession I can not fathom how he persists with this dispossession machine. It's insanity.

6060~~~
If you accept mediocrity then that's fine... Not for me.

6061~~~
You can't imagine any player whatsoever doing better than Rooney did today? Unbelievable.

6062~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6063~~~
Was there someone with a Fellaini wig sat in front of you or something?

6064~~~
Well at least he completed 5 forward passes.


Interesting that fourfourtwo has it at 31 passes attempted, whilst the twitter one has it at 35. Probably included some of his first touches in that I presume.

6065~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6066~~~
I don't accept it, but I'm also not desperate to be offended by perceived slights from a manager who's certainly got bigger things to worry about than the feelings of oversensitive fans.

6067~~~
Martial, for one, has consistently done better in such situations.

6068~~~
He's the captain of a young team which is going through a transition with new players in many positions.. Of course he's going to play the majority, specially in the important games.. Today(City home) he made some critical plays defensively but was far too passive going forward.. Shite at corners but that's nothing new..

6069~~~
But he's not 'worrying about the bigger things', he's petulantly ignoring them when asked point blank! 

In the Stretford End today, it was clear I wasnt the only 'oversensitive fan', not by a long shot.

6070~~~
We have one of Germany's most decorated players in the side who has more big game experience than Rooney. So, taking away the "leadership" issue (and, in that respect, I have never mistaken Rooney for Robson or Keane), we are left with a player who is woefully below the standard needed for a team competing at this level. The difference between him and Martial is night and day.

6071~~~
This situation is now coming to a head. It is blatantly obvious that Rooney is now a hinderance and needs to be eased out.  Today he should have be subbed off, with Martial moving into the centre and Lingard taking his position on the left.  The press, and most importantly the fans, may have to make up LVG's mind on this issue as he seems very stubborn right now.

For anyone at today's game did you hear any unrest from Utd supporters regarding Rooney?

6072~~~
You don't think Germany's captain replacing England's captain in an English club would look a bit weird? Not that I think it should even matter, but I can see that turning into something nasty in the press.

6073~~~
Another game nearer being dropped. He's a trier, worked hard against 2 good centre backs, but that's not enough. With a proper no 9 we'd have beaten them today they were poor and there for the taking. We were rock solid and barely gave a sniff to a team that scores goals for fun. 

As for his "captaincy" he got the armband by default, has never been captain material, and the sooner it gets passed on to a genuine leader the better.

Once Young is fit he goes out wide and Martial is back in the 9 slot. No brainer. 

Once Rooney is dropped it's the beginning of the end. PSG can have him on a free I reckon just get him off the wage bill.

Added bonus is that Bobby's record stands (and we all want that don't we?)

6074~~~
Nonsense. It's not 1939 you know.

6075~~~
Screw the press. We need to do what's best for our team. Yes it would be nasty, but we can't worry about things like that right now.

6076~~~
I miss Chicharito!  How many goals has he scored after we sold him ?

6077~~~

6078~~~
Hate to say it but we need more articles like this to start appearing.

6079~~~
Aye.

Does seem to be happening more and more though. More media are starting to report how woeful he is these days. I'm hoping it's his last season with us.

6080~~~
I'm a fan of Rooney but he needs to be dropped, these performances aren't acceptable.

6081~~~
Out of all the things that Moyes fecked up, this will have the longest-lasting and most damaging repercussions.  2019?!? <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6082~~~
fecking hell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6083~~~
Feck off and support Bayern or Madrid then.  Ridiculous.

6084~~~
Giving the cold shoulder to media and worrying about the team are hardly mutually exclusive.

6085~~~
You guys were listening to his press conference in the Stretford End? How is that possible?

6086~~~
didn't know to stick this in the "is Louie scared of Rooney" thread, "post Utd vs City" thread or this.

I wasn't able to watch or listen to the game due to other commitments but managed to follow it via posts on the caf / bbc.  

A ridiculous amount of posts in the utd vs city thread were slating Rooney saying his touch is off yet again, afraid to shoot, passes back rather than going forward, he's lost it etc etc, yet when i posted that it sounded like Rooney was having one of "those" games, i had numerous posts back saying it was the usual gang mob picking on the easy target that he's now become rather than tactics / lack of pace and power / goal threat and Rooney just wants to do it all become others just aren't doing it.

I would personally like to see him dropped as he has been off for years, his touch is bad compared to others and he does seem scared to shoot unlike the old days..but i really do think the slating he's also getting saying he's washed out etc is just so wrong.  Every player goes through bad patches and he's carried United through the last few years when lets face it, the team was shite.  So lets give him a break, back off with the shouting at him as he's a legend for us, bench him and maybe then he'll start to become our new super sub for the rest of the season or something

6087~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6088~~~
Never mind dropping which seems to be a fantasy at the moment, why does LVG never sub him ?

6089~~~
I was referencing his displacement or Martial to accommodate Rooney.

But I suppose.... nothing comes close to the coverage you must get in Toronto.

6090~~~
Cpt always plays. I think he might've been quite literal about the always.

6091~~~
I wonder why no journalists have the balls to ask LVG about that. I have never journos ask such a direct question to a manger ("Why do you keep playing Rooney when he is this bad ?")

6092~~~
As bad as it sounds I'm hoping Rooney picks up an injury just to keep out of the side for a few months. I'd rather he found his form but I'm becoming increasingly pessimistic about his future. I fear a situation whereby he is allowed to continue playing badly and the home fans turn on him. Would be horrible to see that considering how important he's been to use throughout the years, I'd rather he bow out with grace than become a burden.

6093~~~
Straight swap with Stones? I'd take a straight swap with Barry, just get rid of him.

6094~~~
They will do it's inevitable. Won't be with us or starting for England within 12 months I say.

6095~~~
The English media themselves refuse to recognise how shite Rooney has been. So it's why they never bother asking him.

6096~~~
This shouldn't deteriorate into a Rooney bashing thread for the haters, but many valid points have been made. It's perfectly obvious that we're witnessing the understandable and inevitable decline of a once extremely good player. He still works hard and provides leadership, and will still have some great moments, but they'll be much less frequent. Sir Alex seems to have had the read of Rooney, and his decision to phase him out (which, it seems, he had set the table for) may have been wise. At present, we're left with a player who is badly underperforming relative to his contract. A new striker, or versatile forward capable of playing in a number of attacking positions, must be a priority.

6097~~~
They wouldn't let Stones go for Rooney no chance. 

Throw Jones in as well that'll clinch it.

6098~~~
No, just no. I wouldn't have Barry for all the tea in China.

6099~~~
The fact is that Rooney was a top player at a young age and he is now finished. It should be obvious to anyone with a pair of eyes. His pace is gone, his fast reactions are gone, he is no more a top class player, obviously we should not forget his contribution to United during his career as a top class player. But his time is over, we need a much better man up front if we are to progress. I would love for Rooney to come through and start blasting balls into the opponents net. But common sense tells me it is not going to happen, I hope I am wrong but I very much doubt it. He is slower than he was in years gone by.  Lingard would be a better option up front right now, as he is a young player who has the skills needed and is hungry for success. Rooney has no pressure, he could play like a shopping trolley and still be on next match. That is not right in my opinion. Never even taken off, and that sends him the message that he is fine no matter how shit he plays.

6100~~~
He was not rank bad awful today, but he was no better than average with regard to his attacking responsibilities.

With 20 mins to go as Lingaard came one, the sensible decision was to take Rooney off, move Martial across to no 9 position and play Lingaard wide left.  Kompany was on yellow card and the game was begging for Martial's pace and trickery to have a go.  Instead Mata came off, Lingaard replaced him wide right; Rooney stayed central no 9 and Martial stayed  wide left.

I suspect thats simply because Rooney clearly enjoys undrop-able and unsub-able status.  It sucks.  

I think thats what todays frustration is about.

6101~~~
I'd let him go for free tbh, relieves us of his galactical salary and he won't be stinking up the changing room if the manager grows the balls to drop him.

6102~~~
And give his still blinded supporters the excuse of needing games after injury to get back into form? No thanks though I agree with your sentiment. An injury will be the only way LVG doesn't play him.

6103~~~
this isn't a patch, he has been like this all season I'm afraid. whether he is physically fading or not suited to LVGs philosophy (how ironic is that?) he is a constant red flag in the team. Years of service are great and he would have been hailed for it back then and rightly so, that doesn't or shouldn't give him a free pass now if its hindering the team moving forward.

6104~~~
There was a consensus where I was sat that he should be dropped & certainly should have got the hook. A lot of frustrated fans at his performance especially when you have Martial almost wasted out wide.

Personally I thought LVG was tactically naive today. Against Kompany you need to match his physicality & Rooney when on fire or struggling will never be able to do that. Martial for his physical qualities should have been up top today & maybe Rooney wide, even more so as the game got stretched.

Despite that it still wasn't a performance from a player nailing 300,000 dabs a week!

6105~~~
he must be dropped

6106~~~
May have been posted already but

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/400-hidpi/cpsprodpb/A8C2/production/_86320234_rooney_graphoc.png" src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/400-hidpi/cpsprodpb/A8C2/production/_86320234_rooney_graphoc.png"/>

6107~~~
Thank feck for that!

Can the rest of the press please wake up and discuss this farce?!

6108~~~
Kompany was on a yellow card from the first half, putting Martial centre for even last 20 minutes would have caused him problems with his pace and quick feet. Having a basic physical battle with Rooney all game was right up his street

6109~~~
But...eh, he <i>tried</i>!

6110~~~
We have same damn level of resources as those clubs and they wouldn't put up with this shite either, so no, you feck off with your lack of ambition.

6111~~~
Mate he gave the ball away 28 times.

6112~~~
biggest Wayne Rooney here but he gives no one a chance to defend him. Even the late Johnnie Cochran would struggle to defend this guy now.


You shouldn't make any shit defender looks like Nesta mixed by Franco Baresi world class style. The guy is so poor he made City defenders looks miles better than they were.

Even Titus Bramble in his worst form would fit Rooney nicely into his pocket it seems.

6113~~~
If they wouldn't sell Stones to Chelsea for the money they were offering, they sure as hell wouldn't do a straight swap for Rooney.

6114~~~
Mata was even substituted.

6115~~~
Martial is such a better fit as a striker for us at the moment. I'm struggling to see what LVG is seeing. I'm not even saying Rooney is finished but just so out of form its untrue

6116~~~
But your whole point was that he was disrespecting sensitive souls like yourself by refusing to answer questions about Rooney. Or is your real point that you are upset with him for playing Rooney? (which is fine because I am too - I just don't feel disrespected; same as when Moyes was here.) 

Not sure what my being in Toronto has to do with anything other than allowing you a chance to score points in an internet argument - if that's the case, then advantage iKeano!

6117~~~
Yea but Bramble was better than Zidane.

6118~~~
This is all on Van Gaal and his stubbornness is the reason why he won't go down in history as a top manager. There is no way a sane manager would watch that and not only keep playing him but never subbing him off when he is clearly holding the team back, we had City on the ropes and if we didn't have a dispossession machine (stolen) in our attack we could have etched out a few more chances and possibly won the match just as it was vs Swansea. I have had my doubts re-Van Gaal but this farce has convinced me that we need to get rid and bring in someone who is more adventurous and is quick enough to see his mistakes and rectify them - he did it last year with Herrera, almost did with Smalling this year, repeated it with Herrera whilst all the while allowing Rooney to drag the team down to his Sunday league level.

6119~~~
This thread has been far more entertaining than that derby. Keep it up, people.

6120~~~
LVG isn't blind, he can see it too. It doesn't look good to drop your captain, and perhaps he offers a lot in the dressing room that would effect morale if he was left out. He's an absolute liability on the pitch though. He's been a hot/cold player all through his career but he looks totally finished at this point. It doesn't bode well for us if we must persist with him, nor for England at the Euro's next summer. I doubt Hodgson will have the balls to drop him from the national team either.

6121~~~
I still find that stat lost possession 28 times hard to believe. I was sitting infront of his scholes pass to Valencia in the second half, that sailed out for a goal kick. I assumed it was deflected and i was getting ready for the corner <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6122~~~
It's the passing accuracy I find astonishing. To misplace nearly half your passes is unforgivable

6123~~~
I keep trying to believe this, but there must be some way in which we can mitigate the effect he has on our play without dropping him totally. As it is, most of our attacks are broken down by having him as a lone striker. Can we not play him wide left, or deeper into midfield? He still works hard and those traits would be useful there and we might actually see a few attacking moves through.

6124~~~
He is no longer becoming a liability, he is a liability.

6125~~~
i know.  and i contradicted myself by saying i know he's been poor for a year or two but everyone goes through bad patches, and 2 years isn't a bad patch....i just hate the way we booed Giggs in his early late 20s / 30s and he proved us wrong by doing the business for us for numerous years still, same with Scholes (although i don't recall many boos for him)

Rooney deserves a bit more respect than so many are giving him and as much as i hate seeing him in the line up i hate even more how people just jump on the band wagon and slate the guy...

i think i'm just torn between supporting a legend and dropping someone who's just not good enough currently yet so many are saying things that are shocking

6126~~~
Don't want him anywhere near that midfield. We now have the players in there that are knitting together nicely. All it would mean is Wayne giving the ball away closer to our goal. Then it could cause real problems.

6127~~~
This is true.

6128~~~
Why would you want to feck around with everything just to keep our worst player in the team?

6129~~~
that's fair, I think most feel the same really

6130~~~
I don't. If i had my way i'd drop him, but it's clear we're not going to.

6131~~~
Ah fair enough, misunderstood.

6132~~~
this is the general feeling i read and given his post match stats i can't disagree with it.  in fact that's what i wanted to start with (martial as no. 9 with another on the left wing other than Rooney) and he shouldn't be playing.  i do also think his time is up as a starting xi on current form

but like i just posted in another reply, i hate the jump on Rooney bandwagon like so many did with giggs....but he does need to be dropped, i just don't agree with what's being said about someone who in a few years time people will be fighting for to get his autograph as a united legend

6133~~~
He was playing better sit in the hole rather than the main man up top. I hate to say it but his legs are looking shot, he's not getting about the pitch anymore. 

The crazy thing was people talked about dropping him back into midfield when he finally started to slow down, the reality is he's not very good on the ball, I doubt he'd get in the midfield of a top club. Where we go from here is anyone's guess but I think we're seeing the end of Rooney.

6134~~~
Does it count as a pass when the ball comes to you and just bounces off your boot in a random direction?

6135~~~
Yeah I seem to remember him taking off McNair because of his 'poor performance' but persisting with RvP for ages despite him being next to useless. It's understandable in a way but it also means that he's letting his more established players away with worse performances.

6136~~~
Spot on mate and that battle in which Kompany thrives, Rooney would never win.

6137~~~
To the reporters asking about Rooney's form:

6138~~~
Amazing. Even the English journos are noting he was shit.

The funny thing is, I think he's had even poorer performances than today recently.

6139~~~
'<b>W</b>hen Wayne Rooney scored at Goodison last weekend, people queued up to tell us why, actually, this is why you don’t write off the man. The last two games have demonstrated that, in his current guise, disappointment is the rule, not exception.

It’s not just that Rooney is offering nothing to United’s attack; he is hampering it significantly. Anthony Martial, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera can do all they can to take attacks so far, but at some point their team-mate needs to get involved. Then all promise turns to dust.

It is as if Rooney is playing with lead weights under his shirt, labouring around the opposition half like a 35-year-old League Two striker telling everyone who’ll listen that he’s still got it. He completed nine passes in the first half, and gave the ball away seven times. There is an increasingly familiar Old Trafford groan reserved for a Rooney pass straight into touch. It is becoming the soundtrack of his decline.

The bizarre thing about Rooney is just how much goodwill he retains from those within the game – he is effectively immune to criticism.

Here is his game in numbers: No shots on target. No chances created. A passing accuracy of 55% (the lowest on the pitch). Lost possession 28 times (highest on the pitch). One touch in the opposition penalty area.

Yet the only reaction from Gary Neville was to twice praise Rooney for his defensive work, while Martin Tyler remarked that he was “defensively responsible at 30”. For a striker, that should be the ultimate damnation by faint praise.

The person with the most faith is Van Gaal, who continues to start Rooney to the detriment of the team. Memphis Depay has struggled to settle in during his early months in England, but at least with Depay, age provides reason for patience.

More importantly, playing Depay on the left would allow Martial to operate as a central striker. For a manager who demands movement from his forwards, it is difficult to see how dropping Rooney wouldn’t assist United’s creativity. Van Gaal must surely now be at least considering that option.

In terms of this game, the biggest crime was that Rooney stayed on until the final whistle. He may once have been United’s magic man, the player who could conjure something out of nothing to win you the game, but that time has passed. He was a 90-minute passenger.

“Sir, I have to talk every week about Rooney,” said United’s manager to a journalist in his post-match press conference. “Why? I don’t give any opinion. Sick of it. You have your opinion, write it.” Not as sick as some United fans are at the free ride given to the captain.

When having faith that Rooney could rediscover his greatness, bear this question in mind: What did he excel at?

The three most obvious responses to that question are pace, power and positive aggression. Not only do all now look lost, but these are impossible characteristics to switch on and off. You can’t just decide to have more pace or add ten times more power, and the aggression in Rooney’s game has been reduced to swearing in the direction of the officials. He has become a parody of the jaded striker, a brightness dulled by the rigours of his career. He is the old fighter still stepping into the ring but now being punched from rope to rope.

So the question to Rooney’s backers is this: What are you waiting for? Rooney isn’t naturally fit enough to regain his missing athleticism. He’s played too many career games to find the effervescence associated with his early years at United. He has never been the type of striker who you would expect to redefine his style in order to prolong his career.

It’s all very sad, but there’s a shell of a player where Wayne Rooney used to be. Van Gaal is one of few who must still have faith, and even that is waning.'

(<i>Football365</i>)

6140~~~
Bigger game today though.

6141~~~
I was under the impression LvG is ruthless and cared less for reputations. Unless we're all missing something obvious Rooney is playing on past reputation. He should be nowhere near the first team. 

I don't think he's even worth a place on the bench.

6142~~~
Sorry to break the news, but we've been mediocre for several years now.  Probably best to support another team if that's unacceptable for you.
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6143~~~
Probably is just because we have a lack of strikers, numerically. 

He is robbing Wilson/Martial of that no.9 slot though.

6144~~~
What's the deal with strikers dropping off a cliff lately, though? Torres, Falcao, RvP and Rooney all went from good to atrocious in what seems like a matter of months. I guess you can blame it on injuries for Torres and Falcao, but the astronomical drop in performances are incredible to say the least. I can't remember strikers from when I was a kid going from world class to sunday league that quickly. I guess Shevchenko sort of did, but you've got players from the 90's generation like Del Piero, Inzaghi and Totti who were or are still doing it in their late 30s.

6145~~~
Thanks for posting that Steve. Can't argue with any of it. I feel sorry for Wayne in the fact he is shadow of his former self who wants to give his best, but unfortunately his skills have gone. Funny Gary Neville is mentioned, it actually reminds me of his decline. Except of course he realised it had happened and did something about it.

6146~~~
I still think he is capable of scoring lots of goals and contributing, but he needs to be dropped for at least 2 weeks and recharge himself. Hes not the player he once was but i don't believe he is shot, hes only 30 and is rarely injured. He looks burned out more than anything

Van Gaal needs to show that no one is undroppable

6147~~~
Is that a stat provided by the BBC? Think that's misleading because they count inaccurate passes/crosses as losing possession. Which is absurd IMO. He misplaced 14 passes; had 4 inaccurate crosses; was dispossessed 6 times; and had 3 unsuccessful touches. Doesn't even matter that much because it was an awful performance.

6148~~~
If we get a striker in January or even next summer, his days could be numbered.

6149~~~
last year it was silent domination, now its his defensive work.

6150~~~
Absolutely spot on article.

6151~~~
We are still in October, and had no summer international tournament. What will he be like next year after the Euros?

6152~~~
Linking up well with Steven Naismith and Gareth Barry, I hope.

6153~~~
I'm wondering if he's gone down past the Torres at Chelsea benchmarks. I remember the CL games vs Chelsea when a ball played into Torres meant United would get possession in the next 5 seconds. Right now, when Rooney gets the ball, I'm looking to see if there's anyone close enough who can clean up/fight for the 2nd ball after his touch or pass.

6154~~~
Stuart Mathieson at MEN has actually spoken up about it,which is surprising and kinda brave.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-united-0-0-manchester-10329199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...rts/manchester-united-0-0-manchester-10329199</a>

The media are slowly coming around, it seems.

And the 365 article was excellent, sums up the situation.

6155~~~
He wasn't as bad as the stats suggest. He had some good moments and worked hard in the first half. He wasn't poor, he was just average. I suspect that this is his top level now. Average players score goals too and have good games from time to tme. But United can't afford to carry average players if we want to win titles. It's an illusion to think that he can reinvent himself. He lacks the physical attributes to do it. Giggs' shape of body and mobility was completely different. He was far more flexible than Rooney even when he retired. This Rooney lacks explosivinness, flexibility, good enough close control (unlike Giggs and Scholes). He may have some very good games till the end of the season but he seems finished at top level.

6156~~~

6157~~~

6158~~~
of all those undroppable/indispensable/highest paid players in the world, we are easilly getting the worst return. it was probably the worst and stupidest contract extension in the history of club.

6159~~~
Feck this shit, Louis. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

It's a good start, but we need a lot more voices turning against him and fast.

6160~~~
He's done.

6161~~~
The club proper fecked themselves. Better bite the bullet and pay him off or he'll bloody ruin us.

6162~~~
Took the press long enough to catch on....

6163~~~
I think for some of the press , they dont want to be one to call out Rooney and then subsequently proven wrong

See <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Es-RIBnba8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alan Hansen</a> or <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/31/sport.comment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rob Smyth</a>  . So its better to wait for someone to go first and then ride the bandwagon. 

Others, simply have vested interests in Rooney for whatever reasons.

6164~~~
What really annoys me is that when he is asked about his form, instead of admitting that he is poor, he always says the same thing: "I only get shit because I am Wayne Rooney".

6165~~~
That Rob Smyth article - O dear <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

Poor guy - literally just before the best season we've seen at United since 1999 in terms of relentless attacking football that ended with the PL trophy in the bag and almost the FA Cup and CL too.

6166~~~
A club like Manchester United should have a striker who can contribute to the overall play when the scooring boots decide to take a break. Rooney is a quality player but 2 goals out of eight is just not cutting the cloth. You can argue that he is not getting the chances, but its about making the runs and giving yourself that extra yard to set your chance up. The goal at Everton was a perfect example and he still has decent pace, but he keeps sticking in the same position waiting for a bal before being beaten in the air or physically. A striker these days can not stick around on one spot, you have to create unpredictability and make the defenders question their position. RVP at his prime was an excellent example of making those runs and having defenders questioning what to do next. Still many games to play for him to turn it up a notch, but the noise of critics is getting louder and louder.

6167~~~
Thats the thing, a lot of people were saying similar things about Fergie, but that one stuck out and he cant live this down even today.

Most of the press don't want to be the guy that wrote "that"article about Rooney. Cowards, yes..seeing as they are fond of laying into the non-favourites.

6168~~~
I couldn't care less about Hansen (I wasn't watching football back then) nor about Smyth (his article was stupid considering United did a lot better in the 2005-06 season compared to the previous 2 seasons). All signs for a steep decline are there and Rooney is not the only striker suffering from such and turning quickly into has-beens these days (see RVP, Falcao, Torres, etc.). Furthermore, the journos who follow the national team must have seen that Rooney has done feck all in recent times bar scoring a few penalties, no?

6169~~~
I'm sure they do..but he's England captain and All time top scorer..he will be held by high regard by a lot of them..Also most of them really arent United fans, and will not care about the effects on our results.

For them, it will be something like Van Gaal's "weird" tactics or his poor teammates to blame. To admit that their best player and greatest hope is over the hill at 29/30 is a tough pill to swallow. 

Some of them will have a relationship with Rooney himself,as he has been a fixture for such a long time in English football.

6170~~~
100% it isn't a bad patch of form when you've been on a steady decline for almost 18 months, we all just didn't think it would happen this quickly.

It's over.

6171~~~
Yeah. That sort of response makes me sad and mad all at the same time. The club, people around him, agents, media etc have all created a monster (ego wise that is).

6172~~~
Funny. People and media already called Michael Owen a has-been when he was around that age, and he also used to have that tag of "best player/greatest hope".

6173~~~
Nice to see that headline news on the BBC website is an appalling piece defending him.

6174~~~
But Owen was struggling at Newcastle at the same age..this is the captain of the NT and of the biggest team in the country. Of course both are done, but I am giving reasons why the press may have been giving Rooney such an easier time. He's getting the David Moyes treatment from journos.

Eventually even they will not be able to dress it up. Except for maybe Gary, he wont dare criticize him.

6175~~~
Ok just heard from two fellow fans who were at the match.
One said people around him were getting on Rooney's case after one of his inexplicable wayward passes.
Another one said people beside him were adamant that he needs dropping. 

If this continues, can't say I feel too confident that the match going fans won't make their feelings heard in a big way...

6176~~~
Absolutely finished. Been saying it for ages and there is no way this is just a form issue now. His good games are now the exception and with him in the team it's like playing with a man down. I can only think that Van Gaal doesn't want to rock the boat too soon but it's fast becoming a situation where there is no other option but to drop him. He's a total liability.

And that BBC piece saying he's not a 9 is just more excuses. We hear it time and again that he's best as a 9, then when he stinks the place out he's a 10. It's just a repeating cycle of a player that not good enough anymore.

6177~~~
The best praise Rooney could've been given today was a 90th minute shove in our own box from an opposition set piece. It's going beyond infuriating at this point.

6178~~~
IKR. Shit attempt to defend him.

At least, Jermaine Jenas shouts that Rooney is finished as a number 9. However, he's crazy if he thinks that playing Rooney as the number 10 will help him anyhow. We already tried that several times and to no effect.

6179~~~
Has anyone thought of this...

LVG us known to give youth a chance when they're ready, correct or not (Kluivert, seedorf , muller, iniesta etc etc)

Whoever is at fault, be it Louie, woody or the club, we basically have two strikers on our books as Wilson just aint ready.

Maybe, just maybe Louie doesn't want to put martial in as our number 9 this season.  Be it because he doesn't want to put the pressure on the young lad, burn him out, wants him to get to used to the physicality of our league,  whatever the reason is.

Hence his only option right now is to play Wayne up front.

Come on folks, he's just broken the England goal record, on par with our legend law, quickest guy to score x goals by the age of 30.

Do those at the match also not think he doesn't feel or hear you all sighing and booing him.  Imagine going to work and before you even sit down people complaining about you. Think you're gonna do a good job that day.

I think we just need to get behind the lad, bad game or not, till we get a replacement in and then we clap the lad off into the sunset as a united legend who just burnt out too soon

6180~~~
It's a piece from Jermaine Jenas, I doubt any one gives a feck about what he has to say.

6181~~~
That's the crazy thing. People will say he's finished as a 9, but then will say oh he needs to play 10 and get involved in the game, he can still effect things with his great stamina and selfishness for the team. Apart from the fact he has zero creativity, an awful touch, and no agility to beat a man in tight areas. It's a real shame to see him fall like this but it has to happen some time. There are better options for the team now, he needs to be benched until he can show CONSISTENTLY that he can be a threat. Not just 1 game every couple weeks when people get on his back.

6182~~~
I'm sick to fecking death of the British press treating him like some sort of God. He's like bloody royalty nowadays because he's England captain.

They totally overlook his appalling run of form whearas they'd absolutely slaughter him in years gone by.

6183~~~
He is shite.

6184~~~
It really is. Sad for me as ai said it when he signed. Shafted ourselves to keep him.

6185~~~
The Football 365 article is spot on. After 13 years of top flight football he has lost the physical explosiveness that made him a special player. That is not coming back.

6186~~~

6187~~~
He's never been 'the man' in world football but somehow United and England have managed to fabricate this.

I appreciate his efforts and he has been a great player at times but I get sick of the re-writing of history when it comes to this player. He really didn't become the player we thought he would.

His wages and his media reputation would have you thinking he was at one time on the level of Messi, Ronaldo or even fecking Kaka for those two years.

He was never that level.

6188~~~
There was a time when he was one on one with city's LB and a lot of space behind. I knew 100% he wasn't going to go past him and he didn't disappoint.

6189~~~
You have a good point about not having Martial taking on all that responsibility. But if so, why not put Martial on the bench and give him a breather? Instead he's starting him all the time. So I can't believe LVG is that worried about throwing Martial into the deep end but who knows?

On the fans supporting him - the problem is, the more you support him the more he thinks he's not doing anything wrong. It's precisely what the club have done - and as you can see it's causing massive issues for us now. When he's interviewed and doesn't want to acknowledge that he's not been playing well, you know he's in complete denial. Plus, as with most footballers, he has a massive ego - so it's unlikely he'll willingly reach the point where he accepts his performances have not been good enough. Maybe he does need a bit of a hard time to get the message?

6190~~~
Wow. Great article. I concur with every word.

6191~~~
If he has to play, put him on the left. The midfield 3 needs to stay the same, and Martial needs to play up top. Those are the only certainties about our team, along with Smalling and De Gea always playing. We should keep our spine the same every week, especially in big games, and not move Martial out wide to accommodate Rooney, because the way he's playing, he really doesn't deserve to push anyone anywhere. And besides, he still puts in a shift defensively and has always been a good crosser of the ball, so perhaps he could improve his form out wide with Martial stretching defences up top.

6192~~~
He really is holing us back as an attacking unit so badly right now.

I mean, he didn't even play <i>that </i>badly today (at least by recent standards anyway). He worked hard, defended well...but he just offers nothing up top. Absolutely nothing. No physical presence, no pace, no holdup...literally any ball into him to get him in on goal has to be perfect, or the defender has to make a mistake.

Its like trying to cut a joint of meat with a blunt instrument,

6193~~~
First you theorize and then you conclude from the assumption. Why wouldn't he play with Martial as #9 when he's shown he is the only player at the club capable of doing so? I see no logical reason for not doing so. Besides, we've got another supremely talented player for the left wing. 

I can't assume the reason for playing Rooney upfront when it's not working is logically sound. There is no evidence to back that up, just the assumption that a manager must know right, similar to "maybe Rooney is his old self during training"...

Falcao...

6196~~~
Are the Independent supposed to make us believe that? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> This is on par with all the propaganda shit that is sold in North Korea about Kim Jong-Un.

6197~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The writer is casting for the <i>BT Sport’s Champions League comedy club.</i>

6198~~~
Yep. The similarities between Rooney this season, and Falcao/RVP last, are clear for all to see.

6199~~~
Yeah, he is useless despite trying hard, that's sad to see.

6200~~~
So, we have: 

Then...

The mind boggles.

6201~~~
Not only does he get to start every game, he gets to play the whole 90. 

Would have liked to see Martial centre forward and Mata behind him when subs were made.

6202~~~
Yeah its pretty painful to watch atm.

6203~~~
Rooney is finished simple as that, he was a few seasons ago, SAF had him gone then Fergie retired and golum signed him on a stupid contract.  There are no excuses or angles to take on it, playing in the wrong position and all that shit, as a footballer he is f*cked, he is so frustrating to watch, he regularly displays poor ball control, poor short range passing and in particular, poor decision making, if you lose a yard of pace as you age, understandable, but it is so much more mentally fundamental than that.  LVG doesn't feck around, that is just as clear, so what is going on here is a bit odd, politics of some kind perhaps, for me, this particular situation is without doubt the biggest issue around the club at the moment.

6204~~~
He doesnt contribute anything

Its even worse being in the stadium and seeing it. His movement is terrible, he gets in the way of other players and right now is a detriment to the team.

There seems to be a lot of Rooney apologists though or those trying to find a way to justify his performance (like blaming others eg other people arent running, or the position hes playing, or hes better suited to bigger matches, or its his hair...)

Forget numbers though, just from watching the match, you can see how terrible he was. His first touch so bad, his second touch is a tackle. So frustrating.

6205~~~
He has been an international and a first team player since the age of 17 and all those games have done a toll on his body.

I dont doubt his effort at all but the touch has gone, the pace and power has gone, the passing has gone.\

6206~~~

Supposedly a touchmap of a United #9

6207~~~
We would have a right to blame a number of unhealthy habits in his lifestyle as well. If he took good care of himself, I don't think we would talk about matches having a toll on him.

I only wish the board just cut the grass under Moyes' feet in the Rooney saga in 2013 and that many of us (including myself) were not kissing Rooney's feet that easily back then.

6208~~~
He did get very close to goal, though. <i>Our</i> goal, but goal nonetheless.

6209~~~
Agreed and when you compare to Ronaldo who treated his body like a temple and worked his arse off to be the best.

6210~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6211~~~
Yep, and Ronaldo is a single father on top of that too; it's all credit to him for keeping himself fit and being still one of the very best despite.

When I look at Rooney's situation, I think this is where clubs should find ways to make sure players are fully accountable for their physical shape through healthy lifestyle habits. Anyone who steps out of line (of which physical fitness would be seriously impaired as well) should face consequences (fines, getting dropped, etc.) at any moment and regardless of past reputation.

6212~~~
I gave him a 2/10. That's generous.

6213~~~
It's actually quite amazing how United relied for so long on world class strikers bailing us out under Fergie, to all of a sudden having to carry mediocre strikers who offer nothing for the 2nd season now. At least we know that in Martial we have one who will be one of the best in the world without a doubt in the near future and can perform brilliantly at his very young age, but it's just dependent on how long is Van Gaal willing to put up with Rooney up top? Last season he gave Van Persie and Falcao both a few months of constantly keeping them in the side to prove themselves, but then ended up giving up on both of them around February time I think? Which isn't too ridiculous, as at the start of the season when we signed Falcao and RvP right after the world cup, everyone still thought of them as world class strikers, same with Rooney. So 5 months or so later and Van Gaal completely drops them to the bench and decides he's getting rid. Not many managers would do that so quickly, even if the fans were saying it for a while. I don't think he'll be afraid to drop Rooney when he gives up on him though. For today, you could say we didn't have proper options really as Young was injured and Memphis has been in poor form just as Rooney has been, and it was the derby. Next week though, if Young is fit, I wouldn't be surprised to see him start on the left with Martial up top. Just hope that doesn't mean dropping Ander.

6214~~~
The Rooney problem is something that needs to be addressed immediately as it's clearly the biggest impediment to both our short and long-term success.  Ignoring it isn't a solution, and if we think it's bad now I shudder at the thought of what the Rooney thread will be like in another year or two.  He's on the hook for another £250-300k/week until June 2019.  Based on past behavior, I just can't see him leaving elsewhere unless he got paid the terms of his current contract, even if that meant rotting on our bench.  It's clear we need to be rid of as a sulking Rooney isn't going to help matters.  But in all likelihood, for Rooney to move on would require United to subsidize a significant portion of his wages.  I just can't work out any other solution than this.  Who'd be willing to pay his full wages in his current state?

It's not likely that Rooney will score 14 more goals by the end of the season to break Sir Bobby's scoring record, in fact it'd actually be a small miracle if he did.  I really hope the scoring record doesn't play any part in LVG's decision-making for sticking with Rooney.  For whatever reason, LVG is unwilling to bench Rooney, let alone sub him.  One can only hope that LVG will do what he must in the summer and that the club would support him.  Wish he'd simply live up to his reputation of having big enough bollocks to bench anyone.

Giving Rooney a 5-year extension should have been a sackable offense in and of itself.  Fecking Moyes.  <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> IIRC, plenty on here were quite satisfied when Rooney got his extension.  This and the Moyes' hire should be a constant reminder that no club is too big to be exempt from massive repercussions brought on by bad decisions.  Making Giggs our next manager would also qualify.

6215~~~
No shots on target. No chances created. A passing accuracy of 55% (the lowest on the pitch). Lost possession 28 times (highest on the pitch). One touch in the opposition penalty area.

6216~~~
I'm hoping that LVG is giving Rooney every opportunity to prove how shit he is to the likes of Woody and the Glazers to get them to put up the cash to get rid of him next summer.  I'm trying to see his inexplicable squad status in a positive light, because I agree that he should be nowhere near our starting 11.  We would've been laughing at this form if Moyes had the balls to sell him to Chelsea back in 2013.

6217~~~
I agree with most of what you said but there's a difference between the manager making what you consider to be bad calls and him disrespecting the fans. His irritation at the media does not mean he's disrespecting the fans.

6218~~~
That 365 article is spot on.

6219~~~
Hes played near 60 games a season since he was 18. Rushed back from injuries when he should have rested. Plus he hasn't taken care of himself like Ronaldo, it all adds up. If he didn't have such a ridiculous contract where he is getting a 1m a month, I would give him a month off, in the hope he could rejuvenate himself

6220~~~
Is it just a Rooney issue, or is it our style of play, Fallcow, RvP & Rooney have all been pretty dire up top for us over the last 2 seasons. 

Rooney has always been a player who has to play into form, but it's now getting beyond a joke. Van Gaal needs to address this issue one way or the other, but as we're so short on striker options he's kinda in a difficult situation.

6221~~~
All 3 of those mentioned players are past it, play style isn't the issue, take Martial for example

6222~~~
I don't buy tactics and formations not accommodating, even his biggest critics don't bother about him scoring if he at least doing the basic right. The most infuriating about him is that he manages to look like a nobody on the field, failing to trap a ball, failing to pass 10 yards under no markings, failing to win a "SINGLE" header (bar the one he did on our box) in not just "ONE GAME" but consistently for 18 months. Beggars believe, put anyone with sunday football experience and they can still pass the 10 yard pass without being intercepted, anyone in our youth setup can probably make that pass, let alone Wayne Rooney

Everybody lost form and ability with age, nobody holds it against him (I didn't), but take a look at Teddy Sheringham, Henrik Larson, Berbatov, Giggs, Scholes, Carrick, Rio, Vidic, Evra, and any other 30+ players, even 35 years old professional footballer didn't fail that badly. Even Scholes can still do the 10 yards pass.


What happens with Rooney? It's one of the biggest mystery in world football.

My theory is just his instict, brain and reflex still belongs in the 18 years old wayne's world, while his body is declining and he didn't retrain his basic. I played football myself, when I was 20 my brain told me to pass there, with x speed, and voila, it reaches where it's intended, but nowdays the same train of thoughts would get the ball moving slower because my motoric is getting weaker. I have to add some more strength to reach the same result.

He should really retrain his basic and getting his body and mind recalibrating, he should accept himself that there's something terribly wrong with his performance and acknowledge the problem if he still wants to have a top flight career in football.

6223~~~
I felt so sorry for him when he tried dribbling yesterday, one of the slowest pieces of movement I have seen in the last couple of years. He's really past it.

6224~~~
Can he control a ball anymore. Seemed like every time a ball was passed to him it came bouncing off and then he was in a fight for possession. Reminded me of Falcao last season.

6225~~~
Dispossed 6 times
Unsuccessful touches 3
Missed passes 15(out of 31)
Acc crosses 0/4

So he lost the ball 24 times, hit 0 out of 4 crosses. But to be frank I thought statistics in this case didn't show the entire story. He was still a lot better than he has been this season and showed a lot of desire and motivation at least. He hasn't set the bar high at all, so being one of the best display of the season doesn't matter a lot of course. We still want a world class player, not a liability.

6226~~~
It's only a few days since Phil Mcnulty said there's "... No case for Rooney not starting up front for England at the Euros." 
So according to the BBC's main man his form is not even worth debating. Nothing to see here. Everything is just fine. Move along...

6227~~~
Let him start for England, and continue his abysmal performances for them at major tournaments..but please, not at United..we've had enough.

6228~~~
WTF is that, he's the striker isn't he?

He wants to be everywhere but the team won't pass to him, they want to pass to a striker who's halfway back in the circle, when the teams needs bodies in the circle he's jogging sluggishly to the opposition box.

6229~~~
Style of play has to be a factor. Unless they're willing/able to dribble past people and create their own chances (i.e. Martial) being a striker for us must be a grim experience. Lucky to get one decent chance per game. Often less. That's no way for any striker to get any kind of form or momentum. Rooney's all-round play is so bad that it's obviously not <i>just</i> an issue with the creativity of the team but it's fairly obvious that this isn't helping.

6230~~~
Couldn't put that any better.

6231~~~
Yes, it is easy to carry an over the hill striker if your team is constantly creating chances for him to put them away. 
Problem is even if it may be a problem for Rooney, I don't think it is bad for the development of the team. Van Gaal is building from the back which many great managers aspire to do. The fact that we were not overrun by City in the midfield was a positive from yesterday given they have butchered us in that area in the recent past. (Of course, lack of Silva helped as well). Rooney at his peak would have made us more creative as well, right now he is in a state where he can be carried by others.

6232~~~
He was unbearable to watch and should have been subbed. However 6 goals in 14 games isn't that bad

6233~~~
Mata, Memphis, Schweinsteiger and Hererra aren't making us creative either. I really hope they aren't all over the hill too.

6234~~~
Schwein has not been the creative fulcrum for either Bayern or Germany in the recent seasons. For NT for example, he pretty much played as a pure DM allowing Kroos or Khedira to play more attacking role. He is playing more B2B role for us, especially alongside Schneiderlin but it remains to be seen if he will be a contributor to our attacking output. 
Out of the other 3, I would say Mata is the clear disappointment for me. His attacking output is good for us but I expected more from him when we signed him. Some will say that he is playing on the right but he does gets the freedom to cut in at all times. 

In any case, I am not disputing that we play in a rigid system with less freedom for attacking players. But I don't agree that is hampering individual performances to the degree that one may think. Athletico Madrid and Chelsea in recent seasons have played very rigid systems as well, yet plenty of attacking players and strikers at both clubs have done well.

6235~~~
It's going to be a nightmare when he's eventually dropped, he'll kick off about it, he's done so everytime he's not been selected in the past, then the media will be on the story each fecking game/presser like vultures, distracting our season.

Then theres the problem of the fact he hates not playing every game but is on such an inexplicably large contract that anyone he could conceivably start for wouldn't be able to offer him 1/3rd of his current wages.

6236~~~
Well Schweinsteiger seems to have that air of having a bit of fun before he hangs up his boots. Not sure he has that drive to win he had before. Memphis could very well turn out to be another Zaha. We will have to wait and see. No doubting the talents of Mata and Hererra...but the way LVG intructs the team to play seems to be stifling any creativity...which always needs an element of risk.

6237~~~
He can't kick up a fuss because he's genuinely shit, If he was on form scoring a couple of goals every weekend then he could argue his point. The squad, especially our strikers and wingers would benefit from Rooney being dropped as one or two of them would be back in the squad, they're not going to side with Rooney on this one. The media response does not matter, they have zero control over our squad selection and I can only hope we have a manager in charge who isn't scared of dropping someone because a certain player has friends in the media. This all boils down to the manager, he has got the final say on who starts for United.

6238~~~
TBH I think LVG's rather irritated reaction to questions about Rooney (did you see his face go redder after he said 'I'm sick of it') could be interpreted as him being frustrated by Rooney as well. But he's in a bit of a dilemma. Drop Rooney and an unhappy pissed off Rooney could totally tear the dressing room apart. Just a theory mind.....

6239~~~
Another straight to the point article.

6240~~~
We have made a rod for our own back, of course Rooney will have a strop if he is benched. He has spent his whole career both for utd and England getting starts and not being subbed despite his form because "he needs to play himself In to form". No other player gets this to the same degree, they get made to play themselves into form
In the reserves. Now all of a sudden people expect him to take being benched with good grace? It's too late, rooneys ego needed a boot up the arse and taming years ago but no one had the balls, not even saf until it was too late

6241~~~
I think the longer he is untouchable then it will tear the dressing room apart anyway. If he is dropped and we start performing properly they will soon get over it.

6242~~~
Probably true, which means LVG needs to start growing some big balls.

6243~~~
55% pass accuracy
0 shots on target
0 chances created
0 take ons


"Works his bollox off and did well in protecting defence from their set pieces"

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a joke.


Must be hard defending him when even the stats won't mask the fact he was abysmal yet again. He might not have been the worst player on the pitch every single game (he was in this match, though) and, sure, som has been as bad as him once in a while (noone denies that), but there's a reason for this wave of criticism - good, solid performances are now the exception, not the rule anymore. Of course, when someone stinks up the place for 30 straight matches, chances are that he will be more and more criticised as each game passes by with him letting us down again. But yeah, we're the haters, ruling out the chance that we actually care about the team rather than some individual's feelings.

I'm glad the media are starting to pick up on it. Will be interesting to see for how long Rooney's spin doctors will be able to keep up with this charade.

6244~~~
It is when 3 came in one game, 3 in 13 games from a main striker isn't good.

6245~~~
Very worrying indeed, at this point it's been too long for him, I'd rather blood Pereira/ Lingard... Can't we talk him into being a nearby retirement home worker? He would be just as happy, but appreciated

6246~~~
If he is dropped and never given a look in he will walk, I tell you. Like Gerrard he is too proud to accept a squad role at this stage in his career.

6247~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Wow, those stats are terrible. 

I agree that he didn't seem that bad when I watched the game - not that he seemed particularly good or anything. 

50% passing accuracy ffs

6248~~~
He's holding us back now and so is LVG for playing him. Come on Wayne, hang your boots up!

6249~~~
Those two are finished too.

<atrial has had no problems scoring goals when playing as a centre forward!

6250~~~
i think can gaal is deciding whether it's time to be done with him completely. i agree that he is unlikely to accept a squad role, so the choice seems to be to either start him or sell him. it seems reasonable to me to give him every possible chance to come good before pulling the plug completely, especially given his stature at the club.

6251~~~
Couldn't even hit the trademark diagonal long ball to Valencia either yesterday <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>, tried it once and it went straight to the corner flag.

6252~~~
<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Actually went to the whoscored thinking I could find something positive as I thought he deserved some praise for the game but those stats are indeed horrific, probably the worst I've ever seen myself. Just shows how off statistics can be sometimes if you don't also watch the game.

6253~~~
Watching Rooney makes me sad.
Listening to Van Gaal rave about Rooney and insist that he must always play makes me angry.
Seeing the Independent give Rooney a higher rating than Martial makes me laugh though, so, every cloud.

6254~~~
He would have a wail of a time, all those naughty Gilfs, we could even buy him a retirement home and be better off.

6255~~~
LVG needs to find another solution to this dilemma before it does more damage to us.

6256~~~
You know, it wouldn;t be so bad if it was just his explosiveness which he lacked. The effects of age and loss of fast twitch muscle fibres are naturally going to account for a loss in bursts of speed. The thing that irks me the most when watching Wayne is his first touch is so heavy his second touch is often an attempted tackle. I don't know if it's through instruction or that he has bought into the silent domination rubbish that he needs to be more static up front to be an effective lone striker. I'd be inclined to believe it's the latter since when Martial plays there his movement is constant and dangerous.

I think half of it is physical depreciation and part mental but I guarantee one thing. We will never see the Rooney of old, or even last season. He hasn't adapted his game. I don't know if it's the coaches responsibility or his, or a mix of both, but he should have concentrated on refining his touch and passing by putting in extra hours on the field with a view to becoming a less mobile, but more creative force. Instead, these qualities that once were second nature to him have also been allowed to rot.

I wouldn't be surprised if he concentrates on nothing but finishing in training in order to reach his laughable boast of 20+ goals as the main striker. However, he never gets close enough to the goal to offer a threat and if you watch his movement, it's static at best. Often he just stands in between both defenders when he should be offering support to the right sided forward. I can't even be bothered to address his negative attitude to passing, it feels like he makes more passes to Smalling then Mata in the average game. His back is always to goal and the only solution seems to be to play him on the left or right since he has become undroppable. A sad state of affairs indeed.

6257~~~
Wayne Rooney - 7 out of 10
After turning 30 on Saturday, the United skipper led from the front. Delivering a display epitomising his responsibilities, his most memorable contributions came in front of his own goal.

Anthony Martial - 6 out of 10

Had little room to manoeuvre on the left wing, a position Louis van Gaal has insisted upon lately, and inevitably cut an isolated and frustrated figure.

What kind of <b>bog eyed cnut </b>could come up with those ratings I ask you?

The Times had it right. Martial 7, Rooney 5.

6258~~~
5 is par, in my opinion, relative to the player and the circumstances. So Rooney was probably a 5 relative to his own abilities (shite), but given it was a derby and was an opportunity to go to the top of the table, Rooney was probably closer to a 1. Equally weighted, he was a 3.

Science.

6259~~~
My predition: Rooney will be sold next summer...........

6260~~~
Thanks Professor <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

 I personally have 5 as below average. Below 5 is starting to border on ineptitude, 6 or 7 is average for me, and anything above that is a more than decent performance.

6261~~~
I agree. Moyes was so full of himself for Rooney signing that extension.

If I remember correctly, it was sold to the fans as being a great deal because the club would have to spend a fortune in fees and wages to replace him... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6262~~~
The club was at such a low ebb, that we were willing to do anything to keep what we saw as our best player. He and his agent took advantage of that and was given a ridiculous contract. It's the second worse decision of the club in the last decade after the appointment of Mr Moyes. In normal terms, he's untransferrable because no one is willing to take up that contract. First of all, I don't think Rooney is willing to leave England. He has said it on several occasions that he doesn't have the desire to play abroad. There is no one in this country that will pay him anywhere close. Chelsea, Arsenal and City won't want him cause he isn't good enough to start and he doesn't want a bench role.
Even if we give him a free transfer, Everton will not pick up his wages. This is Bill Kenwright we are talking about. The only way a transfer happens is if we give a free transfer and subsidies his wages with over £100,000 till 2019. I want to see how Ed explains that to his employers.
I think we are going to have an Adebayor situation on our hands.

6263~~~
If only we had a manager with real balls Rooney would engineer his exit in the summer on his own, if he gets dropped and loses his default starter status he'd be making noises in January because his Euro 2016 place would e in jeopardy and by May he'd be so pissed that he will feck off into the desert without needing the gentlest of pushes. If we drop him, he is done here!

6264~~~
The system we play requires a player with certain skills,which neither Rooney , RVP or Falcao have. In their peak, they would have been perfect, but now they are all struggling . Its the same reason why I wasnt worried when Falcao left us for Chelsea, It wasnt only the system that was the problem, its also the player fading badly. I would feel the same if Rooney left. I have seen Rooney put equally absymal performances for the NT especially for at major tournaments. This perfomances are no suprise at all.

The reason that Martial excels there is that he has the skills required for an LVG system, good first touch, fantastic hold up play and generally maintains his position within the forward line. That makes the job of the players around him easier and brings others into play. With Rooney its the complete opposite, the other players have to do both their jobs and compensate for some of his failings.

If anyone saw his performances this Summer for England, you'd see that its more than a system thing , Think for example his performance against Ireland. He's been quite poor for a while now as a forward, however now he has mastered the art of consistency in doing that .

A lot of people seem to be surprised at how poor is he has been , but I am not. Remember that he played as forward for us at the beginning of LVG's reign, he was then changed when LVG said he didn't like that. After a major part of the season out of the forward line, he was brought back near the end of the season and was still very poor( That's when we were subjected to the silent domination rubbish) . We tried it again this year, he was still terrible and moved Martial there who was for some reason not hindered by the supposed system at all. For some inexplicable reason, he's been moved there again, and unsurprisingly the old problems with our system have arisen again. 

He simply doesnt have the skills to play forward for us anymore, and  I dont not expect a sudden upturn. I'd hope he would be dropped or moved to left wing(That brings with it its own problems), but something will have to give soon.

6265~~~
Hopefully.

Since when did running around with purpose become enough for a player to be classified world class? And why then doesn't Valencia get the same vindication?

Its obvious to see he's holding us back. A world class striker and we'd have at least 4 more point this season, possibly more.

He should at least be benched until he regains his form. And none of that crap about him needing to play to recapture his form, cause he's been playing for the past year and is still crap.

6267~~~
He had zero touches inside the penalty box in the first half.. and I'm sure it was the same in the second one, maybe one or two. Explain to me how a CF can neglect his primary responsibility of being a focal point and a target for wide players to play to. I applaud his desire of always wanting to be in the thick of the action, his industry and defensive contribution. But to do this at the cost of your primary responsibility is an unforgivable offense. What if Schweinsteiger decides he wants to score more goals and moves up the pitch all the time ?? Will Van Gaal be happy ?? Or if Darmian or Rojo drives along the flank with no care about defensive duties ?? Will Van Gaal keep mum then?? 

Yesterday he was the difference between the two teams. A better CF and we would have won the game. Sticking Martial to the wings is a criminal offense not because he is being wasted, but Rooney fails to get us the goals.

6268~~~
I think I first said that I suspect something fishy with his contract last season, and that view was ridiculed. Now it is starting to seem more and more like the only plausible explanation.

Rooney is not only not good enough for Manchester United, he is not currently good enough to be a Premier League striker.

For those insisting he would get 20 goals this season, I have no idea how they thought/think he can do that. I sometimes laugh at how terrible we would look if not for a much-criticised deadline day move for Martial. We would not qualify for the CL next season, and go out at the group stages for certain in this one.

6269~~~
We would be in desperate trouble without Martial. That is looking like a genius signing now. I would be having nightmares if we were relying on Wayne Rooney for goals.

6270~~~
All the stuff about him playing into form. If it was like Harry Kane and the work and threat was there, but all the problem is about putting the ball in the net, then fine. He might now be getting that right. However Wayne is offering absolutely nothing. No pace, no assists, nothing. In fact he is a menace to his own team. He has gone completely. You would expect him to be in form by now after 14 games and a couple of England games.

6271~~~
It's bordering on "feck you" here. not because he is playing like this, but rather because he doesn't say "hey, boss, I play like an outhouse, can you just please sub me/give me time off to find my old self?"

6272~~~
No mate. He's also stealing a wage. He took us for mugs at a time we were grieving Sir Alex's retirement and conned us to give him such a silly contract. He now needs to do the right thing and feck off to MLS.

6273~~~
Now he's being slated for not refusing to play. Awesome stuff, redcafe, the thread that keeps on giving.

6274~~~
Seriously. Are people expecting Rooney or for that matter any player to go up and tell the boss. "Hey!! I am in s**t form and looks like I will never improve. So don't play me"

6275~~~
Not read the whole thread but I don't think that is what he is being hated for. It's more of a number of things from his past by threatening to leave to City, to his massive contract, to his performances only being worsened by Massimo Taibi's performances at United. Add that to the fact we have moved Martial who is a much better player out to the wing...

6276~~~
He just cant control a ball and pass it on anymore. So many attacks he messes up. It's shocking really. He's been playing so poorly lately that he should be benched

6277~~~
Yes, Neville did that a few years ago but Rooney doesn't come across as someone who would do that.

6278~~~
That's effectively what Gary Neville did.

6279~~~
Pity we don't have a Ronaldo type waving his arms about in frustration everytime Wayne misplaces or miscontrols a pass. While his teammates are quite happy to put up with getting slagged off for all his frailties then nothing will happen.

6280~~~
Gary didn't do that, he retired. And making that decision is easy at 36. Anybody expecting Rooney to do the same has his head in a cloud. This will be down to the manager and no one else.

6281~~~
I seriously dont...I doubt even Falcao would do that..its the manager to take him out..so all eyes are on LVG.

Rooney is awful, but try telling him that. In a sense, its this self confidence  and self belief that gets this players to the very top, but may also be what hinders them from seeing what everyone else sees.

6282~~~
Against Villa,who was it Rooney was having a go at when he gave a shit pass towards the end of the game? I so wanted the player to tell him where to go.

6283~~~
Maybe as you say the players have to give some back. He is quite happy to yell at them. Well Wayne you have to be able to take it as well.

6284~~~
Would be a long time coming. Fecking Moyes..

6285~~~
Some pix from Wayne's birthday celebrations. Funny Smalling photos. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6286~~~
Best bit about those photos (aside from the lovely ladies) is that Jones's missus appears to be pulling a Phil Jones face.

6287~~~
It looks like Jones is holding hands with his GF and Smallings whilst Smalling is thinking: "you might have my girl, but damn your ass look fine in dem jeams" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6288~~~
Wow...rooney is looking old....

6289~~~
fletcher looks cool as feck <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

6290~~~
No one from the Spanish contingent at his party I see...(getting my spoon out here<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>)

Seriously, the rumour I've heard is that apparently Rooney doesn't have a must play clause in his contract, but that <i>United</i> are payed a certain amount of money each time he starts or plays (whatever) for image rights...if this is true it's over to Ed to sort this out....

6291~~~
What.In.The.Name.Of.Christ.

Seriously...is Rooney sleeping with journalists?

6292~~~
Paying them more likely

6293~~~
What about just selling the notion that Rooney has lost his right to feature based on form? A manager sells a system and other stuff to make sure the team plays well, and that includes justifying why he drops this guy or that guy. I don't think any other player in his right mind would seriously believe that Rooney deserves to be among the untouchables. If anything, keeping Rooney among the untouchables will create the unrest a lot quicker than doing the opposite.

He better be, but not until LVG simply ditches him out of the starting XI to make everybody understand that no one is above the manager, not even the captain.

David Moyes, you're one hell of a shithead.

6294~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

Football 365:

6295~~~
Yea, but Charlie Adam, Elmohamady, and Almen Abdi don't show as much passion, and they don't play CM/#10/LW.

6296~~~
feck, man. That's an insane stat.

6297~~~
He is almost entirely useless. We would be better off playing without a striker and an extra man in midfield.

6298~~~
If LVG refuses to drop Rooney which should be apparent to everyone by now, why won't he at the very least stick him out on the left where he can do the least harm?

6299~~~
I am crying.

6300~~~
If he sticks him on the left, then when he is eventually dropped, the media will say it because LVG stuck him on the left. Like last season apparenty his poor performances was because LVG stuck him in midfield and not no9.

The media are quite funny tbh, last season they were crying for Rooney at 9 (LVG pointed this out at the start of the season), now they are saying he needs to play as the 10.

I personally think the time is coming, Rooney will be dropped and the media will have no excuses to throw at LVG when it happens

6301~~~
If you looked closely at forward passes stats though you'd clearly see that Rooney is the best player in the league.

Forward passes.

6302~~~
Nah, van Gaal loves him and rates him. Ditto Giggs. It's the manager after Giggs that will inevitably drop a 36-year old Rooney forgetting the £400k a week 5-year contract he will have signed in 2018.

6303~~~
Disgusting thought. That's one more reason to tell Giggs to learn his trade somewhere else if he ever wants to manage United, and not until all of his mates are gone.

6304~~~
The amount of people in here with powers of precog is frankly astounding.

6305~~~
I have certain powers. I envisioned Moyes being here for 6 years despite results and this image stuck so hard in my imagination that I believe this is what caused his dismissal.

6306~~~
I see. Well feel free to envision Wayne stinking up the place for a bit longer if you think it will have the same result.

I'm a man of faith so just make sure you deliver.

6307~~~
i was sitting infront of that pass. i assumed it was deflected and going to be a corner

6308~~~
I am disappointed in you. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6309~~~
Also from Football365:

"Let’s have a reminder of Rooney’s performance in statistics: No shots on target. No chances created. A passing accuracy of 55% (the lowest on the pitch). Lost possession 28 times (highest on the pitch). One touch in the opposition penalty area."

I can't understand how we continue to carry him so defiantly despite all the evidence - statistical and visual. It's got to be a contract-related issue now. Thinking over what he could reasonably be expected to contribute:

1. On-pitch leadership - Shockingly absent. All he seems to contribute is to abuse the officials...once in a while...
2. Motivational talk - Going by the documentary and all his interviews, he's hardly the most eloquent. I reckon 'Mike' Smalling could do a better job. And that's without talking about Bastian Schweinsteiger. Also, perhaps he could do this as a "non-playing captain"?
3. Leading by example - OK, this just makes me laugh...
4. Exemplary loyalty - Errrmmm...

All said and done, he's dire and whether that's form-related or a permanent decline, no title-winning team can afford to be shunting its best player (Martial) around the pitch and benching another quality attacker (Herrera) to make way for the mess that Rooney is now...

6310~~~
The leadership thing, who was giving the motivational speech and had an arm round Lingard when he came on at Everton? Herrera. Him and BFS are always shouting and gesturing to their teammates. Rooney only gets involved when moaning to the ref is asked for or not. Was it BFS who went straight over to Martial when Coleman fouled him and Herrera who was moaning to the ref and still managed to get onto Rojo's cross.

6311~~~
Ana Ivanovic <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6312~~~
I said at the start of the season that the likes of Bony/Benteke/Lukaku were better strikers then Rooney, and got roundly laughed at.

Truth is, you could probably name 50 better players then Rooney in the PL thesedays.

6313~~~
So when can we expect him to beat the goal scoring record if that is the only reason some people want him around? Feels like dragging your 14 year old half blind, half deaf dog out for one last hunting season.

6314~~~
Shame really, he was great player at he peak of his powers, but this is sad to watch. Been trying so long to find something positive in his game, but I'm not blind to see how poor he's become. Still won't kick him while he's on the ground like some of posters, it's not cut for me, hope rest of you have fun.

6315~~~
I said in the summer that Berahino was better than him and got similar.

The sad thing is, I think it's very obvious that this should stop being referred to as 'a spell of bad form'. I see, especially against Arsenal and City, a man who is trying so hard and giving his all, yet he just doesn't have the legs anymore. He's done.

The truth is,forget Manchester United, I can't think of one single Premier League team that would be better off with him in their team, perhaps Bournemouth now that they have lost Callum Wilson.

6316~~~
Just touching on something from the last page of posts: He is comfortably the worst captain United have had in my lifetime.

He's not a leader. He's a charity case at the minute.

6317~~~
Ana <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6318~~~
The only top club I know where the team is carrying the captain. Should be the opposite.

6319~~~
Agree with all of that. His body simply isn't doing what he wants it to do anymore, physically he's absolutely shot. I guess that what 14 years of top flight football + poor genetics + a relatively unhealthy lifestyle (in comparison to other top players) does for you.

I said a few weeks back that we wouldn't get into any starting XI in the top 10, but tbh, I think I might revisit that and say top 15. I just can't think of many teams he'd improve. Same as Falcao last season. He's living off his name and reputation.

6320~~~

6321~~~
One of the lads I go to the game with said "He looks like a fan who has won a competition to play centre forward as captain"

6322~~~
Even my fecking mum can see he is a completely useless player. Questions like I get from here that I can't answer:
"why is he playing so deep?"
"why are the midfielders more advanced than him?" 
"How does he have no first touch?"
"Where did his left foot go?"

6323~~~
Plenty of moronic comments below the article. We need to move him back to no.10 apparently - I forgot how great he was there but thankfully they've reminded us.

6324~~~
as dominant as Drederick Tatum, battering Rooney's Homer Simpson.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6325~~~
it's all in the tea leaves fella..trust me.

6326~~~
It's starting to look like Scholes' assessment of Rooney may indeed prove to be correct.

6327~~~
which one? before the world cup he correctly stated he is older than his years, last week him and Rio were saying he needs pace around him

6328~~~
Agree with that, I am not kicking him either(at least not like some other people). I just wish he fecks off from our first XI because it's stopping us playing decent football. I couldn't care less about other things.

He was right..the annoying thing is he himself has completely abandoned the position, and its never seem more true.

6332~~~
Got to be the most pointless compilation video I've ever seen.

6333~~~
He was saying the other day that Smalling is in the top three centre halves in the world. 

I think Rooney has a fair shout of being amongst the top 3 centre halves too on this season's form.

6334~~~
I still can't get over this...

<b>Almen Abdi</b>
I had to Google who he even is. 547 minutes for Watford in the league so far this season. 1 goal but 0 assists this season.

<b>Patrick van Aanholt</b>
Plays for (and has been destroyed as a defender playing for) Sunderland. One of the worst starts in the Premier League ever. Decent player on his day but if it hasn't sunk in already, let me repeat it. <i>He. Is. A. Defender. For. Sunderland.</i>

<b>Ahmed Elmohamady</b>
Isn't even in the league this season. His time was playing as a right back for Hull as they got relegated last season. 10 games including Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and us at home with Spurs and Southampton away. And he <i>STILL </i>created more chances than Wayne Rooney as a striker for United.

<b>Charlie Adam</b>
Has scored more than Wayne Rooney in the Premier League since the beginning of March. FFS.

6335~~~
yet hes our top scorer this season. Don't you just love irony

6336~~~
He is, but 3 were in one match against Bruge, 1 in the Capital One Cup. Where we could do with more goals in the PL he only has two. Not good enough.

6337~~~
Because he scored a hat trick against a god awful, and half depleted, Brugge side. And 1 against fecking Ipswich.

Against proper opposition he has 2 in 9 games.

6338~~~
Not to mention he knew feck all about his goal against Sunderland too.

6339~~~

6340~~~
Pretty damning this. And people laugh when I say that he isn't a top 150 player nowadays.

6341~~~
calm your tits i know. I was laughing at the Irony of that statistic not using it to defend him. He doesn't even deserve a spot on the bench in current form

6342~~~
According to the MEN he has been granted a testimonial next summer. So anyone thinking he will be gone in January, think again.

6343~~~
Can we not give him one in the summer and say goodbye then....<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6344~~~
He was never going to be going in January anyway. It will be Summer at the absolute earliest, and even then I doubt we'll be able to offload him.

6345~~~
I can understand about a testimonial for the time he has been here, but the way he is playing atm, not the best time to announce it.

6346~~~
Sorry who thought he was gonna be gone January? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

6347~~~
He was never going to go in January, though. If he is going to leave it will be in the summer but even that is a long shot given how the manager is terrified of taking him off to press for a win against title rivals we had put on the ropes.

6348~~~
I think some were hoping, not a cat in hells chance.

6349~~~
One of those matches where he has the touch of an elephant. 

More surprised by his positioning though. He kept dropping deep and stayed outside the box. Should be tactical instructions from LVG.

6350~~~
Does anyone think Rooney and the people at the club are aware that most fans are pretty pissed about his continued inclusion in the starting 11? Honestly, I went to most newspaper sites today and our fans are saying the same thing we are here. Some are even wishing for him to be injured. A bit surprised fans are out on the mainstream sites voicing those opinions. Just can't see how this can go on.

6351~~~
Most match fans still sing his name. I think I managed to convert a lot of people in my quadrant though by keep shouting 'sub Rooney off' or 'feck off Rooney'. Had a lot of people backing me.

6352~~~
oh yeah fat chance that will ever happen. I just think that if certain players are benched and rightly so for their performances it should be across the board.

6353~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Getting a testimonial in the summer: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-testimonial-10335465" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-testimonial-10335465</a>

6356~~~
I'd assume United pay attention to what is being said on fan forums and social media.

6357~~~
I really hope so...

6358~~~
Am I the only one being a bit saddened by this whole situation? I want him dropped because he's useless but seing a player who's been so good just lumbering around the pitch is sad and I feel a bit sorry for him. He shouldn't be playing and his state of mind can't be good right now.

6359~~~
Don't know what to do with him. Spark seems to be gone. Relieve him of the armband, give him a rest, rotate him a bit. Needs rejuvenating.

6360~~~
I wouldn't worry about that. They know very well the opinions the vast majority of fans have.

6361~~~
Can't see a player getting a testimonial and being sold in the same summer.

6362~~~
Looks kind of like Giggs did for us in 2007/08, where he was visibly declining and needed to start being rotated and managing his games to get the best out of him. He just looks tired in every game. Still think he can make a big impact for us, he just shouldn't be starting every game. It's come to the point where he needs to reinvent himself really to prolong his career as Scholes and Giggs did, and he definitely has it in him to do that, so I don't agree with people saying we should sell him. Just shouldn't be starting.

6363~~~
I can almost hear a little girly "meh" when he skips over his leg <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6364~~~
what tools do you see he has exactly to do this?

6365~~~

6366~~~
Jesus, it gets worse every time I watch it.

6367~~~
If you don't know what tools Rooney has in his locker after watching him over his career I'm not exactly sure it's worth explaining really...
You can't say he's lost it all, not yet. Players often look well below their actual level once they start declining and they aren't adapting their game to their body declining. His overall performance will hugely improve I think once he sits out of the team for a while and starts fighting to get back into the team, to prove himself but also when he just isn't starting 2-3 times a week.

6368~~~
whats Rooney thinking, hows the Linesman supposed to get to that. Fair play to him for trying though

6369~~~
he had 1 touch inside the opposition's box all game.

6370~~~
Thing I don't understand is, what happened to the whole LvG's approach of "Limit your touches and get in between defenders."

He's getting far too involved as a #9.

6371~~~
City were expecting "silent domination" after last season's fixture, so Rooney had them completely fooled by serving up some "resounding suckery".

6372~~~
His testimonial has been announced.

6373~~~
My favourite moment was when he turned up in the middle of our midfield, tackled Schweinsteiger, then gave the ball away. If that's tactical instructions then I don't think me and LVG are into the same sport.

6374~~~
His time is up here, he looks burnt out, no disgrace, many great players have gone through the same at the club, he deserves a testimonial, he did some sensational things for us over he years and the club we are we rightly should recognise that but he has been so poor it is unbelievable he is still starting and captain, the English media not going over the top as he is important for their Euros, United media are rightly questioning LVG though and have irked him, I would say after another mediocre effort at the Euros from England the floodgates will open and it will snowball from there.  Again though, as one of his biggest critics the past few years of his decline as a top player, and his contractual antics that were hard to digest, he did some great things here over the years, just watch some of the highlight reels from seasons gone he is unrecognisable, seems he peaked and burnt out early, he has after all being playing in the PL since he was 16.

6375~~~
A good third of the length of that "highlights" was him getting stitched up. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Also, at 1:33, he wasn't doing what a 9 was supposed to do. His job there was to lay it off, and get in the box, instead of peeling round and taking Herrera's job and position, who I wouldn't blame if he was pissed off and confused at what Rooney was doing there.

6376~~~
Thought i'd check out his goal scoring after reading that statistic from earlier today. So here's the goal table for all of 2015 so far in only the Premier League.

20 - Harry Kane
18 - Sergio Agüero
14 - Jamie Vardy
14 - Olivier Giroud
14 - Christian Benteke
12 - Alexis Sánchez
10 - Bafetimbi Gomis
10 - Mame Diouf
10 - Sadio Mané
10 - Saido Berahino
9 - Graziano Pellè
9 - Romelu Lukaku
9 - Danny Ings
9 - Diego Costa
9 - Glenn Murray
7 - Riyad Mahrez
7 - Nathan Redmond
7 - Raheem Sterling
7 - Juan Mata
7 - Theo Walcott
7 - David Silva
7 - Eden Hazard
6 - Georginio Wijnaldum
6 - Cheikhou Kouyaté
6 - Diafra Sakho
6 - Dusan Tadic
6 - Ander Herrera
6 - Jonathan Walters
6 - Jermain Defoe
6 - Nacer Chadli
6 - James Milner
6 - Charlie Austin
6 - Steven Gerrard
6 - Wayne Rooney

6377~~~
He only has that goal because Martial pitied him enough to bang it in off him.

6378~~~
Hopefully it doubles as a farewell.

6380~~~
Not making any excuse for him, since his performances have been dreadful, but I think van Gaal's idea of football doesn't suit him at all. He's at his best when he gets more on the ball and he's asked to do the exact opposite. Furthermore teaching his players to play with their brian and not with their instincts, as van Gaal calls it, is also the opposite of what he needs to do.

6381~~~
This is interesting. Maybe if he was only playing 20-30 minutes a game coming off the bench and could sprint more, and just starting in the cups to give us some experience and leadership with more youth figuring in, he'd actually be helping us instead of hurting us? 

In this case, he'd be Martial's useful backup until Wilson beats him out at some point. We'd buy someone versatile (like Griezmann or Reus) to play either as the 10 or out wide with Mata or Herrera as other options at the 10 or out right and hopefully Memphis starting on the left and maybe 2 of Januzaj/Lingard/Pereira not loan and here covering both wings and the 10 spot.

6382~~~
Yep. Too many are too quick to write him off and just say "sell him". He can still play a very valuable squad role, both in terms of his presence in the dressing room, and also what he can offer on the pitch. He just can't be treated like a 25 year old full of energy anymore. He's always been someone where you thought he could decline early, but he is 30 after all, the age where players usually hit a decline. So he needs to understand that he can't play every game anymore and be effective in them. But yeah, he can still start games, just not every one. A sub appearance now and then, sometimes a start, and saving him so he can be at his best in the big games. Just a squad player role, and we all know how useful it was to have squad players like Giggs and Scholes in Fergie's latter years. They didn't play every game, and probably weren't part of our strongest 11 who would play most games, but Fergie trusted them more then anyone in the big games and when managed correctly, they always put in a good performance and looked fresh. When was the last time you could say that Rooney has looked fresh and hungry on the pitch? He's looked tired and generally not all that motivated for months now. Give him some time out of the side to get that hunger back to get back in the team, and so he gets some well needed rest, so once he comes on he can make a big impact like we know he can. 

Anyways, it's not like it has been all that long since he played well. He was probably our best outfield player for the first half of last season. It was only really the last few months of last season where he started struggling, and it carried through to this year.

6383~~~
I don't believe he would accept a squad player role, but i would be happy with him if he did.
Have nothing against Rooney, he just isn't good enough to start for us anymore, as a backup striker that would be fine.

6385~~~
The problem being the best players in the world get paid £300 grand a week not squad players. Rooney does need taken out no doubt but to early to write him off imo.

6386~~~
I think that being a regular is actually hurting his form currently. 1-2 games on the bench might give him that extra bit of motivation. He has been poof before but he has been utterly dreadful for a while now.

6387~~~
What happened to Wayne Rooney? Seriously hes going to be the clubs all time top scorer and yet he puts on such woeful performances like the one on Sunday! His regression is shocking despite the fact that hes only 30 years old, hes actually supposed to be at his absolute peak according to conventional wisdom. I dont think hes being lazy and I dont think its a lack of confidence or desire it just seems like a a complete drop in physical ability. He is not as fit or as strong as he used to be in the past, maybe he needs to do crossfit or something or maybe he needs to sit on the bench and not feel like everything is fecking handed to him.

6388~~~
I believe a rest will be good for him and if he lost his default starter status he will be forced into taking measures to alter his game so as to prolong his career. What Van Gaal is doing right now is not helping him at all.

6390~~~
I must be the only one but I can't see him doing a good job at Manchester United anymore, backup or not, same as how Fletcher suddenly get done at this club despite still being good enough for the PL as he proved at WBA.For me he needs to be sold.End of.

6391~~~
Or rather too late? 

He's been declining since 2012. Offering him such a fat contract was a stupid mistake.

Rooney's game is based on his physical attributes because his close controll is a bit average for a top player. Actually, I don't think there is a top forward out there with a more inconsistent first touch and lesser ability to manipulate the ball in tight spaces. Once his mobility and explosivinness are gone, he is average. He is still capable of class moments but they come relatively rare for an elite footballer. Those citing the example of Giggs and Scholes are oblivious of the important differences between them and Rooney. They were much better in tight situations because of their first touch and superior close control. I think they had quicker mind too. And finallly, they weren't on 300 k per week. It'd be ludicrous to pay a squad player such wages.

6392~~~
Yes he could have a squad role, but this isn't OGS we are talking about who was happy to not always play. Wayne wants to be the main man. LvG needs to do a bit of sweet talking to make him realise that it might be best for the team if he doesn't play every single minute of every single game. It might actually help him to now retire from England duty.

6393~~~
What makes those stats even worse........I bet they have all played considerably less minutes

6394~~~
The 'squad player' thing just sounds like rhetoric to me. I can't see how, having watched Rooney, he appears suited to any sort of role here. Players like Giggs and Scholes, even to the point they retired, still regularly showed moments of genuine quality for us. Rooney is showing no such quality. As <a class="username" data-user="66946, @khoazany" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66946/">@khoazany</a> was saying, Rooney isn't the most gifted of players. He doesn't have the grace of Giggs and Scholes, and when his body no longer allows him to burst past players, his usefulness is very questionable.

It seems some would like him to be a squad player on the basis that that is 'what happens' when top players start to decline - however, there is no actual evidence that Rooney can still offer anything to United. Even at 40, Giggs was usually the only player in our squad who could do certain things - pick certain passes. etc. Rooney is not that player. If anything, Rob van Persie was always most likely to have greater longevity, due to being a more technically gifted player.

I am personally extremely disappointed with Louis Van Gaal. For me, he is going as far as to personally weakening the team's chances of winning a title by insisting Rooney play every game. Some of that is down to him not having better options (at the beginning of the season), but then this is also his fault, he builds the squad, ad obviously misjudged Rooney as some sort of 20 goal striker. I cannot help but think that if we had Martial (or someone useful) against Swansea and Newcastle - we would have made up the two points we are off the top of the league. The Swansea defeat particularly - Rooney squandered every opening we made. I'm not convinced that Rooney will win us more points than he will cost us this season, therefore, if we manage to win the League anyway, the achievement will be great. We would have basically won the league with ten-and-a-half players.

6395~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69330, @Rozay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69330/">@Rozay</a> I agree with your last paragraph. 

Regarding what you said, and has been said in this thread about Rooney re-inventing himself, the only thing that pops to mind that could possibly help us is his eye for that long-range pass over the top to a striker running on that he's shown a few times over his career. Rooney's effectiveness was heavily dependent on his power, pace and flair (which he seems to have drowned with his decline). Take all those away and you have a player who isn't intelligent and technical enough to play at number 10 and someone who isn't quick, technical and powerful enough to play the lone striker role.  

Rooney needs plenty of time and room to turn, take in the situation and pick the right pass and IMO, defenders have identified that all they need to do is apply close pressure for him to be dispossessed or neutralised.

6396~~~
People talk of rest and motivation as a result of leaving Rooney on the bench, but no amount of these factors will rectify the issues that have dogged Rooney's all round game for a number of years. 

His first touch is erratic, his short passing inconsistent and his dribbling more or less non-existent. This hasn't just happened this season, it's been the case for a longer period of time, something I vividly remember arguing on this site in regards to his role as a #10. 

What has been worrying this season is his noticeable lack of pace, athleticism and strength. He still had these attributes and now that they wane all that's left is a great finisher well past his best, capable of hitting a Hollywood ball out wide once or twice a game.

So dropping him won't change the player he has become. It will only serve to quicken the end of his time at the top level. Rooney is a fantastic finisher, that's something I'll always maintain, but when you draw comparisons between the rest of his game and that's of Martial's, the difference is frightening.

Martial is a better footballer right now, and people at the club need to accept that. No amount of motivation is changing that either.

6397~~~
spell it out to me. Youre saying you think he can change his game, and has the tools to do so. Now, unless you have something lined up that isnt number 10, midfield or winger then we have seen what he has to offer in any other realistic position unless you want to try him in defence? Tools, you say...touch, vision, technique, pressing, positional awareness etc You think he has these things going for him now?

6398~~~
This. He's been in a steady decline for years now, and Ferguson called it in 2013 - I seriously cannot believe that people think it's "too early" to write him off. That said, he deserves respect for what he has done for the club in the past but now it is time to move on.

6399~~~
I am with <a class="username" data-user="78347, @Kag" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78347/">@Kag</a> How does resting him teach him how to pass 10 yards?how does it teach him not to come to deep? win duels wi defenders? hold up the ball, improve his first touch. It's not like he looks tired. He's running up and down just fine, even say too much.
He simply has lost what made him a great player. His pace, explosiveness and agility have deseted him. With that,nais confidence has gone.
There was a moment on Sunday, when he got the ball on the end of a run and had a decent angle to shoot from just inside the 18 yard box. Top Rooney would have banged that across the keeper but this pretender tried a reverse pass.
Anyone that thinks his performances will automatically improve after a period on the bench is fooling themselves.

6400~~~
Fergie said because of his physique he always has to be in tip top condition, that was in his mid 20s. when he gets suspended or injured he needs 3/4 games to supposedly get back to normal. If he is burnt out by end of October what does that say?

6401~~~
Even when he signed this contract many people here were not happy at all with it.

6402~~~
I think he still has all the same things he had before, but he's just not showing it as he can't handle playing every week and for 90 minutes. He needs to change his role in terms of how much he runs around on the pitch, and in terms of how much he actually plays. Definitely think being turned into a squad player would make him more fresh and pretty much every part of his game would be hugely improved compared to what it is now.

6403~~~
And rightly so. A lot of people called it that the club would be stuck with him.

6404~~~
The thing that gets me is, even in his younger, fitter years, he wasn't playing 90 minutes every game. It's all very strange and kind explains why some people are thinking there might be something in his contract.

6405~~~
There have been a few posters mentioning the system not suiting him, and while that doesnt excuse his current inability to do the basics I do wonder if there is something in that, he doesnt exactly come across as the brightest tool in the box, so could the slow patient game be giving him too much time to think? If you look back at his most magic moments they are almost all instinctive moments of brilliance, where he doesnt have to think but just lets his skill take over.

6406~~~
I think it's his intellligence in general that fails him. I agree the system calls for patient build up but it also requires A LOT of movement off the ball that he doesn't give and acceleration in both the speed the ball is played and bursts of movement during those accelerated passages of play. He obviously doesn't offer much in either scenario.

6407~~~
I think he already changed that tbf. 

Apart from the last game against City which he actually looked up to it in terms of running and chasing down everything(what he didn't show in that game is the quality on the ball), he is actually quite reserved when we are out of possession, and he rarely does any pressing anymore. Most of his running is when we have the ball, only problem is that he isn't making good runs, but I think it's quite obvious this season that he isn't running a lot when we don't have the ball, but is actually telling other people where to press and when to run while he just stands keeping shape and trying to read the play mostly. 

Someone posted that analysis after the Everton game which was quite funny, IMO, but it had few gifs where you could notice it quite easily. Van Gaal is using him this season completely differently in comparision with someone like Moyes who wanted him to show his old energy.

6408~~~
You might be into something if he can pass 10 yard to his team mates atleast. 

It's the basic that he fails at,  basic like winning header,  first touch and short pass. 

No amount of leadership and silent dominations can be deemed good enough in place of the basic. 

It's like having a posh sound system on a car with a flat tire.

6409~~~
I wasn't talking about that, nor praising him for anything. I just said that I think he already changed his game to help him being better when in possession, but he looks even worse now.

6410~~~
id say a lot of our players would prefer and excel under another manager. What we are giving up in flair we seem to gain in an organized unit. Cant keep moving the planets inline for this guy though. the players dont suit him, the position doesnt suit him, the manager doesnt suit him, style of play doesnt suit him etc

6411~~~
That's what I'm trying to say, the problem is bigger than simply trying to fit in to the philosophy, the problem is he suddenly become a pub player who can't trap/pass a ball, no amount of tactics/formation can benefit from a player that fails at the basic. 

And I disagree, unless LVG instructed him it's always as if he's hidding behind the opponent, he makes himself unvailable for a pass, if you watch the game closely he'll take a pass, pass it back, and just jog into the nearest defender and stay there. 

no one is going to find him with a ball unless they're xavi.

6412~~~
I am not sure you get what I was trying to say.

6413~~~
hahaha, maybe, it's late in here <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

insomnia nite <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6414~~~
He'd not be any good as a squad player, Scholes legs went but as long as we were on top and could protect him his passing was still an asset, Giggs was a naturally gifted, skillful player with lots of creativity who took care of his body and was genetically suited to playing longer with his wiry build.

Rooney is not a great passer and is the opposite of Giggs when it comes to genes and looking after himself. His game was about explosiveness over the first 10 yards combined with his power and endless energy, these are the things that defenders feared and that got him in positions for goals. He doesn't have any of these attributes anymore and them fading has exposed his average passing game and erratic first touch much more severely.

6415~~~
He also wouldn't be a good squad player because there is no way he would quietly accept that. He'd kick up a fuss like the last time he was rightly dropped under Fergie and we'd get the usual PR campaign by his team.

I honestly think the best scenario is to just accept Van Gaal won't drop him, let him stumble through the rest of the season and then in the Summer start the process of getting rid. Although the testimonial in the Summer sort of ruins that dream.

I really don't think I could bear to watch Rooney as our main striker for 2 or 3 more years, it's so depressing.

6416~~~
He is shite.

6417~~~
Shame he's going to be rested. Probably his best chance to get on the score sheet for a bit.

6418~~~
if he continues to under-perform and is dropped then they really don't have a case to "play the victim." we've given him fair bit of chances to perform already and he's failed to do so.

6419~~~
A pity that the "we" there clearly doesn't include LvG end-to-end. It does in the sense that he's the one that's given him the chances, but he's clearly in no mood to jettison the captain just yet...

6420~~~
He already got on the score sheet a few times this season, hasn't made a difference to his overall performances in the games after.

6421~~~
Xavi Hernandez continues to speak utter madness. Qatar is a lovely place and Rooney can play in midfield.

6422~~~
I wouldn't say it's madness at all. Quite measured in fact. He's saying he's finished as a striker and it's time for him to learn to adapt. He's not saying he's a midfielder now, just that he's an intelligent player so he should be able to adapt.

6423~~~
I thought we had given that a trial last year with disappointing results? Maybe news of Rooney's lacks of control and passing accuracy has been slow to reach Qatar.

6424~~~
He said "if he can adapt". He recognises that it's a process and that he won't suddenly be a great midfielder. He's also saying he's a shit striker now, I don't get what's mad about it.

6425~~~
Neither, actually seems a very good assessment from Xavi, if anything. He has a very good understanding of the game, would be interesting to see how he'd fare as a coach or manager.

6426~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> But managing and coaching requires more than just a good understanding of the game! I'm not sure how he would handle big time Charlies in a team.

6427~~~
<a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> hes saying Rooney can play at the top level for another 5-6 years if he can adapt. That's nonsense. As a top level player, he's done. He doesn't have the first touch to dictate a game from the centre, his passing range is actually quite limited, and his positional awareness leaves a lot to be desired for. So moving deeper will cause us more problems.

6428~~~
Playing this brand of football also exposed how poor his first touch is, and although everyone know about it, in the past it was masked with different brand of football played under SAF. Think that best example is THAT goal against City, everyone remember him scoring the screamer, but what people fail to remember is how he almost cost us that chance with poorly passed ball to Berbatov who tried to play 1-2 with him. But somehow Scholes got the ball, gave it to Nani and we know the rest. Nowdays when he fails simple pass it's more noticable because of techical football that's been played, and the lack of action in final third, shame how he's fallen from the grace, but since no one is bigger than the club really hope LVG sits him on the bench, sooner the better!

6429~~~
I think his poor performance is partly due to his captain position, as the manager said it himself Rooney is an automatic start. This is causing Rooney to relax too much, because he knows he doesn't have to work for a place in the team. Which is causing his ability to play, which effects his touch, his passing choices, his lack of goals, his effort etc. The domino effect.

Rooney has to be dropped not for the squads benefit to play decent football, but for himself aswell to improve his performance again. I just imagine if LVG did come into the club and slammed the starting sheet on Rooney's lap and say "you're benched, if you wanna get off it show me that you deserve to be in team both in training & on the pitch". We would probably see a different Rooney right now, either a sulking one or the one who works hard and scores alot of goals to prove he is the main guy. LVG is doing that to every other player except Rooney. These special treatments have to stop and if Rooney wants to start being a proper captain, he would of told the manager himself to drop him.

6430~~~
How do you know he's going to be rested?

6431~~~
He was a bit shit already under Moyes, in the second half of the season (13/14). His form has everything to do with his loss of explosiveness and agility and very little with his captancy.

6432~~~
I think Rooney's intelligence is a bit overstated. He has an eye for a pass but his mind doesn't strike me as particularly quick. Besides, there is no such thing as a monolytic footballing intelligence. A defender can be very intelligent with regard to his duties and a bit thick when it comes to reading the game in midfield or attack. Being intelligent as a forward doesn't guarantee that you are intelligent as a playmaker or a midfielder or a defender. There are different types of footballing intelligence. Rooney's intelligence may be suited to a particular kind of position and particular kind of attacking football. To say that he's intelligent per se would be imprecise.

6433~~~
was going to say the exact same thing.  It's literally like he's lost the ability to shoot and control the ball over the last year or two.  He's just not good enough for our first XI based on his form over the last 2 years

6434~~~
That's why i said partly. I'm not excusing him at all because i do agree his ability to play in general is coming to the point where we question that can he play at the highest level week in & week out. What i'm saying is when you see players like Totti, Raul, Giggs etc who lost alot of pace in their game, they adapt their playing style differently to accommodate for the team and also work there arse off to keep playing for that team until the point where they can no longer play. This is where i think being captain and receiving special privileges is not doing any favors for Rooney. Why?

How i see it Rooney is not working hard enough. You probably seeing Memphis working his balls off to get back into starting line up and to prove the manager he is the future but Rooney... he's chilling, not working extra training on his touches, not working extra training on his passing, not doing much target practice etc and full well knows he's going to start next game anyways. I'm not saying that's what's happening because he maybe is but how i see Rooney on the pitch, i dont see effort in him anymore. With his experience his touch should be cool as ice and the passing should be as accurate but instead he looks like a donkey playing football. Which makes me think with all these privileges he's getting is causing him to be too relaxed, not threatened in terms of his position within the squad and doesn't make an effort to work on the part of his game which is causing him problems etc is partly causing his performance on the pitch to be so poor. Obviously numberous thing also in play that also causing Rooney play this poor like the different style of play, new players, his ability play in general etc. But the captain armband in my opinon is poorly worn and it should go to someone who deserves to be on that pitch week in & week out, has leadership qualities and has experience under his belt.

6435~~~
Against competition at a similar level.  Brugge, Sunderland, Ipswich...

6436~~~
Maybe that is his level now.

6437~~~
I dont think LvG is so naive to select Rooney if he is just chilling out in training. 
And where did you get Memphis working his socks off. Hardly saw any progress from his first PL game to the point he was dropped.

6438~~~
And what level do you consider Middlesbrough to be at?

6439~~~
** - a good summary of  the current situation, mostly caused by LvG. Hes done well in msot other departments but this Rooney blind spot must gall other players who can see how sh*t hes been playing of course they won't say it as he has too much power at the club but he should be benched until he improves on the pitch.

6440~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6441~~~
What a load of nonsense, if you looked at his forward passes stats you'd see that he's world class player!!!!!!!!!!!!!

6442~~~
This is a very good post. Fully agreed.

The thing is I've noticed for several seasons that Rooney does not perform when he's too 'comfortable'. He becomes complacent - not deliberately imo - but it just happens. It's like he switches off once he doesn't have to fight for something anymore. It's just a part of his psychology.
What surprises me is that no one at the club seems to recognise this - it's so <i>obvious</i>. Giggs I don't believe has the know-how to recognise these things, but I would have thought someone else at the club would be able to better advise LVG?

For sure though, these 'privileges' aren't helping him.

6443~~~
I think the opposite. He looks to me like someone who is struggling to come to terms with his diminishing powers. He plays devoid of confidence, doubting the ability he still has, and as though he really isn't sure of his role anymore. Part of what made him a top footballer was his arrogance but that has ebbed away now. 

The one thing you cannot level at Rooney is a perceived lack of effort. If anything he tries too hard to overcompensate for his failings.;

6444~~~
I think LVG is wary of killing Rooney too early, he is almost making him force him out the team, so that he doesn't lose the dressing room. We've seen at Liverpool what can happen when you kill a "legend" too quickly, or Chelsea with Lampard. Rooney is clearly a favourite in the dressing room, and that's something we don't want too disrupt. The fact is though he is just not doing it on the pitch, and sooner or later it will become inevitable that he has to be dropped. 

When asked recently, LVG said it was up to the press to write what they thought. I think that was almost coded in a sense that "I know he's playing poorly, but I can't drop him until the world universally agrees". Now that the press are actually getting on his back, he will have the ammo to support the decision.

Either that or he will play him forever and ever.

6445~~~
I think I wasn't too clear. I don't doubt his <i>effort</i> - I just noticed that he has a sort of combative or 'Ill prove you wrong' sort of personality - and that's when you tend to see the best of him. Not having to prove himself means he becomes 'unconsciously complacent'. Once you've achieved everything in the game you need more motivation than ever to carry on delivering the same standards, and I think not fighting for his place is preventing him from having the 'right' motivation.

6446~~~
I'd like to know what kind of material he is serving up in the dressing room, that is so good that it could make the players take the news of his dropping with discontent.
Surely it's worse for morale to see a player who obviously isn't up to the standard on the pitch, getting guaranteed 90 mins every time we play. And whilst doing nothing on the pitch collecting more money than the rest.

6447~~~
Yep I see what you mean. I'm sure he's not as driven as he once was. A seriously rich, family man, in his 30s now and one who has been at the top of the game for a considerable length of time is unlikely to have the same hunger and focus as his 21yo self. Add that to his diminishing physical powers and you've got what we see now ie slow, laboured play, poor touch, bad decision making, risk averse etc etc 

Perhaps being dropped will light a spark in him but I don't think so and we can't afford to let a declining Rooney hold us back now.

6448~~~
nail on head. Perfect

6449~~~
Yeah I agree. In the past, being dropped would have lit a flame under him, but I am also coming to the conclusion that we're way past that now. Big problem if you lose some of your hunger at the top level.

6450~~~
Rooney was shite in that first half. Never got a touch of the ball.

6451~~~
Made no runs in behind defenders at all.

6452~~~
Fecking cnut, invisible performance.

6453~~~
Why did he take the captain's armband off Carrick? That is a very Steven Gerrard thing to do. 

Never saw Roy Keane, Giggs, Neville, Bruce or Vidic do that. I don't like it either

6454~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6455~~~
Why Why Why was he subbed on!

6456~~~
He's just horrible. Completely and utterly Falcao'd without the injury excuse.

6457~~~
He plays without any authority or drive.  He's just too comfortable.  Should have been sold 3 years ago.

Oh, the LRBR crowd can feck off.

6458~~~
Lost the physical part of his game, 14 years playing non stop was bound to catch up on him.

6459~~~
That's the worst thing. He came on at half time and has just bimbled about at 2mph. He's not stretched the centre backs once.

6460~~~
Has played some delightful one-two's with the Boro defense today.

6461~~~
The what crowd?

He's at least looked like he can control a ball tonight. Offering no danger, but at least it's not bouncing off him 90% of the time.

6462~~~
He was equally shite in second half too. <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

6463~~~
He annoyed me less in the first half, I must say.

6464~~~
Even coming on fresh vs somewhat tired defenders, he looks off the pace.

He's NOT out of form. He's just not that good anymore. Like Falcao last season. He is done at the top level. It's sad to watch him play nowadays.

6465~~~
This is becoming disgraceful, like the club should seriously start looking into fining him wages. This isn't acceptable.

6466~~~
Let Rooney be Rooney.  Apparently Fergie was shackling him, if SAF just let him be, Rooney would play better than Messi and Ronaldo combined.

6467~~~
What is LVG exactly expecting him to do, based on what Rooney has shown him this season? it's the equivalent of bring on Falcao right now.

6468~~~
I'm running out of words to express my sheer disappointment at Rooney. What a fecking joke.

6469~~~
Better first half than the second. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6470~~~
Making Daniel Ayala look like Roberto.

6471~~~
Can't we just take him out to the woods and leave him there?

6472~~~
Ah. I thought that's what it might stand for, but figured there can't be enough people that stupid for it to be an actual thing. Pity he didn't shackle his wrists to stop him signing that damn contract.

He now has gone back to stinking up the midfield while Fellaini has gone up front by the look of things.

6473~~~
You can't fine someone for being crap.

Nice little 1 2 with fellaini there. Thought he was going to smash it left footed into the crowd.

6474~~~
I wish he would just go away and never come back.

I'm actually starting to really dislike him now too, He just needs to accept he's done as a top level footballer and feck off. The club as a whole needs to get its act together, Brendan rodgers had the balls to force out a liverpool club legend in Gerrard so why can't we and he was loved by all liverpools fans.

The vast majority of United fans couldn't careless about rooney now so what is stopping them from doing the same.

6475~~~
One touch on the counter brings 6 defenders back goal side of our attack. 

Golfclap.

6476~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6477~~~
Gerrard was in the last year of his contract. Our situation with Rooney is...different.

6478~~~
That counter........

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6479~~~
You can, some of the players may be unh the next day though

6480~~~
I've defended Rooney enough in the past, wanting to give him the benefit of the doubt, but he really needs to be dropped, and left out. Why the hell was he brought on today? Honest to God. Useless. Absolutely useless performance.

6481~~~
I missed that... unnecessary from Rooney I would think<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

6482~~~
Yeah, cheers moyes what a good lad he was giving him that contract <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

6483~~~
Takes some doing to come on as a sub in this game and still be our shitest player..

6484~~~
It's disgraceful if I'm being honest, IMO

6485~~~
You couldn't make it up...

6486~~~
In hindsight he should have been sacked on the spot for agreeing to it and probably slapped.

Luckily he took the arm band off Carrick and demonstrated his quite frankly remarkable leadership abilities. Abilities so outstanding that he actually needs to take the armband off another player before he can even begin to show them. I'm starting to feel like I do have an agenda against him, but my agenda is entirely driven by him being shite. So it's a vicious cycle.

6489~~~
So obvious he'd miss. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6490~~~
had to happen...

6491~~~
Christ the look on his face pre-penalty was like something from a salad fingers cartoon. His head isn't right at the moment.

6492~~~
How many straws can you load onto a camel's back?

6493~~~
He seems determined to make himself more and more hopeless with each passing game.

6494~~~
An animal in his condition would be put down.

6495~~~
What a man! Captain steps up for our first penalty and fecks it up.

If you have any pride, drop yourself.

6496~~~
He's conditioned me into feeling dread every time I see him on a football pitch.

6497~~~
Van Gaal drops him into midfield when we're chasing a goal. 

Has the penny finally dropped?

6498~~~
He is past it at the highest level

6499~~~
feck him off. Total embarrassment.

6500~~~
Last year's RvP was ten times better than this Rooney.

6501~~~
oh dear. we're gonna have sh!tloads more threads about him now!

6502~~~
It was a certainty. Everyone watching knew the outcome

6503~~~
He is nothing.

6504~~~
Not blaming him for the pen. Can happen. He was dross again out there though. He needs a selling to the MLS.

6505~~~
How obvious was it that he'd miss?

6506~~~
yup

6507~~~
that sums up Rooney and people laughed when I compared him and RVP to Grant Holt. Rooney's fecking dinosaur who wouldn!t get into any side in the premier league let alone being captain of the biggest club in the world, he never acts like captain, the only thing he does is arguing with referees because he lost the ball with horrible touch and had to made that 50/50 tackle.

we could say he put in some fight in the first half but went to complete utter shit in the rest of the game mainly after he was switched to CM again.

Can you believe it?(In VLG tone)

6508~~~
He is utter crap, in every aspect. Like the second coming of Falcao.

6509~~~
He's always been pretty dodgy at penalties. Thank god we subbed him off in Moscow (08).

6510~~~
Surely SURELY LVG will drop him now?

Right?

6511~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6512~~~
Unfair to blame him alone as there were eight or nine Rooneys out there today in the red shirts.

6513~~~
Wage thief.

6514~~~
It's like he's decided to Emulate Falcao from last season.

Even Wilson was better than him frankly.

6515~~~
Painful viewing to even see him on the pitch these days. Christ almighty.

6516~~~
Yeah, for me anyone who continues to defend him should be made to post pictures or their wives or girlfriends (or mothers) nude or they'll be banned from the forum. He is so bad, we haven't even got the ability to carry him past his mediocre bullshit every week.

6517~~~
RVP and Falcao weren't this bad, were they? 

Ok maybe Falcao was, RVP wasn't.

6518~~~
I don't want to see him ever again.

6519~~~
Watch him play the full 90 upfront when we score zero goals against Palace.

6520~~~
shit

6521~~~
What the feck?

6522~~~
If this was 2012 everyone would be calling him an omnishambles. 

He is just relentlessly terrible and Van Gaal's love for him is beyond any reasonable understanding.

6523~~~
One would think that he would have found his level today against a championship club but that didn't happen. Atleast we might get a lower league club in the FA Cup and Rooney might have a chanse to put in a good performance then.

6524~~~
RVP was the only one able to shoot the ball, but he was pretty bad too.

6525~~~
RvP wasn't.

6526~~~
He is an insult to footballers who earn £2000 a week, and this thief is scamming the club of over £200k+ a week

6527~~~
Just terminate his contract. I'd honestly not complain if we did at this point. He's been an amazing servant, but he needs to leave the club.

6528~~~
I thought he was an instant upgrade on Wilson in the first few minutes, then he suddenly just decided that he doesn't bother to play proper football anymore.

6529~~~
Any indication of the match going fans turning on him?

6530~~~
Might be time to start looking at those Miami brochures.

6531~~~
If he was a dog he'd have been put down long ago.

Do us all a favor Wayne anf bugger off to the MLS.

6532~~~
Reek.

6533~~~
I think it's about time he started intentionally playing crap and make some "good" mistakes.

6534~~~
Van Persie declined no question and was too easy to mark out the game/too often anonymous but his touch, control and overall play was way ahead of Rooney's level this season.

6535~~~
The two centre halves will get a tougher time off almost every forward in the Championship.

6536~~~
I'm showing my cards here: 

I'm sick of the sight of the overpaid cnut and I hope he never plays for us again. Sadly, my wish will not be granted.

6537~~~
Yes, i wasn't there tonight but I'm a ST holder and there is a lot of.. i wouldn't say hatred but certainty annoyance? Towards him these days.

6538~~~
He'll be the first name on the team-sheet in our next league game.
That's guaranteed.

In fairness, I don't blame him for missing the penalty - it can happen to anyone.
What really showed him up, was when Fellaini was counter attacking (yes, you read that right, Fellani was counter attacking) and he passed the ball to Rooney at the edge of the penalty box. Rooney, stopped the counter and passed it sideways, which allowed the Middlesborough defenders to get back to their defensive positions and attack was dead. He actually helped Middlesborough defend our own counter-attack!

6539~~~
I feel sick being on this "post ", being a great Roo fan, since his incredible debute hat-trick (Fenerbache!  woow)..... Once, in my mind, he was Probably thee best player in  the world...... & I hate to admit, that WAS years ago!...... Tis now time to DROP/ SELL..... tanx for the memories Wayne.

6540~~~

6544~~~
Anyone going to claim he did well tonight?

6545~~~
2.9 rating so far <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6546~~~
We need Bruce <i>Banner</i>, if you get my drift.

6547~~~
Someone must have given him a 10 as a laugh and dragged it up a bit.

6548~~~
Most players when they're out of form get dropped and spend a few weeks out of the side until they turn it around, unfortunately for Wayne he is being played every game when it's all going wrong for him and the level of criticism gets worse and worse. His undroppable status is working against him.

6549~~~
First 45 minutes of the game he was brilliant, needs to repeat this on a weekly basis.

6550~~~
Shit thats so poetic.  But sadly its true.  Rooney do us a fav and feck og to the states.

6551~~~
It is like beating a dead horse in my critique of his performances. Their is not much else to say. The only thing we can do is hope he finds some form or our team figures a way to win games with 10 men.

6552~~~
I'd like to see what his rating would be if you took the Brugge away game out.

6553~~~
I kept thinking if LVG benched him, he could maybe do a job for 20 minutes against a tiring defence, but after that performance...stick a fork in him.

I still believe he will be in the starting XI until the new year.

6554~~~
Had a strong feeling he was gonna miss his pen. I really don't want to see him starting this weekend - we cannot afford to lose against Palace.

6555~~~
His picture in at the top of this thread is annoying me

6556~~~
When I submitted my lingard MOM vote, he had 65 of the votes.. Someone has a mancrush that just doesn't want to go away.

6557~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6558~~~
And we still have people with opinions like this. Incredible.

6559~~~
The White Pele !
<span style="color: #ffffff">runs away</span>

6560~~~
I just made him my MOTM to underline this farce story today...

6561~~~
I gave him a 2 and thought I was being lenient.

6562~~~
Lock thread, we're on a loop

6563~~~
We should put arsenic in his granny.

6564~~~
Pele would be more threatening up front than Rooney these days.

6565~~~
He kind of was - he summed up our general performance pretty well.

6566~~~
Sadly that's precisely what we'll have to do...On the bright side, at least we'll get lots of practice playing 10 only - helps if someone gets a red..

6567~~~
Real talk, he has to be benched now, surely..?

6568~~~
Dont think he started that badly, was poor after and inevitably that he was going to miss. Surely something must happen.

6569~~~
I gave him a 1. He's useless now. Have mercy on my wearied soul and get rid of this guy.

6570~~~
well I don't know but 75 year old pele might do better in place of current rooney.

6571~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YVrxFmheSc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>


I think Memphis was worse than him tonight but he looks like he's regressed so much, and he's not even been injured for a while so I have to wonder how long can he survive...

6572~~~
Same, I think this is the first time I ever gave someone a 1 in the match ratings <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6573~~~
If LVG doesn't bench him now then he's fecking mad

6574~~~
dunno if it helps but if it's not Rooney who barely gets cards these days which sums up his mature performances, than we are at 9 men and Roo playing midfield

6575~~~
We were shit without him and equally as shit with him. Everyone will blame Rooney but the whole team were shit from start to finish.

6576~~~
I've never been able to justify giving a player a 1 before, but Rooney actually fully earned it tonight. I've wanted to all season but he's always put in a defensive shift or made a deft touch to create a chance which has always dragged his performance up to a 4/5, but tonight he actually helped the opposition.

6577~~~
How many different ways can you say the same thing?

He's finished, he's absolutely terrible, he is a massive burden to the team and Van Gaal should be having serious questions asked about him for why he keeps playing him.

It's a fecking mess.

6578~~~
If you watch some of his past videos, it's quite incredible how much of a shadow he is of his former self. He has absolutely no dynamism left in those legs. It looks like he's wearing a 50 pound armor whilst playing.

6579~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6580~~~
It's absolute lunacy playing Martial out of position for him. Everytime Martial gets the ball he holds it up, turns and creates. If this one, and it's a big if, manages to control it, it's going only one way, and that's backwards. If he gets his mythical touch back, it's still not enough for me as he is a negative player these days. There isn't a creative thought in him, he's got two learnt moves, the long range chip and the floating ball to the right wing, he is just so laughably predictable and easy to play against.

He's become an institution at United, too big for us with absolutely nothing to back that status up, except for stats that count for nothing in the present. I've been pro LVG, very much so, but this Rooney situation is tipping me over, he must have misunderstood the Rooney rule, it's not mandatory for every starting line-up to have one.

6581~~~
That's what marriage and three kids does to you at the age of 30. He has no desire left in his entire being. He will achieve nothing more because he has lost the hunger for it.

6582~~~
I nearly fecking died when this happened. Complete waste of space.

6583~~~
But he's the <i>captain</i> <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> - he should be <i>leading</i>

6584~~~
Utter gash, absolutely indefensible

6585~~~
Me, too. After giving him a 1/10, the first time I've ever rated a player that low. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6586~~~
He's an impotent bastard as of late, that's for sure.

6587~~~
That's understandable. But then he needs to feck off and leave the hungrier and more motivated players to get on with it.. It's wrong for him to hinder the progress of others.
Unfortunately I don't think he will see it that way, not with his ego.
Looks like someone in semi-retirement acting like a statesman - this sort of attitude doesn't win you matches.

6588~~~
This helps. Thank you.

6589~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He probably overheard something about it and asked Wayne to explain it to him.

6590~~~
Please drop him LvG. For everyones sake including his.

6591~~~
It's big Mike going to give an interview on MUTV, should be Rooney but it never is when we lose. He only wants to speak if we win.

6592~~~
id take Bruce Jenner upfront at the mo

6593~~~
He can't exactly walk out or quit the club, why would he? Would you if you were on his money?

This is all on LVG for me. He has to bench him ASAP. The longer this continues, the more pressure it is going to put on Rooney, himself and the club.

6594~~~
It's actually extremely frustrating knowing there are so much better players who have to make way for this has-been. LVG is giving away points at this rate, forget the title we'll be lucky to secure top four with this rubbish.

6595~~~
I think ratings of 1, 2, and 3 should be replaced by Wayne, Mark, and Rooney.

6596~~~
He's half of the players he used to be. It's sad to witness his decline. In this form I can see him as a back up for Herrera and maybe Martial, that's about it. Time will tell what LvG has in his mind.

6597~~~
Why am I not surprised? Couldn't wait to take the armband off Carrick but now when he should front up to the media he doesn't want to know. Great. I hope the lads put aside their 'support' of him and realise that the club is paying them a hell of a lot to win matches and they won't be if they don't say something about the Rooney situation. It will totally ruin our season if we carry on with him like this.

6598~~~
He'll start at Palace, he'll be absolute shit, we'll all come on here and talk about how shit he was and then next game he'll be the first name on the team sheet.

It's the circle of life.

6599~~~
Must be a scouse thing

6600~~~
Every time he gets the ball, his touch takes him about 6 yards backwards. Killing attacks. If LVG is going to persist with this shite, he should resign.

6601~~~
I would personally be ashamed to take all that money for doing feck all. It's not in my DNA. However, I understand that footballers are very very different people.

Yes LVG should take some of the blame for playing him, but we don't know what goes on behind the scenes - I don't think it's that easy. Nevertheless, Louis must put his ass on the bench. I don't care if Rooney keeps showing everyone how shite he is, but I do care about the rest of the players, the fans and of course the club - so yes LVG needs to get his big balls out and do the right thing. It's indefensible to keep playing Rooney.

6602~~~
I think LVG is terrified of the disharmony that Rooney being benched would cause to the team morale. We are stuck between a rock and a hard place until the transfer window I reckon. If he's not sold in the summer then I give up.

6603~~~
Van Gaal's called him the best captain he's ever had. Just let that sink in. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6604~~~
Thing is though it's not Rooney's fault, he peaked ages ago yet the decision was taken to tie him down to a crazy new contract, and now LvG is left with having to sort out the problem of dropping the clubs captain, highest paid player, and the most commercially important player at the club, it's not an easy thing for him to do, even if he want to (which I'm sure he does.)

It's a problem, and unit its sorted we won't be winning anything just yet imo.

6605~~~
Someone made a joke a few weeks ago about his second touch being a tackle but it's actually true, and defenders just brush him off with ease in duels, this is not a slump in form he's every bit as shot as RvP and Falcao.

6606~~~
Sure LVG has indulged him too much. But the majority of the blame lies squarely with the decision makers at the club. They've bloody elevated him to this seemingly untouchable position, so they really need to sort it out.

6607~~~
I wouldn't give a feck to be honest. Give the youngsters a chance and lock anyone who causes a stink out of the dressing room. It's gotten to the point where Rooney is performing so poorly that we'd be a better side without him anywhere near it, even if he takes a couple of first teamers down with him.

Van Gaal needs to whip out his balls again and show the team who the boss is. Anyone who wants to play for the team will figure out very quickly that throwing a hissy with Rooney is the wrong way to get time on the bitch, and with better performances comes better morale.

Fergie showed that rotten apples could easily be fecked off without the rot spreading to the rest of the team. He got rid of Ince, Keane, RvN, Heinze, Tevez and more without the team suffering much at all. Rooney shouldn't be any different if Van Gaal is half the manager his reputation says he is.

6608~~~
I know it's not something United fans are too interested in right now, but seeing Wayne like this really shows how incredible Alan Shearer's PL record is. For years people have been saying Rooney will break it, but I'm more likely to win a golden boot in my 30s than he is.

6609~~~
Can't really recall anyone saying Rooney will break it to be honest. Shearer's record will last for a long time. Not that this has anything to do with Rooney being utter shite at the moment but hey ho!

6610~~~
I agree with all of that. I just think and fear that Rooney has far more power than we are led to believe. The best thing Van Gaal would do would be to drop him, just to see how he responds at first.

6611~~~
Couldn't find a stream for the match, must say I'm definitely very surprised to hear Rooney was terrible again.

6612~~~
Totally gone. There's no spring in the legs anymore or anything. Balance, agility, strength all seem to have packed up

6613~~~
A few years back I thought he could do it but his steady decline lead me to believe otherwise. It really is amazing how Shearer kept scoring into his mid 30s, he's pretty underrated on the world stage.

If only he came to United <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6614~~~
I'm not sure it's team morale as such. I think it's the power of Rooney's dealings with the media and the mess he can cause which would of course disrupt the team. I would like to think there's a method to his madness and that the only way to neutralise Rooney is to play him and show everyone how shite he is. If Rooney continues like this, then he will quickly run out of excuses because the evidence is right before everyone's eyes.

For eg. I remember last season with Falcao. LVG wasn't playing him for a bit, and then Falcao's 'people' and Mendes started throwing shade LVG's way - at that moment, I believe Woodward and Mendes were getting along (before DDG's contract fiasco) - plus some fans wanted Falcao to start - so LVG started playing him. When Falcao started getting his run of games, I felt at that moment that someone intervened to get that to happen. So LVG continues playing him until slowly the fans and club realised finally that Falcao was done.

I wonder (or hope) therefore that he might be employing the same action with regards to Rooney..

6615~~~
He's done. I'm sure he won't be at United next season.

6616~~~
Sure thing if Sir Alex was still here Rooney wouldn't be, he knew what was going on alright.

I don't want to bash Rooney too much because he has done some great things for us, but I do harbour the hope that LvG will faze him out soon, and he will somehow find a club willing to take him off our hands next summer, thus leaving Sir Bobbys scoring record intact, because there's not a hope he'll score enough before the end of the season on this form.

6617~~~
One thing I thought was hilarious because it summed up perfectly the shite-Rooney. There was a perfect ball was played into him from the left side (can't remember from who) and Rooney had found himself in space outside the box to take a touch and either shoot, lob a ball forward and try a through ball like your top level striker does but instead he managed to take a diabolical touch which put the ball backwards about 5-6 yards, ran to it and without even checking behind him, trying to turn to pass it to someone in an attack position he pinged it out wide <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>


0/10 do not want.

6618~~~
The pass from Martial?

6619~~~
that was back when it was 442 you have a go we have a go. Shearer was class but I wonder how many he's score under this philisophy

6620~~~
Most likely since Memphis couldn't even complete a pass.

6621~~~
The level he was at 5 years ago he should have gone on to break Shearer's record. He's kind of limped over the line to get the England record and we're not sure if he'll even break Charlton's record at United. He's only just turned 30 but he looks completely done.

6622~~~
Was it the pass from Fellaini when they were counter-attacking?

6623~~~
No but that was probably equally as terrible <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6624~~~
I remember Frank Lampard coming on as a sub in one of Chelsea's League Cup matches, and completely changing the game through sheer intelligence and composure; he did that Zidane-like thing of being calm, making space for himself, and his experience really told against lesser opposition...and this was when Frank was getting on in years. I'm not even a fan of his but I was very impressed; why on earth can't Wayne - if his energy and touch has truly deserted him - do the same as Lampard did? We're forever being told that Rooney has a good footballing brain, so why can't he even reach the level of an aging Lampard or Sheringham? At this time, you'd even fancy long-retired Paul Scholes to show more nous and even dynamism than Rooney has. Running on fumes after a long career is one thing but at heart there's really no excuse for being unable to adjust, even if one isn't as 'clever' as Frank or Teddy or Paul.

6625~~~
Only person capable of breaking it would have been Ronaldo.

6626~~~
Sick of it. It's the same every week, he plays, he plays shit and we all come on here and moan about it. Van Gaal and his coaching staff somehow miss it and he plays the next game like nothing happened.

Something is seriously. We need a goal and LVG brings him on. Madness.

6627~~~
If he scores a goal a game in La Liga this season he'll have more league goals for Real than Shearer has goals in the Premiership, in half the amount of seasons.

Mental player.

6628~~~
Frightening to think, isn't it? There'll not be another like him for decades.

6629~~~
Ronaldo's a phenomenon but the quality of the spanish league outside of the top 3 or 4 teams is woeful. I'm no longer surprised when Real or Barca beat teams by 4 or 5 goals.

6630~~~
He really looks like a punch drunk boxer sometimes and his peripheral vision is getting more and more narrow. 

I hope we already have a deal in place with Everton so he can go home at the end of the season (infact I think we do have a pre-deal in place).

6631~~~
PLEASE
 DROP
ROONEY

Rooney is truly finished, no amount of matches will play him into form. He's a big joke now, a true laughing stock.

6639~~~
I hear Bolton are looking particularly deadly thesedays with the holy trinity of Emile Heskey, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Shola Ameobi up front.

6640~~~
Thanks for the years Wayne but it's over.

6641~~~
This is all part of a brilliant plan. Martial gets to lead the line now with no expectations as all since we will have to say, "better than Rooney at least" no matter what.

Genius.

6642~~~
You missed my word play with Rooney <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6643~~~
Finished as a striker, defended him all season and the last few games has even broken me. 

He can't run, and whenever he does run his chest is pumped out like he's struggling to keep up. I actually thought he improved when dropped deeper last night, having said that he was bloody awful still. 

Time for the MLS me thinks.

6644~~~
Even when he was at City, he had a few good cameos off the bench with his presence improving things for them. Lampard is on another level when it comes to footballing intelligence in comparison to Rooney.

6645~~~
The difference was that Lamps, Scholes, Giggs etc. had accepted their limitations at that stage and adjusted their game accordingly. With Rooney, from his teammates to the manager to some in the media, everyone is telling him that he is still the top dawg; captain marvelous. The great, indomitable Wayne Rooney who is still a top player in the world. Nearly everyone who competed with him for a spot was swiftly shunted out, and the only one he has to compete with is a 19 year old bought from outside the league. 

Hardly anyone is telling Wayne that he isn't the same player anymore, nor does it seem that he has the self realization. It was the same with Gerrard, who was constantly told that he was the Anfield hero, the heartbeat of Liverpoool, even when he was way past his best. For Stevie, the realization dawned when he was benched for the clubs most important game of the season and ended up being asked to walk after a horrible stamp on Herrera within minutes of coming on. The similar will happen with Wayne, if he doesn't start realizing his limitations and starts adjusting his game accordingly. 

He may be getting those wages, but he can't play like someone deserving those wages anymore.

6646~~~
They did it successfully because they had the tools: a very good first touch and a quick brain. When you struggle with controlling the ball, particularly under pressure, there isn't much left to adjust.

6647~~~
I am really curious how this whole situation works behind the scenes. If LvG says Rooney plays he will not complain and get on the pitch, but surely, he realizes that he's letting the team down and basically being dead weight? How does LvG justify this to the team, every one must surely realize by now that it works better if he's not on the pitch?

6648~~~
Rooney's touch can be iffy, but I think a lot of it has to do with his anxiousness to perform at that 'top level' and also being asked to play in a system which is very demanding on the striker. Don't think Rooney can perform under those circumstances under his current condition. Still think he can contribute at a good level if used sparingly, in the right position and when the game opens up a little.

6649~~~
Not sure about that, maybe he thinks that the team is letting him down?

6650~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Magnificent! It's funny because it's true.

Rooney's technical ability and awareness of space are shot - it's like watching my Gran trying to reverse park

6651~~~
"Wayne Rooney boldly stepped up to take the first penalty in what seemed a gesture of confidence from the Manchester United striker ..."

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> @ Daily Mail

6652~~~
He was fooling himself then. The perfect case of misplaced confidence.

6653~~~
He'll go back to his "best position" at no.10 this weekend and herrera will be benched sadly. Then he'll play shite and the media will say he should be playing centre forward.

6654~~~
Pretty sure nobody has been saying that have they? The goalscoring records he's been touted to overtake are England and United ones, not the PL one, he's miles off it and has been played in too many different roles to have stood a chance.

6655~~~
Yeah true, maybe that could be the case. Would you say that is the case though?

6656~~~
I think he realises that he isn't great but maybe he blames his team-mates and the tactics for it. Obviously, his intention is to play for United at least till the end of his current contract and he thinks that he still has a lot to offer.

6657~~~
True, and maybe he is partially right regarding the tactics. 

He's still dire though. And that's putting it lightly.

6658~~~
Even Steven Gerrard had been in the PFA team of the year the year before his decline started, and Brendan had the cojones  to drop him. 

We cant afford to keep this waste of space in our team. I really in all honesty cannot see the benefit. Its not like he makes his teammates play better(arguably its the opposite), he really offers nothing for a team with genuine ambitions for silverware, and keeping him in the team will cost us dearly. From a marketing pov, that cannot be a good thing either. As shown by Falcao, it is possible for a once great player to become a laughing stock. This appears to be happening here too, just that I don't really find this funny, but rather infuriating.

6659~~~
The English media will turn against him after the Euros, especially with him likely to stink up another major tournament, and this time as captain. They dont really care about his United performances, and will stick up for him and blame everyone else for his problems.

6660~~~
I didn't get it. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

6661~~~
The Rooney cycle in full effect. You forgot to mention though that he will be rated Star Man in The Sun newspaper regardless.

6662~~~
I'm happy to match it mate <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6663~~~
I didn't watch the second half but according to the match report in The Times this morning we looked a lot better with him on. I'm actually more inclined to go woth the consensus here though - there's a blindness to Rooney's shortcomings with some reporters.

6664~~~
It's incredible how such an awesome player has become so ineffective on the field, irrespective of position. It's almost hard to remember that this was the guy who brought new meaning to the term "put in a shift," and that he used to score for fun.

To say he hasn't aged well would be an understatement. We need to bring in Harry Kane (or someone similar), maybe then Rooney will be dropped from the starting 11.

6665~~~
I'm sure she could do better, bless her.

6666~~~
He wasn't worse than Wilson, who was crap.

But my God, his acceleration has gone completely. It's like Falcao all over again. 

As I posted elsewhere though, the mistake was made in the summer when LVG decided to rely on Rooney as our only senior striker, with Wilson and Martial as the only other options. Now we're stuck with him. Playing Memphis or Wilson instead of him certainly won't solve any problems as we saw yesterday.

6667~~~
The mistake was made in van Gaal's head when he decided that Rooney was going to be his captain and fell in love with him. The praise he gets from van Gaal despite the fact that he's hardly ever been anywhere near his best since van Gaal came here is really inexplicable.  He is refusing to see what actually goes on on the football pitch because he is absolutely in awe with our Wayne. It's like when your girlfriend cheats on you repeatedly having threesomes with her bosses and gangbangs with your friends from school but you still keep loving her.

6668~~~
I missed the 2nd half and post match comments. Did LvG answer any questions about Rooney?

6669~~~
That's some rawk type shit right there <a class="username" data-user="8145, @Sarni" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8145/">@Sarni</a>

6670~~~
Not really, mate:

<b>L</b>ouis van Gaal admits that a recent lack of goals for Manchester United is a “concern”, but that his players simply need a bit of “luck”.

United followed Arsenal and Chelsea in being eliminated in the last 16 of the Capital One Cup as Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Ashley Young all missed from 12 yards after a goalless 120 minutes when the hosts proved equally wasteful.

Marouane Fellaini, on two occasions, and substitute Anthony Martial missed gilt-edged chances in front of goal in extra time and Van Gaal admitted his side’s profligacy cost them before the “casino” of the shoot-out.

“When you are not finishing the chances – and they were very easy chances in front of the goal or in front of the goalkeeper – then it is very difficult to win a game because the goals are counting, not the chances,” the Dutchman said.

“You can say it is unlucky but that I have said already after the match against (Manchester) City also because that was also 0-0. You have to force the luck also, we didn’t do that because we didn’t score. That’s why I’m disappointed.

“My players have given everything and that’s why I am also proud of them because until the end they have done it. Penalties is a casino – you never know.”

Six sides have scored more goals in the Premier League so far this season than United, while Rooney is their top goalscorer in all competitions with six strikes in 15 games.

England captain Rooney and Young both saw their penalties saved by Boro goalkeeper Tomas Mejias, while Carrick blazed over in between with only David Nugent not converting for the visitors.

However, Van Gaal absolved his trio of any blame, preferring to instead reflect on Mejias’ successful rolls of the dice.

“In the goal was a goalkeeper; and he was very quick and he gambled also,” Van Gaal added.

“He’s 195 centimetres. That is not easy to do when the goalkeeper is gambling for the right corner.

“You need players who look at the goalkeeper and put it in the other (corner)…very early he goes away. It is already 120 minutes you have played so you are not so sharp any more. These things happen.”

While United could have put the tie to bid in extra time they were also fortunate to not be ousted in 90 minutes, with Daley Blind almost scoring two own-goals, one ruled out by an offside flag against Kike and the other dropping just past Sergio Romero’s post after the goalkeeper had let the ball slip past him.

At the other end, James Wilson offered little before being withdrawn at half-time due to injury and not even the presence of Rooney, often operating in a deep midfield role, and Martial from the bench could provide a goal following Sunday’s Manchester derby stalemate in the same stadium.

When asked if the lack of goals was a concern, Van Gaal replied: “Yes, of course. Football – what only matters is a goal.

“We have played two matches – 0-0. In my opinion we could have scored against Manchester City now, again, that’s the score.

“It is a concern but I do know also that it can easily turn around in the next game.”

6671~~~
Has anyone got marjen's girlfriend's phone number, please?

6672~~~
I have a different explanation. I think LvG is afraid that his philosophy isn't very popular among the players and this could cost him the position. Maybe Rooney has shown enthusiasm about the "philosophy" and LvG relies on him to control the team.

6673~~~
I give up. Lets see at the end of the season how this stubbornness will affect us. I cant see us winning anything under LVG, and this will be a major reason why.

6674~~~
No chance. Aston Villa away was far worse than last night.

6675~~~
5.0, I think. 

It's just one game but it's literally the only time he has performed well all season. Apart from that he made the team average in the Ipswich game and against Sunderland and Everton he was only a bit below the team average. In every other match he has been significantly below the team average. 

Also I'm on Squawka atm and I wanted to get a sense of how Rooney's attacking game has declined so I look at his goals, chance created and successful dribbles (per 90 minutes) over the last three seasons and it's just brutal. 

Goals: 0.63 - 0.38 - 0.22.
Chances created: 2.06 - 1.41 - 1.11
Successful dribbles: 1.51 - 1.19 - 0.78. 

13/14 Rooney (when we gave him his insane contract) is three times as good a goal scorer, twice the creative force and twice the dribbler as 15/16 Rooney. And 13/14 Rooney wasn't even close to Rooney at his best!

6676~~~
Those cases when the stats completely back up what you're seeing with your eyes..

6677~~~
A player we couldnt give away, even if we paid half of his salary, and he will start every game until the end of the season. Its going to be a long year.

6678~~~
I've been pedalling the Rooney is rubbish bandwagon for about two years now, but I take no pleasure from watching this. Especially after seeing a bit of him as a man on his documentary, I do actually have some pity for how shit he now is.

Yesterday was far from his worst performance though, poor as it was. I think some are going a little overboard with regards to yesterday's performance alone, although it was still shit. I've had enough, and it's clear that Van Gaal doesn't know what to do with him. He's played 4 different positions now since Martial has arrived - none of which are down to injury. Ultimately, when it really mattered last night, he wasn't trusted in attack.

January cannot come soon enough for us, as we simply can't afford o take a 'wait until summer' approach, not unless we are writing off any trophies this season. The difference between Martial and our other forward players is staggering, and we need at least one more of a high level to compete.

Rooney is clearly, CLEARLY done though. This is no 'he's just in a spell of poor form'. He is not a Premier League level footballer at present.

6679~~~
If he's smart enough, he'll find a way to get dropped. Because if he plays <i>like that </i>till the end of the season, he will not only become a laughing stock but one of the most hated players among United fans.

6680~~~
We got better, or at least more threatening, towards the end of the half after Young and Martial came on and Fellaini started staying forward. 

I think there is an element of this. If LvG loses Rooney, then the doubters in the dressing room may get restless.

6681~~~
I think this was true for his game against City but he was appalling yesterday. He was one of the worst players on the pitch against a Championship side at Old Trafford! He couldn't keep the ball close to their box. Didn't Boro's strikers look much better than him?

6682~~~
Either way, if we're all discussing just <i>how</i> shit his performances are, not <i>if</i> they were shit even, I think it says something about where this train is headed.

6683~~~
They did, and that probably applies to almost every game he's played this season. That said, he's been worse, that's all I'm saying.

For the record, I don't need to be converted as to seeing Rooney is shite. I've been saying this long before this season to far more resistance than we see today.

6684~~~
I know your stance well and I think you have been generally spot on. Also with regard to Martial, IIRC you created a thread about Martial weeks before we signed him?

6685~~~
2 years ago I did say Rewnaaayyy being sold to Chelsea would have been a massive boost to us on the football pitch... he did have a few decent early months for Moyes, but the people who opposed me must surely felt he had much more to give. 

Again I triumph, although how happy I am about being proven right is another hing altogether. Had he been half as good as some thought he was/is/would be, we would be winning the league this year.

6686~~~
I also was of the opinion we should have bitten the bullet and sold him to Chelsea. The worst that would have happened that season is that we would have finished 8th or 9th. Not much difference with our eventual position. However, he would be Chelsea's problem now not ours and by now we would have replaced him with a younger better player.

6687~~~
What really annoys me about his performances this year is that when he has space he never drives in to it. His first instincts always seem to go backwards and then just pass it to the wing. There is absolutely no creativity coming from him at the moment.

6688~~~
Absolutely. Hindsight is 20/20, obviously, but there were strong signs already back then and I don't recall too many of us complaining when Ferguson dropped him for the Madrid tie.

6689~~~
His form was terrible around then. He had been faffing about for months. He was also playing in his so called favored position behind RVP.

6690~~~
Indeed. Like I and many others have said earlier: Ferguson put Rooney's head on a plate for Moyes. The rest is history.

6691~~~
There was a point when he killed a counter dead when he got a pass in space. Instead of him to play a foward pass of drive for goal, this charlatan took a touch backwards about 7 yards allowng four of the other teams players back into position befor trying a cross foeld ball to Lingard.

6692~~~
I will be honest, my Martial thread was probably only about a week before we signed him.

Can you just imagine the state of our attack had we not added Martial? I'd imagine we'd be on course for a record low goals total.

6693~~~
If he carries on playing like this he will put Hodgson in a difficult situation as well, the current Rooney can't lead the attack for England.

6694~~~
But he will, we all know this.

6695~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You really should be raising a sword aloft when you write that. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6696~~~
At the time, I think we really couldnt afford to lose him. Make no mistake, even then the decline had begun, but that would have sent out a terrible statement at the time. To lose Fergie and the biggest name in our team would have sent the United in crisis narrative into overdrive. I also feared that Mourinho would turn him back into a megastar and we would suffer for it. Now it looks like they would be fighting relegation together.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>


What I didnt agree with though was the contract lenght. Stupid decision then, even more terrible decision now.

6697~~~
Cant see Hodgson dropping him..he's not got the balls for such a thing..he'll squeeze him into the team again(Like left wing as he did at the world cup), Rooney will perform poorly, England will suffer for it, and Woy will still keep his job.

6698~~~
<i><b>Was laser pen to blame for Rooney missing penalty?</b></i>
<i>Wayne Rooney's recent difficulties continue as he misses a penalty in Manchester United's shock cup exit to Middlesbrough, but was he put off?</i>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/wayne-rooney/11962279/Manchester-United-vs-Middlesbrough-Wayne-Rooney-penalty-miss-laser-pen.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ough-Wayne-Rooney-penalty-miss-laser-pen.html</a>

6699~~~
Always an excuse...

In truth, Rooney's penalty was pretty good. It was hit hard and low, he was just unfortunate the keeper guessed right. If you want to make something of the penalty you might say he could have hit it with more power. Still, he got it on target, it was headed to the corner, the keeper just did his job on it, it happens.

Forget the penalty, its what Rooney did for 75 minutes before that is the main issue. He's huffing and puffing like a punch drunk fighter. His first touch was mostly abysmal, his anticipation poor. I can remember when we used to bring Rooney off the bench against lesser sides to change games, and he would. Last night his introduction had no impact on the flow of the game at all. Boro weren't afraid of him, his presence didn't give their defenders anything to worry about. Rooney had so little influence that when we went for it in extra time Rooney was pushed into midfield for Fellaini. 

Maybe Van Gaal needs to give Rooney a mid-season break to get his head straight. Some time in Dubai doing a little eat.pray.love might sort him out. God knows what else will.

6700~~~
If that's true that laser pen guy has been working hard for the last two years

6701~~~
Rooney didn't miss the keeper saved it. I'm not sure how a laser pen can help him choose a different corner or hit it harder. The keeper guessed correctly and went early. Young did exactly the same pen and got saved also, so no excuse there.

6702~~~
Ferguson knew Rooney had to go two years ago and his final act as manager was to leave it as easy as possible for Moyes to get rid of him but Moyes of course f*cked that up as well

6703~~~
There is a lot of truth in this.

Also Moyes has saddled us with Rooney for years to come. Nobody who can afford Rooney's wages will want him now, given the way he has been playing. Even if United wanted to get shot of him who would come in for him? Only the biggest clubs can afford to give someone £200,000+ a week. Yet can you see even PSG, who tend to make glamour signings for the sake of it, being tempted to take a punt on Rooney in his current form?

English NT does not pick players on form or will not drop players because they put the team unbalanced. A big name will get picked for sure.

6707~~~
If this is true, then LVG is not going to last for long if Rooney is his best of way of keeping the dressing room under control.

6708~~~
I died inside when I saw this happen. And people legitimately think Rooney is capable of playing #10 when he can't even get that right. Baffles the mind.

6709~~~
Did he even take a shot yesterday? All he wants to do is pass is whenever he gets into shooting distance or knock it out to the right wing.

6710~~~
He has to be the second most predicatable player in the team, after Valencia

6711~~~
If he really wanted to do that he'd have just told Moyes.

6712~~~
He told Moyes many things Moyes ignored tbf. Like the backroom staff etc

6713~~~
Aaaand I think that blaming Rooney situation on Moyes is just being lazy to be fair.

6714~~~
I do too, although a 5 year contract (as with Nani) was not the best idea.

6715~~~
Aye, hard to argue that.

6716~~~
Free transfer.

6717~~~
I disagree. It has already been said by Hodgson that Rooney's place is in no way guaranteed. There is already a change in language and tone when it comes to Rooney and England and his place is under serious threat both with them and with us.

It seems clear as day to me that he's on the verge of being dropped for both club and country. This stuff about managers being scared, dressing room unrest, marketing pressures etc is pie in the sky. 

I think he'll be an ex United player come next season and his international career will be all but over too.

6718~~~
I really do hope so, but I'm not as optimisitc.

I cant really see Hodgson dropping Rooney. Remember that at the world cup, instead of playing with a CDM like Barry(Who had a fantastic season that year) or Carrick , He played Gerrard there instead who was horribly exposed. Its been like that for years with England whereby a lot of big name players have been forced into the squad, at times at the expense of better suited players. That is part of the reason why Carrick has played so few games. I cant  see Roy dropping his captain months before a major tournament. He has never been one to ruffle the the feathers.  

As for United, I will wait expectantly..i'd take him being just subbed off in games at this stage. Hopefully your optimism is handsomely rewarded.

6719~~~
[
I like your optimism but its not going to happen. First for country, i kind of agree that he will be dropped to the bench but without a doubt Rooney will be on that plane. Even if he has the worse season ever, he'll be on that plane to France next year. For club, Rooney salary is huge and i cant see any club taking Rooney with that huge salary. I don't think Rooney isn't going to settle for a cut salary, so he'll most likely just run down his contract and then go in 2019.

6720~~~
I've been saying this since Moyes was appointed. Fergie had gotten RVP to play up front, and Kagawa to play behind him. Hernandez and Welbeck were good enough backups.

6721~~~
He's beyond parody now. 

He actually plays like a 40 year old who's come out of retirement for his testimonial, just plodding round the pitch playing the occasional long pass that looks good on the eye.

6722~~~
MLS would cough it up.

6723~~~
He tackles like Boris Johnson these days, too.

6724~~~
He would struggle in the Championship these days. I mean he genuinely would. Thats how bad he is.

6725~~~
Just posted this in another thread but looking at the poll I'm not the only one who thinks this is an issue of woeful form, rather than him suddenly being physically incapable of playing anywhere close to his usual level in the weeks running up to his 30th birthday. Which begs the question, <i>why</i> is he playing so badly?

I would put this down to three things:

1. Massive crisis in confidence.
2. Not getting enough chances. Which, in turn, puts more pressure on him and adds to 1.
3. The captaincy thing. Van Gaal loves to make football seem incredibly complicated. Rooney has always been an instinctive footballer. Now he's being asked to be the embodiment of his manager on the pitch, with all the chat about phases of possession and micro-management of the position of every player on the pitch. Is it any wonder if the whole thing has blown Rooney's (simple) mind? And a blown mind brings us back to point 1.

So yeah, he's been shit all season but you have to wonder if the player himself is able to turn things round, without the other issues being addressed...

6726~~~
He scores a hattrick,  broke the england record, if that doesnt give him some confidence then what else? 

People have been telling us it's just a drought and he'll find form once he got goals, he got it and still...

6727~~~
Someone has to go to prison <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6728~~~
100x this.

6729~~~
Well, exactly. Game like the one in which he scored a hat-trick, and other goals he has scored this season indicate he's still capable of performing at a reasonable level. Even if only fleetingly. Which goes against the narrative that his problem is entirely physical.

6730~~~
Shearer was top goal scorer for Blackburn.
Shearer was top goal scorer for Newcastle.
He was a proflific scorer for England.
He'd score in any team, in the No.9 position.

And this excuse that it is LVG who prevents strikers from scoring, is ridiculous. What manager would tell his strikers not to score? I mean seriously? And why didn't Martial listen to LVG, when he was our No.9 and free scoring?
Di Maria, last year, was also taking pop-shots at goal. Nobody seemed to tell him not to shoot.
It seems that only Falcao (last year) and Rooney (this year), are the one's who refuse to shoot/score.
Falcao is now proving his inability at Chelsea.
And Rooney is proving his inability at MUFC.

6731~~~
Iirc Fergie wanted Lewandowski, Hazard, Kagawa in that summer. So yes, I would say SAF had planned to push Rooney out of the team, He clearly saw this coming. Any manager post-Fergie era would struggle with Rooney whenever he's off form.

6732~~~
Hodgson already dealt with that situation.
Rooney was dropped for the last 2 England games, because he was "injured".
Bear in mind, Rooney played the game (for MUFC), before the 2 England games.
And on the day of the 2nd England game, he declared himself fit to play for MUFC (which he did, against Everton).

I think Hodgson will continue the "injured" excuse, if/when he wants to drop Rooney.

That sums it up nicely.

6733~~~
I think that was more out of fairness to United really, there was no need for him to play and potentially get injured now England have qualified and he's broken the record so Hodgson did Van Gaal a favour. 

I don't think Hodgson wants to drop Rooney yet, not that his international form has been that amazing, England had an easy group and he was gifted a bunch of penalties to get over the line past Sir Bobby.

6734~~~
The gist of that ultimately seems to follow the 'it's someone else's fault ' line that the press trot out in discussion of Rooney. Even the captaincy thing is not an excuse for me. He's been saying from before Van Gaal came that he'd like to be the skipper, and I've never seen it mentioned as an issue with England, arguably an even bigger responsibility. 

I'd be utterly astounded if he returns to any form close to what he was once capable of, rendering this just some sort of blip in form. Also, if this is just a spell of poor form and not a decline , when exactly did it start? If it was just this season, are we then saying that last season was Rooney at his best?  Or the season before that? Because from my observation, he hasn't regularly performed at a level that is fitting of his status in the team for around 3 or 4 years now. So unless we are calling that just an extremely long spell of poor form, all signs point to a notable decline. Unless of course, there s an excuse for him not being as brilliant as he was in 11/12 since then that is of course down to someone else, and he will just return to his 'normal self' once whomever is responsible corrects their errors.

What level of Wayne Rooney performance do you actually expect him to return to if the factors you listed were not an issue? 4 years ago? Or another point since then that wouldnt have been anything special anyway?

6735~~~
who said anything about telling strikers not to score? bar the odd screamer Shearer got his goals from the ball being in the box, something that doesn't happen here. Like what Scholes has just said about Sheringham, Cole and RVN being useless in this team as they need service.

Also Rooney was rested for England because the games were dead rubbers and LVG PUBLICLY said he would prefer Rooney didn't play as he needed a rest. If England needed points he would have played, nothing to do with being dropped for form

6736~~~
Oh I do think it's his own fault. Don't get me wrong. I just wonder whether he'd be quite so abject under another manager, playing for a different team. We've developed into a fantastically boring and conservative team. I can't imagine any attacking player looking at our games and thinking yes, I'll do well there. I'm just floating the idea that whatever is causing Rooney's to play so badly is exacerbated by Van Gaal's influence on our team.

6737~~~
Martial got the ball one time inside the box yesterday, and it was panic galore, but great defending of Ayala to save the day. Rooney got it and lost it every time.

6738~~~
Perhaps, but I think it could be argued both ways personally. As it can be said that Van Gaal is a restrictive manager who is inhibiting Rooney, it can be argued the other way  (although it would still ultimately be LVGs fault tbh). Van Gaal's rep also takes a battering weekly for being negative or whatever, but you can argue that he couldn't possibly have looked a great attacking coach with Rooney, Persie, Falcao and Di Maria in the form they have been in since he came. Martial has had very little trouble exciting fans and being bold, and Van Gaal would look a lot better and a far more adventurous coach if he had another Martial instead of Rooney. 

I don't think his intention is to be dull, it isn't his way or the Dutch way, not historically. I don't think he has had any great offensive players really since he's been here, except a couple months of Martial, and he probably longs for a Neymar or two, probably more than a Strootman.

6739~~~
Martial's performances upfront have put paid to any excuse Rooney could hide behind that its LVG's tactics that are restricting him. The same excuses that were used for Falcao and RVP last season, and have also been blown away by their continued poor performances at their new clubs. 

LVG's football might be boring and slow (it is) but it doesn't make a player unable to control a ball, pass, dribble, run, hold off a challenge etc etc

Rooney's been slowly regressing since 2010, and has finally hit the wall. He's just hit it a few years earlier then anyone expected. His body is clearly ruined, you only have to take one look at the way he can't handle any physical presence anymore to see that. Whether that be pace or strength wise, he just can't deal with it. He either gets outpaced, or out muscled. We're two months into the season and he already looks absolutely shot.

6740~~~
The current Rooney can't lead the line for hereford city 
A scouser not accepting responsibility for something? What ever next?

6741~~~
I blame the Loch Ness Laser.

6742~~~
his intention is to control the game, and if you get 3 chances and don't score/win then its your own fault. that's what I get from his aftermatch interviews

Longing for a Neymar/Bale to make your philosophy work is a bit of a cop out, any manager would do better with outstanding talent

6743~~~
All foreign and younger players will take the fall for his shitness like the line that Scholes and his cast of comedians introduced on the CL night which was reiterated today when Scholes pretty much blamed everything under the sun than our thirty year old boy wonder. It's on Van Gaal to make the big call and let the team move forward.

6744~~~
True, but just as any manager including Enrique at Barcelona would struggle to play great attacking football with Rooney and Memphis in attack.

He does appear to like control, but I suspect that this is because he accepts he doesn't have the firepower to outgun teams, and he would be right. His method is the best method to win with this group I think. We are very hard to score against, yet we can't score for fun ourselves.

6745~~~
You are a brilliant and highly respected poster on here so i'm genuinely interested to know what part of rooney's game do you think is still of the standard required of a literally undroppable captain on the highest salary in the entire club? From your viewing what way can he still be an influential player in this team? What i see is a player who, through playing flat out since he was 16 and through having a physique not made for sporting longevity has reached the end of his time at the top level to the point where pretty much every aspect of his game has rapidly deteriorated. The body just cannot execute what the mind wants it to. You seem to see a still great player who is instead just struggling with bad form- what is it that makes u think he's worth persevering with?

6746~~~
I do agree a bit with the opinion above.I did predict that he will be done at top level sooner than normal players but seems LVG's philosophy and tactics accelerated that "process".

6747~~~
His age and the fact it's pretty much unheard of for any footballer to be finished this young, in the absence of serious injury problems. Plus he's never been a striker reliant on pace to hurt teams, so should age reasonably well.

6748~~~
its not his own pace as such, more everything around him has quickened. The pace and power of the premier league seems to be rapidly gaining on him. he wont forget how to score goals, but his body isn't doing what his mind wants anymore

6749~~~
Maybe Xavi is right perhaps his future from now on is as a deep lying midfielder, he has offered next to nothing this season as a striker and is potentially stopping Martial's development by him playing there.

6750~~~
That is pathetic..but I am not confident of him being dropped. I think Mata and Martial have to step up a level to compensate for Rooney, or we will be in big trouble.

6751~~~
Played him there last season, wasnt very good.

6752~~~
Wasn't Shevchenko finished at this level when relatively young despite the absence of serious injury? Anyway, I don't think it's age so much as playing time and, by those standards, Rooney is more like 33/34 than 30.

I admit it is mystifying and, until recently, I still had hopes of a revival but it is starting to look terminal.

6753~~~
Really? I always thought that his explosiveness over ten yards or so was a huge weapon of his in his peak years. Definitely read years ago that he was one of if not the quickest players in a sprint too.
You're right it is generally unheard of for players to be finished at 30 but not many 30 year old players have been playing top level football relentlessly for 14 years. He's basically 5 years ahead of where he should be. And again, it comes back to his body and the fact he's been playing in such a physically demanding role throughout that time.

6754~~~
I think it's hard to defend Rooney when so much of the problems in his game are hard to put down on to our style/the players around him. I agree with the general view that we're an overly conservative team where the build up play is too slow which makes it harder to effectively lead the line however when you look at Rooney a lot of his problems are very separate from that.

As most have pointed out numerous times when the ball is played to feet to Rooney <i>if</i> he manages to actually control it he is almost never able to turn his man and typically ends up facing our goal and a lot of the time he loses it or tries a switch outwide that comes of as much as it doesn't these days plus it's fairly ineffective when we can't cross particularly well. He's more often that not ineffective in wide areas, not able to take on a full back and when he does get the ball his passing is often backwards. He seems to always want to come to the ball when we really need him running behind and opening space either for a pass to him or for someone else to move in to. He struggles significantly to create a chance for himself. I don't really see these problems with other top strikers and it's nothing to do with the team, look at the contrast in Martial's brief spell up top yesterday.

Like I said there is some truth that the way we set up would make it somewhat harder for most good strikers. Similarly someone like Mata might be more influential in a central role with wingers who run of the flanks/ a striker running in behind. Truth be told I'm not sure who it is our approach is meant to suit as far as I can tell the main game plan is to bank on the other team making a mistake as opposed to really carving opportunities ourselves and playing to the attacking strengths of the players. That said though there's plenty wrong with Rooney's individual play and more wrong there in my opinion than potential flaws in the team set up.

If Rooney does need to start every game, although I'm sure internally LVG must be thinking about this- (I don't really believe too much in us feeling obliged to play him, end of the day Rooney has few options, there's not another top team who will pay him what we do imo and I can't see him opting to move to the middle east or something to maintain his pay level and personally I don't see him someone who will be happy to just turn up for his money)- then I'd prefer him to stay up the pitch and be more of a poacher. At least then he'd push the defenders back a bit and not slow down as many moves . I don't even want rid, in the right circumstances he can be at least a good option, right now though he's inhibiting us, although we are somewhat limited for options given Depays bad form. But with Lingard doing alright it's hard to justify not putting Martial up top and dropping Rooney for a few games. He definitely needs a wake up call.

6755~~~
Yeah the pursuit of Lewandowski made sense back then even when people were wondering why we were after a striker with Van Persie and Rooney in the squad. When you look back, Rooney getting dropped for the Real Madrid games were a big tell sign.

The thing was, Rooney getting phased out by Fergie was business as usual. Ince, Kanchelskis, Hughes, Beckham, Keane, Van Nistelrooy, Stam (although Fergie's gone on to say that was a mistake) all left the club to be replaced by other players who'd stepped up. Scholes and Giggs were the exception, rather than the rule. Gary Neville would've been given chances to do similar to those two, but unlike Rooney, he knew himself when his time was up.

In 2006 when Van Nistelrooy left, Rooney and Ronaldo stepped up. I see parallels when I look at Rooney now, and players like Martial, Memphis or maybe even Pereira. It's on Van Gaal to grow a set of balls and take a risk.

6756~~~
I partly agree with you. And that's why I think he should be benched and not thrown out of the club. 
Rooney needs a challenge. Dropping him on bench will create a spark in him (This is more of a belief than based on hard facts)

6757~~~
I doubt risk is a word present in LVG's dictionary.

6758~~~
Both points don't hold water.

There have been plenty of forwards who were finished <i>as top</i> forwards at 30. Some of them had bad injuries (Owen, van Basten, Falcao), some of them lost motivation (Ronaldinho), some of them became rubbish for no apparent reason (Torres). The King himself retired at 31. Why? Maybe because he didn't want to look like this Rooney?

Rooney hasn't had a career threatening injury but he has accumulated many small injuries and this could be a serious factor for his fitness later into his career. It is a valid point that he has played much more games than your average 30 y. o. forward. Maybe the aging of the body isn't related only to, well, age, but also to overexertion as well? He doesn't look happy on the pitch, maybe he is a bit depressed and this no doubt exacerbates his poor form. But is he depressed because the tactics impedes his self-expression on the pitch or rather because he realises that he can't perform at the level of the best paid players in the world, i.e., because he  can't live up to the expectations? The fat contract he's got has set the bar too high for him.

Rooney hasn't been a striker reliant on pace? You mean that he has relied on his outstanding close control and dribbling ability to make space for himself and get into goalscoring positions? Of course he hasn't, he's never been a Bergkamp or Zola or Baggio. His explosiviness has been a crucial factor in his game, i.e., his ability to get the better of defenders by bursts of energy and quick acceleration over short distances. When you lose this advantage, it's normal to lose confidence to an extent. His top speed is still good but the explosiviness isn't there any more.

6759~~~
Yep I agree, loss of form and been dreadful doesn't equate to you're finished. But the worry is the formation doesn't suit him and I touched on this a season ago. His best chance in this formation is playing off the left and having an interchangeable front three but LVG is proving a little to rigid for this! And for £300 grand a week this might push him out the door as your expected and rightly so to be pulling up trees for this type of money not merely fitting in.

6760~~~
Been on a recent run where I agree with your posts but this seems deluded to me and then people wonder whyit's so sursurprising that LVG is taking so long to drop him.

Most of the senior posters on this site can't seem to see that Rooney is past it and LVG is the same, the poll said it all... many still think he has it. He is a goner and has been a hindrance for a fair while for club and country, especially since WC 2014 where his petulance was incredible. 

There is no way this is a mere lack of confidence and the captaincy point is a joke,  he's not a cricket captain. .. people need to face the clear hard facts about Wayne, its tiring to discuss what is fast becoming a non debate. The evidence before us is overwhelmingly one sided..

6761~~~
Three years of making excuses for Rooney's performances (RVP's arrival, Moyes, LVG's system, playing out of position, etc.) won't be easily brushed aside. Desperation reigns.

I think you are wrong about LVG though. IMO, he sees that Rooney isn't particularly great but he uses him to control the dressing room and to keep at bay his pals in the media. LVG has never been great at controlling the team and was sacked at Bayern and Barca for falling out with key players and losing the plot. He doesn't want to make the same mistake here, all the more he plans to retire soon and this is his last job as a manager. This is why he is extremely cautious with Rooney

6762~~~
There will be a riot if he starts tomorrow and we end up drawing or losing. It may be the final straw. Him being shifted in extra time of the game against  boro showed that Lvg knows he cant get a goal, i hope Lvg drops him for lvg's sake. If he keeps on playing him fans will turn against both.
Old trafford may never boo our own player but going by some reactions from match going fans on twitter the tide even inside the stadium has turned. Not saying they will boo him but the displeasure may be shown.

6763~~~
Surely his age is irrelevant? Whith his natural body types and relatively unhealthy lifestyle choices over the years ( relative as much better than mine but worse then the very elite footballers he should be up there with) he doesn't have the body of a 30 year old

6764~~~
He won't be booed. It's not like he's trying to be crap is it? He works hard for the team and we should at least appreciate that much.

6765~~~
Works hard is an insult to every one on the team.  He's not the only one running. Everyone is playing the same game running the same distance sweating the same sweat. 

You make it sounds as if he's the only one that works hard in a game. 

He's not even that hard workint anymore, he barely sprints these days

6766~~~
No they're not and no they aren't.

Goes without saying that anyone that endorsed booing him is a dick-head. Even if the closest they ever get to <i>actually</i> booing any footballer is belittling him online.

6767~~~
Well at least he works hard for the team,  let's give him a contract extension

6768~~~
Wouldn't the other Utd players be angry and frustrated to see a very poor Rooney starting week in week out ? Just like one rule applies to them and another to him.

6769~~~
I reckon Rooney would make a very good wing back these days. I genuinely believe that. His defending is on point these days.

6770~~~
At the same time pogue how many players explode on the international stage at 16? Even Messi and Ronaldo were 20/21 before they became as good as Rooney (and then obviously accelerated beyond). 


Additionally I think Rooney has lost that quick burst of acceleration that negated his at times awful first touch. It allowed him to quickly rectify his mistakes, but now he makes one and gets absolutely monstered. It also stops him moving into space more freely hence preventing him time on the ball for shooting and passing.

6771~~~
Actually, Shevchenko is a good (and worrying) example. Didn't realise he was the same age as Rooney is now when he joined Chelsea.

6772~~~
Interesting discussion

6773~~~
MLS? maybe when he retires from England national team, if he leave England to MLS he'll lose his captaincy & most likely his place with the England squad. So no way he'll go MLS yet and risking his captaincy.

6774~~~
we should send him a 3 week holiday.

6775~~~
Good video.

The reason why I don't think it's just 'form' and more of a decline like stated in the video is because he's not even shown a glimpse of the Rooney he was.  Usually players in bad form will show something at least, where you can tell they're still world class.  But with Rooney every part of his game is just bang average at best or shockingly bad at worst.  Even his passing, which he started to fall back on in the last few years, is just poor.

Form maybe playing a part in his really bad games, but his good games aren't good...they're "he played alright".  And I honestly believe that is him playing at his best in the years to come.

6776~~~
The Geordie lad had some interesting points to make about Rooney, particularly the bit about rushing him back after the Bayern injury and him not really looking the same player since.

6777~~~
Three week there, then three week back?

6778~~~
I don't think it is Rooney, I think it's the system.

6779~~~
Explain Martials performances at 9

6780~~~
Yeah because he's scoring for fun and playing brilliant for England isn't he?

6781~~~
I hope he is shunted to the left wing vs Palace, from where he can be on the peripheral of our attack with Martial switched to leading the line......

6782~~~
It took us 35 minutes to carve out our first chance on Wednesday night without Rooney in the side might I add.  Wilson didn't fair much better than Rooney in the first half in terms of productivity or creativity.  The system is making some good players look bad imo.

6783~~~
Young, gifted, energetic, and eager to impress, look at Rooney at the same age.

6784~~~
Sooo it is not the 'system' then. Since Martial has performed in it, and Rooney hasn't.
Also explain his reluctance to turn and drive forward, he obsession with spraying the ball out to the right wing.... His inability to take the ball back to goal, hold it up and bring others into play. All points to him not being good enough.

I do think he would score more goals if we just got the ball outwide and peppered balls into the box asap, but blaming the system for Rooneys poor form/performances is a cover up.

6785~~~
You can say that about a handful of our players why's Rooney only being singled out, please don't bang on about his wages as no premier league player deserves the wages they earn in this day and age.

Also, without Rooney in the side on Wednesday night it was more of the same in the first half, zombie football with very little chances created, in fact we looked more dangerous with Rooney on in the second half if anything!

Fair point on Martial but I think he would look dangerous in any side you put him in.

6786~~~
Abysmal players are letting him down.

6787~~~
It is the Rooney thread. Every other player not performing has been dropped. Memphis, Carrick, Darmian (at times) etc.
Yet we persist with a striker where the build up play always seems to break down at him, yet we have a player who was playing well as a striker and refuse to play him there to accomodate Rooney.

He is not being singled out, apart from Memphis he is our worst performer this season, he needs to see the bench

6788~~~
This nonsense again.

6789~~~
Maybe so but the system doesnt make players have the first touch of a rapist.

6790~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6791~~~
Laugh all you want but the system is shit, the football is shit, it will be enough to drag us into the top 4 and that is all, we won't be winning any titles that's for sure.  Rooney will be dropped but the same problems will remain.

6792~~~
We already played better with Martial up top this season, not perfect, but a lot better than with Rooney up top.

6793~~~
Rooney wasn't there the first half of the Middlesborough game and it didn't help...
I don't think he's been playing well, but don't think he's the cause of our problems right now either.

6794~~~
Rooney was lethal at the same age, but it's clear to most people that he peaked too early and is done. I'd love that not to be the case, but watching him struggle to run with a football, control a football, shoot and everything else that should come as basic to a professional footballer has led me to that conclusion.

6795~~~
He's lacking basic technical skills at the minute to even perform to the minimum required level. But yeah, it's the system and van Gaal making him look bad. Also, it's the fecking abysmal cretins of players who can't get the best out of beautiful Wayne.

6796~~~
You can't use a front four of Memphis, Pereira, Wilson and Lingard as a measuring stick can you? Surely a player that can not control a ball half of the time, and is much more negative in possession than Martial, is not helping our cause. He needs to be dropped, as soon as possible.

6797~~~
Life isnt so black and white you know.

Its possible that both the system and Rooney are shite, they arent mutually exclusive. Especially when you consider Rooney's recent England performances, all the way since the World cup have been poor. That is under a manager without any philosophy , yet he has still struggled. 

You have admitted yourself that Martial has looked good within the system, further evidence that the problem here lies with the personnel. 

Of course there are problems within the system, but dropping Rooney will not be THE solution. It should merely be ONE of the solutions.

6798~~~
neither were half of the first team

6799~~~
Why? What would that achieve?

We're two months into the season, where he's just come off a two month break (with no international tournament) and he's playing like this. What would a random three weeks off do to help? Is he going to invent a time machine in that time, and go and bring the 2010 version of himself back? If so, I'm all for it!

Like when Martial played upfront and we instantly looked miles better upfront, and actually had a threat from a central area? Hmmm

The system is casuing Rooney's problems in the same way it was supposedly to blame for RVP and Falcao's poor form last season, and the minute they changed clubs they'd magically return to their best, away from nasty LVG. Remind me, how did that one work out for them?

6800~~~
It's not LvG's systems fault when Rooney isn't able to complete a 5 yard pass, or fail to trap a simple ball to feet or give it away 20 odd times in a single game, 
It's a point though, the style we play can be tough on the forward compounding the issue.

6801~~~
Wilson didn't fair any better in the system as he's a kid with no experience who clearly doesn't look ready for the top level yet, we looked a much better team with Martial as the #9. The system and form excuses are wearing thin, you only have to look at him and look at RvP last season to see it's the same physical decline.

6802~~~
Martial up top guranteed...

6803~~~
Any blaming of the system is a bit bizarre, in respect to Rooney. His looking lethargic, slow, and generally not up to it as a player isn't the result of how we're playing...especially when he was a bit better last season despite us arguably being worse, and a lot better in Moyes' season, which was horrendous in comparison to how we're doing now. Granted, we don't look brilliant creatively in attack, but at most a more fluid attack would perhaps see Rooney scoring the odd extra goal here or there. It wouldn't fix the fact that he just looks a bit hopeless as a footballer right now, especially when Rooney himself is the sort of player you'd want to drag an attack that isn't overly great to a higher level, which Martial often works hard to do.

6804~~~
Wonder why it's only under Moyes, where Rooney was excel. He's awful in the last few years of Fergie retirement, hence the buying of RvP. Then he's been awful under LvG.

Rooney is United legend, and media darling. I'm starting to think that LvG keeps on playing Rooney, until NOT even Rooney's mum can blame LvG if he eventually drops Rooney in the future.

6805~~~
he was on form first part of the Moyes season when the contract debate was happening, and he had a point to prove. After that he levelled off as he tends to do anyway. clusters of great form that gets him credit for the lean periods

6806~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> sorry man. But it's funny.

Martial is currently 10 times the player Rooney is. Him being up top will give us a lot of pace and we will be way way way way better.

6807~~~
There are actually some people here who are defending his current 'performances'? 

Wow! I'll surely have some of the stuff they are smoking.

6808~~~
So Wilson is now a standard bearer for Rooney? When will this end and people start accepting that he is not being made to look bad or that players aren't running of him or whatever the latest excuse and accept that he just hasn't been good enough?

6809~~~
Anyone else seen what that Pilib De Brun guy is going on about on twitter, Malachains.

Last tweet the most interesting one, as are the Scholes on Rooney ones.

6810~~~
I'm not on twitter, so have no clue if I can see most of the stuff posted (sorry I'm useless with modern technology<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>) - but I saw that he said Rooney and CO92 have a 'renewed friendship' and that Scholes is speaking for Giggs. Is that what you're referring to?

6811~~~
Yes, taking with a pinch of salt, but I like Pilib De Brun, he seems to have an idea about what's going on.

6812~~~
Does he really? I thought someone mentioned once that he wasn't as in the know as he liked to portray but I don't much about him. Though tbh, it's possible what he says is true. Might explain the constant defending of Rooney.
Bloody hell, if all of that is true LVG in big big trouble<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6813~~~
I've followed him for a while, he's certainly very opinionated but doesn't seem to speculate, and he gets alot of credible journo's validating what he says when he does stick his neck out, he also meets alot of the players past and present.

Called the Moyes sacking very early on.

I'd go with the opinion that Giggs is in big trouble if he is right.

6814~~~
As far as I'm concerned, Giigs shouldn't be assistant.

6815~~~
Really? Would be sticky though...Imagine Ed Woody and Fergie fighting<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6816~~~
I think it's fair to say we need LvG more than we need Giggs, he gets is Top 4 again then he'll be as safe houses.

6817~~~
Agree. But it' getting the top four that might be a problem if LVG continues with Rooney. He needs to make some big decisions. Don't fancy another season going crazy wondering if we'll make top four.

6818~~~
No me either last season just about finished me off!

I do think that LvG's hands might be ties with Rooney though, highest paid player, captain, sponsors pin up boy... it's very hard for him to drop him, if not impossible.

6819~~~
I agree he's in a bind but someone needs to explain to the sponsors that the pin up boy might not be such a good advert at the moment for them if he continues with his dire form. Why not use Basti/Mata as their pinup boys? Basti is charismatic and Mata is photogenic/charming/intelligent. Surely they'd be better for the 'image'?

6820~~~
New low in Rooney thread.

6821~~~
Schweinstegier won't be because he'll be forever associated with Bayern, and Mata whilst great just hasn't got the worldwide appeal Rooney has, that's the point no one has in our squad, and I don't think anyone is even close, maybe that's why we were so desperate to get a Muller, or Neymar type player in the summer.

Rooney has maybe now reached a point where he is more important to the sponsors than he is to the team, a sad place to be for such a top player.

6822~~~
LvG did actually speak about Rooney today, said he was maybe doing too much.

6823~~~
from what I see Mata is the main guy doing nearly every interview and PR obligation. Rooney actually is a very low key public captain

6824~~~
We'll definitely get top 4. I don't rate LVG in terms of winning us a title, but he's good enough, and our squad is good enough, to get top 4. Look at the teams 'below' us.

6825~~~

When you thought you had heard it all ...

6826~~~
Diesel combustion

6827~~~
10 years on the caf

Bramble is better than Zidane 
Thomas muller is not as good as rooney
Moyes is as good as lvg
Pennant ronaldo
Joe cole is the new messi
Rooney the thor godlike son of odin shackled by the system
Buy the next messi

6828~~~
So, Wilson is now the standard which Rooney is aspiring to?

And with regards to the system:
1. the system does not require a striker to have a bad first touch and the second touch necessitating a tackle (numerous games)
2. the system does not require a striker to stop a counter attack, by side or back passing, when all the attackers are running forward and out numbering the defenders of the opposition (vs Middlesborough)
3. the system does not require a striker to be goal shy and dwell on the ball (see the own goal vs Tottenham)
4. the system does not require a striker to ...

well, you get the drift.

Scoring too many goals?

6829~~~
I don't understand why that is not possible in your reasoning?

6830~~~
Isn't Wilson injured, so maybe that is the standard he wants from Rooney.

6831~~~
I have just bought my little boy the United Annual for Christmas and a calender. Wayne Rooney's ugly mug right in the middle of both of them.

6832~~~
Maybe the marketing thing is true..just imagine how many calendars we will be able to sell with his face until 2019..Oh the joy!

6833~~~
If anyone cares to read this point of view:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2015/10/johnny-giles-man-utds-wayne-rooney-is-complacent-and-in-comfort-zone/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2...yne-rooney-is-complacent-and-in-comfort-zone/</a>

Also what do you make of LVG's general comment here: Surely he can't think Rooney is delivering as he should?

Edit - didn't realise this was already posted in the press conference thread.
<i>“I was manager of Bayern, and there the striker was Mario Gomez, and he touched the ball nine times as an average in a game,” Van Gaal said.
“The highest was 14 balls but he scored every game and I don’t think that our strikers touch the ball less. <span style="color: #ff4d4d">It’s how the balls are coming to him, how he decides, how quick he is in dealing with the situation</span>, it’s much more complicated than everyone is thinking.”</i>

6834~~~
His footballing talent carried him before, now that has gone he doesn't have the looks to make him marketable. RvP might not be as good as he was but he is still a good looking guy.

6835~~~
Can't believe people find him appealing - there's no accounting for taste nowadays smh

6836~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6837~~~
I was being a bit cruel there. Wayne was an amazing footballer who got you off your seat with some of the moments he produced. Now he is a shadow of that. To be using him as the centre of the advertising is madness. If he doesn't improve it might not be good for business.

6838~~~
Don't worry, I agree.

6839~~~
To be fair, I've always liked ugly footballers. Wayne has certainly  never been a looker, but its the football that annoys me now .

Our marketing team need to earn their money by making someone else a star.

6840~~~
To be fair, if he expects Rooney to be happy with touching the ball nine times in a game and still score goals, maybe Rooney isn't the one to blame. He's never been that sort of player.

6841~~~
Looks like he starts.

6842~~~
Untouchable.

6843~~~
Starting today...

6844~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> just got to laugh really.

6845~~~
So round 3732423892 of hoping that he actually performs on a worldclass level.

6846~~~
Don't agree with him starting but nothing to do now so just hope he delivers.

6847~~~
BTW guys, an interesting nugget I just stumbled upon.
The reason why Rooney missed the penalty in our last game was not actually his fault.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/28/manchester-uniteds-wayne-rooney-had-laser-shone-on-him-before-penalty-miss-v-middlesbrough-5468094/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/28/manch...-before-penalty-miss-v-middlesbrough-5468094/</a>

6848~~~
physically shot, can't control it, doesn't take people on, can't pass blah blah

there...saved you all the trouble for 90mins...

6849~~~
poor...

6850~~~
Fingers crossed he actually performs today

6851~~~
Thanks mate.

6852~~~
He keeps floating about the half way line looking the ball, I've seen this in the last few games. Pretty terrible for a striker.

And before anyone defends him: if he was actually effective on the ball you might give him that but currently he does feck all with it.

6853~~~
He was clear in on goal and his touch was so heavy that he couldn't catch up to it. It got to the keeper before he could catch up with the ball.

6854~~~
feckING SHITE

6855~~~
My stream stopped just as he got through on goal. Tell me he scored please

6856~~~
Yeah but we don't create anything for him...apparently.

He's finished. 

He's the fecking reason our chances on goal is low.

6857~~~
It didn't stop.

6858~~~
Poor ball from martial. No need to hit it that far in front, even a straight pass to his feet would have done.

6859~~~
it's laughable LVG let RVP and chicharito go and pinned all hopes on rooney. Why we didn't buy a striker last window is anyone's guess.

Well we actually did but he has to be pushed out wide just so we can play rooney up front it's quite ironic considering rooney sits so deep.

6860~~~
Your stream didnt stop, you were watching a Rooney sprint

6861~~~
Pitiful. That pass couldn't have been any better and he somehow managed to make it look like a difficult ball to deal with. So annoying seeing him like this up front while we are struggling for goals.

6862~~~
With hindsight, it's kinda fecked that Louis let Welbeck go. Not that Danny has set the world alight at Arsenal, but he would certainly suit this style a lot better, whether he'd be played up front or on the left. Pace, energy and works for the team.

6863~~~
LVG can get fecked if he continues with this charade

6864~~~
Not sure it's fair on Rooney to play him up top any more -- hinders us and does him no favours.

6865~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6866~~~
The commentator had just said 'Oh Rooney's through..' I was staring at the screen for about a minute ready to throw the computer out the window

6867~~~
Rooney taking another free into the box. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I give up.

6868~~~
Honesty this is kind of sad to see.

6869~~~
This is why I said he's costing us points. If Martial was on the end of that pass, we'll be in front.

6870~~~
Maybe this thread should be locked until he does something good.

6871~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6872~~~
Rooney has 6 goals this season? 

where? apart from Everton goal, 2? against Brugge? where else did he score?

6873~~~
He looks slow.

6874~~~
I don't actually think he has had that bad a game, but the chance he got was poor from him, looks very leggy. Also again dropping too deep, far too often

6875~~~
2 in the league. 1 he knew nothing about - might as well have been Martial's goal. 

Rest against fodder.

6876~~~
he scored 3 against brugge i think

6877~~~
Really taken the game by the scruff of its neck, captains performance.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Someone needs to stab him in the tunnel.</span>

6878~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Rooney could've took it in his stride but decided to let it run on, partly because he didn't see Henessey coming off his line that quickly and partly because he still hasn't come to grips with his physical decline.

He's got very little chance of breaking that goalscoring record, it seems.

6879~~~
I agree with everything.

6880~~~
Unfortunately it's Captain Birdseye.

6881~~~
I agree.

6882~~~
He's trying, but it isn't working for him. Needs some time to rest. Until next season would be perfect.

6883~~~
True. Abysmal Martial is preventing Rooney from being good. Yet another idiot holding Wayne back.

6884~~~
He is dropping too deep, he is supposed to be leading the line, when we get the ball he is not in the box.

6885~~~
yeah I thought that was strange he fits Lvg system quite well. We could do with someone like welbeck in the team now tbh

6886~~~
I don't think he's been that bad in general play in a lot of games but he's clearly not physically capable of performing as a #9 and in a possession-based team he's a liability at #10. He doesn't fit in anywhere any more.

6887~~~
I don't think he is finished but he needs to be dropped. He needs to come of the bench for a few games and try and make an impact then, he's just taking up a space in the team atm, while do nothing.

6888~~~
I agree

6889~~~
I missed the first half. Is it safe to say people would want him off for Young and Martial through the middle? That's how I would've started

6890~~~
If he's not finished I'd hate to see who is.

6891~~~
Not the worst player on the pitch but he's offered nothing. Whenever he receives the ball, his first instinct tells him to pass it back. It's so embarassing

6892~~~

6893~~~
I hate him now... Sounds strong but i really do. Have never felt this way about one of our own before.

6894~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6895~~~
Sometimes I wonder if there's a clause in his contract that stipulates he'll always play when fit. I remember hearing something similar to that about the captaincy.

6896~~~
The lad needs a break from the team, he's holding us back at the mo. Its not like we dont have a replacement.

6897~~~
It's not going to happen though and it's costing us results.

6898~~~
Sounds pathetic I know, I lost affection for him when he went through the whole contract issue questioning the desire of the club. Add that to his awful game now and I really can't stand the guy.

6899~~~
Rooney isn't the worst today

6900~~~
Just think it's a bit harsh is all. It's van Gaal choosing to play him, mind.

6901~~~
Same.

6902~~~
It's actually a joke how he's still playing.

6903~~~
That sequence at the top of the box where he literally just fell down while deciding what to do with the ball. I feel like comic book guy on the Simpsons logging on the internet to register my disgust.

6904~~~
'Hate' is a bit of a strong word, but I know where you're coming from. I feel the same, he's our only player I dislike and I'd cherish the day he finally fecks off.

6905~~~
Sums him up. No agility, no touch, no awareness.

6906~~~
No hair, don't care.

6907~~~
High praise indeed.

6908~~~
Van Gaal is the one to blame. It's crazy how he plays every match

6909~~~
.

I understand you because I'm feeling exactly the same.

6910~~~
One of our best players ever and comfortably one of our worst players ever.

6911~~~
That was painful to watch. Took so long to make a decision, and didn't make it anyway.

6912~~~
He has to be dropped, maybe it will be the kick up the backside he needs. Awful again today

6913~~~
Sometimes you need to let players play their way into form, but other times a player doing badly just hits their confidence more and more. Rooney's confidence looks shot to me. He's taking 4 or 5 touches before deciding what to do, at which point every one of our players is covered by a defender or he get's tackled.

I dont blame players for being out of form, but I think LVG is doing worse than hurting the team playing Rooney, I think he's really hurting the player.

6914~~~
Van Gaal, Stahp

6915~~~
Falcao wasn't much worse than him.

6916~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6917~~~
I've been all over his back recently but not for today. Our problems seem to run a lot deeper.

6918~~~
The decent cross followed by that stumble and fall attempt at a dribble sums him up at this point, odd good moments here and there followed by utter shittery.

6919~~~
He actually played well for me by the standard I believe he's now in. Problem is that I believe his top level is very, very mediocre and he offers us nothing an average joe in the Premier League would do.
His pace is gone, can't turn a man, that's simply unacceptable for a player in our front four.

6920~~~
His only use currently would be in a David Beckhamesque right sided role putting a bit of a shift in and playing crosses.

6921~~~
But still worse.

RvP wasn't this bad IMO.

6922~~~
I agree with this.

6923~~~
I was about to say at least he didn't do anything good or bad in the second half, a good solid neutral performance but then he lost possession by dithering near the end. Not his worst performance today though and probably not the worst on the pitch today either. That is some high praise

6924~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j316/pimpwich/thumbsdown.jpg" src="http://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j316/pimpwich/thumbsdown.jpg"/>

6925~~~
He wasn't the worst player on the pitch. #improvement

6926~~~
We need to hide him away in the red zone

6927~~~
Only if he would do that better than Young or Lingard.

6928~~~
Think he was helped today by everyone else being rubbish too.

6929~~~
Van Persie actually won us games and points last season.

6930~~~
Really poor and as long as LVG plays him there won't be an improvement at all.

He's also not getting close to that 25 goals <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6931~~~
You need to be able to play in tight spaces in this system. He is shocking in tight spaces. There are times when the ball is passed into him on the ground and he takes a yard touch in the air.

6932~~~
What I thought as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He is simply not good enough to play as number 9 though. If LVG is desperate to have him in the team, just drop Herrera and play Rooney behind Martial. Persisting with this is just madness.

6933~~~
A turd that won't flush.

6934~~~
Yes, his crossing from deep is far better than either player.

Lingard really should be playing from the left, if he plays.

6935~~~
90 minutes again... Fecking con artist. He could score five own goals and say something mean about van Gaal's mum in the post match interview and he'd still be the first name on the team sheet next weekend.

6936~~~
Nobody is bigger than the club, not even Busby, Fergie, Charlton, Law or Best...

...unless your name is Wayne Rooney. 

What a nightmare this is becoming. I'm still hoping he is given until Christmas to prove himself, then he's fecked off and he can eat himself into oblivion.

6937~~~
Man, i miss the old Rooney <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

It was games like these he would just say feck it and do something incredible on his own.

6938~~~
I know what you mean - actually makes my blood boil every time i see him

Time has come. Fans need to turn on him like we did to get rid of Cleverley and Gibson. Sad but its either that or watch him continue to ruin our side

6939~~~
Wasnt the worst player out there. But thats not saying much

6940~~~
Mother Theresa would have thought he was beyond help by this stage.

6941~~~
Desperately needs a "rest".

6942~~~
Wish he'd get injured. I can't see any other way to get rid of him out of the team for a while.

Seriously, I'm super puzzled why LVG is persisting with him, it is the greatest mystery. If it's not in his contract, and it's not a marketing thing, then what the feck is going on? Is he in love with Rooney?<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

6943~~~
Funny thing is that he is so untouchable that he's not even being substituted while playing poorly. We always make substititions taking off players around him - Mata, Herrera etc. - but never him.

6944~~~
He deserves a medal for that, our Scouse captain marvel.

6945~~~
Rooney is clearly our weakest link but yet he keeps starting every game. All the blame is on van Gaal.

6946~~~
That's disgusting, fans don't need to do this..LVG is the man in charge and the man who keeps picking him, yet you want all the fans to turn on any players out of form or you don't like?

6947~~~
Funnily we played better football without him

6948~~~
A rest from now until eternity should be fine.

6949~~~
I love Fergie for dropping him back then. Spineless cnuts Moyes and LvG are.

6950~~~
That's obviously what is fueling the 'contract says he must play' stuff. Van Gaal can't even argue, "Well sure, you know Wayne can get you a goal! I can't sub him." <i>Erm...no he doesn't get us goals Louis, he doesn't give us anything.</i>

6951~~~
Hadn't realised just how slow he is now before today. His pace isn't really highlighted in a short passing possession game, but today we were a bit more speculative, and seeing him chase long passes was painful. Not just slow to move, but slow to react as well.

6952~~~
I actually thought he looked half-decent for much of the first half. And it just went downhill after that. His first touch became...OMG

6953~~~
At least be a good captain Rooney and invent an injury. Don't ruin the season for your team mates

6954~~~
Seriously, he must have some clause or the other - there's got to be something there. Irrespective if there is, Louis needs to say feck it and do the right thing.
It's crazy, not even to sub him? Is Louis trying to make a point or something? Puzzling as all hell.

6955~~~
Martial hasn't beaten two players and smashed the ball in off Rooneys knee for weeks now.

it's poor from Martial.

6956~~~
LvG needs to take the blame here.

6957~~~
If it is a contract thing which was hinted at months ago then our club is a disgrace as we have always said that nobody is bigger than the club.

Starting Rooney every match goes against everything our club is about. Sick of it.

6958~~~
Thought he was decent for his standards actually. He's just pretty shite now. He needs a prolonged run on the bench, and then use him as a sub if we need a goal or to help see out games. Just under no condition should he be starting right now.

6959~~~
I feel he is in the Red-Zone.

6960~~~
I'm not Rooney's biggest fan but I don't blame him for the team's current goal-scoring problems.  Yes he's playing badly, but all the blame for that lies squarely with the manager for me - either drop him or else change the tactics.  This continually playing him and refusing to sub him clearly isn't working and van Gaal needs to try something different.

6961~~~
3 0-0s in a row with him leading the line. (well, more like 2 1/2 because he didn't play full time vs boro, but still unacceptable)

6962~~~
I don't know how he could stomach seeing his teammates everyday. 

Even in team games you hold your hands up if you're having a mare and asked to be subbed if it's not your day. Forget LVG, Rooney should have the decency to tell the boss that he might need some game to regain his composure.

6963~~~
Nah I can't agree with that. It would be of no benefit whatsoever and only likely to have a detrimental effect. Those players didn't leave because of fans criticism.

6964~~~
Looking at how unfit Schweinsteiger is, I think it's best all round if Rooney is deployed deeper. His legs are gone for the strikers role, he'd be better dropping into midfield and offering us something there. 

I know it's ideal but the current midfield bunch can't pass a ball forward between them, at least he'd offer a ball forward.

6965~~~
was it like 0 shots on goal as well? cause I don't recall we have a shot today. A free kick saved and a cross saved is all I can remember

6966~~~
Rooney, passing the ball forward ? Are you serious ?

6967~~~
I think some people are looking at the fact no-one else is scoring and using that to defend Rooney, which is a bit silly.

He's the focal point of our attacks. He's more likely to get into a position to have a 'chance' at goal. If he doesn't do his job (which includes his passing, decision making, touches etc), chances are unlikely to occur.

I understand that some on here don't like the 'pragmatic' system LVG utilises and it definitely has it's drawbacks but Rooney is MAJOR reason we're playing such ineffective football in the final third. It really shouldn't be questioned. There's a reason why no.9 strikers are sought-after and demand high transfer fees.

We won't necessarily become world-beaters overnight if we drop him but I'm convinced that if we did and played out 3-5 games without him, we would see much better football in the final third. I'm sure Wilson despite not having the quality of Rooney in his prime, would still lead us much better.

Unfortunately LVG is determined to never let us see what happens when we do drop Rooney.

6968~~~
If we continue playing the current group the football will never improve. The first thought from each one is a back pass or simple side ball, the drive has gone out of Bastians legs, he's fecked.

6969~~~
Rooney always loves to pass to the RB or RW, he loves to pointlessly switch sides. His passing is atrocious, I do agree with you about Bastian, he has been underwhelming to say the least.

6970~~~
Press has started to turn against him. Lvg can safely drop him without being called out in the press. I wonder if he has the cajones though.

6971~~~
He must really love Halloween, he's been playing like a zombie all season long.

6972~~~
With the way Van Gaal has been responding the press recently, he's probably going to dig in even deeper now over the issue.

6973~~~
<b>Premier League 2015:
</b>
Odion Ighalo, 7 goals in 785minutes for Watford
Wayne Rooney, 6 goals in 2379minutes for Manchester United

(This obviously counts all of last seasons Premier League games during 2015).

Just incredible.

6974~~~
His failure to get on the end of that Martial pass sums up how he's playing. The keeper did well but he could have gotten to it, a few seasons ago he would have.

6975~~~
He is easily one of the worst strikers in the league now.

6976~~~
I'd be seriously worried if he isn't dropped by around thanksgiving period.

...ok, maybe I'm being generous. by next game.

6977~~~
Teddy Sheringham at 35 looked like a lethal striker, even went to the World Cup with England. 

Rooney at 30 is struggling to look like he should still be playing the game.

6978~~~
Harsh

6979~~~
If his name wasn't Wayne Rooney he wouldn't be getting a look in at any side in the Premier League at the moment with the way he's playing. Nothing personal against Wayne, I'm sure he's as frustrated as anyone but LVG needs to wake up and smell the coffee.

6980~~~
On the turd.

6981~~~
On Wayne. 
His form is shit but common, respect the player.

6982~~~
Will be the day he leaves then.

6983~~~
why should we ? because he is captain?
any other player would be dropped like a stone, playing the way he is, might has wee start a game with only 10 men.

6984~~~
Mata has more goals than Rooney in 2015 in the Premier League on 7. Herrera has scored the same amount as Rooney on 6. If you put those goals together you get 19, Kane has scored 20 in 2015 in the Premier League.

6985~~~
£250k for that performance. And all the others this season.

6986~~~
Becasue he has played for this club for 10 years or summat. In the process he has scored many important goals. Yes he deserves to be dropped but calling him names is childish.

6987~~~
What do you suggest then? If you are happy to sit and watch him earn 300K a week to single handedly drag our team down to mediocrity then I am sorry but I just don't think you care as much as I do. Because at the moment never mind booing him I feel like punching him in the face

6988~~~
Wtf? Are you for real?

6989~~~
FM nailed his preferred moves.

"Argues with officials."

6990~~~
Not going to be dropped but perhaps if Martial is moved back up front and we play Rooney in the hole, it will at least mean we'll score...

6991~~~
Definitely. How far do you go? Ighalo or Rooney? Charlie Austin or Rooney? Solomon Rondon or Wayne Rooney? Because at the moment he isn't just playing badly he looks like he would struggle in a pub match

6992~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Can't wait to see what the updated 'attributes' are in the next game. That will be some fall from grace.

Teams wouldn't pay more than £5million for the poor bloke at present.

6993~~~
Ighalo looks like a world beater next to Rooney. Rondon hasn't scored much but he's been much more present in games than Rooney.

6994~~~
Vardy looks like fecking Ronaldo Fenomeno next to Rooney. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6995~~~
Rooney must certainly have a clause in his contract where he has to be picked if fit.  Otherwise, I dont see any other logical explanation why he's continued to be played.

and 300k a week to boot.  feck David Moyes.

6996~~~
That's really the big problem. He isn't even average anymore. I watch other teams and almost any striker I see, looks more agile, dangerous and willing to make something happen than Rooney. His first touch is horrible, he can't hold up the ball and is disposed with absolute ease by any defender in the league. He has lost a good bit of pace and only seems to have the legs for maybe 1-3 sprints every game anyways. Watching Chicharito in the last couple of games for Leverkusen I'm almost certain we sold the wrong striker.

6997~~~
He's got 15 goals in 2015 compared to Rooney on 6. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Even Charlie Austin managed 6 goals last season in 2015 and he's now in the Championship. That's how bad Rooneys goal scoring is this year, truly a year for him to forget unless he suddenly scores 10 odd goals.

6998~~~
It is sad, for a while a lot of fans thought that this was a shit run of form and weren't ready to accept that he was finished as a decent (notice I didn't even say top) player. He's a liability and a joke.

6999~~~
Off topic a bit but just watching the All Blacks win and their captain Richie McCaw is unbelievably great. The passion he has, the intelligence, knowing when to calm his players down when they're under pressure.... honestly, sat here wishing we had a leader like that..

7000~~~
He didn't do much during the game. I didn't do much during the game. Can I claim his 300k paycheck in his stead?

7001~~~
Absolutely - said a few pages back, he's (Rooney) the worst captain I've ever seen for United. Completely devoid of leadership qualities. 

The whole first team is rotten from it.

7002~~~
His forward passes stats are legendary on here.

7003~~~
Need to lose the captaincy and his place. Not surprised there is this malaise in the team - we see it with the national team all the time. Sadly I can't see one English football player with any leadership qualities. It is all about hype, the media, leaking crap, getting managers sacked etc - it's infuriating. What's worse and so disappointing is that LVG doesn't seem to see this. Really disappointed.

7004~~~
The Rooney of the last year, I think he's the worst consistent starter I've ever seen for Utd.

7005~~~
I would be interested to understand people's opinions on why Rooney is still playing, don't know how to start a poll but the way I see it it's either,

a) LvG genuinely thinks he has been playing well
b) The management are pressuring LvG to select Rooney as he is our most marketable player
c) There is some clause in some contract (either the kit deal with Adidas or Rooney's) that says he has to play a percentage of games
d) LvG is scared of what Rooney's reaction to being dropped might do to the dressing room
e) LvG thinks that he is the best of a bad bunch of options

My opinion is 90% d) and a little bit of e)

7006~~~
2 moments I recall left me open mouthed, there was a one two Herrera tried to play a bit further out than the d edge of the box, it was like hitting a brick wall off him

then in the second half he was on the left wing, turns into the game to see a pass while the defender just takes it off him

7007~~~
I think it's difficult to choose one or the other - I think it's a combination of a bit of (c) (d) and possibly (b) to some extent.

7008~~~
I can't believe you've listed 5 ridiculous options and missed the sensible one.

f) He recognises Rooney isn't playing well and hopes/prays he'll play himself back into form because a peak Rooney is better than all our other striking options. 

Thats the reason, thats always the reason when managers play over the hill players long past their sell by date.

7009~~~
The real moment that defined what sort of captain he would be was the 5-3 last season against Leicester. You saw him ranting and raving, blaming everyone after conceding a goal that came from <b>him losing the ball. </b>

He's not someone you make a captain and instruct to lead your side. Even at his best, he's just a guy who you'd want him to do his 'job' (in his case, score goals). He doesn't have any qualities beyond that.

7010~~~
The annoying thing about Rooney is this premise around him that all he cares about is playing football, money and the limelight is secondary and is not chaser of it.

Yet the only reason he is paid so much is because of holding the club to ransom and his marketabiliy, you just need to look at his adopted celebration, to know that is not true, and there is nothing in his performance to suggest he should be on the wages he is on, even 2 years ago. I am sure Giggs and Scholes were on 60-100k in their 30s.

We could all blame Moyes for the contract he is on, but that really should be on Woodward, he sactioned it. Hes going to be getting these wages until he is 33...

7011~~~
It's a disgrace that he is still starting matches but it's sheer incompetence from LVG keeping him on for ninety minutes. He should have been the first player off. I accept that we lack options but between now and the winter window, when we can do something about it, we should try Perreira and Lingard alternating on one wing with Young on the left, Martial uptop and Rooney out of the side.

His apologists will bang on about the lack of service but when you see him failing to trap simple balls you then question; what would be the point?

7012~~~
Don't forget our inept performance away to Everton as well when we were thumped 3 nil after we had been playing well before and then we suddenly decide we didn't feel up to it<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Games like Leicester and Everton away we need our captain to keep things together. He won't accept any responsibility if he's crap - not gonna go down well with the dressing room - it's gotta cause problems as I said in the other thread.

7013~~~
A mix of E and F I'd have thought.

7014~~~
So how have I missed it then - that's basically e) which I say myself is probably partly true

7015~~~
I really think he's only playing because he's close to the record, LVG doesn't want to be the guy that stops it from happening

7016~~~
I don't think it's all Rooney's fault, to be Rooney that we know he should be making tackles and running on defenders and making creative forward passes. Rooney shouldn't be captain responsible and it's not only down to the captaincy thing it's just LvG style doesn't fit Rooney so one has to go or they have to change his role and give him more freedom. But after saying that if Rooney lost his enthusiasm to play for the shirt and I hate to see him leaving he needs at least a kick on the ars by the manager not constant praise.

7017~~~
That failure by LVG to see or accept that this guy has fallen off the cliff is reason enough to note that this is not the manager to take us forward. A manager who is willing to take the down for the benefit of one player has no place at this level of the game.

7018~~~
If we allow Rooney to keep playing despite his evident regression, simply to break an excel sheet-esque goal record, then we've fecked it as a football club.

Barely anyone outside our club knew that he was close to it until it was brought up recently in the media in the last couple years. It's not that fecking important if he breaks it.

It also diminishes it (the record) and its importance a tad when we're having to drag the git over the line with regards to it. I mean essentially if RVP (or anyone else) was in his place and close to the record, we would have sold Rooney instead or something?

This is all of course forgetting that if Rooney was anywhere near as good as his paycheck and reputation in the English media suggests, he would have broke the record at least 3 years ago.

7019~~~
Let's face it, the club treat him like a king - look how the MUTV people drool all over him? It's Rooney this Rooney that - we can blame the manager but he is only partly to blame for falling for Rooney's crap - but most of the blame lies with the club for giving this elevated status. Woodward needs to sort it the feck out and if it's LVG that's being stubborn, then <i>order</i> him to drop Rooney's ass.

7020~~~
It's got nothing to do with any record. It is insane that he is never dropped but it would be batshit of the highest order if the reason was for him to break a scoring record

7021~~~
Was the best game I've seen him play this season. Actually was the only attacking player doing anything. Still poor but better than the other performances.

7022~~~
Remember when Chelsea wanted him? For a lot of money? Missed our chance we did.

7023~~~
That would have been Sheva, Torres, (others I'm possibly forgetting) and then Rooney. Chelsea mugged off - then, now and always.

7024~~~
I thought then it was a good idea to get rid of him - but most United fans didn't agree..... so there you have it.

7025~~~
Martial was better, of course. Kelly struggled against Martial and their manager changed his position in order to avoid him being red-carded. Besides, Martial created a very good chance for Rooney. Rooney wasn't that bad, just painfully average. It isn't surprising that Leicester are above us.

7026~~~
Yip. We desperately needed leadership and our captain made a balls up before screaming at a nervous looking Mike Smalling and a teenager. Great leadership there.

I'm utterly baffled what it is LVG sees in him as a leader. He's come out and said he's the best captain he's ever had, what does he do when he's not hiring and firing the kitchen staff?

7027~~~
I think off the pitch, Rooney is great with the guys. Also almost every United player interviewed says Rooney is a monster in training - more in the working hard sense than the quality sense im sure. That is what LVG probably means when he says he is great captain.

7028~~~
This is closer to the truth for me. I believe there is a serious incentive for him to break the club goalscoring record, both for the club and Wayne to gain publicity and money. He is being given every chance to get across that line, and coupled with Van Gaal's stubborn nature, we are unlikely to see change soon.

7029~~~
He's utterly fecking shite. Worst player in the PL atm.

The most animated he gets is when he's running over to shout at the ref.

7030~~~
The problem is the hair. Balding/bald Rooney is better than transplant Rooney.

7031~~~
Just read on the Guardian that he was 'isolated and starved of service.' What game were they watching?

7032~~~
Its never Saint Wayne's fault. The poor little lamb, constantly let down by all those around him. If he had better team mates he'd be as good as Messi.

7033~~~
I don't buy this theory that LVG is scared of dropping Rooney for morale reasons. This is a guy who seems to almost thrive on conflict and hardly seems the kind to bow down to anybody, whether it be the locker room (just ask Luca Toni,) or the higher-ups (ask the Bayern hierarchy.) I think he's just being stubborn and trying to prove a point (that he was justified in making Rooney his captain and sticking with him. It's the only explanation that remotely makes sense (not that I agree with it at all.)

7034~~~
The commentators were over the top in their efforts to either praise him ('that's a fantastic pass') or downplay his shiteness ('he didn't hit it too well'.) But Martial get singled out in the strongest terms as he failed to make one run into the box.

7035~~~
The milk has gone stale. Im being dead serious if I say he wouldnt improve a championship side. He's just average in everything he does at best, at the moment. He doesn't have anything that sets him apart.

7036~~~
For me, the picture (or I should say the video sequence) that said a thousand words about how bad he is now is when he was too slow to catch what was a perfect through ball from Martial and then added insult to injury by fanning on the shot. Mark that moment with a hot rod into your brains, people. That's the perfect example there is to explain how Rooney has lost that split second/extra step that differentiates quality players from average ones.

Did anyone feel that way when you saw that moment?

7037~~~
Maybe he doesn't want to heap the pressure of being Man Utds main attacking option on the shoulders of an inexperienced 19 year old considering the likely reaction should he not score a hat trick in every game........

7038~~~
If Falcao had played like this especially playing every minute he would have been slaughtered by the media. Not them making excuses.

7039~~~
To hell with that. Wayne Rooney was given the task to carry the attack on his shoulders when Van Nistelrooy started showing signs of slowing down and repeated injuries. I don't think there's an issue in doing that again with another 19-year-old if he looks fit to do it at the moment. Furthermore, Martial looks to be well ahead of where Rooney was at the same age in terms of fitness and vision of the game.

7040~~~
Rooney was FAR more experienced, and already used to the British press when he signed for Utd.

7041~~~
Martial is not that familiar with English yet (since Schneiderlin is still translating for him). So I don't think he would care too much from press-related stuff that doesn't come from his native France, and that's a big plus right now.

7042~~~
Yeah, I doubt the French press would be bothered printing stories about a 19 year old French lad who has just displaced Wayne Rooney in the Utd side.

7043~~~
Yea, guys, look, we're all sitting here getting pissed off at him being incredibly shit, don't you think that our players might possibly be pissed off at him as well? He's fecking up most of the attacks, doesn't do shit, everybody knows he's the highest earner, other players around him get subbed and he's never subbed, he's the first name on the sheet, been throwing his toys outta pram more than once saying he wants to leave and all that. 

You've got a co-worker like him, do you REALLY like him? Thinking even about Mata today who's genuinely a nice guy, he was walking off pissed off, not saying that it was purely down to this, but maybe, just maybe something popped in his head along lines like 'fecking hell, I wasn't the one to get subbed'? 

It's not like our team is filled with fecking idiots, they see how things roll at United at the moment.

7044~~~
He already is regardless of whether Martial is up front.

7045~~~
He was bad today but unlike other weeks there were a few players that were far worse than him.

The fact is he has 2 PL goals in 10 games playing 90 minutes in pretty much all the games. One came off his knee and the other was a one on one. The numbers are dire and the performances are just as terrible.

How much longer will LVG ignore the obvious and start substituting him because we all know its folly to expect him to be benched eh?

7046~~~
It's like the guy who is always late for work and the boss says nothing. You do it once and are on report. We all know them.

7047~~~
Yeah, he's the one were looking to when we need a goal, If anything playing him centrally would make his job easier.

7048~~~
Yeah but while the pitch forks are out for Rooney the focus will be off him.

7049~~~
Didn't make it look much easier today, if anything he looked more of a threat when he was out left.

7050~~~
Martial played 68 games prior to his move.
Rooney played 77. Not a lot between them, other than the league.

Pressure doesnt seem to affect Martial. He seems as if he was ready made to be our saviour (attacking woes).

7051~~~
Everytime I see Rooney play I think of this:

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

In Rooney's support, I think Rooney did "okay" today.
There were other players on the pitch who played worse.
The only issue I have with him is that he is undroppable, yet isn't a top player.

7052~~~
Rooney's ratings and how they compare to the rest of the team are amazing:

Tottenham 5.4 - 2nd worst
Villa 3.6 - worst
Brugge 5.7 - 3rd worst
Newcastle 4.8 - worst
Brugge 8.8 - best
Swansea 3.1 - worst
Southampton 4.8 - worst
Ipswich 6.7 - average
Sunderland 6.8 - below average
Wolfsburg 4.7 - worst
Arsenal 3.8 - 3rd worst
Everton 6.8 - below average
Moscow 4.7 - worst
City 4.5 - worst
Middlesbrough 3.0 - worst
Palace 3.7 - worst

7053~~~
Rooney had led the line for England at a major international tournament, not that the press around the England team is unrealistic or anything.

Yeah, what could go wrong.

7054~~~
If I had a co-worker who keeps on getting late in whatever he or she is asked to, whether it is about getting to work in time or about getting the job done, I would go to my boss and ask him/her to do fecking something before it hurts the results at work. Right now, I'm sure there are many players who feel that way and I'm pretty sure many of them already went to have a word with Van Gaal about that. The big problem here is Van Gaal not having the balls to take any action against that washed up employee named Wayne Rooney.

At some point, I hope that one of our senior players who doesn't give a shit about Rooney will come up and lash it out like an angry Al Pacino calling out Kevin Spacey for doing a shit job as a boss.

7055~~~
my recollection was that he could have took a touch but let it run infront of him. Worse than being too slow for it

7056~~~
So VOTM half the games he plays accord. to the Caf...

7057~~~
Him being England's darling doesn't help, I feel no journalist has the balls to ask LvG this question : "Is Wayne Rooney untouchable ?"

7058~~~
The problem is as soon as the press start asking Van Gaal why Rooney doesn't get dropped they have to start asking Hodgson the same thing and they're not going to when he's just broken the England scoring record and England won all their qualifying matches, no need to rock the boat. It doesn't matter that he limped over the line to beat Charlton's record, gifted a bunch of penalties in easy games, he's still the main man.

7059~~~
Removing Rooney and playing faster, quicker players.. injecting some pace and flair into this side would make Martial's job easier and kickstart some run of form for a few others. Might bring out the best in players like Mata, Herrera too.. making the team less reliant on Martial than it currently is. There is no doubt that quite a few players in this side are playing for their futures here but playing Wayne is making everyone's job that much harder and it must be demoralising seeing him start and finish every game despite being our worst performer by far this season.

He is physically done, there is no improvement to be had in his game.. at least the other lads may have an upturn in form, the potential is there as we saw last season. You are more comfortable criticising the likes of Herrera than telling it like it is with Rooney. He is finished - simple as, protecting Martial is not a valid excuse as the team is getting more stick right now and attracting more negative comments than ever.

7060~~~
After 4 winless matches and only 1 goal scored in that time (390 minutes of play), do you see any sense in not rocking the boat?

7061~~~
Rooney is finished?  I think people forget that even SAF only used him for one season as a ST and that wasn't a particularly great year either. 

This lack of form from alot of our players is happening because of memphis & not rooney; if  memphis could play even 50% of thr way he did against basel then every player would be playing in their best position bar maybe mata.

7062~~~
Watching him run today you can see he's overweight. He's a fat disgrace. Fergie would whip him out of the team in an instant.

7063~~~
Van gaals training is definitely harder than fergusons.  Maybe not better but definitely harder.

7064~~~
All that <i>might </i>happen, or it might not. The question was asked as to why we don't drop Rooney for him and I posed some possible answers, aside from the usual 'LvG is afraid of him', there are other, IMO, more realistic potential reasons, thats it. 

Owen, Rooney, Fowler, are 3 players who were over-relied on in their teens and, arguably as a result, suffered later in their careers - maybe LvG is trying to avoid something similar with Martial. 

I'm comfortable criticising Herrera because his performance today, and recently, deserves criticism, but yeah I should probably ignore everything else and just join the chorus on Rooney - whose performance I haven't defended or justified in any way, because it doesn't deserve any.

7065~~~
That's a bit harsh on Memphis, it's not his fault Rooney looks so bad, Martial has done well on the left yet Rooney still looks lost.

Anyway if Memphis was playing well then where does this leave Rooney? On the bench? This doesn't seem to be an option, so obviously Herrera or Martial will be there instead.

7066~~~
I thought he was no worse than anyone else on the pitch really. However the issue is that 8 of the 11 players on the pitch for us played bad games, but for Rooney that was a <i>good </i>game..

7067~~~
calling names I agree , but the rest does not matter , the way he is playing right now is an embarrassment to him and the club.

7068~~~
lol.

I have to disagree with the bolded bit there. There was others that played as bad or bad for their standards but I don't think blatantly 'worse' than Rooney.

Herrera had an off game but you could tell the quality is there even in little spurts. He was one of the worse players because we know what he's capable of and he didn't deliver half of that.

7069~~~
You're completely justified criticising Herrera but one of the most telling point about the games today was Herrera's neat lay off into Rooney (back to goal at the edge of the box) with Herrera looking for a one-two. Rooney fired it into Herrera as a result of a bad pass/he actually meant to pass it back to another player further back. 

It's not nitpicking but it's a team game and sometimes you're only as good as your weak link. There are not many players in the world, who can take the game by the scruff of the neck and break down stubborn defences but that doesn't mean your Herreras, Matas, Schweinsteigers aren't good players because they can't seemingly open a game. No imo, it's simply because Rooney is the blunt spear and stopping the penetration.

7070~~~
Has Rooney ever been a proper striker though?  He cannot lead a line properly because his natural game is to drift around the pitch.  Isn't this why we bought van persie anyway?  

Some people here complaining about the fact that Rooney is bigger than the club when i would say the loaning out of januzaj proves that Rooney wasn't really intended to be the striker leading the line. 

Yes he should do better; but memphis being off form has made our no 1 striker (with goals to his name) shifted to the left; our AM in rooney shifted to ST and Herrera (who i dont think is a AM)  also possibly played out of position. 

We still however seem to have a squad depth of a team not in the CL & we cant afford to have players like memphis taking too long gettingn out of ruts.

7071~~~
I feel the same, and its really disconcerting.

7072~~~
What surprises me the most is that he is never substituted.  However big name a player might be, usually if they are not playing well they will at least be substituted here and there. Usually they are given a role from the bench for a couple of games or so. If not they might start but if they are off form they'll be taken off. 

I have never seen anything like this.  Somebody who is playing as bad as this playing pretty much every minute of every fecking game. Even against Boro he was the first player brought on.  <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Has a similar situation ever happened anywhere before,  where the consistently worst player gets played every single minute of every game?

7073~~~
13 off the goal scoring record.. Will he get it this season? If not, he isn't going anywhere in the summer.

7074~~~
Apparently some fella rang into the phone show on MUTV and said he is playing badly because he has piles <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

7075~~~
No Herrera was poor as was Mata and Darmain. Rooney played better than these guys imo. Rojo had a tough time today as did Blind as well.

7076~~~
Again not Memphis's fault, if LvG hasn't planned for the Memphis struggling in the first few months then he's nuts, also people soon forget that Memphis starting playing badly after Shaw got injured, hardly a help having your partner on the left and good buddy getting that sort of injury as he's adjusting.

Rooney and pundits bleat all the time about playing him as the main striker, the guy hasn't scored as many as he has by not been a top striker, the simple fact he is he isn't/can't perform any more, it's not anyone's fault, not even Rooney's but it needs sorting out, shifting him into the number 10 role will solve nothing.

7077~~~
I have taped the show. That will be worth waiting for. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7078~~~
Isn't it worrying that Rooney's good game would be bad in most people eyes.

7079~~~
Let me know if it's true <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

7080~~~
You can blame Rooney all you want but van Gaal is the real problem with the seemingly unstoppable status he's been given.

He's got a clear option. Drop Rooney, play Young to the left and Martial up top.

7081~~~
that seems to be the level he has dropped to now. He had some stinker moments again, yesterday. But it becomes accepted if he does some standard things to counteract them

7082~~~
Just because we got used to Rooney's shit performances doesn't mean we will lower our expectations and can judge other players equally... Rooney was the worst on the pitch again. Couldn't pass, control the ball, the basic stuff you expect from north conference player.. he was also too slow for the perfect pass, someone as average as Dwight Gale would have scored in the position. Even someone as slow Berbatov who would have controlled the ball.

The combination of disastrous touch and movement of pub players is the worst thing what can happen to a striker.

Rooney was the worst again even right now it wasn't by a country mile...

7083~~~
I'm really scratching my head about Rooney now, I've been defending him all season, but it's now beyond the defending point. Unfortunately, he's now played 16 games and beyond maybe one or two games he's been pretty much awful in them all.

Okay, I can accept the professional point of view that he's not being supplied, but that doesn't really tell the whole story as we know Rooney of old would have offered far more to the team than we're currently getting.

I don't think he will drop him, I also don't believe we have the experience or the talent in reserve to replace him on the field. For me, we've got to invest in January, whether that's another attacker on the right hand side or an out an out striker. We need more pace and creativity up field.

7084~~~
Van Gaal is a pussy. And this issue is beginning to turn me against this manager. This is costing us points. Even though we were shit yesterday, if he had any legs, he would have scored and the game might have been different.

7085~~~
this is the issue now, what's he worth?

7086~~~
Repost when the drinks worn off!

7087~~~
He at least used to get subbed/rested/rotated didn't he? Seems like he's playing more minutes than ever now.

It's as if Van Gaal is trying some brute force method to kick start some form into him. It can't last.

7088~~~
We shall flog him back into form. I like it

7089~~~
So this is our idea of a public flogging?

7090~~~
seems like it is you who needs to sober up<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> seriously. whats wrong with the comment, pardon me if it was sarcasm...

7091~~~
Lol just you managed to slag off Berbatov Gale and Rooney plus half the pub players in Britain in one post! Rooney wasn't the worst yesterday far from it. He's been dreadful this season but was certainly nowhere near our bottom performers yesterday.

7092~~~
Probably<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7093~~~
The manager has left the squad in such a situation that it's incredibly hard to rotate players in attack. We have next to no options.

7094~~~
Indeed. We've managed to spend a simply staggering amount of money signing players for a club that arguably has the best record of any other club at producing PL players from its own academy, yet somehow ended up with a squad that seems more lacking in depth than any other top four contender. It's quite the achievement.

7095~~~
It's not even due to misfortune or missing out on a target either. The manager wanted it this way. Letting Hernandez and Januzaj go that late in the window was madness. He then has the temerity to complain about the players being tired two months into the season. The more I write this post the more I realise the manager may have to go.

7096~~~
If he saw Wilson as legitimate competition for Rooney's place, then he should have played him long before now. If he's since realised that this isn't the case then it's another to add to his long list of poor judgement calls. 

He's also talked about Martial being young and needing to carefully managed. Now look at him, playing every minute of every game and no obvious candidate to give him a break any time soon.

7097~~~
Yet Lingaard is trusted on the right hand side, why Pereira isn't being given the same game time is anyone's guess. 

The continued overlooking of Wilson and Pereira is a complete mystery to me, both are clearly ready for first team football. And the first team is clearly in the need of a kick start a young talent might bring.

7098~~~
We shall hear it all again about no xmas break means players cant recover. Tells the players they are tired

7099~~~
I just keep watching it over and over again. Never in my life have I seen a top-level striker fail to keep up with a perfectly-weighted ball like that; it's absolutely disgraceful and the sheer cheek of Van Gaal to criticise Herrera for missing our "only chance" because he wants to ignore the lump he has up front.

7100~~~
What the feck is Rooney  doing there, the weight on the pass was almost perfect and he steps over it?

7101~~~
Look closely at it; he honestly can't catch up to the ball to control it; he isn't even letting it run beyond him; he just simply can't break stride to control the ball because he's flat out just trying to keep up with it. That's how dreadful his mobility is these days. He has to be benched, and Van Gaal has to go.

7102~~~
So infuriating. It's such a perfect pass from Martial and Rooney just balls' it up.

7103~~~
Van Persie and Falcao would have also fluffed that chance in the same way Rooney did unfortunately. It reflects how poor some of our strikers have been recently, I wonder if we should have at least given Hernandez another chance as Wilson does not seem to be ready. I fear Rooney will outlast Van Gaal if this goes on, but I want irritarate that Rooney was not the reason we didn't win the game yesterday. For me, his performance in the City game was much worse when others were playing much better.

7104~~~
He doesn't have to be the sole reason we don't win a game to get dropped; what we should be looking at, as fans of a massive club, is what his level of contribution is. His strop after Rojo's long ball forward really irritated me immensely too, because the guy doesn't play well enough to criticise anybody else, and that kind of strop is not how you lead on the pitch; he just looks spoilt, and I don't see how his fellow players can really see him as a leader. You have to look up to and respect the character of a leader. Do you think Basti or any of the Spanish, French, Belgian and Argentinian lads feel that way about Wayne? I think they're all starting to wonder what on earth is going on at our football club, going by the look of dejection they carry around. it's taken him longer to do it, but Van Gaal, with his undroppable captain and structured, defensive football, has sucked the joy out of the club just like Moyes did. You can see it in the players and in the fans.

7105~~~
That pass though. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7106~~~
What, in 09/10 when he scored 34 goals? You think his best season wasn't a particularly great year?

You think Memphis is the reason Rooney's first touch is currently atrocious? Or why he lost the ball 28 times with a pass accuracy of 55% against City? Or why he's too slow and couldn't finish that through ball from Martial yesterday?

OK.

7107~~~
I think you misunderstood me a bit, I'm not saying he shouldn't be dropped (as I think he should be), just that he's isn't fully accountable for us not winning. My point overall was that Van Gaal is only adding to his problems by not dropping Rooney, in fact I believe that with Rooney out of the squad more of our counters, forward moves and ability to keep the ball in the final third would be improved. I think you've forgotten just how bad the Moyes era really was, Van Gaal has been bad at times but he's been much better than Moyes ever was.

7108~~~
I honestly haven't; the football we're playing at the moment is just more functional than David Moyes' United, but we're just as joyless to watch. We don't score goals or create chance, but worse than that, we don't have any intent/urgency in our play. We all thought when we got Van Gaal we'd play in the style of Bayern Munich and Barcelona, but do we heck. We don't press high and pen teams back in their own half; we keep the ball as part of a defensive strategy, and it is dire to watch. This all comes from the manager, and it won't get any better while the entire team continues to revolve around the mind-numbing, riskless retention of the ball and the guy we currently have up front. What you have to ask yourself is: is either of those things going to change under Van Gaal? I've supported Van Gaal fully until yesterday, because I've come to the conclusion they won't change under him. I had the same experience with Moyes. I waited and waited for a sign of progress in the football we played, not just the results, and it never came, and after the game we played against Everton where the shape of the team was literally a square that we passed the ball around inside only to get countered over and over again, I decided that the game was up. Van Gaal has reached the end of my patience, particularly with this Rooney business. If he were to show some humility and drop his captain, I could get behind him again and give him more time.

7109~~~
Maybe we need to put velcro on Wayne's boots to make the ball stick.

7110~~~
It appears from that angle that once the ball goes past him he never makes up any ground on it, if anything the gap slightly increases. The keeper being so quick off his line spares Rooney further blushes because it looks like if you gave him another two yards he still wouldn't have reached it. 

The clip sums up Rooney nicely, it's not that he isn't trying he just simply isn't capable of things we once took for granted.

7111~~~
I have been trying to avoid this form and thread since yesterday because of anger. The way LVG has handled our attack this season is negligent. We lost 6 attackers and brought 2 in. 1 and a half will be more ant because Memphis is half a player at the moment. We are now in a situation where we keep starting a player who's playing like a pensioner. It's unacceptable.

7112~~~
imagine that was  Herrera

7113~~~
What made it funny is our the co-commentator didn't even criticize Rooney for not touching the ball but instead went on to praise the keeper (who did well tbh but Rooney should have either shot or dribbled him). It's like in the eyes on many media, he can do no to little wrong.

7114~~~
Sign Rooney Mara.

7115~~~
He most certainly was. I suggest to watch the game again. It wasn't his worst game to say the least. But his lowest standard is too low..

7116~~~
Not yesterday unfortunately there were far worse performances!!

7117~~~
That gif I posted, alone, makes him the worst player. He is completely finished and all this "he wasn't the worst performer" in (insert game here) is just an attempt to paper over the enormous, hideously-obvious chasm that is our lack of a striker; we have a fatty who has the touch of an elephant trying to lindy hop playing there.

7118~~~
that's not the worst part of yesterday. there was one where he tried to shimmy past 2 players, and just fell over. Like he outconfused his own body

7119~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7120~~~
I wonder what LVG will say about that. He is very quick to criticise all players, except for Rooney... He'll probably tell Martial, that the pass was too heavy.

I noticed on MOTD yesterday, Gullit looked at that. He didnt say it was a good through-ball. He said, "unlucky".
Seconds later, the pundits proceeded to say that our other players are not creating enough chances for Rooney. But Rooney himself, was not criticised.

7121~~~
His status has elevated him to a position his performances simply don't merit, and I think the arrogance of our manager and Rooney himself is the most bewildering and infuriating thing about it.

It's always somebody else's fault when it comes to Rooney's garbage form; he's been the untouchable golden boy of English football since he became captain of club and country, which is all the more maddening for us, the fans, who know he's shot. The situation is causing me to really dislike him, to the point where I cannot stand the sight of him in a United shirt.

7122~~~
You see the problem in dropping him - carnage in the media when it happens. But it has to be done for the good of the team.

7123~~~
As I didn't get to watch the game, on the Herrera chance - is it true that Martial seemed reluctant to pass to Rooney and waited for Herrera? I just saw someone comment about that under an article.

7124~~~
A lot of rubbish

7125~~~
Think people are going way overboard with Rooney. He's not playing well for a while now and needs dropped but people saying he's finished are way premature imo. Time will tell I guess. You are just being disrespectful at worst and stupid at best.

7126~~~
Wait, so on the one hand you say time will tell, but on the other hand you say those who think he's finished now are being disrespectful at worst and stupid at best; how about we're right and you're wrong? Is that a possibility? Because if it is, you're the one who's being premature at best and disrespectful at worst.

7127~~~
It's the level of abuse he is getting. Pub player, fat elephant etc etc come on he's going to be our all time scorer. The level of respect is a joke imo. He's not pulling up trees atm agree but as much as I want him dropped there is a level of opinion that is just not palatable.

7128~~~
it's not really performances alone that are driving fans up through the wall. he's elevated to the status of being untouchable by the media and by van gaal without having justified the status to be there this season. whenever I've seen him this season I get frustrated to no end , mainly because of his poor decision making.

when other players have a string of bad games they deservedly get dropped so why not rooney.

7129~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He is overweight and his legs have definitely gone. The immature comments aren't because of what's happened to his form but the fact he's undroppable and doesn't even get substituted. It's not entirely right, but it really does make me dislike the guy. Really, in fairness, the blame lies with the manager.

Rooney in on goal. Roooneeeeeeeeeeeeeey 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.gifbin.com/bin/102010/1287507497_horse-plazying-with-big-ball.gif" src="http://www.gifbin.com/bin/102010/1287507497_horse-plazying-with-big-ball.gif"/> 

This isn't a fair comparison, I know; he's not as sleek as the horse.

7130~~~
Stuff the media. When they start picking the team, it's time to call it a day.

7131~~~
Is he? I mean he has a good chance but it's far from a certainty. He could easily come up short this season and get sold during the summer.

7132~~~
Imagine LVG binned him before getting the record. A nice fat bonus from Sir Bobby methinks

7133~~~
He's a 30 year old man, I'm sure he's been called worse.

7134~~~
watch how Martial sets himself up before the pass. Right, left, right, His touch is majestic

7135~~~
Clearly Martial's fault. Over hit the pass, poor old Wayne just doesn't get the service thesedays. And any service that is provided, that shithouse Herrera misses. What is Wayne supposed to do? The poor little lamb

If he had better teammates, Rooney would be the best player in the league.

7136~~~

7137~~~
I know you're taking the piss but that seriously seems like the narrative that some on the media are trying to take. the numbers might be dwindling as I've recently seen increasing number of articles slating rooney and for good reason.

7138~~~
Would be interesting to hear the media excuses if we dropped him and Martial scored two or three. Then the 'create no chances' argument would be even weaker.

7139~~~
WTF is wrong with Gullit? Is he afraid to lose his position as a pundit should he slag Rooney?

But for that to happen, someone out there needs to grow a pair and just drop Rooney without any remorse. Unfortunately, that someone looks to have a hell of a deep hole instead of a pair of cojones.

7140~~~
How do the other players feel about being dragged through the mud and blamed for their captain poor performances?

7141~~~
not just the media but Van Gaal too

7142~~~
Martial has already scored goals which is makes the whole situation even more bizaare.

LVG even game out after the sunderland game to say how impressed he was and how important martial is as he offers a focal point to attacking which nobody else does. 

then he shifts him wide left.

absolutely ridiculous

7143~~~
It's not just Gullit. It's fecking everywhere, like a disease. Amount of bollocks spouted by so called 'experts' and 'pundits' is just astonishing. They're doing their utmost to shift the blame away from Rooney on just anybody, players, system, LVG himself while Rooney's the saint one.

NBC commentators pretty much summed it up on Saturday for me. There was some shit cross from Herrera that wouldn't reach anybody, Rooney was in the midfield, Martial was still on the wing and they're blaming Martial for not cutting in to get that cross absolutely omitting 'where the feck is the #9' part. Seconds later, Martial creates that pass for Rooney, he doesn't get to it, 'unlucky', 'keeper's done well', it's just like watching a different match at times.

7144~~~
At the Palace match, I sat and concentrated on where Rooney was. I found him at half line or behind the ball too many times.

7145~~~
its quite astonishing.

It has been the case for years now but the last 12 months have just been pathetic.

7146~~~
His average position for the Palace game was behind Herrera (for the first half at least). So I'm not surprised !

7147~~~
Disgraceful

7148~~~
Still confused how he started and still managed to stay on the pitch for the full 90 mins... If he starts AGAIN in Moscow then ive seriously faith in the manager. The guy clearly needs to be dropped to the bench and only bring on in the late stages on the game or not at all. 3 goalless games now... Martial up front is a no brainer.

7149~~~
Even weaker? It's not weak to begin with. We create feck all. An issue that is distinct from Rooney's terrible form (although obviously doesn't help it).

7150~~~
I was watching Sunday Supplement yesterday because I have nothing better to do on a Sunday morning and one of the journalists (Jason Burt, I think) actually had the audacity to suggest that Rooney wasn't playing well. One of the others wasn't having it, of course, and chose to blame everything else but Rooney.

7151~~~
Tbf i didnt ecpect pundits to go all out and says something like 'bloody awful,  dropped, etc' 

They have to be pc,  they're being watched all over the world.  The best they can come up with is an euphimised 'not good'  or 'bad pass'  at best. 

Nobody is going to get on the record slagging a player,  bad for business.  Forget rooney, i dont think any pundits ever really slagged anyone iirc. 

Let's not forget pundits have to remain netral.  Or at least perceived as netral. Saying on the record how shit rooney is will definitely get them in trouble with the editor like it or hate it.

7152~~~
This is something that goes back beyond van Gaal's tenure I think, but you're right. It's a problem that's made worse when Martial plays out wide and so fewer chances fall to him. I watched Barcelona's game at Getafe this weekend and even though they didn't create a massive number of clear cut chances, the difference in play was simply night and day. Plus they were able to put away two of their chances and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners, restricting the home team to pretty much one decent effort all evening.

7153~~~
it was the same the previous week when the female reporter was on. She was the only one saying he isn't playing well and could be dropped for club and country. The 3 other guys scoffed it off saying nah its Wayne Rooney, service, tactics, position letting him down

7154~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://m0.sportsjoe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/30202354/rooney-miss.gif" src="http://m0.sportsjoe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/30202354/rooney-miss.gif"/>

It's not poor Wayne's fault its the service. There were about 3 chances away to Swansea as well that he should have done better with.

7155~~~
Wayne Rooney missing simple chances has feck all to do with whether or not we've been creating enough of them. He could have scored every single one of the chances you mention and still be a tier below the league's top-scorers. And no striker scores every single chance they get.

7156~~~
It's both, Rooney is finished but we don't make enough chances either.

Martial would be better upfront but when you look at his 3 goals, the Liverpool one he made himself, and one if not both goals at Southampton were because of defensive errors.

I thought Van Persie was awful last season and didn't work hard enough,  but I don't remember him missing a bucket load of chances either.

7157~~~
Yeah poor wording on my part. It is not a weak argument, but I think that we would create enough for Martial to be able to score regularly.

7158~~~
Maybe if he wasn't so slow and static we'd create more chances. Martial managed to score a few when being played through the middle.

7159~~~
Yeah this is basically my point.

7160~~~
Only because he didn't miss a single chance. He's scored feck all since those first cluster of goals, though. Because, surprise surprise, he's had feck all chances to score.

Wayne Rooney isn't the only player we should be creating for. There are other players in the team who should be creating and scoring goals too. Blaming our number 9 for this not happening is missing the point.

7161~~~
And has been out on the left wing.

7162~~~
Martial has been played on the wing and in that time has still created chances for others, the two at the weekend, the ball to Lingard against City etc. And when played as a striker he got some goals.

Roooney doesn't get chances when played as a striker and barely creates anything for anyone else when he was a 10 or out wide. If we don't create any chances then Rooney has to take some responsibility for that, his job isn't to stand there and wait for chances to drop at his feet. He should create chances for himself and others, he's the best paid player in the entire league.

7163~~~
You say that as though players in the same position at our rival clubs haven't been scoring goals either.

7164~~~
FFS.

<i>Rooney</i> - given his status, earnings & reputation - <i>is supposed to be a difference-maker</i>. These days when he's upfront for United or England, whether the opposition is Scunthorpe or Spain, you KNOW that he's not going to make the difference and you know that it'll be a boring watch. Practically none of this is to do with van Gaal or Hodgson or Moyes or Capello or whoever; it's not teenagers in their first PL season who are the problem; it's Rooney and his inability to be a game-changer. The most famous name in British football, the 5th-highest-paid player in the world, yet he can't even be relied upon to shine against the likes of Middlesborough or Crystal Palace; absolutely damning.

7165~~~
You're only making points that have been made a million time before. Rooney's been shit. Well, you don't say. Posting a gif of him missing a couple of chances as evidence that he's been getting enough chances is completely glossing over the real issue here. We're not making enough chances for Rooney, or anyone else.

7166~~~
Again, with the repetition.

It's almost as though people are arguing against cases that haven't been made. Can you find a single post from this thread at any point in the last few weeks, that has <i>anything</i> positive to say about Rooney's performances? This place never agrees on anything but I reckon we've got as close to 100% consensus as we'll ever get that Rooney has been playing nowhere near well enough and does not deserve to start. So why people feel the need to keep pointing this out?

7167~~~
And he doesn't create chances for himself or anyone else. Entire games go by where nothing of note happens involving Rooney and it's not even unusual or surprising now. If our attack isn't creating chances then Rooney is part of the reason why, he's the only attacker playing every minute of every game. He isn't paid what he is to stand on the penalty spot and wait for chances to drop at his feet.

7168~~~
Only part, though. If the best we can hope for is part-solving a problem, then we're doomed regardless.

7169~~~
We don't create many chances both because of the system and Rooney's ineptness as a No 9 and a No 10.

Chances do not involve only a creative play from team-mates but also your movement, your awareness, your touch, your explosiviness, your close control, etc. I'm sure if we play Ronaldo up front, the team will create much more chances. Rooney's inability to keep the ball up in tight situations massively contributes to our average creativity (Memphis is another culprit here, he's been a bit brainless).

Rooney used to assist a lot of goals in previous seasons. What has happened to his creativity? How many assists has he made this year? He's virtually non-existing as a creative force this season. Most strikers in the league not only outscore him but create more chances as well.

I'm afraid that if we don't find a solution to Rooney's poor form, we'll fnish below Liverpool. May sound crazy, but it will happen, IMO.

7170~~~
Got a 7 rating in The Sun newspaper <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7171~~~
Watch Aguero's performance v QPR last season to see what a #9 can do when you're not creating chances.

Maybe it's our fault for expecting too much from a has been,...in which case, he should be benched and Martial should be playing there, who does have a bit of magic.

7172~~~
Rooney's never created very many goals as a 9. His asssists have come in seasons when he's played deeper. Whenever he's played up top we've been reliant on other players to create. Which isn't happening this season and will only get worse when other managers follow Pardew's example in creating a game plan to specifically neutralise Martial.

7173~~~
I agree that he doesn't assist many goals when playing as a main striker but he played several games in a deeper role (before Everton) and he was the same in terms of creativity.

7174~~~
I know and it all comes back to him playing really badly. I'm just making the point that him playing badly, as a number 9, is not the most important factor in us creating the second fewest number of chances in the league.

7175~~~
Chances created per 90 minutes played

Mata - 2   Fellaini - 1.37  Herrera - 1.31   Rooney - 1.0

7176~~~
Martial played a wonderful pass to him at the weekend, which should have been taken. Fair enough, we don't create enough chances, but when that chance did come vs Palace, Rooney screwed it up.

7177~~~
Our only chance. In 90 minutes. Against Crystal Palace. That's horrendous and has very little to do with Rooney.

If anything, that chance proved that he is at least still capable of finding a bit of space and making a well-timed run. Which is not to forgive the miss but does go against this idea that his lack of movement is a key factor in our toothlessness.

7178~~~
the thing is with the Wolfsburg one................not only does martial offer goals.......he offers assists like that...running the channels and beating man.  something else rooney can not do

7179~~~
Ya, I saw that as well, it actually made me angry, literally angry standing there watching the program when that chimp Burt dismissed the notion of Rooney being anything but great. Thank god the guy next to him actually piped up and confronted him on it.

7180~~~
Rather it was our only chance in 90 minutes or not, it's a chance that Giroud, Martial(if on the other foot), Aguero, Bony, Kane ect will all take 99% of the time. We're struggling to create chances, so what we do create obviously must be taken. There's without a doubt more problems with the team than just Rooney though, I agree.

7181~~~
Exasperation? It's an utterly farcical and surreal situation that United, England & the fans find themselves in, truly "the emperor's new clothes" stuff.

7182~~~
I agree that Rooney is not the only reason we don't create enough chances; I think Van Gaal's defensive style of possession football is conditioning the players to play without urgency and intent, but Rooney being so deep constantly, when he's deployed as a 9, and not being able to present himself in the final third without either losing control of the ball or failing to run off the shoulder for Martial, Schweinsteiger, Herrera and Mata to use him as real focal point is a massive problem that congests all our play.

The other problem we have is that we don't have any width on the right. Darmian isn't cutting it for me. Valencia should be starting to complement Mata.

7183~~~
He recently wrote an article that England could be better off without Rooney starting.

7184~~~
Probably the same reason why you keep bleating on about how bad our football is.

7185~~~
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つTake my energy, Jason Burt ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

7186~~~
That's just flat out untrue. There's not a striker in the league with 99% chance conversion. Even good chances like that one. I remember in that game where Aguero scored 4 goals (or was it 5?) he missed a handful of equally presentable chances, before the goals started raining in.

All of the criticism of Rooney for his poor touch, passing and all-round play is completely fair. Hanging him out to try for missing chances is really missing the point though.

It's so rare for him to get a decent chance these days that it's almost inevitable he'll faff it up. Even the most lethal striker needs regular chances to get into any rhythm in front of goal. Harry Kane being a good example, missing chance after chance before finally starting to score regularly.

Rooney's proven himself capable of scoring in the very rare game when we're creating a reasonable amount of chances (e.g. CL qualifiers and Ispwich game) but when he's reduced to one presentable chance every 90 minutes then there's clearly a serious issue in what's going on behind him. The rest of his game might be stinking the place out but there's every chance his finishing ability will be the last to go. It's absolutely deluded to expect any striker to convert every chance he gets (or even 99% of them)

7187~~~
Because people are offering a different opinion? Erm.. Nope. Wrong answer.

7188~~~
So are people supposed to only post in this thread when something changes, ie when he plays well?

Also, I don't think many people are actually claiming that we are playing good football? They're just not being half as hysterical about it as you are.

7189~~~
There's a bunch of people coming up with reasons for us being shite to watch that exonerate Van Gaal's role in what is being served up. With others thinking the buck stops with the manager. Hence there's a lot of debate about why we're not scoring and whether it will turn around or not.

Similar discussion with Rooney. There's plenty of room for discussion about why he's playing badly and whether he will turn things round. Repeatedly pointing that he's not been playing well enough is the definition of stating the bleeding obvious.

You've a strange definition of hysterical fwiw but meh, to each his own.

7190~~~
He's absolutely right.

7191~~~
Fair enough, 99% is overblown, but that chance was put on a plate for him. Any striker worth his salt would have made a lot better of that. He didn't even test the keeper ffs. As for his run, it means nothing if you can barely catch up with the ball.

7192~~~
For every big chance in which Rooney has taken a shot this season, there's been another chance where he has somehow contrived to fail to shoot, starting with the winning goal against Spurs, and continuing more recently with big opportunities against Everton when Martial put him through (he may have got a slight touch on this one), and at Palace when Martial put him through. There was another big chance a few months back when he took so long to shoot that a defender got back to tackle him but I can't recall which game it was off the top of my head.

Then there's the dangerous crosses that he hasn't been close enough to get a touch to. Januzaj put in a super cross in the first few mins of the home CL qualifier but Rooney was asleep.

It all adds up.

When I first started going to Old Trafford, Frank Stapleton was our main striker. He was astonishingly good at headers but so slow that he rarely got chances to score with his feet. Each season, having played 42 league games, he would finish with around 13 goals. It is much easier to create chances for fast players or those who make super runs in the box than slow forwards.

7193~~~
I think everyone would agree our chances created is very low; however the centre forward is not just key to converting chances, but also in building up our play and being in the right areas to convert chances. I think this is the biggest area in which Rooney is negatively effecting us at the moment. If we completely ignore his poor shooting, how many times per game does the following occur:
<ul>
<li>A move breaks down due to a poor Rooney first touch;</li>
<li>A move breaks down due to a poor Rooney pass;</li>
<li>Rooney is static and man marked, resulting in no forward option, so we pass the ball backwards;</li>
<li>A ball is played into Rooney's path but his tortoise speed of pace and acceleration results in a simple interception; or</li>
<li>Rooney is far too deep meaning there is no options in the box (average position vs Palace in line with Herrera)</li>
</ul>I'd say an aggregate of up to 15-20 times per game one of the above is clearly present. I think with the likes of Suarez up front at least a third to a half of these situations result in a chance (maybe 5-10 chances), with maybe a couple each game being a key chance. Naturally that's comparing one of the best CL forwards with one of the worst, but that's the level we should be aspiring to.

Rooney isn't the only problem - but how many teams would create an abundance of chances with 10 men? This is before even discussing the "wonder goal" category where a 30 yard effort or great piece of skill creates a goal out of nothing - the likes of Coutinho have scored 3-4 of these already this season and a United centre forward should be up there also.

7194~~~
My point in a nut-shell. You mention a half-chance he missed against Everton, then the next one you can think of was "a few months back". 

Rooney's played almost every minute of every game up front. He should have missed nearly a dozen decent chances by now (and scored the same amount)

7195~~~
In the first half yesterday, his average position was deeper than Herrera. Granted we don't create a lot of chances, but imo the way a striker plays is a fundamental part of creating chances. How can a team create many chances, if the person who should be leading the line and drawing CBs out of position by stretching them, is deepe than his No 10?

7196~~~
Fair enough that we don't create chances, and a lot of the blame has to go in van Gaal's direction for playing turgid possession football with no aim to penetrate, but even if Rooney isn't getting the ball in threatening positions, he needs to take most of the blame for that himself. A good striker is crucial to creating chances by offering the following:

1) The burst of pace to get behind the defence and receive the ball with space ahead of him.
2) The ability to receive the ball and create passing combinations or turn his man and run at the goal using one or two touches
3) The patience and discipline to stay forward and harry defences, constantly looking for the crucial opening
4) The pace and skill to beat a man in tight spaces and get the shot away
5) The eye for a killer pass to create for his team mates

Those five things are completely torn out of Rooney's current playbook. He does the opposite of this most of the time and it's no wonder we're not creating chances. Even if we had the most creative team in history behind him, he wouldn't be producing the goods because his first touch and pace is completely gone, and he can't play others through either. As for our wingers, I'm sure if you switched Benzema out with some average pub team player, Ronaldo's numbers would fall off a cliff as well. A striker, by virtue of his position on the pitch, is bound to be involved in most of a team's attacking moves, and if that player messes up the simplest things like trapping a football or playing a quick, simple pass on the counter, it's very difficult for the whole team to finish attacks.

The lack of a threat he poses also makes it extremely easy to take him out of the game, giving the opposition more opportunities to safely shift some of their focus onto our other players and neutralize them too. When a true top-level striker like Agüero or Lewandowski is on his game, you need to put two players on him if you want a snowball's chance in hell of keeping him quiet, giving other players a more space to inflict the damage. Pardew admitted that Martial was the man they wanted to mark out of the game and Rooney still did sweet feck all. When he's playing like he is now, you might as well not mark him, because just allowing him time on the ball is an equally effective way of ruining our attacks as marking him out of the game is.

The biggest mystery is that we have this anti-striker sucking like a black hole every week while a player that can actually do all the five things listed above is being played out of position, away from the position where he's most likely to win us games. It's a lose-lose situation for everyone at the club except Wayne Rooney himself.

7197~~~
That's one of the ways a striker can draw CBs out of position. By coming deep. The theory being that other players pour forwards to exploit the space he's vacated. 

Which is not to say that a quicker, more dynamic striker wouldn't have kept Palace's back four a bit more honest but the lack of <i>anyone</i> getting forwards when Rooney came deep is indicative of our malaise under Van Gaal.

7198~~~
With his movement it's not easy to get any chances to be fair. Service should be better but Martial has somehow managed to have more chances in his very short time here than Rooney has had for the last year. Concidence?

7199~~~
Huh?

7200~~~
He has scored 5 goals and has missed 4-5 good chances at least (some due to brilliant saves like Cech v Arsenal, it wasn't a good chance at all yet he did brilliantly to make a turn and take a shot). Rooney has barely been in a position where he could take a shot 10 times all season.

Strikers need to be mobile, capable of collecting the all and running with it or making runs to pick up passes. Rooney has done none of these things. He takes three touches to control the ball, it's not acceptable at this level.

7201~~~
Yep. And it's worth pointing stuff like this out to those who still think that Rooney is undroppable for club and country and that the media don't see the problem.

A year ago there was virtually nobody in the media questioning Rooney as a starter for club or country. The calls for him to be, ahem, "rested" are getting louder by the game.

7202~~~
The problem is that his one of a few that are willing to. But if his performances don't improve and especially if that is at the Euros, they will be no way back for him. The media love a tournament scapegoat. Rooney's performances actually do warrant criticism at this point though.

7203~~~
I reckon LVG's having one of those "old dog / vet" moments with Rooney...

dog is 14 years old, his legs are gone, he wees on the carpet, poops in his bed and his breath smell of fish and he can't walk further than a few 100 yards - yet he still wags his tail every morning you see him...so you're not quite ready to take him to the vet even though that's exactly what the poor old dog is wanting as he just has no life in him anymore

7204~~~
The real question is: Why is Rooney undroppable?

Fine, it's because he's captain, but that only begs the question.  If a player is consistently out of form or lost his class altogether and if we have the players to step in for that player, for the good of everyone involved that player should be benched until he proves he's ready for inclusion in the starting XI again.  Gerrard wasn't undroppable and many other legends-in-decline are not undroppable.

All joking aside, what explains Van Gaal's insistence on playing Rooney -- for a full 90+! -- regardless of how poor his form (lost class?) has been?

7205~~~
Not only that but the majority of the time he is stuck several metres behind play so much so that when we get the ball in and around the box there is no one making runs in the box or no target for the widemen to aim for. How do you create goalscoring chances when your no.9 is always stuck behind play? His positional indiscipline is killing us as much as Van Gaal's philosophy is, imo. Yes we don't create anywhere near enough but isn't it worth a try to see how we'd do if our striker didn't lose as many one on one duels as Rooney does, if our attacking moves didn't break down on account of his poor first touch or if he actually made himself available for the ball.
Rooney has been so poor that there credibility in the argument that it is he that is holding the rest of the team back not the narrative his apologists are keen of selling ever since Scholes came up with the idea to blame the rest of the team.

7206~~~
The biggest indication that Rooney's finished is the fact his legs are simply giving out on him when he makes any kind of run through on goal. Those chances against Everton and Palace are both perfect examples of a man who doesn't have the legs any more; he's falling over before he gets in position to shoot. A couple of years ago when I was out of shape and about a stone and a half overweight, I tried to play a game of five-a-side, and there's a moment that still makes me laugh where I tried to turn and run in behind after a through ball and I simply ended up falling over because my legs had gone. It was that that made me realise how out of shape I'd allowed my self to get and pushed me into working out to take better care of myself, but I will never forget that feeling. It was so obvious. I reckon Wayne knows his legs have gone. He's never been the fittest player, not like Ryan Giggs, and he's really living on his reputation at the moment. The fact you had to mention that all his goals came against Brugge, basically, says it all.

He really is shot at the highest level, and no amount of apologies for his current state will help him get back to where he was; he'll never be what he was.

7207~~~
The fact he can no longer Spring the offside trap and get himself into goal scoring positions is a very big reason as to why he hasn't had many opportunities.

7208~~~
I'm coming round to the idea that his legs have gone for good. The chance against Palace wasn't a gimme but the manner in which he missed it was ominous. Just looked so heavy-legged. 

The reason I'm still bickering away is that even the current version of Rooney could and should score more goals with better service. The caf has a habit of seizing on individual players as the problem behind/solution to all our woes. It wasn't long ago that an idea took hold where we just needed to start Hererra to get us back playing the fast-paced incisive football we all crave.

7209~~~
Funny you should say that when his most recent chance involved all of the above.

7210~~~
I agree with you, but Rooney is part of the team, and I believe you can only solve problems one step at a time. The first step is getting Rooney out of the team. The next step is Van Gaal either changing his slow, defensively-minded possession game for a high press similar to that which bayern and barca implement or the manager getting the sack.

7211~~~
I think van Gaal genuinely believes he's been playing very well. He's already said that Rooney is one of the best 5 players he has coached. He's happy with his performances and absolutely in love with him.

7212~~~
That's true but we need a game-changer in this position, not a striker who could match the output of, say, Giroud (who is currently better than Rooney, no doubt)

7213~~~
i fail to see how this could be the case with a manager obsessed with keeping possession, with a player who is prime suspect of losing the ball. Any other player would have been banished from the lineup ages ago

7214~~~
You'd think so. Although, if retaining possession really is all he cares about I guess we should all be a bit nervous about Martial's 45% pass completion at the weekend <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

7215~~~
If that's true, oh my!

Have you ever heard the phrase "He has the wolf by the ears."?  It means something like it's dangerous to keep holding the wolf but it's even more dangerous to let the wolf go.

Rooney is our wolf, too dangerous to let go of but a danger when kept in hand.  Somewhere along the way over the last 10 years he became this iconic face and name associated with Manchester United.  Maybe it was the overhead kick v City.  Who knows?  But Moyes felt Rooney was indispensable and gave him (Woody should be blamed too, btw) that ridiculous contract extension.  Louis has branded him undroppable.  Adidas now are desperate to spend millions to have Rooney endorse their products.  Maybe someone upstairs has ordered that Rooney play every game.  Whatever it is, Louis can't possibly be happy with Rooney's football performances.  But maybe he is in love with him.

It cannot be that Louis sees the same shit football from Rooney and sees greatness from him.  I'll grant him that Rooney is, even now, capable of pulling a rabbit out of a hat, but his play over a 90 minute spell is dreadful, week after week.

7216~~~
A single example is not proof of a trend.

7217~~~
Ok, the goals against Ipswich and Everton? He's scored few enough goals this season but the majority have been by well-time runs, beating an offside trap. Even his most obvious missed chances came about the same way (in Swansea game) Seems like a strange thing to focus on, with so many other obvious flaws in his game.

7218~~~
and that.

7219~~~
Must be the only dog that, when you throw a stick for him, he gives it to a cat.

7220~~~
Is the GMP twitter feed run by a City fan?

7221~~~
Probably a disillusioned red.

Sky couldn't of picked a better photo for their article on LvG backing Rooney.

7223~~~
Pogue, look at how often Rooney breaks up our attacks by his atrocious touch, passing, speed and dribble and then wonder why we cant create for him. Normally when you send a striker away on a through ball for instance, you have a big chancw that he'll go 1 vs 1 and score. Bar vs Everton, I cant remember the last time he just scores these. Its not because they players dont create solely, bit mainly because he's slow, lost strength and technique and that makes him so easy to defend. He doesnt stand a chance against basically every average defender at the moment.

7224~~~
If we have people in this thread still sticking up for Rooney despite the evidence in front of their eyes, then it's no wonder Rooney and other English players get away with murder.

7225~~~
It's terrible! Makes him look so fat

7226~~~
Just as well we don't, then.  

What do you mean by Rooney "and other English players" getting away with murder?

7227~~~
I mean they are too coddled. By the media and the fans. It's pretty obvious that's one of the big failings we've got in this country as regards the way football players are treated. Maybe a little more accountability and less 'idolising' might bring them back down to earth a bit. My personal opinion anyway.

7228~~~
Surely that's Anderson in disguise

7229~~~
I don't really have much to compare it with because I don't read much foreign media but do you really think English players get less media scrutiny and criticism, on and off the pitch, than players in other countries?

7230~~~
He looks like he's in his 40's there.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7231~~~
His body's gone. You can tell he doesn't do much in the gym, which is shocking for a professional footballer of today, let alone one playing for Man United.

7232~~~

♫ He's got van Gaal's balls in his hand ♫

7233~~~
They are scrutinised, but they are also more protected than their foreign counterparts in the league. Do you think for e.g. that if a foreign player in our league was putting in Rooney's performances, that the media and pundits would be looking to blame everyone else but him? Absolutely not. This is one thing that encourages these players to think they are better than what they are, and that they never need to be on guard and make sure that they constantly improve their game.

7234~~~
Jesus Christ how out of shape is he? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

He's slowly morphing into the 'homeless' Rooney from that world cup advert...

7235~~~
Come on guys it is obviously the wind that is making his shirt look like that.

7236~~~
He looks like John Hartson. With a shit hair transplant.

I do give up. Reading some of his defenders in this thread is bizarre reading to say the least. It wouldn't be given for another player if they weren't called Wayne Rooney.

<i>"Even this current version of Rooney should be scoring more goals" 
</i>
Aye okay! Suppose the fact he's easily one of the worst footballers in the league currently has nowt to do with his lack of goals or the fact he barely looks like a threat against defenders.

Unfortunately there's no way of proving this nonsense wrong until Van Gaal gets his balls back and drops the git.

And Wilson being given 45 minutes is not the same thing. Try 5 games without Rooney and I'm convinced it would be a different story.

7237~~~
Was wracking my brain trying to think when he got an assist this season then remembered it was that own-goal against Spurs wasn't it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

He didn't know much about one of his two league goals either, the Sunderland one, he's actually had a bit of luck this season, his stats could be worse.

7238~~~
Badly let down again by his tailor

7239~~~
Well, I mentioned Gullit in particular because 1) he's not British, and 2) so it should not matter that much for him if he calls out the face of English football for playing like crap unless Gullit is really afraid to lose his job.

Regardless, the media world must be one hell of a mess when they don't criticize someone who deserves to have flak coming his way. Even David Moyes was gunned down in several media by the time people realized how extremely bad he was at United. For the record, I think Trevor Francis said 2 days ago that John Terry has lost his legs. I only wish people could start giving the same reality check on Rooney as they did on Terry and on Gerrard.

That's the big question. In Van Gaal's case, the question is more legitimate because he has been in that situation before with Mark van Bommel. As for other examples, Rodgers ditched Steven Gerrard when it became self-explanatory about why Stevie Me's presence on the pitch was detrimental for the team. This season, it's John Terry's turn as well. Mourinho might lose his job because he was awfully wrong in a number of things, but benching Terry wasn't a wrong call.

Van Gaal is risking his job if that Rooney thing carries on and becomes even more detrimental to the team's performances than it already is.

7240~~~
It would be interesting to see a full opposition scouting report on him from this season.

7241~~~
All two sentences?

7242~~~
He's a problem that would be fairly easy to fix if he could pick up any semblance of form. Even scrappy performances would do if he could start grabbing some goals. Our defensive prowess right now could probably carry us through these fixtures if he was able to put in average performances.

7243~~~
Even people from Canada working in the broadcasting of Premier League matches know how to write a good piece and show more common sense than almost any of their British colleagues in this case.

The future is now, ladies and gents. Remember it.

7244~~~
It's a good article, but only 2 United managers are unwilling to drop him. Fergie dropped him a few times in his career.

7245~~~
Pardew gave one indirectly when he spoke about just stopping Martial. Rooney who?

7246~~~
The only thing that will make van Gaal drop Rooney is a series of shite results. I'd say we're halfway there.

7247~~~
I'm keeping this for upcoming match threads.

7248~~~
Yeah, what is it with the English media ignoring his poor form? Always giving English players a free pass.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://dailym.ai/1N8zIAU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dailym.ai/1N8zIAU</a>

7249~~~
In my fantasy league with The Sun it has become a running joke between my friends because I have Rooney in my team and no matter what he always gets above a 7 rating so in turn has gotten me a shed load of points. When in reality you look at the average rating he gets by our fans on here and it's around 4 <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

7250~~~
Yeah, found it interesting too. Just goes to show how good he already is.

7251~~~
MUTV showing clips of his debut vs Fener. Man, what a player he was. He should just retire before most United fans grow to resent him for being a has-been weight on our backs.

7252~~~
Read in the latest issue of UWS that he <span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>WAS</b></span> going to be dropped against Everton but, LvG went against the idea as he thinks he's a great captain, who gives the team something extra just by his presence in the line up.....

7253~~~
He may have been right in that particular game, as it happens. Even a stopped clock...

7254~~~
True. He did score to be fair to him and should have had an assist too. The whole scenario puzzles me. Easily done I know but, it's just strange

7255~~~
Weird...did the conversation go like this?:

LVG: "I'm going to drop Rooney."
LVG: "Don't do that - he's a great captain."
LVG: "Ok Louis, I won't."
LVG: "'Bye, Louis."
LVG: "'Bye, me."

7256~~~
"Both me....That's not me in bed with another bloke called Louis"

7257~~~
At 18 years old, Rooney was a terrifc player.
I'd describe him as a warrior. I'd definitely want him next to me when going into battle.
He basically matured very early and as such, he will also finish his career early.
I would liken him more to a 37 year old.

7258~~~
I don't think this debate will be over until Rooney is dropped for a run of games and people see how much our attacking play improves.

How can you create a host of chances if your only striker position is nowhere near the opposition goal? Or takes a bad touch anytime he gets on the ball?

7259~~~
how do they know stuff like this though, the staff are leaks now? if so it would be common knowledge throughout the squad if the captain was about to be dropped

7260~~~
I don't know but, they've been pretty much spot on with a lot of stuff the last few years now.

Also, as someone else pointed out on here, there were a lot of missing players at Rooney's birthday party. Obviously it's easy to read what you want into a situation though

7261~~~
Anyone else dreaming that he's rested tonight, Martial leads an exciting and dynamic line that scores 4 in the first hour before Rooney is given a run out on the 70th minute and it all turns to turgid shite.... and the penny finally drops.

7262~~~

7263~~~
Alan McInally just said we definitely still need to start Rooney as he's our best player.

Pundits don't think before they speak do they?

7264~~~
It's bizarre how they build these England players up as kids, knock them down as soon as they do something wrong or don't perform as they should and then when they hit a certain age they become untouchable and enjoy a huge amount of media protection. 


It's backwards. They should be protecting the young players while the senior players should be accountable for their performances.

7265~~~
At this rate we'll soon see Rooney in goal so DDG better watch out.

7266~~~
Herrera dropped again

7267~~~
When he is dropped and he will be dropped, no one will have the opportunity to say that LVG didn't gave him a fair chance.

7268~~~
The Teflon Don.

7269~~~
At what cost though? If we dont do well tonight, with WBA at home next(Who'be won 2 on the bounce at OT), our season could unravel.

7270~~~
Herrera dropped ahead of Rooney. SHOCKING. Its beyond a joke now, it really is. 

feck off LVG.

7271~~~
I keep laughing about it. I've got my white handkerchief ready tonight.

7272~~~
He'll score tonight

7273~~~
His missus doesn't count

7274~~~
Souness tearing into him...."He doesn't even sprint anymore. Doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the team"

7275~~~
....and all will be forgotten. 

That'll show everyone. Cue media gushing.

7276~~~
Is van Gaal going to burn him out anyway?

7277~~~
The only way that he vindicates this start is if he genuinely has a very good all around performance. Don't even care about goals from him. We just need to see if he can actually play well and actually justify his untouchable status.

7278~~~
great start from Wayne...relatively speaking

7279~~~
He's been better today tbf

7280~~~
Not as bad as usual, which is something I guess.

7281~~~
Good first half against Moscow.

7282~~~
If only he could make a forward pass to Martial. 3 failed attempts including that woeful attempt at a return pass on the 1-2. Positive start and agree it's looking better than previous games - credit runners around him.

7283~~~
He had a couple of good moments in the first 15 minutes but has faded as the half went on.

7284~~~
Played well actually. If he played like this consistently then nobody would really complain about his inclusion.

7285~~~
Even a broken clock tells the correct time twice a day.

In all seriousness, he's looked more like his usual self. Some good link up play with Martial too.

7286~~~
He has been better, but just because he hasn't been dreadful doesn't instantly mean the 'Rooney is back' bandwagon needs to come round again. Definitely better, but still not the level I would want from out captain/talisman/#10/best paid player/legend/take your pick.

7287~~~
Hes lucky he was flagged offside when he was clean through. Loved to have seen the lads defend that.

7288~~~
He's been good, loved that little pass to put Lingard through. Shame Akinfeev was fast to react.

Pretty good linkup with Martial too...

7289~~~
1 pass from Rooney to Martial which was next to the half way line 40 yards from goal. 3 failed forward passes to Martial. Are you sure about that?

7290~~~
He played better than usual, but if that is now a "good performance" standards have fallen to rock bottom levels for him.

7291~~~
Best performance in a long time. Nothing special, but did the basics right and created a chance or two.

7292~~~
Did surprisingly well in the first half. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

7293~~~
"This"

7294~~~
He's not been poor, I'll give him that.

7295~~~
Four Four Two says not. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/5-2015/matches/832629/player-stats/13017/1_PASS_11#tabs-wrapper-anchor#:vFeE8giTjm-QBA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...1_PASS_11#tabs-wrapper-anchor#:vFeE8giTjm-QBA</a>

7296~~~
Does Rooney ever actually jump for headers?

7297~~~
Yes

7298~~~
I saw him passing to Lingard which was a very good chance. So feck 442.

7299~~~
But not spectacular either. If this is classed as a good performance then his standards have dropped big time

7300~~~
In that moment he just proved he has completely lost it.

7301~~~
If there was any doubt...

7302~~~
Balls.

7303~~~
The fat cnut is simply unacceptable. Never want to see him in a United shirt again

7304~~~
I'm f*cking sick of this shit.

7305~~~
Moyes got a hell of a lot wrong but giving Rooney a contract extension was by far the worst

7306~~~
I am desperate to see Scholes to defend him now

7307~~~
Exxon Valdez was quicker on the turn than him.

7308~~~
Ian Dowie: "It just gets stuck under his feet. Not much more he can do about that."

Inevitable

Get in!!!

7311~~~
It had to be didn't it. Football, bloody hell.

7312~~~
Good lad, I'm happy for him. Hopefully it'll get him going now.

7313~~~
Had to happen didn't it?

Beautifully-worked goal. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7315~~~
looking good!

7316~~~
Just bought himself next 10 poor performances with no fear of getting benched.

Good for him but sorry - still not that quality what I'd expect from club's top earner.

7317~~~
Rooooooooney <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

7318~~~
Well done Wayne.

7319~~~
In lVG's eyes, that goal has bought him guaranteed starts up until Xmas.

7320~~~
Nice one, hopefully that sorts his confidence out at least

7321~~~
Delighted for him.. His best performance in 2015 probably (even though it was merely just good)

7322~~~
Indeed. This is Rooney's Falcao vs Everton moment.

7323~~~
He bloody well of wanted to make up for that chance he screwed up with the ball at his feet.

7324~~~
It's a shame to feel that I can't enjoy his goal properly knowing its guaranteed him a starting spot till end of the season now.

7325~~~
Bittersweet, I'm happy we've scored but now this has guaranteed Rooney won't get dropped so long as LVG remains manager.

7326~~~
Won't hold my breath. Class goal though.

7327~~~
It did, indeed.

Also, you're a bit of a cnut yourself, aren't you? Sorry to single you out, as you're not alone in this, but it's true. He's a United legend, be respectful.

7328~~~
The fifth coming of Christ (in the past year) !

7329~~~
Most likely yes, but a lot of us were/are sick of his shite this season

7330~~~
He's back!

7331~~~
Best performance for a long long time but he's still be sloppy at times and is trying to do too much on his own now.

7332~~~
Yep,  one of his best performances in 18 months. Solid 6/10

7333~~~
Better.

7334~~~
I know mate, I am as well. There are proper way of expressing that though. Again, I don't want to make this about you, it's for whoever reads it.

7335~~~
Its not really saying much. I thought he was still very wasteful today. You cant argue with the decision to keep him on as it got us the goal but honestly i would love to see what we look like without him this season

7336~~~
You are welcome Redcafe

7337~~~
I'd agree with this. He's done okay and he took his goal well but that chance beforehand was a joke. Won't hold my breath that it'll make a difference come the weekend.

7338~~~
I have very little hope left but I really do hope he gets some confidence from that and kicks on.

7339~~~
This performance is the best we can hope for these days, which is really sad.

7340~~~
Good performance.

7341~~~
Good thing he scored. But still garbage for me.

7342~~~
Happy for him. You could see him from his celebration how much it meant to him. You know that this bad form has been eating him up inside.

Hope he carries on.

7343~~~
His best game of the season for me by far. Only lost the ball twice and held on to it. Even his crossfield balls were working. Scored a crucial goal. 

Fair play Wayne

7344~~~
His touch and performance were....better.

Still wasn't a threat and the surprise when he actually scored was the strangest feeling.

Hell, the surprise when the team actually scored was the strangest feeling, barely reacted because I didn't believe it.

7345~~~
Best player in the world.

7346~~~
Much better from him today.

7347~~~
still not convinced as he hasn't really kicked on from any of his goalscoring games but fair play, goal's a goal

7348~~~
Great... Means he will start the next 10 games. If that's now his best then we will struggle as he was poor apart from the goal. Gave away the ball most times.

7349~~~
Average performance overall.

7350~~~
Seems many critics are trying to hold back in the praise. I'm possibly his biggest, but he was excellent tonight. Second only to Jesse as MOTM for me. Best performance for ages. I doubt he can keep that up, but if he does we have a real chance.

7351~~~
Won you a game which was a must win. Can't ask for <i>much </i>more than that.

7352~~~
Had a good first half

Went missing like the rest at the start of the 2nd missed a bad chance thankfully came back and scored a vital goal

I'm delighted for him.

7353~~~
It's not just the goal though is it?

Comfortably his best performance in a while. 

His passing stats will be healthy. He played Lingard in a couple of times. Had a few raking long passes. And scored. 

I've been calling for him to be dropped but no one can complain tonight. It won't silence the doubters obviously (hate that phrase), but he did his job very well.

7354~~~
No idea how to rate him on this one. For the first 15 minutes and 5 minutes for and after his goal he was a solid 8/10. His touches and passing were crisp, played a few awesome passes, one lovely flick for Lingard and general looked like a different player from what we've seen for a year or more.

The other 70 minutes were standard for this season - 5/10 at best. I'd probably go for 6.5 if that was an option, since his goal was divisive.

7355~~~
Started well then faded alot but he came up with the goods at the vital time.

7356~~~
Feck all the negativity that was a big win for us not just in terms of the group but to break the streak of nil nils. I'm very happy right now.

7357~~~
Did much better today.

7358~~~
Fully justified his inclusion ahead of Herrera tonight before he moved up top and played with a lot more confidence after that. That's our best team, for me. Toss up between Lingard and Memphis.

7359~~~
The goal was so vital for his confidence, specially after the previous opportunity. 
We sure can but it will have to do for now.

7360~~~
Havent celebrated a goal like that for ages. The fact that, prior to this game, we hadnt scored for three games and Rooney hasnt been firing made it a very special and important goal.

7361~~~
He seemed to look so much sharper for a few minutes after he scored, then he went back to being pretty crap. 

Still, good goal.

7362~~~
I thought he was good. Going by his recent standards especially. A solid 7 or 8 IMO.

7363~~~
It will never cease to amaze me how Rooney can go from garbage to great in the blink of an eye. Despite his dreadful attempt to convert Mata's square ball into a goal, Rooney was playing okay against CSKA. Then he scored and all off a sudden he's pulling off outside of the foot flicks to play in Lingard! The difference between Rooney when he's in the zone and when he's not is amazing. People used to talk about Nani as a confidence player, Rooney's even more so. He went from 5/6 out of 10 to 7/8 out of 10 instantly.

7364~~~
Shocking. Lucky he scored that goal or he'd have got a 1.

7365~~~
Getting the goal from a good run will give him breathing room from the fact it was another performance littered with sloppy passing and poor touch. It was better than the last few games but it's not saying much.

7366~~~
His best perfomance this season definitely.

7367~~~
Fair play to him. I really wanted him dropped for this game but he scored the vital goal so well done to him

7368~~~
we needed that, and he needed that.

seemed to turbo blast him for a while after, looked a real weight off mind job. The getting up well, flicking it on, and getting onto his own flick was my favourite bit.

7369~~~
Easily the best he's looked all season, still fluffed a couple relatively easy chances though and would likely be getting slaughtered again if Lingard didn't hand him a goal.

I'm glad he looked better but I'm afraid it will just serve to buy him more time when he inevitably plays shit again soon.

7370~~~
Better. Still not up to par, but better and won the match. Can't complain too much about that.

7371~~~
I only saw the second half, but this strikes me as being way over the top.

7372~~~
Not seen him celebrate a goal like that in a while

7373~~~
Let's not go over the top, it was a decent game and I'm happy for him that he scored after that horrendous miss beforehand. I do think that goal now secures his place in the starting XI for the foreseeable future so I hope he can turn his form around.

7374~~~
Because he scored a goal. He's being built up again, but he gave another performance exactly in keeping with the rest of his performances this season. he was helped by having martial up front with him, but he did absolutely nothing until he scored.

7375~~~
playing him in his right position makes a huge difference and so does having fast wingers. we cannot play mata and rooney in the same team if rooney plays as a 10. just doesnt work.

7376~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. That's because he hasn't scored in a while.

7377~~~
He was decent today, even without the goal.

Anybody noticed when he celebrated the goal he looked like he had no eyes? Creepy. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7378~~~
He was never a 1/10 without the goal, don't be absurd. In the first half he was clearly much sharper, his passing was improved and he rarely lost the ball. Yes, the miss was a shocker and it was a relatively easy header for him, but that first post you made is laughable.

7379~~~
I thought he was very good throughout, apart from some sloppiness in the last 5 minutes.

7380~~~
OK. We'll see. He looked better because we had 70% possession and were committing 5/6 players to every attack, but his overall contribution was again very small. He didn't create anything, and he's supposed to be the no.10, but I guess that's a great performance for some people.

7381~~~
Odd. He put Lingard through on goal in the first 15 minutes and linked midfield and attack very, very well. He was easily our best attacker.

7382~~~
As good as anyone on the pitch tonight but still a shadow of Rooney in the past. Indian summer.

7383~~~
This goal will only make LvG more stubborn about playing him.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 

<span style="color: #ffffff">Joke, I'm glad he scored!</span>

7384~~~
With some people no matter what he does he will get slated from now on, he's been receiving fair criticism over the last few months people should also be fair and give him some credit when it's due.

7385~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The Rooney propaganda machine rolls back into town with the efficiency of a float without a battery.

7386~~~
I have the same view.  The set up and attacking intent of the side made a hell of a difference.

7387~~~
Has anyone said it was a 'great' performance? Not that I've read. Almost every post apart from yours in here since full time rates him as 'average', 'better' or 'good' and his rating so far is 6.5.

7388~~~
As I said, because he scored a goal. Imagine what the rating would be if it were somebody else nodding it in. He'd easily be below a 5. I gave him a 3, because at least he just lacked any kind of threat tonight, rather than giving the ball away every second touch.

7389~~~
Did well tonight.  Solid 7/10 performance which ultimately won us the game with a well taken goal.  

We are where we are, he is our captain and has us hostage to his enormous contract, so we have to make it work with him in the side.  I hope he can gain sufficient motivation and confidence from tonights performance to propel him to a sustained run of form.

7390~~~
He won't be dropped so let's hope this is his at least standard from now on.

7391~~~
Was pretty decent today but he's still arse-clench inducing in and around goal. Just can't get away with missing half of the unmissable chances you're provided with.

7392~~~
I don't cut Rooney any slack nowadays (and I still think we ought not to think long term with him and that he should be dropped when he's shit) - but I was so happy for him today. I'm fervently hoping he uses this in the right way and gets some fire in his belly. No more complacent stuff, just keep going.

7393~~~
He wasn't, especially not <i>easily</i>.

It was decent-good game from him, but that's about it. Nothing special in that performance.

He was still our least involved attacking player even though he was dropping deep quite often almost playing as third midfielder. He was invisible at times, again had the worst passing accuracy bar Martial(altough it wasn't that bad as in other games), and he was dispossesed more than others. Also almost costed us 3 points again today, he should thank Smalling and de Gea for keeping us in the game.

His understanding with Martial is worrying, but I won't blame him for that because Martial is even worse with his understanding of Rooneys movement.

7394~~~
If we accept he is erratic at least he hit some higher notes today than he has done for the majority of the season. Still had his moments of bizarre direness but they were somewhat less frequent and infinitely more ignorable when mixed amongst decent and dare I say good contributions.

I still only gave him 6/10 though.

7395~~~
Thought it was a good performance overall, arguably his best in a while. Some of the things he tried didn't come off, needs to be more decisive in-front of goal; but he functioned well as the midfield-attack link and seemed busy throughout. Hope Rooney can turn out games like this on a regular basis. He's going to start anyway, might as well get used to it, and hope he does well/ isn't an impediment to atleast see the season out.

PS: The attack in general seemed more fluid tonight, and Rooney was the pick of the bunch. Despite the lack of goals for the majority of the game, we looked way more threatening than recent weeks. But the players have to start converting chances, and as the most experienced attacking player, Wayne has to compose himself and lead the charge. 1 goal from 15 shots on target is a pedestrian conversion rate to be honest. Thought, atleast this time around there were double digit shots on targets. Signs of progress right there. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7396~~~
Decent game from him, looks promising. Still some terrible moments and a bad miss but much better than the past weeks.

7397~~~
Certainly one of his best performances this season (only other one up there is Brugge). For a brief few minutes after scoring he looked like he might have his mojo back.

7398~~~
You gave him a three. Good God. I'm in neither camp but sweet Jesus, to feel that level of contempt for one of your own must take away a bit of the enjoyment of watching your team, no? Or is enjoyment a silly concept to introduce here? Maybe Niall could introduce a facility whereby you could fill out your ratings in advance of matches seeing as what actually happens in them seems to be of little interest to you.

7399~~~
how many is he behind SBC for club?

7400~~~
his first 20 minutes when we dominated the game was his best this season but then he absolutely vanished from the game and was poor, only to score the important header. Overall he deserves praise, he wasn't the worst palyer on the pitch..

7401~~~
I've already given my reasons. Why do you want me to agree with everybody else that he was "average" because he scored a goal? He was our least threatening attacking player on the pitch, missed a sitter, and some of his touches to give the ball away were absolutely as bad as in previous games; he just wasn't quite as bad as in previous games because he had more players around him this game and wasn't playing as the lone striker. For a no.10 in a game where you have 70% possession and 5/6 men in every single attack, that is a pretty dire performance.

7402~~~
that's how I saw it too. Does not mean I was happy with our forward play. We need to be taking on players more.

7403~~~
Given what he's produced so far this season then I'm going to have to accept that as a good performance.

I mean, it isn't <i>really</i>, but all things considered I can't complain too much.

7404~~~
Absurd click bait (which I have fallen for).   Either you have an agenda, or you have no clue about judging a football players performance.

7405~~~
You're a hoot. I like you. I like you a lot.

7406~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

7407~~~
Good performance, against a very poor team. Would love if he could carry this in to the next game

7408~~~
13.

7409~~~
I think for much of the game, his control was tighter. Unlucky with the blocked effort but took the goal well. Such an important goal, hopefully we kick on as a team and create more chances.

7410~~~
I only saw the extended highlights on TV3 but I didn't see much different from what we've already seen from him. The goal was good and he did some good things after but the talk of him turning his season around which will surely follow this must be way ott.

7411~~~
When he plays well, I will say so. He is yet to play well this season, and there is nobody who can argue with me about Rooney's ineffectual performance (aside from the goal, as I have already said) because it's an honest, objective evaluation. people are only giving him a 6 out of 10 (some are giving him higher than that, amazingly) because we functioned better as a team today and Rooney wasn't isolated. You have to be honest, we had 70% possession, much of it in Moscow's half, and Rooney didn't create a single chance apart from a flick to Lingard (after his goal; as I said earlier, he did nothing before he scored) which Lingard turned into a chance with a great turn and shot.

He was playing as our 10. You all obviously look for something very different to me in a 10.

7412~~~
I don't know why everyone is jumping on the new guy for, that was not a good performance unless you lower the bar to a height that a toddler can climb over it. It was better in patches than we have seen from him this season but still littered with sloppiness and the goal doesn't paper over the cracks.

7413~~~
if he picked up form...

think if he exceeds that record, he will be gone to MLS next season.

7414~~~
More like we havent <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7415~~~
I agree.  He once again looked a weak link to me - seems to take so long to do anything these days, every other touch goes horribly wrong.

7416~~~
Oh pack it in. They parked the bus. Most of that possession was back and forth in front of banks of yellow jerseys. He came out and linked well, had a couple of key passes and scored the winner. To give him a 3 is petty, vindictive nonsense. What did you give Martial? Mata? Schweinsteiger? If you gave everyone a 3, fair enough. Nobody said Rooney was great but he was better and ultimately effective. Your determination to write off the winning goal as an annoying irrelevence is frankly slightly mental. I want him to get better and succeed, you want him to shrivel up and disappear, we'll just agree to disagree.

7417~~~
He played ok today. Arguably his best performance of the season. Some clever passing around the edge of the box and his long-range passing was bang on the money for a change. So fecking annoying when people are unable to judge an individual performance on its own merits.

7418~~~
Thought he was "better" today, but still not hopeful in the longer term. As he's undroppable I'd like to see him stay at 10 from now on with Martial in front.

7419~~~
He was alright up until the goal, that was a fantastic header. I just hope this will spur him on so we can see a return to the Rooney of old. I would still rather see him as a number 10 than a 9 though.

7420~~~
Anyone notice the guy he hugged in the crowd looked a lot like Andy Tate?

7421~~~
2 good, creative ideas to sort of put Lingard in, finished 1 one his 2 good chances and otherwise didn't do much good or bad. This is what I thought he'd play like this season, instead of the immobile horror show he's been. 7/10

7422~~~
It was a good game from him. Like I said, all of you who were claiming he's been "falcaoed" were just going over the top. I'm confident he'll get over this bad run of games that he's had. One of our better players today.

7423~~~
Also has anyone noticed he's on course to get 20 goals this season at his current goals/game ratio? Which admittedly is entirely carried by the Brugge hat trick so barely worth mentioning..

7424~~~
Acceptable, and if his best performance of the season is just acceptable he is still needing to be phased out. Having said that if he plays like that till the end of the season I'll be fairly happy. Not convinced it will last to the weekend though.

7425~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/l2mq" width="560"></iframe>

Loved the celebration.

7426~~~
Mata created two clear-cut chances, and most of the play was on the other side of the pitch. Watch the game. I gave Mata a 6/10. Basti is not a no.10, but he controlled the game and his choice of pass was generally positive. It's hard not to give a midfielder 6/7 out of 10 in a game where he dictates the tempo and you have 70% possession. Martial had his poorest game for us with some poor passing, but this was not helped by his poor synergy with Rooney. Even in this game he was holding the ball up very well, drawing two-three men to mark him every time he received the ball and was the one always looking to stretch the game, hence why he fell offside so often, so even in this game I gave him a 5/10.

The point is not so much what the players did wrong but what they offer to our play in their respective positions. Rooney offered no creativity as the team's creative focal point, the no.10. you can have a bad game where things don't work for you (Martial) but you can't be a passenger.

7427~~~
There was an attack just after the goal, where he threatened in behind. Lingard (I think) played him in but instead of taking the shot on from inside the box he attempted a return pass. I do wish he would be more selfish sometimes.

Delighted to see him back on the scoresheet.

7428~~~
People saying it's his best performance this season, but I personally think he was better against Everton. He may have lost the ball more against Everton, but he was involved more and always looked threatening. Wasn't as involved as I would have liked him to be tonight, but I'm so glad he got his goal.

7429~~~
Would have been just cruel if the only reward for a much improved performance was the tap-in he couldn't sort his feet out for.

7430~~~
Bullshit. Slipped Lingard through with a couple of very clever passes and generally passed the ball well. I swear some of you cnuts must not watch the game. Were you watching on a laggy stream or something?

7431~~~
Yep I've been a big critic of his but he was our second best player today. It was nice to see. Hopefully he can start to justify his inclusion in the team.

7432~~~
Get the feeling people are seeing what they want to see here. He had a good game. If it wasn't for Akinfeev's heroics he could have had a couple of assists as well. I get the bashing when he's his usual ineffective self but he was actually pretty damn good and won us the game so give the credit where it's due.

7433~~~
Generally passed the ball well? He was very sloppy with the ball, as usual. The ball to Lingard, after he scored, was decent. I have already said that. The ball earlier in the game didn't result in a goal-scoring opportunity because, though my recollection may be wrong (and I have no problem being proved wrong on this) I thought the pass was over hit. But even if it wasn't, why does that equate to generally passing the ball well and an overall "good" performance. If that's a good performance, we've slipped a very long way from the summit of world football.

7434~~~
He misplaced very few passes and only very rarely conceded possession at all. Apart from 2 or 3 times in the last few minutes, which must have distorted your memory of his passing overall. Short and long. It was a huge improvement on recent weeks (apart from, maybe, the Everton game)

7435~~~
He gave the ball away a number of times throughout the game, resulting in some of Moscow's only counterattacks (which Rooney has done in every single game I've seen of him this season. I've lost count of the number of times him losing the ball in a bad area has led to goal-scoring opportunities on the break for our opposition). I thought he was poor, goal aside, in the Everton game. That was another 4/10 performance. Our creativity in that game came from Herrera's runs into the box and the team generally being sharp in the first 20 minutes and Everton poor.

7436~~~
Well if no one else is going to say it well done Wayne Rooney on becoming our 2nd highest scorer of all time, and will overtake Ruud in European competition and eventually Sir Bobby as Uniteds all time leading goalscorer.

7437~~~
I'd say he was our worst player if we discount the goal. Even with it only Martial was as bad. The chance he missed was painful to watch.

7438~~~
I really don't think he's going to overtake Sir Bobby.

7439~~~
Sorry but you're talking out your arse. Your mind was clearly made up before a ball was kicked so there's no point discussing what actually happened.

7440~~~
I personally thought he was quite good today. He had good movement, some good first touches, picked his passes well, sprayed them around judiciously and brought people around him into play well generally. That goal was well taken, though his tangled-up feet should have finished the Mata chance, too. 

Good improvement over the infuriating dross he's served up this season so far.

7441~~~
This. Deserves it own thread, to be fair. Great achievement.

7442~~~
Unnecessary. 

I've said I will credit Rooney when he plays well. The problem is his level has been so low (not even Championship level) that people immediately think any game in which he isn't disastrous to our attacks and scores a goal (created by his team) that he's deserving of a solid score out of 10. Sorry, his level is still too low. He needs to improve. I hope he improves and proves he is still a world class player. 

My observations of his game tonight were that he switched the play relatively well at times, although he's too deep and too static much of the time as the 10. This is caused by the fact his legs aren't willing any more. There's an example towards the end of the game where he could have attacked the space down the wing but instead he turned back inside, choosing to come to a standstill. The Rooney of old would have attacked there, for sure. A couple of his touches in and around the box were decent, and he did well not to let his head drop after he missed a sitter, but these very fleeting moments of quality are still so far between when the general play is so sloppy. He absolutely did give the ball away leading to one of the only counterattacks CSKA Moscow had, and that was not the only time but is the one that stands out in my recollection of the game.

In my opinion, the level is too low for a Manchester United player. You were happy with him today. OK.

7443~~~
Wayne deserves a lot credit for scoring the match-winner.  

That said, while he was absolutely improved off his horrid recent performances he was nowhere near the level he should be at.  He's lost his explosiveness (no news flash here) and has no ability to beat a defender on the dribble or to be first to the ball.

On the play that resulted in the Rooney goal, watch the defender.  He completely switched off and Wayne was wide open for the easy header from 6 yards out.  Still, he knew where to be exactly at the right time from the fantastic volley cross by Lingard.

But there is no way any of us can be happy with his overall play today, even while conceding that he scored the match-winner.  He has work to do to get back to an acceptable level of play for an attacking player of a top four club.  Let's hope Louis can solve the mystery of how to help Rooney find that form.

7444~~~
He was very good today. Pulled the strings in the final third and was involved most of our good play. Some fantastic one-touch passes as well. Rumours of his demise were greatly exaggerated.

7445~~~
He only needs 12    more I think could be wrong but I believe he will.

7446~~~
14 more, it's going to be close. If he's shipped out next summer he won't do it IMO. But now that I really think about it I don't think there's any chance of him leaving the club.

7447~~~
12 more is it not?

7448~~~
Sir Bobby had 249 and Wayne has 237 so we're both wrong, it's 13 more.

7449~~~
He scored cos he got the taste of scoring from that open net one where the crowd sarcastically cheered <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7450~~~
Agreed, it's not hard for him to be a bit better than he's been but it was against a team that  put zero pressure on the ball, unlike PL teams. The fact is that as long as he remains a started for us we wont be serious contenders for the PL or CL.

7451~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s12.postimg.org/g9lsblztn/anigif.gif" src="http://s12.postimg.org/g9lsblztn/anigif.gif"/> 
I think he snatched at it with his left foot because the defender was about to make a tackle. Rooney definitely could have done better, but it wasn't an easy chance.

7452~~~
Yeah, there was like 2 right after each other. On one he played that really nice pass through to lingard which drew a good save, and the other he seemed set up for a shot similar to how he scored that winner vs Milan in the semi's back in 2007, but he just pulled it back to nobody. Today was very encouraging though as it showed if we play with a bit of pace and width, he can still show he is a good player. Just needs more confidence and to get more anger in his shots like he used to instead of always trying to play the killer pass or finesse it in.

Also maybe I'm being overly optimistic, but this was genuinely the first time where I've felt like it could be a turning point for Rooney to kick start a good run of form. Sure he scored a hat trick against Brugges, but everyone knew they were pretty shite and it was a really easy game. His goal vs Sunderland was just him bundling it in, and then he scored vs Ipswich in the capital one cup so barely mattered. Everton was pretty good but still just didn't have that feeling like he would kick on from there. This was his first all around performance where he looked like a good player at all. Good link up play, good vision to play good passes, looked dangerous, scored a goal. We'll see, but hopefully I'm not wrong and he kicks on because it'd be a huge boost to have him in even decent form.

7453~~~
He wasn't good Pogue. He still looks off the mark. A couple of his one-twos where completely mistimed. He was slow, wasn't very aware of his surroundings. He had a positive spell of about 5 minutes but rest of the game he was bad-to-average.

His long-range passing was very good. It was a better performance but that was also because he wasn't playing as the furthest man up the pitch. He can find form as a #10 but he's not good enough to be a striker anymore.

I thought he was less frustrating than Lingard overall but in hindsight Lingard was starting for his 2nd time or so and was probably instructed to take so many runs so he gets a pass. Rooney hasn't got any goodwill left this season. In order for him to get people off his back he has to do more than be slightly better than what he's usually shown this season. The goal should help with that.

7454~~~
I thought he started the game really well, was probably our best player for the opening half hour and then faded.

Like everyone else I thought he was sloppy in the 2nd half and although the chance he missed may not have been quite as easy as it first looked, it was still a poor effort and a good example of how he just seems to have lost a step. He was caught flat footed.

Still, he took his goal well and I think performances like tonight are probably as good as we're going to get from him. I'd give him 6.5/10, his best non brugge performance of the season.

7455~~~
No surprise Martial has an average game with world class wayne at the 10 position. RVP suffered in the past because of it and he will going forward.

7456~~~
Well-taken goal today, and an overall slightly better performance from him. 

Hopefully he can carry it on into the weekend against West Brom.

7457~~~
Remind me who played the most games at number 10 in the one great season RVP actually had for us.

Remind me who assisted the most goals (10) for RVP during his spell here as well.

7458~~~
I thought he was decent today, got to praise the man when he gets it right, right?

Doesn't make up for how shite he has been overall, but i hope this goal will give him some confidence going forward, we need Rooney to score us goals this season.

7459~~~
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

7460~~~
His touch for definitely better today.

7461~~~
I'm still not remotely confident that he's turned a corner. with his stature in the game and hefty wages today's performance should surely be one of his poorer performances. the fact that it's being praised as one of his best performances (which it actually is and I'll give rooney credit) is probably more damning towards him because our expectation of his performances over the years has dropped like a rock.

also you'd think if goals help boost his confidence he would've kicked on from the hat trick against brugge, goal vs everton, etc. which never happened after any of those games.

7462~~~
I'd agree with this. He was ok but the standard has been set so low with him that an ok performance gets praised (which is understandable).

7463~~~
There are definitely a few agenda posters when it comes to Rooney. It's frustrating because people should at least try and have a balanced view. He'll play poorly again soon and they everyone can criticise him. He was decent-good in the CSKA match though. Doesn't deserve some of the stuff in here.

7464~~~
In RVP's great season here Rooney managed 4 assists from his 30 goals, 1 was from a set peice and the one against Villa was him playing in CM not as a 10. He played plenty of games in CM and was eventually dropped al together from the side with Welbeck being used at 10 which led to his supposed transfer request.

7465~~~
His best game of the season.

7466~~~
Rooney was very good in the first 15-20 min, then slumped into mediocrity for the rest of the first half. He started the second half well and delivered a great ball for Rojo. Then he became average again and made a bad miss from Mata's pass. Then scored with a nice goal and created a very good chance for Lingard. He didn't finish the game brilliantly but that was a decent performance overall with some excellent moments. Hopefully, he can keep this level of performances at least for a month or two before inevitably losing form again. 

Generally, the pattern of his form this season has been two steps back, one forward. The step forward keeps alive the hope that he's going just through a bad patch of form and will soon be Rooney of old.

7467~~~
See I think that's fair. Just goes to show that even one of his harshest critics can acknowledge an improved performance when it happens. Puts the earlier laughable comments about "3/10 performance" into perspective.

7468~~~
Thought he was actually good last night. Showed a number of really nice touches although he did muck up a number of 1-2 opportunities and plays. Did well to get the goal so I hope it builds his confidence. Definitely thrived when we played the ball a lot quicker. 

I hope he builds on it in our domestic games.

7469~~~
3/10 is just being spiteful, 6 is perfectly fair. Although the fact so many of is are happy with a 6/10 tells it's own story

7470~~~
Played well I thought - and it's no coincidence that he was up front with a partner in Martial. Not a great game, but a lot of improvement over what we've seen this season.

7471~~~
Yeah, true. It should be bit of a "meh" performance, despite the goal. The fact it's up there with his best of the season is a problem.

Still, the 3/10 stuff is ludicrous. Biased fools. Can't see what's happening in front of their own eyes.

7472~~~
Played better but there were still worrying signs. One goal doesn't answer critics or change things but it's a step in the right direction. Next three games against West Brom, Watford and PSV should be good games for him to build on it.

7473~~~
Evans vs Rooney <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7474~~~
I think the problem is he's lost his acceleration, which means his touch need to be that much more perfect, if not he'll lose the ball since he plays in crowded areas. This is also why he seems so ponderous when put through, he overthinks his touches because he knows he'll be caught unless the touches are perfect. His instincts, always a big strength, are put out of the equation.

And we all know that for all his obvious quality throughout his career, his first touch has never been a strength. Then the resulting performances has slammed his confidence and we're basically seeing a horrible player as a result.

He was fine yesterday, not going to criticise that performance, but there was precious little to suggest to me that was the start of a great run of form, as explained by the above.

7475~~~

7476~~~
Didn't see first half, so can comment only second. IMO he did good, not great, not brilliant, certainly not 3/10 performance, but good. Apart from scoring the winner, he did setup Lingard with the chance and had a several moments in which he held ball well or gave teammates good pass. But he did miss sitter provided by Mata, lost ball few times so overall I think he did about 6,5 or pushed 7 for the winner he scored. Hope he builds on that and stops with horror shows he's been serving us this season!

7477~~~
One of his better performances of the season. 6/10.

7478~~~
Love that celebration.

7479~~~
Thought he was pretty good in the first half to be fair, no, not creating God knows what but definitely energetic and involved, something that lacked recently and he didn't do any blunders which was a big plus. Second half he's turned into old Rooney for me though, looked bad most of the time, that miss when Mata squared it to him was embarrassing but he redeemed himself with that goal so credit where it's due.

7480~~~
Some highs and lows yesterday but Overall decent Performance.

The Goal showed he still has got the power. Hope he can Keep on improving.

7481~~~
Don't get the criticism from last night. He was good, even before the goal, and the winner made it a very good performance I believe. He did not slow us down, he showed energy moving around, his touch did not let him down and he even passed it well.

His Valencia-pass was working all night, but he also linked up well at close-quarters with Martial in the first half and with Lingard towards the end of the second.

I don't expect him to be as good every game, largely because they will be at a slower tempo, and there is no 'silk' to Rooney's game as such. But if he can get closer to that level of performance on a regular basis, then he will be useful to the team, which is a massive, massive improvement.

7482~~~
One of the questions for van Gaal yesterday:

<b><i>"WAS ROONEY THANKED FOR HIS WINNING GOAL?"</i></b>

Incredible!

7483~~~
I was at the game last night so here's a few thoughts on Rooney.

He was better than the dogshite he's been serving up since the start of the season. But he still wasn't <i>that</i> good. He had a lot more time on the ball mainly because Lingard and Martial were making runs / stretching the defence. When Rooney plays as #9 he is way too static, and drops deep crowding the midfield meaning that there isn't any room for our #10 / creative players to make any space for themselves and dictate play high up the pitch.

Rooney had space and time (more than we're used to) and he could spray it to the RW and he generally looked better. The goal which was served on a plate by Lingard (my MotM) is what I think all we can expect off of him for the remainder of the season. Just finishing easy / presentable chances (well having said that he still fluffed his lines when he was a few yards from goal and Mata put it on a plate). Hopefully he'll be shown the exit door come the end of the season.

Furthermore, for those saying 'it's a return' etc, he plays every minute of every game. He is bound to get a goal and an assist sporadically, but it doesn't mean he's back to his best. It means a broke clock is right twice a day.

7484~~~
If I can give credit no one else has any excuse <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7485~~~
Convinced journos in this country have very low IQs

7486~~~
Rooney was terrific and very creative, strange many don't believe so. I guess when you hate a man you really hate him

7487~~~
Not many gave much accolades on here last night either bearing in mind that in our last game v Wolfsburg away we may have needed to get something but by virtue of Rooney's winner we may still need a point but we could wrap up qualification v PSV instead.

7488~~~
Didn't see the game to comment on his overall performance (have read it was slightly improved) but it's nice to see him getting the winner (although let's be frank - harsh or not - he would be a total numpty to miss that chance and any striker worth his salt was scoring that).

Again...let's see if he can kick on and perform better.

I don't think it's going to happen - his fundamentals are gone and without them, we're going to bitching about him soon enough. Some of our supporters standards have evidently dropped significantly so I'm not going to take much value from hearing 'he was better tonight'.

7489~~~
I'd go along with this. He certainly wasnt the worst player on the pitch.
But that miss in front of goal...that's something that a £300kpw (or whatever he gets) player should be expected to score from.

In any case, lets see how he does in his next game.

7490~~~
I see you're still at it. I notice it's only the score out of 10 you're complaining about though, which is mostly irrelevant, since the numbers are arbitrary. I've given my reasons for why I think Rooney was poor last night, and I've stated I will give him credit when I think he plays well. The criteria for a good performance is no different for any player in our squad (obviously relative to position), but people still want to say I am being spiteful. If you think I am "out to get Rooney" because I think last night's performance was turgid (for all the reasons I've made in other posts) then you are deluding yourself. It's far more comfortable to follow the crowd and say what everybody wants to hear than to be objective.

For instance, how many people do you see giving the man of the match to Daley Blind? From a positional, technical and controlling aspect of the game, he was my man of the match. I thought he was serene at cb. I am my own person. Get over it.

7491~~~
Unbelievable <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

7492~~~
I've noticed this recently, about a lot of things.
Some are saying that Rooney scoring around 10 league goals per season is also acceptable.
Some MUFC fans are saying that 0-0 is now acceptable.
Few chances being created - this is now also acceptable.
Few goals being scored - this is acceptable.
Slow/zombie passing - this is acceptable.
Top 4 - this is now acceptable.

Standards are definitely dropping.

7493~~~
12 goals to equal the living legend Sir Bobby Charlton. Hate him, adore him, you can say all you want but for a guy who played on several positions he will probably clinch on a very honourable title that will probably stand for very, very long time.

7494~~~
He won't get it this season I don't think, and I hope he's gone by August 2016.

7495~~~
27 games to play in the PL and some more in the other cups. There is a reasonable point to argue about him kicking off and hitting the form as we know he can, but thus far he has not shown to be on that run.....yet

7496~~~
He won't be gone.

7497~~~
hitherto, up to this point, to date, since the season began, he's not shown that...yet

<span style="color: #ffffff">sorry!</span>

7498~~~
I wouldn't go as far as "terrific". He performed much better and looked less isolated as he did previous games. With Martial next to him, Rooney had someone with pace to play off which he really needed and he looked much better. If only Martial was more on the same wave length with Rooney the goals would of maybe came sooner as Martial's 1-2 passing and spacial awareness were lacking, which i was understandable for the reason for him to be subbed off in the late 2nd half. 

Back to Rooney, overall performance was above average. Due to him playing a deeper role, he was less isolated, was in a more natural position, was pinging the ball to the wings and was linking up with players well. I cant really fault his performance but at the same time cant say that he was "terrific" because being on 300k a week you expect alot more.

7499~~~
Not this again. 
His exorbitant salary doesn't need to be brought up every time he has a good or bad game. We all know the circumstances under which he signed that contract but it's worth going over again. 

We aren't paying him 300K/week because we expect world class performances week in week out, or because he has performed at that level in the past. Bear with me. We're paying him 300K/week because Wayne and his agent had the upper hand in contract negotiations, and that was the outcome. They had the upper hand because Moyes was reluctant to let one of the most experienced squad members walk out on him just as he'd been appointed manager. Understandable to some extent, and in retrospect, retaining Wayne wasn't the worst outcome, more that in showing their hand too early, Moyes and the board gave Paul Stretford full license to demand whatever they wanted.

So ultimately, it wasn't as if Wayne was being rewarded for good performances, past or future. He was given this contract because Moyes and the board got cold feet and goofed up. We're stuck with that, but there's no need for it to be brought up every time since we know it's a vastly inflated figure due to the circumstances.

7500~~~
Fantastic header. Was a lot harder then it looked at first, as the ball was a bit behind him.

The rest of his performance was pretty 'meh though. Which, worryingly, turned out to be one of his better performances this season. The miss from two yards out was hilarious, as are the excuses being made for it. A top player would have buried that with their eyes shut.

7501~~~
Who are they, I can't recall single poster claiming that?

7502~~~
Well taken goal. Certainly the type of goal you’d expect a more in-form Rooney to score. Of course, it’s only one game, and he now needs to start doing that on a more consistent basis. Hopefully the fact that it was an important winner to break our goalless streak will give him a confidence boost as well.

7503~~~
Spot on that. Except I'm more reluctant to praise his Hollywood passes out to the right wing, mainly cause people start saying he's Scholes-esque off the back of it, despite not being able to control a football or accurately lay off a 10 yard pass.

7504~~~
I agree it's just his Hollywood passes came off this time, which was something unexpected.

7505~~~
I have been one of his biggest critics in recent times, but that was a much better performance. His two passes to Lingard (or was one to Martial?) were very smart, and of course he scored an absolutely vital goal. 6.5/7 performance, really; levels above the 2s and 3s of recent weeks.

7506~~~
I want him to build on this performance and turn it into a good run of performances mainly because we avoid having to deal with the unpleasant task of dropping him but also because the team will benefit immensely from a Wayne Rooney in form. After a difficult run of matches in the past month the ones that are coming up are more important because you can win the league without beating City and Arsenal but you have no chance in hell if you can't dispatch sides like WBA and Palace.

7507~~~
But these things happen which is why we should create more in the first place instead of giving players shit when they miss a single chance. What is inexcusable is how he has let his short game deteriorate to the shambles it is right now.

7508~~~
Yeah I agree maybe not terrific and we can always expect more but his passing was very very good no? He could have had two assist for lingard imo.

7509~~~
Thought I had last night...

Everyone does remember that even Torres scored a great/important goal or two during his recent decline at Chelsea?

<b>Ultimately he was still shite, a joke striker</b> and needed to get the feck out of Chelsea. 

Rooney will be no different in my view. We might serve chances up from 3-5 yards out - he'll probably score 50-80% of them sure but he's still useless with his overall play compared to modern strikers and we have to hold higher standards than that.

7510~~~
I am probably Rooney's biggest detractor but, to be honest, after his most promising game for ages is not the time to drop him. He could "kick on" from here. If he goes back to being shite this weekend...then drop him.

7511~~~
Agreed.  The header wasnt a worldy but it was a stretch and a good goal.  The miss...and the excuses are just facepalmable.

7512~~~
The standard of his overall play in the last game was far above anything Torres showed at Chelsea - his goal was the most important but not the most impressive part of his game, IMO.

7513~~~
This weekend is the prefect opportunity for him to follow up on his performance on Tuesday. Unfortunately, I don't have high hopes that he will kick on, as he's been poor for so long with promising signs here and there. As mentioned above, similar to Torres when at Chelsea.

7514~~~
Have a feeling he's going to score again.

7515~~~
Me too. I feel like he is going to get back into some goalscoring form. Not extraordinary stuff anymore, but productive, statistically pleasing performances.

7516~~~
His miss was also something that would have made Torres proud.

Torres had some good performances for Chelsea too, especially under Benitez. In fact - as unbelieavable as it sounds - he scored in a single season for Chelsea 22 goals. For msot of the time, he was shit there though and he was playing cause of his past. Which I think is identical with Rooney's situation. Obviously - like Torres - Rooney will have the occassional game, but for most of the time, he would look like a player who is too bad to play in EPL.

7517~~~
His best half of the season as far as passing and first touch go.

7518~~~
1 pass to Martial so far.

7519~~~
Yeah, he's been quite sharp actually. One of our better players. Won't stop people singling him out for criticism if we don't win.

7520~~~
Good game by his standards. Made a few runs and his touch wasnt so bad.

7521~~~
Done well the last couple of games, playing a bit off Martial. Probably the only way to use him, a shame our wingers are next to useless and can't put in any crosses for our forwards.

7522~~~
His touch and passing looks miles better.

7523~~~
Decent half for Wazza.

7524~~~
This sums it up. The rest aren't much better but in my opinion Carrick and Rooney are playing way too slow. Some touch on the line though

7525~~~
That touch in the first half <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7526~~~
Looks much better playing behind Martial and today his first touch has actually been pretty good.

7527~~~
From a technical point of view, he has done well. Nothing infuriating about him in this first half. In truth, it's just an average performance.

7528~~~
I actually think he's been poor, personally. His use of the ball has been far too safe.  6 passes to Schweini, 3 to Carrick, 3 to Young, 1 each to Blind and Smalling. He recycles too often for the position he's in. Only 1 pass to Martial which was down the right wing near the half way line. Far too negative overall and a catalyst for the negativity drawn into the team's style.

However, what a touch that was to bring down that cross field ball from Schweini. Over the shoulder, mid stride, just wow. Take a bow.

7529~~~
He's an average player these days but at least he's not hurting the team like he has been with messing up the very basics of his role.

7530~~~
Indeed. The bar isn't set low, it's been buried deep.

7531~~~
OMFG HE GOT SUBBED

<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

7532~~~
He's improving, good to see.

7533~~~
Rooney had a decent game. Saying that, I dont think he did anything better than the run from Martial when he was taken off. Its just obvious we are a better side with the 19 year old wonder kid playing up top.

7534~~~
That piece of skill (taking down the high ball) on the 70+th minute is a bit special. Reminiscence of Berba's.

7535~~~
I honestly thought he was better than usual. Typical that he gets subbed off for the one game where he isn't complete shit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7536~~~
I think hes been good the last two games. Dare i say one of our better attacking players in each?

We are a better team with martial up top though. Still, I dont think hes done as a player for us.

7537~~~
His touch was better again today, especially when he brought down the high ball (<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>) but he's just not a threat at all is he?

7538~~~
I don't think that's what it is. I mean, we saw against Moscow, and even today, with Martial up top, that we struggle to create chances. Yes, we won the two games (Moscow where Rooney scored), but I don't think there's a significant difference in our play.

7539~~~
Best game of the season for him so far. Good to see he is improving.

7540~~~
Probably his most accomplished performance of the season and yet he barely featured as a threat. At least he wasn't a hindrance today, its just he was not having an impact at all.

7541~~~
All our attacking players are improving tbf
Slowly but surely were getting better. The game today should give them a confidence bump too.

7542~~~
3 shots, 1 on target, 2 blocked, 0 goals.

His general play was better but still not much of a goal threat.

7543~~~
He offers nothing much in the way of creativity of incisiveness for a #10 and can't go past players, but at least he's not acting as an extra defender for the opposition at the moment, that's an improvement.

7544~~~
He's offered no threat or invention. I really don't see how people can think he played well. His job is to score and create and he does none of that. He's played as our primary attack and he does nothing.

7545~~~
Not a bad performance, but didn't contribute much. As long as he can do all the simple things right, such as controlling the ball, then he's done good.

7546~~~
If it weren't for Lingard taking the initiative, I'm not sure we'd be out of the woods. Our attack improves when we field players with a nice turn of pace and ability to take people on. But we still sorely lack balance and Rooney is the main part our team's imbalance.

7547~~~
Much better, without question, but would anyone call Rooney's performance v West Brom "good"?

7548~~~
Today Rooney played like Herrera would play in that position, only higher up the pitch. Got the ball, popped it off, spread play, nice touches, yet Herrera's performances would be lauded, whilst Rooney's is seen as 'not a threat'.

7549~~~
Last two games he's been average overall, two 6/10 performances. Some nice touches in the first half and set up Mata but was quiet in the second and gave the ball away or was tackled a couple of times.

7550~~~
Played well and got subbed... After all the bad games that's mental.

7551~~~
Decent game again today I thought.

7552~~~
He gets so stuck in defending, that he's often just totally out of position on any sort of break.

7553~~~
Normally its like playing with 12 v 10 he's that bad.. today it was 11 v 10, so I'll take that.

7554~~~
Done the basic right, still off the pace and sharpness and positioning is still abit off. Good performance for his standard (which was pretty low these days)

Let's keep Martial up top, he got 7 defenders around him at one time

7555~~~
Our biggest chance in the first half came thru Rooney shielding Schweinsteiger's pass which let Mata on a 1v1 with the goalie. There are signs of improvement and that's a good thing going into the second half of the season.

7556~~~
No it wouldn't.

Rooney lost the ball a number of times and didn't seem to be in tune with a lot of things. I remember specifically Scweinsteiger and Carrick passing into space close to Rooney, expecting him to move a bit, but he was on his hind legs. Rooney didn't even try to chip Myhill when he got that poor clearance right outside the box with the goal wide open. That was one of the most un-Rooney like behavior I've seen from him. I thought his CSKA game was better than this.

7557~~~
Not bad at all today, that touch from bfs pass was sublime

7558~~~
Better then his usual self. Shame it's taken 2 and half months to see an improvement.

That and he is rarely in the number 10 areas when he needs to be. He either drops too deep or he's too far forward.

Too often we see Carrick and BFS looking for a pass to a number 10 and Rooneys not there.

7559~~~
Good match by his recent standards, but he still needs to do a lot more to justify him being an automatic starter

7560~~~
No it wouldn't, you are talking bollocks. 

Herrera was criticised for similar performances, and after all, dropped by his manager.

7561~~~
Still not impressive, but he's definitely improved over the last two games.

Hope for all our sake he continues.

7562~~~
He isn't even a goal threat anymore, that situation when he had 36 year old Mcauley ahead of him in one on one situation in the first half and his first thought was to turn back and see if he can pass it backward just sums him up.

All around, decent game and at least he is not stopping us from playing like he did all season, but as a number 10, not good enough.

7563~~~
A competent but underwhelming performance today. He is a very easy player to defend, he simply can't push past anyone with speed or physicality. Once he bounces off the defensive force field, his only option is his trademark outlet pass wide right.

7564~~~
A better performance tbf

Did fade as the game went on though

7565~~~
If you don't follow united and read this thread you'd think he plays like messi today while in reality even lingaard plays better than him.  Even if you discount the goals, he's hungry and dangerous,  keeps the ball well. 

Best performance of the season is not even as good as the new kid on the team. 

How the mighty have fallen

7566~~~
Not bad, a solid 6/10. His touch was better, but dont think hes a number 10. Dont even think hes a number 9 and defo not a midfielder. Its a tough one, but hes captain so will continue as number 10 to fit him in. (Probably would be better on the left or right of a three behind striker so he can cross the ball). Actually think that would be his best asset.

7567~~~
He just never looks like he's going to do much in terms of goal-scoring. He looks bloody petrified of shooting the ball.

7568~~~
He's been so poor this season. People are settling for performances where he can actually control the ball.

7569~~~
Bizarre. The majority viewpoint is that he played better but wasn't a threat.

7570~~~
If you didn't know which site you were on you would think you were on a Liverpool forum.

7571~~~
Average performance, did the basic things alright. Just meh.

7572~~~
We have a blunt instrument as a number 10. He did the basics which is an improvement on his usual of the season which is dog shite. It wasn't a good performance, nor a bad one.

7573~~~
He's a lot better when he has someone playing in front of him which allows more space for Rooney to operate in. I have no problem with him playing at 10 instead of Herrera.

7574~~~
Taking this season into consideration this was a good game. On the whole, the team obviously requires a lot better from a player in that role.

Baby steps...

7575~~~
He did.  Im not denying that. His best performance of the season. Probably this and everton. 

But i dont think anyone could argue thst lindgaard has a better game than him. And his best performance of the season is just par.

7576~~~
He's from Warrington not Copenhagen.

7577~~~
I blame it on the fat finger,  fat fingers,  curse youuuuu

7578~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7579~~~
No you wouldn't.

7580~~~
Amazing how far our expectations of Rooney have fallen. That said, he had a decent-average match. Not done much wrong & that touch on the touch line was exquisite. I guess that is progress.

7581~~~
He was okay today without ever really doing anything threatening. He seemed to give the ball away less which was good and his touch was better than it has been this season. An odd performance for LVG to finally sub him.

7582~~~
He looked like a PL player today, that's a marked improvement. He has to add goals and assists to his game though because his stats in the league are appalling. His only proper contributon in the EPL has been the third goal against Everton in a 3:0 win. Actually, we would be in the same position in the table if we discounted his goals against Sunderland and Everton.

7583~~~
Seriously? Even the old Rooney was only decent+ as a #10, where as Herrera always looks dangerous there. Not trying to take a dig at Rooney here, but he never was, and never will be a midfielder. He simply does not have the tactical and technical skills to be effective there, where as he is/was an incredible forward player

7584~~~
He's going to play no matter what,  any improvement is welcome, let's hope he can keep improving by adding some more goals.

7585~~~
Dont agree that hes not a goal threat. He scored a goal 4 days ago ffs.
He hasn't been good this season and our attack in general has been unbalanced and pretty poor but hes played well last 2 games.

People are far too critical of him.

7586~~~
Didn't see the game but from reading the match report and this thread - sounds like more nepotism going on.

If he's an average player on 300k/week, then he's got to go. End of story.

7587~~~
If it was say Januzaj giving these performances he would be dropped (see the start of the season when he played as well as Rooney is now in the couple of games he played), but as its Rooney he carries on. If people are pleased by his performance today then that shows how far his ability has lowered, as he is a shadow of his former self. In my opinion a player on his wages should be giving a 8/10 performance at the very least almost every game. Rooney has given us maybe one of these all season, its not good enough. Time to move him on.

7588~~~
He's getting paid stupidly high wages. It matters whether a load of morons try to tell us it doesn't or not. His wages should reflect his value and his value is currently no better than a mid-low level PL player and that's on his better days. 

He's getting defended because he's Wayne Rooney - he deserves more criticism, not less.

7589~~~
One goal is enough for you ? He really doesn't even inspire danger never mind goalscoring anymore.

7590~~~
I think #10 is where he's best, I've thought that for about 3 years now. His tendency to fade out of the game for periods doesn't affect the team as much as it does when he plays up front. 

And I don't think Herrera is that good there either, I think he's best as a kind of hybrid #10/#8. He can play well in both positions but lacks key qualities to ever be a consistent success in either, imo.

7591~~~
Ander seems to be good when we have bored a team into submission or have a very narrow lead and they have to come out and try to score against us. He laid on the ball for Valencia for Martial to equalise in Russia, today a lovely pass for Martial to run onto for the penalty when WBA were trying to hit us on the break.

7592~~~
How long does that one goal buy him before people can point out he wasn't a threat, another 4-5 games? When he goes on a decent run of form the criticism will ease off.

7593~~~
Am I the only one that thought he should have shot first time in the build up to Mata's missed opportunity? 

He had the chance to whack it first time right on the edge of the box. It was probably a better chance than the one Mata was eventually presented.

7594~~~
He doesn't havr the believe anymore,  it's pretty obvious.  Rooney of yesteryear would havr at least make a nice hard shot a few touch earlier.

7595~~~
His best game of the season. Tidy in everything he did, like most of our players, and also very functional rather than exciting, like so many of our players. I gave him a 6. At least his touch is looking better, and he's finding his rhythm again a bit as the no.10. We need more than functional performances, though, and that's the problem with our whole attack at the minute. Lingard and Martial breathe a bit of life into it, but we have to show more patience in the final third to pick out passes between the lines; there are far too many crosses and lobbed balls from central areas at the moment.

7596~~~
I think it really tells a story when we're applauding Rooney for not making mistakes. People talk of how we're a big club, but we're clearly willing to accept mediocrity from Rooney now and it'll keep holding us back.

7597~~~
Probably his best performance of the season, and it was still a 6/10 type performance in all honestly.

7598~~~
He just doesn't do all that much. He kept it tidy today but he never really looked a threat or have them on the backfoot. It's not good enough in my opinion.

7599~~~
Did not lose the ball in a daft manner more than a couple of times, only one wayward shot and pass each, completed some of his passes. 10/10.

7600~~~
He just looks a very limited player now. Thought he played alright today without really doing anything, couple of nice touches maybe. He's just not creative enough and doesn't seem to be able to create space for himself to either pick a pass or get a shot off. I'm not happy with him playing at 10 when we have at least two better options.

7601~~~
I thought he looked a lot better in his general play. His touch and passing were at a much higher level. He is still relatively ineffective in terms of being a goal-scoring or chance creation threat.

7602~~~
He was better today but I still don't feel that he offers much. Everything about his game is so slow now, it's rather sad considering what an explosive player he was for all those years. If you ever wanted an example of player living off a reputation this is it, and he's doing it for both club and country. If this persists for the rest of the season I think he'll find himself with a reduced role next year.

7603~~~
I thought he played fairly well today. And I thought it was the right decision to sub him off he was tiring badly in the second half.

7604~~~
He must have had a good game, there were only two Rooney threads today when I logged on...

The thing about Rooney is when he plays well, United play well.  When he is cack, United are cack.  He is such a pivotal player for us.  When his form is down, we are depressed, when he has a cracker we are elated.

He was good today, slowing restoring the form he is famous for.  Even did some good tracking back today.  Not quite Rooney of old but if he can get his form back and be at his best from Christmas onwards we have a real shout at winning the title.

7605~~~
He was decent, didn't do much of note but compared to previous games there was a marked improvement. He needs to play behind Martial.

7606~~~
He is not good enough to be our striker as he can't do anything when he's under pressure, we're much better using Martial's hold up ability. At least as a #10 he has a bit more space and he can carve out a few chances, like he did against CSKA, he'll track back and at the very least retain possession. Not entirely sure what this means for Herrera though... 

But it's probably the best we can do for the rest of the season.

7607~~~
Compared to his other games this season, it was a better performance. However with regards to what he should be offering to the game, it still continues to be poor. Would still prefer Herrera play instead of him or even give Pereira a chance by putting Mata at no.10

7608~~~
It should, but it doesn't, because his wage is vastly inflated due to Moyes bending over backwards for him during negotiations. Anyone would love to earn more for the amount of work they put in, it's up to the employer to decide whether the payoff is worth it to them. Therefore, imagine that he was currently earning what he used to earn under Fergie, and look at his performances in that light.

7609~~~
That's because if he's not playing well we're playing with 10 men,  doesn't mean that he's the fulcrum

7610~~~
He just looks so slow and immobile. Definitely going downhill.

7611~~~
He was quite good yesterday, did most things well. Nothing great but it's improving atleast.

7612~~~
A marked improvement from his recent lows yesterday.

7613~~~
This stood out for me most 

When Herrera came on he looked so quick in comparison

7614~~~
His best overall performance. Still looked entirely unthreatening. Which sadly says it all.

It's not a case of form, it's a case of losing his legs, like Falcao. You can go on about him "returning to form" but when the physical decline is so sharp, he's just never going to be what he was.

7615~~~
Form is temporary decline is permanent sadly

7616~~~
He was definitely a lot better today than other performances but his legs still look heavy and I really don't think there is any return from that

7617~~~
If he plays like this for the rest of the season I will be happy, knowing he's not actively hurting our attack. We can then see through the season and look for better in the summer.

7618~~~
Been saying since last season that Rooney is basically what you expect from your typical centre mid playing at centre forward. Like a Steven Davies, or perhaps Frank Lampard considering his finishing ability. He plays short sideways passes, he drops back and tries to help keep possession,  he passes it out to the wing - but ultimately, he has no qualities for a player at the sharp end of a team. Can't run his man, can't make space for his shot with skill (hence 90% of his shots seem to be blocked in the last couple of seasons ). He simply does not make it uncomfortable at all for even your average run of the mill centre half. In fact, I think most championship centre halves would have a fairly comfortable afternoon against him, as he has nothing to hurt them with.

7619~~~
We need to cut our ties with him to progress as a team. That's the reality of the matter.

7620~~~
Not bad enough to really criticize, not good enough to alter the course of the game. So gets a reprieve this week at least .

7621~~~
Touch looking better I thought. Traditionally this was a sign that he was regaining form.

7622~~~
the only logical place for him in the team is backup at 10 or in midfield

he started well yesterday and it was a lot better as you say but the 10/15 mins before he went off his touch/passing seemed to desert him again

I'd love to see angry Rooney back - he was a fierce competitor and I thought he would score 20 goals this season.....morphing into a Shearer style forward who bullied defenders - he looks tame and short of confidence

7623~~~
Feck! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7624~~~
Thought he had a very good game myself,Ran himself to the ground for the team

7625~~~
Did anyone else take notice of the kick off he did? What kind of pass was that? He kicked it to Smalling as if he took a shot against goal. Such a beautiful touch. The ball didn't spinn at all. Must have been to send out some sort of "come on" message.

7626~~~
Too much running isn't always a good thing, it's a good thing for keane / viera / bfs, but a stiker shouldn't be everywhere but up there.

Looking at the heat map you wouldn't know where his position is, he's literally everywhere, but not there when it's needed.

7627~~~
Which was probably the main reason he was subbed in the end and not because LvG thought he had a bad game.

7628~~~
Even if he returns to decent form now we'll still have the issue in the summer around what to do with him. It's unacceptable for our main striker to take so long to get back into form everytime.

7629~~~
Maybe WWE will buy him!

7630~~~
Well, he did manage an assist after all.

7631~~~
Thought so as well.

7632~~~
Has been better recently but still absolute nowhere near the standard United's #9 or #10 should have.

7633~~~
He will noway be near better than Herrera or Mata in the #10 or Martial in #9. His capability to play at the top level is at a declining point now and season by season which we have already seen his football will continue to decline. Saying that though, his experience and impact is still effective despite his recent performances. He still offers something for the team but respectfully his role within the team has to change so for not himself but squad also to improve. Maybe into a much deeper role, i dont know. Either that or he has to jog on to another club because at this moment United cant step up there game with an aging Rooney who cant step up his. He's maybe playing better now but this guy is on 300k a week... either bag the goals or the assists but at the moment he's not claiming enough at this point.

7638~~~
Has he got an account on here?

7639~~~
Thought Rooney was man of the match on Raw.

7640~~~
Maybe Barret can do something to keep him out of the starting line up?

7641~~~

7642~~~
great another FA ban looming

7643~~~
Please let it be true.

It's a pretty shitty headline, made to look as if he's almost bragging about it but good job from him.

7645~~~
He's been great.

7646~~~
He shoots.
He scores.
For England.

7647~~~
I think off the pitch he is a great Captain. Perhaps this is why LVG likes him so much. He is almost like a middle manager, who knows how to talk to people and the media.
His problems though, relate to his on-pitch performances.

7648~~~
He's been good, not great.

7649~~~
That's crap journalism, what's wrong with a bloke checking his mates are ok?

7650~~~
Did these words really come out of Wayne Rooney's mouth?

7651~~~
He actually had a good touch and was creative tonight. Not peak Rooney levels but if he performed like that for us I would definitely be content with him in the side.

7652~~~
Yes

7653~~~
Thought he was really good today. Faded a bit in the second half, but he seemed a lot more comfortable. On paper he was on the wing, but he was able to roam around, and it looked like it did him the world of good. Involved in two of the goal too.

7654~~~
He doesn't seperate religion from relegation, of course it's him.
<span style="color: #ffffff">White text</span>

7655~~~
I missed that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7656~~~
You mean when he turned koscielny inside out and narrowly missed smashing it into the top corner from outside the area? Or do you mean all of his very good passing play? Or do you mean his goal?

No problem with having a go when hes rubbish, but tonight suggested it has been form, rather than "his legs have gone". He played well.

Of course this is a friendly in weird circumstances, but he looked sharp to me.

7657~~~
Yes, word for word, give or take a few "uhms" in there.

7658~~~
I think he looked ok, and i hope LvG watched this. Him interchanging with Mata/Herrera/Lingard/Young/Memphis/Pereira/whatnot at 10, left wing, right wing could be the best way to use him, with Martial upfront.

7659~~~
He showed glimpses tonight of what he was. I do hope he can shove all the criticism down everyone's thoats (mine included). I'd happily eat humble pie if he can play like that for United consistently.

7660~~~
He's going to have to play "sharp" against more than a disinterested French team to prove he's still got it. If Martial's  out on Saturday, I'd suggest bringing your knitting to wherever your watching the game.

7661~~~
I'm not sure how much we can draw from that match.

7662~~~
I dont think he's half as stupid as some people make him out to be. Not the most articulate person generally (though that quote is good), but he doesnt come across as a tool.

7663~~~
a friendly against a French team who clearly weren't up for it but a good performance non the less, hopefully brings it to Watford.

7664~~~
Handy, I was going to watch the game at my knitting class!

7665~~~
Oh Christ just noticed that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7666~~~
There's a lot of top class football left in this lad...

7667~~~
Honestly didn't take much from that match last night. It was pretty crap I thought - the match itself I mean, with plenty of bad passing. Nearly fell asleep watching it. 

Rooney got his goal and credit for being there but should have been saved. We'd be pissed if De Gea let that in. 

Still - we live in hope he might spring into life based off one of these goals in low-pressure games.

7668~~~
Nah, it was volleyed from really close, huge speed on the ball and at hips height so not practical at all for a keeper. Strongly doubt any keepers could've pulled off a save.

7669~~~
In a friendly.

7670~~~
People are so bitter when Rooney does half decent.

7671~~~
Rooney played well, but the keeper should have done better

7672~~~
It's not so much bitter as annoyed that he seems able to turn it on for England but not his wage paying club. Personally I'm hoping it can be the catalyst for improved club form

7673~~~
Unfortunately we've been saying this since the Brugge away trip. That's the problem - this seems to be the best he can offer and regardless of how average it is, he doesn't even show it that often.

7674~~~
Bring him home, Wayne.

Pogba would be nice too.

7675~~~
Na, it's definitely bitterness. If Rooney plays well for England and not for club, then the club have got to look at how they are playing him, and what can be done to better him. For example, Rooney had a lot of freedom playing for England yesterday. He doesn't have that for United at the moment.

7676~~~
Aye, that lack of freedom is what's causing him to mis-control the ball and pass it into touch.

He's playing a bit better now - that's all it is. Nothing to do with England. He's still average as hell and robbing a living.

7677~~~
He playing better than he was, he was better vs West Brom and I believe the game before. Lets not drop the bar though, his performances have gone from poor to average. Its a good thing though, hopefully the tradjectory keeps that ways and he moves from average to good and above this season.

7678~~~
Wasn't he a bif naff in the previous England games, where he struggled to break the record? His form has just improved, doubt it has anything to do with so called lack of freedom at United.

7679~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/G2EGnNZ.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/G2EGnNZ.png"/>

Agent Rooney.

7680~~~
All three of them have heads growing on their left ears.

7681~~~
Scary times and all but I doubt Pogba needs to be wearing a bullet proof vest in the stadium.

7682~~~
It's from another game, you numpty. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Didn't watch the England match.

7683~~~
Oops <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> sorry!

7684~~~
A great captain's performance.........

7685~~~
Wasnt even too bad for his standards, but he's just average. There is nothing extra's he can bring to our team. He wouldnt improve any side.

7686~~~
the worst part of Fellaini coming on, is moving Rooney back deep.

I thought we'd got over those shocking deep performances, lashing aimless balls to the right wing.

7687~~~
One of our best players first half, went to shit with the rest in the second.  I know we all hate his diagonal balls but 3 times in the second half when he was playing deeper it was literally the only option he had except to pass it back.  

Still he needs to do much better but we've no one else to bring in in his place.

7688~~~
Had a decent first half in the 10 role. Had to be swapped with Fellaini In the second half because Fellaini was stinkingly bad in midfield

7689~~~
One of the worst displays by a no.10 I have ever seen. He left a chasm between our attack and our midfield, and when he dropped deeper in the second half he did nothing but give the ball away. He's so far past it, he's coming back round again.

7690~~~
Should not be playing for this club. I'm tired of saying it.

7691~~~
Was one of the few who were decent out there today. The only one in midfield or attack who was good in any way. Was very good in the first half, still tried in the second but was only decent. Still far better then the others. 

Those criticizing him after today are talking out of their ass.

7692~~~
Hung the midfield out to dry.

7693~~~
When he dropped deep, Fellaini's mop was pushed up to play #10 to get on the end of crosses. The game plan was for Rooney to play a diagonal ball and the winger to cross into Fellaini. Obliviously did not work. Rooney had a decent game.

7694~~~
Worked hard and played the odd good pass in the first half but he's fecking useless and his main attribute is running around like a headless chicken. Thankfully for himself, tonight he was one of our best players given how shite the majority of the team was.

7695~~~
He was decent in the first half, and had some good moments. Notably when he pulled off that very good diagonal pass that Martial should've capitalised on.

He was very poor in the 2nd half, though. Our entire team was poor, yeah, but that still shouldn't excuse him. If Rooney's supposedly improving and returning to form, then you'd have hoped that this was the sort of game where he could be a driving force for us, and win us the game. It's certainly something he'd have been capable of doing when he was at his best, and our key player.

Essentially, I think he will hopefully improve slightly upon his woeful form, but I struggle to see him ever becoming our key player again. Which is concerning, because it's what he's expected to be.

7696~~~
Okay-ish in the first half, created a huge chance when Martial let the ball run to Lingered who messed up the touch.

In the second half he was horrific. 

He's en route to one of the worst seasons from a Manchester United captain since pre-Fergie.

7697~~~
That's clearly a tactic by the manager.  He's always said he wants his 10 to be a second striker.  Herrera tends to stand very high up when he plays there too.  For god sake Rooney is usually guilty of looking for the ball too much.  Second half he had no options available to him except long balls forward or pass it back.  

I agree he's past it but this shitty system is killing our attackers too.  Hasn't taken long for Martial to catch the bug has it?

7698~~~
If you think that's a decent game, you've let your standards fall to the floor. We really are at absolute rock bottom right now quality wise. Look at Rooney's positioning all game. Playing in what should be the no.9's space and not linking the play up. His legs have gone. He had a decent 15 minutes, and then he went back to being poor and eventually diabolical.

7699~~~
If that first half constitutes a good performance by him, as I've seen written by quite a few this evening, then your standards have gotten really low. He has no sense of imagination to play that position, every motion is learnt and nothing is spontaneous. When he has several passing options he'll always go to the right, never for a through ball.
He was nowhere to be seen in the second half as a number ten, the gap between our midfield and our attack was enormous. When he went into midfield he had no interest in tracking runs, careless you would say, and predictably he'd go for the hail Mary 50 yd passes to the right wing. Even if that pass is successful your odds are against you with the defenders closing down. He just isn't good enough anymore, not the worst player on the field but never the best.

7700~~~
Don't know why managers use him in central midfield, was like playing with one midfielder after he switched with Fellaini. Had a good first half though.

7701~~~
rooneys been voted by 7percent people as the MOTM people go really mental, hes the biggest reason we switched off in the second half, he is absolutely disgraceful captain material, what more can I say, we wont win anything while hes starting for us, mark my words..

7702~~~
the buck stops with the manager. He's the one that sold any competition and didnt really replace them (you cant really say Martial is, as they both play, in different positions too).

Rooney's struggling, but any sensible manager would have taken him out of the firing line by now, and try to fix our forward line.

7703~~~
When your DMs deliver a performance like Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger delivered today, you can't fault a #10. Even Kaka in his prime would struggle.

7704~~~
He's not good enough anymore to play where he's playing. The fact we even consider swapping him and Fellaini says it all. Name another club that swaps their star striker for Fellaini when they need a goal. It's a fecking joke.

7705~~~
Sneiderlin was poor today and unfortunately we have some really rookies in Martial,Lindgard and Memphis.

7706~~~
I was genuinely excited by what he was doing in the first half but he lost the plot with the rest in the second. The problem is he doesn't have the cutting edge anymore so his good performances are no longer altering the course of matches like they used to. However he can't be blamed for the result given how wasteful Martial were and how comfy Memphis found that right back's pocket.

7707~~~
That moment when the the ball fell to his feet on the edge of the box, and he, for some reason, decided he had time take a nice comfy touch, before the opponent took it off him and started a counter summed up Rooney's 15-16 season for me.

7708~~~
I can't believe he's still in the team after four months of dross. I genuinely fear he'll just keep playing the whole way through the season, without anybody questioning his performances.

7709~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7711~~~
Or if your expectations of him are so low then you might think he had a 'decent game'...and it might even stretch to a 'very good' game.

7712~~~
I can't believe this guy is our captain. Did nothing but hoof the ball when the team was crying out for some composure on the ball.

Him, Fellaini and Schneiderlin might just be the three stupidest players we have at the club and we had to play for 30 minutes with the three of them in midfield.

7713~~~
Hard to blame Rooney today, everyone was bad , but the reality is he just isn't that elite player that his wage demands him to be anymore, he is neither a striker or a midfielder of any great quality.

He's a problem now and its only going to become more difficult to accommodate him, he'll continue to play when he's fit though you can guarantee that.

7714~~~
Stats shmats.

Although those stats more or less reflect what happened. He was one of our better players, a just about acceptable performance surrounded mainly by utter shite.

7715~~~
How can anyone tell me that was a good performance. This is MANCHESTER UNITED FFS!

7716~~~
He was? Decent in the first half, but I'd struggle to particularly rank him above a number of our other players. Better than the worst of the side like Fellaini and Schneiderlin, aye, but hardly a good player surrounded by shite ones either.

7717~~~
Him and Lingard were head and shoulders the best players in the first half. The whole team were garbage in the second half but Rooney was probably marginally less shite than some of them.

7718~~~
His performance wasn't actually bad per-say, although it was thoroughly average, but as captain and one of the senior players he should be driving the team on and he failed woefully in helping us get any sort of grip on the second half.

This is not the Wayne Rooney I want to remember. Impotent, timid and largely pointless.

7719~~~
Heard on football weekly the other day  - Sanchez & Ozil's wages + £30,000 per week = Rooney's wages.

But yeah it was great that tonight he wasn't the worst player on the pitch.

7720~~~
How many counter attacks he created for PSV tonight? How is that acceptable in van Gaal's philosophy? If Herrera lost the ball so many times he would be dropped for at least few games no doubt and that would be mentioned a lot by our van Gaal experts.

7721~~~
He was one of the main reasons we were shit in the second half

7722~~~
Meh, I thought he was decent in the first half and had some very good moments, but nothing particularly spectacular. I'd probably give the nod to Smalling and Blind for being our best players. His first half performance was decent, aye, but still only that. Not enough to excuse for a very good second half performance.

7723~~~
For your sarcasm to work, someone would have had to actually say that...

7724~~~
His obsession with passing to the right does my head, there was a moment when he got the ball in a lot of space with Martial making a great run down the middle but he delayed the pass and then passed it right to Lingard

7725~~~
Also how the feck did he end up in central midfield again? Can we stop this terrible prank that keeps getting played every now and then where Wayne Rooney is considered a midfield of some quality. He's barely a footballer of some quality these days, let's not make it even worse by putting him in midfield. Please.

7726~~~
Like you did when you said he was one of our better players? Which I read as not therefore being the worst.

I genuinely thought we played better without him against Watford.

7727~~~
funny thing is that commentators never question his ability neither were today.. everybody else but not him, only after he played one of his hollywood balls after being 75 minutes invisible/shit <b>(</b>people in fact try to claim he worked hard, he was fecking lost on the pitch again) only after tht ball you could here the same shit again. Wayne rooney was alwys the plyer who came to rescue for Manchester United over the years, I would punch them in their fecking faces, bellends..

again and again hilarious stuff from them and people in the end strt to believe tht this some sort of good performance is top of the cake. It is just fecking mentl, if anything we needed captain to act in the second half, to arouse the team being top of them if they were not performing. You would never seen anything like this if Keano was here.. 

..and Pereira who is much more fit let alone his ability is rotting on the bench again

7728~~~
He wasn't supposed to play the whole game after the sickness..  He created enough chances for others to win the game but himself wasn't much of a danger. The last 10-15 mins was pure survival.

7729~~~
He reminds me of late-Gerrard.  Convinced that he's going to save the day with some massive Hollywood ball, but actually achieves nothing.

7730~~~
His first half performance gives me hope. Let's see.

7731~~~
He wasn't the worst player on the pitch. Now read the rest of that bit of your post I put in bold.

7732~~~
It gives me a bit of hope that he's not completely finished and can still be a decent player, but it's disappointing that we've sunk to a level where him just being decent is what we're hoping for. I certainly can't see him being a key, world class player anymore...which is the exact role he's expected to fill.

7733~~~
Hey, If all you want from our best paid player every game is that he isn't the worst player on the pitch, then good for you. It's doubtful we'll ever agree on anything based on that.

7734~~~
he was OK tonight.  

Let down by weak midfielders behind him and wasteful attacking players in front of him.

7735~~~
Done ok until the subs and he had to move into midfield where he was dross. Was doing fine in the hole until the subs came on and ruined the shape.

7736~~~
He did alright in the first half but he is very rarely a threat these days. If he goes through a game without a shot on goal it's not even a surprise no matter what position he plays.

7737~~~

Why do you keep making up stuff that nobody actually said?

7739~~~
Four months into the season and we've reached<i> "His first half performance gives me hope" </i>

Get in!! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7740~~~
Was probably our second best player in the first-half. Liked what I saw actually. Good first touch, good passing, and some good balls into the box. He faded in the second and was a bit sloppy but it was encouraging. Although I think you can see that he is not going to be a match winner anymore, he has lost that dynamism. He can still contribute though.

7741~~~
He offers next to nothing, the fact he's our supposed top attacker is perhaps the main symptom of our lifeless football, when you compare him to the top dogs at the elite clubs he's like a one legged mongrel with fading eyesight.

7742~~~
I remember the moment, thats one of the many reasons why he cant play there, herrera would have quickly turned nd released the strieker stright away. rooneys not good enough to start at any position and I could find better and more promising plyers to fit on the bench ahead of him too.. hes so done its unbelie´vable, only luis cant see it, or ignores that becuse he ocne said he wont bench captain. Is he just frid not to look a bit silly with breaking this statemen or losing the dressing room, it cant be fecking worse... we would hae for his salary 5 better players and its not a joke

7743~~~
The only way you will get a past his peak Rooney to score goals is to keep him up top and have the midfielders constantly give him the ball in the box or on the edge of the box.  Like Newcastle used to do for Shearer towards the end of his career.  This doesn't happen and as a result he gets 1 chance per game and people on here kick off that he's not scoring.  

We then drop him to midfield (is that Rooney's fault?) to accommodate a fecking tree up top who's only asset is to control the ball and set somebody for a shot, and he can't control the ball, he just loses possession and gives away free kicks.  Terrible decision to bring Fellaini on in my opinion.  We need to bring players on with technical ability like Herrera.  

We missed Carrick's passing.

7744~~~
I was planning on coming in here and saying he had a good first half and was maybe building on his good England performance ................................................ but then the second half happened.

That tiny bit of hope that Rooney could return, evaporated with as bad a 45 minutes as he's had all season.

7745~~~
this Rooney pass to the wing with a 35% pass rate, has become the stuff of legend for me. I actually wince at the games now when he tees them up, they are unbearable to watch. Just make it stop, someone. Enough already. We are better than this. surely

7746~~~
meh

7747~~~
The fact people can't see that his positional awareness is simply woeful as a no.10 is representative of the problems we have as a club. We got hammered 5.0 at home by PSV's youth team tonight. We have all this money and ability to bring in the best young talent in the world, yet we produce nothing through our academy, and we persist with players like Wayne Rooney on 250k a week. There's nothing coming through, and what's there is over the hill. It's tragic. I am watching my club become ordinary. Wayne Rooney is emblematic of the fact we're no longer a top club in Europe. We've been overtaken domestically by the worst sides we've seen in the premier league for a long long time, too. We have to be ruthless if we want to get back to the top. Van Gaal needs get rid of Rooney and stop relying on the kids. Memphis, Lingard and Martial all have a future here, but they need time, and they need to be surrounded by experienced, top-class players. We don't have any in the forward line. Rooney is supposed to be that, but he's simply finished. This fact alone is destroying our forward line, and the kids look lost. It isn't fair on them, and it isn't fair on the fans who support the highest-paid players in the world and have to watch this utter garbage week in and week out. 

Phase Rooney out and bring someone in in January, or at worst the summer, or don't progress.

7748~~~
First half I thought he was decent, but second half he was shocking like basically everyone else. Shouldn't be starting (but then who really thinks he should apart from van Gaal?), unfortunately we have Herrera out and Mata for some reason isn't allowed to play centrally so he gets the nod because 'my captain shall always play'.

7749~~~
He was completely done for after he gave PSV their most dangerous counter of the game. Thankfully they did very poorly in attack this evening. After they messed it up, De Gea gave it to Blind who brought it forward. Rooney was in front of him but with his back turned and walking. Blind shouting at him to receive the ball. Had to turn away and give it Smalling.

He was knackered and barely moved, went for the long ball at every opportunity.

7750~~~
You've sort of contradicted yourself there

7751~~~
He tries hard but he offers very little. He's part of the furniture now, but it's not what we want. He's a passenger in most games. I got nothing against him personally and I appreciate his contribution but we could do so much better.

7752~~~
The kids we've bought. Memphis and Martial were not developed in our academy. Lingard came through our academy. 

My point is that you can't rely on the young players without the experienced, top professionals to guide them and take the brunt of the pressure. we should be relying on a Wayne Rooney, not a Martial, but Wayne Rooney is finished, so what do we have other than kids?

As for our academy, who's going to come through and be a United-quality player. We just don't have them any more.

7753~~~
Please retire. Please.

7754~~~
He didn't seem to do too much wrong in the first half (at least I didn't notice his usual poor passing, lack of pace & strength, and his brick wall control), but he was absolutely out of gas in that second half, which is shocking at his age.

Should be used from the bench, but then he'd no doubt gain weight with not playing and get even worse.

7755~~~
He honestly looks like a mid to late thirties player, who's coming to end of his career, and struggling to come to terms with the fact his body simply wont do what he wants it to. He'll show the odd flash of quality, but for the most part he'll be a hindrance, not a help. Games where he doesn't do anything awful, slowly become 'good performances', the same type of performance that 5 years ago would have been 'a bad game'.

There's no doubting his effort, or his will to win, but he's fighting a battle against his aging body, that he simply can't win. In an era where football is becoming faster, stronger, and a younger mans game...Rooney is simply being left behind. And there's no shame in that, he's been playing top flight football for the past 14 years, he's played 700 odd games and suffered a hell of a lot of injuries, and couple all of that with naturally poor genes, and well, its no surprise he's looking so past it these days...because he is. Players like Giggs and Maldini, who were able to play to a great level well into their late thirties, are the exception not the rule.

7756~~~
....and not forgetting the fags and beer.

7757~~~
He didn't seem to have the faintest clue what he was meant to be doing in that second half... Which is kind of worrying since he's the captain.

7758~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgZlWBDSC54?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

You tell 'em Roy.

7759~~~
Don't think he was particularly crap. He is bang average. That is the form/standard at which he plays nowadays. 
The entire team need a kick up the bu** for that 2nd half.

7760~~~
Surprised people are being so calm here. I thought Rooney's legs appeared to have gone more than they normally do. I think if Mata had gotten 90 in his role he probably finds a through ball or moment of creativity we lacked. You can't have a 10 do nothing for 90 minutes of note other than one nice piece of footwork to set up a cross back into the box off a cleared corner. 

He simply has to go in the summer, even if there's no fee, as long as someone will take his wages. Unless he's out of shape or there's another explanation than that he's played an incredible amount of football in his fine career and his legs have gone, I don't see how it gets any better. We would absolutely be much better off playing a talented youngster like Pereira more, or buying an attacker who is in form from a non-CL team who wouldn't break the bank, like Nolito. 

I mean, what's the precedent here? Who is the last major European team to play a 10, which many teams don't use anymore since it's sort of a luxury anyways instead of a 3rd CM, who provides as little as Rooney has been doing for 3 months now, and still have a good season by their standards/expectations? I'm genuinely struggling.

7761~~~
Not much wrong here. I was also quite confused by his wrestling actions. 

As for the last night - again, this is not a performance you'd expect from the team's captain and top earner. And it has been like this the whole season. I'd be perfectly fine if he was a usual squad player with normal wages and <b>earning his place in the team based on performances like everybody else</b>! The privilege he gets is annoying and is letting the team down big time. 

When we have Mata/Herrera/Shmidfield in full fitness, I see absolutely no reason why he should be in the team instead of them. I understand that the Captain in LVG team always starts, but then please make a better choice when choosing a captain. Captain should be a leader and an example (like Keano said). He does not deserve the armband. 

Testimonial in summer and then I'd have no problem seeing him leave. He must perform miracles during the rest of this season in order to change my mind, that's for sure.

7762~~~
Just doesnt offer enough anymore. As a captain, you'd hope he brings more to the team in such games

7763~~~
Our expectations of rooney are so low at the moment, that a couple of good passes would make it an acceptable game for some people.

Rooney is supposed to be our star player, he's certainly getting paid what only the absolute best get, right now at his best he's performing like a decent midtable premier league player.

7764~~~
That's 300k a week for you.

7765~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

What does this say?

7767~~~
Rooney is among the Manchester United nominees for the FIFA's World 11 for 2015.

7768~~~
He's been nominated for the fifpro world XI

7769~~~
Wow

7770~~~
I know he is persona non grata around here these days with some of his punditry but I agree with most of what Roy said there.

7771~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He scored a hat trick against Brugge... he deserves to be there.....!

7774~~~
So he's not in the running for world player of the year...

But he's in contention for being part of the team of the year.

Right. 

(Completely ignoring that it's a farce and that he wouldn't look out of place in the Scottish PL.)

7775~~~
You have to be joking. At the very least Smalling should be in there.

7776~~~
What in the world is this? All of this is making me hate football. Wayne Rooney nominated for a world 11? I want to laugh, cry, shout, stamp my feet and punch the table. I think this is all a big experiment into human psychology to see how easy it is to make you hate somebody. In this case, take the under-performing, over-paid and over-privileged one, make him captain, force him into the team every single week, never substitute him when he's stinking the place out and then nominate him for awards as though he's your best outfield player.

7777~~~
My thoughts exactly.

7779~~~
He hasn't played well enough to be in contention for a world XI for about 4-5 years. Those things are all about popularity and reputations.

7780~~~
2015 silent domination awards coming up...

7781~~~
He should not be anywhere near the world 11 I agree. Based on this season only DdG and Smalling might deserve it.

However, Rooney was ok yesterday. Good first half. Shit like everybody else in the second half.

7782~~~
Just a few stats from an article on Sky Sports in case people haven't seen it;

* 134 different players have assisted a goal in the PL this year, Rooney is not one of them, despite playing at #10 or #9 for almost every minute of almost every game for a team 2nd in the table
* Rooney has been involved in (contribution to goalscoring move at some point) less than half the amount of goals Herrera has in over double the amount of playing time
* Rooney has created 1 chance this season, a number equal too, or lower than, every single one of our back four
* Rooney has managed 2 PL goals this season (one hit him on the line), which is less than Jamie Vardy, Callum Wilson, Odion Ighalo, Andre Ayew, Nathan Redmond and Yohan Cabaye (amongst many others)

That is all I have to say - apart from anybody who thinks that this "slump" is down to "tactics" or van Gaal must be bonkers

7783~~~
Folks who disregard Rooney's current performances as 'nothing to do with why we play like this' are rather irritating. He's not the only reason and no one has ever said that but he's still a massive, massive problem. You can't get away with such a blatant passenger in your side, especially with young players like Depay and Martial who will have 'off-games' themselves. We need a proper leader up there and proper captain overall. 

Even last night, he played better in the first half....then yet again stank the place out in the second. But because the majority of our other players looked poor, he gets let away with it.

7784~~~
feck! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

7785~~~
All part of the "process".

7786~~~
£300k a week right there.

7787~~~
Rooney has never been professional with his body.

When he was younger he was able to get away with partying and not having a proper athletes diet but as he has aged and gotten closer to 30 it was obvious it was all catching up with him.

If he had of had the same attitude as Ronaldo he would have definitely been a much better player than we have seen in the last 5 or so years.

7788~~~
This is incredible really. My expectations of Rooney's performances are very low but this is beyond atrocious.

7789~~~
But if he was played in his best position, or his teammates offered some movement, or we revolved the team around him he'd be a world beater again. There is nothing poor Wayne can do.

7790~~~
Are they sure? I know he's not been great but this is terrible.

7791~~~
He is shite.

7792~~~
that's actually quite funny if true. Our number 10 hasn't had an assist this season? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7793~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I was getting slammed for saying he's a terrible no.10, but don't the facts prove my point? He shouldn't be in the team. Should be getting booed every time he touches the ball.

7794~~~
I'm sure he's laughing..... All the way to the bank!

7795~~~
Man, I think he was absolutely terrible and I still can't believe that. 

Just checked the assist stats, at least that's easy to check, and it's true. What's even worse is that he doesn't have single assist this season in any competition(at least that's what whoscored says).

7796~~~
yeah put his passes to the right wing stats are off the chart

7797~~~
Takes me back to Wednesday night when Blind played that ball out from deep to Rooney in acres of space near the centre line. Rooney had three options. Lingard to his right, Memphis to his left or a throughball to Martial who would have certainly been through on goal... he chose the 30 yard pass to Lingard on the right.

And people wonder why we create so fecking few chances. And I bet Rooneys wondering why he doesn't have an assist.

7798~~~
I really think his level has dropped so low that he would be just as likely to struggle for form in the Chinese Super League or the MLS.

7799~~~
I think getting rid of Rooney will be LVG's last major act as our manager.

Rooney is Mr. Manchester United and England Captain. If LVG froze him out or sold him now it would be the end of him, he knows the press would turn on him and very possibly force him out before he can complete his work, but hes also not blind. He <i>has to </i>see Rooney is playing terribly and looking increasingly unlikely to recover.

I think once LVG's retirement is around corner either this coming summer or the one after, Rooney will be unceremoniously shunted out of the door. It wont be pretty and LVG will be slaughtered in the English press, but most importantly the next manager wont have to deal with it.

7800~~~
This sounds familiar

7801~~~
Hopefully the board wont appoint a complete buffoon next time who begs him to stay!

7802~~~
I was disgusted when that happened. I thought I couldn't have been e only one to notice that. Martial had made an excellent run. Even a non league player could spot and pick that pass.

7803~~~
He has to leave next summer, if this club want to move forward p, they have no other choice.

7804~~~
I think officially the own-goal against Tottenham first game of the season goes down to him as an assist? I think that's the one the stats at the top of this thread are referring to.

7805~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/22vuGVZ.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/22vuGVZ.png"/>

7806~~~
I'm far from a Rooney fan, but let's not forget that before LVG he was always a player that always raked in a lot of assists every season as well as many goals.

It's easy to say that he does feck all these days(which is obviously true), but this applies to our other attacking players too. For example Mata had over 30 assists in his last full season with Chelsea, now he creates feck all, not a single attacking player has performed under LVG in the 18 months he's been here.

When does it stop becoming a player problem and starts becoming a system problem? Look at new players, for example, last year Di Maria came in and started playing really well, then he started understanding "the philosophy" and turned to shit. Maybe it's to early to say, but it looks like the same thing is happening with Martial. 

You cannot express yourself in such a rigid system, where the manager expects you to perform like a robot and never make a mistake, no matter who you are.

7807~~~
Our defenders have more assists than him, Mata has 8 assists this season which is not bad. He's fecking terrible. Van Gaal has little to do with it. Martial is 19 and you kid yourself if you think a dip in form wasn't inevitable. When will people stop giving excuses for his performances. As for Di Maria, that has been done to death.

7808~~~
Not this season........this YEAR!

7809~~~

Creates less chances per 90 minutes played than Fellaini, and scores almost half as many goals per 90 minutes played as Mata, Lingard and Herrera.

7810~~~
Yet I'm hearing on Tv about how he's lost the legs to play centre forward but can still be a top class number 10 because apparently his passing, distribution and football intelligence is all there. Question is, where is it?

7811~~~
Mata's assist figures from his last full Chelsea campaign are very misleading because he played about 65 club games that season. To better compare his raw assist numbers - he had 24 scorers in 35 League games at Chelsea vs 7 scorers in 13 League games for United this season; or 11 scorers in 15 games in Europe for Chelsea vs 3 scorers in 5 games in Europe for United this season. The numbers are pretty comparable, and he's doing it without Hazard, Lampard and Oscar who were all really good that season, to go with a solid set piece setup, and even Torres who ended up scoring 20+ goals.

7812~~~
Agreed, half the pundits say he's better at no 10, the other half at no 9, maybe he's just no longer any good at either.

7813~~~
I don't disagree that he is better as a number 10 now but this idea that his passing and technical game is supposedly of a very high level is silly.

7814~~~
I still have hope that this might just be a period of bad form and not a permanent decline but he needs to be dropped asap. How much difference that will make I'm not too sure given pretty much every attacking player aside from Martial and perhaps Lingard have either been painfully average or complete shite (Rooney and Depay).

7815~~~
I don't think Rooney has ever been a #10, I actually don't believe he has much if any of the "football intelligence" we are often told he has. I think he has helped create the myth of him as a #10 but I have never seen any evidence that he can play the role effectively

7816~~~
I think we will only be allowed to conclude he's finished is if he and England flop at Euro 2016. The press will do a 180 on him, if England do relatively well then he may survive being a passenger and Van Gaal's system will be blamed. 

Until then many will find a reason, I don't want to outright accept that's he's finished but the evidence is mounting.

7817~~~
I'm seriously fecking tired of people talking about some hypothetical press "backlash" if LVG drops Rooney. Bollocks. Half the press now, at least the press that doesn't reside in the fecking gutter, are openly questioning why Rooney continues to start. Latest is this piece in the Telegraph..

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/12019576/Manchester-United-fans-have-taken-Louis-van-Gaal-to-their-hearts-but-the-well-of-goodwill-is-running-dry.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...-but-the-well-of-goodwill-is-running-dry.html</a>

"Rooney, indeed, is the elephant in the room as the inquest into United’s failings intensifies. Van Gaal has openly conceded that his leader is afforded certain privileges, and only Rooney’s most ardent apologists could say on present evidence that he deserves to be in the starting XI. It is tempting to conclude that one of United’s better performances of late, the 2-1 win at Watford, arose from the fact that he was not playing"

Now I'm no fan of the Tory Telegraph but if you want decent, informed, insightful opinion stop taking your cues from the tabloids and aim a bit higher. Any press that isn't marketed at plankton is telling it like it is..

7818~~~
Just makes it more curious as to why LVG is 'affording' him these privileges? What's going on? Is it the money men and marketing malarky that's preventing him from dropping his arse? It's obvious he must know Rooney is dire and causing problems. His job will be on the line if he persists with Rooney and we end up in a bad position in the league. So why not drop him to at least save your job or to make it easier? It is a great mystery to me. Surely it can't be he thinks he'll lose the dressing room? Surely most of the players must know that Rooney is a hindrance to them, no matter how 'nice' he is off the pitch? I can't understand this situation at all.

7819~~~
It's his last job. I know he wants to go out with a bang, but is it really any skin off his nose if Wayne is playing badly and we don't do well. He will leave and say he tried his best.

7820~~~
Well we know not to listen to you.

7821~~~
Other than the bottom 4 clubs, he's probably the worst player in the league this season

7822~~~
There have been players in all four of the bottom clubs that have played better than him, much better.

7823~~~
This is like the old Pogba thread,people keep repeating the same things over and over again.

7824~~~
Easily worst player in the league. If it was someone else in other teams, they would drop him by now, Rooney keeps on playing every matches.

7825~~~
He has been poor, and poor for a while but come on mate, worst player in the league? I seriously don't get the reactions of some football fans.

7826~~~
Once he's past the level of being good enough for us..... Who cares?

7827~~~
With all the injuries today he is going to have to get his arse in gear and actually attempt to create something for himself. Any chances that do come his way will have to be taken. This is the sort of game that will show what sort of captain he is. We could be under the cosh for long periods. I have a suspicion that Chris Smalling will show himself as more of a captain.

7828~~~
I was questioning your point regarding him being easily the worst player in the league....

As poor as he has been and looks like he could continue that way, he is a United player and one that given the chance, can score goals. Something we kind of need.

7829~~~
yeah there's no room for sentiment if you want to be successful

we managed to carry the likes of Ando for a few years because we didn't use him or rely on him

with Rooney its the opposite - he's offering very very little and is in probably the key position in terms of creating chances and goals....along with his tactics another Van Gaal masterstroke <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7830~~~
For me he embodies everything that is wrong with the club at present.

Too accepting of mediocrity.
Too slow to react.
Too willing to take the easy option.
Completely lacking of impetus.

Fans are also to blame. One Wednesday night I saw yet another performance by our most experienced forward player, our 'talisman', who didn't create chances and once again didn't look like scoring yet there were plenty of people saying he had a good performance. 

Currently the bar is set so low, with so many just accepting it.

7831~~~
It wasn't my point. (That was another posters) My point is he's no longer good enough to play for us, I'm more interested in who we should replace him with.

7832~~~
Exactly, I'm not concerned with who he's as poor as, I'm hoping that we can get a replacement in January, as unlikely as that  is. ( we've bigger fish to fry)

7833~~~
My bad mate on that first point (another reason for avatars guys).

Who we can replace him with is in the future, we have Rooney now and he is going to play. He should have our support in my opinion. Yes, the future needs to be seriously considered but we have games to win now and Rooney is a player that as bad as people think or want him to be (yes many do want him to perform badly) can produce for us.

7834~~~
Barring a very small minority every wants him to do well. But he appears to simply not be good enough anymore. And a footballer keeping his relevance in the team due to past glories isn't exactly endearing to the fans. If  he begins playing to the minimum acceptable level consistently, he could probably stay at the club as long as he's willing to be a squad player, but I don't see how a footballer performing at this level can continue being this "mega star status" player he currently. I don't think I've ever seen such a discrepancy between ability/performances and squad status. It's as if he's part owner of the football club. So yeah, as of now, get rid of him in the summer.

And with Rooney you can't help but look to the future, because the present is so dreadful.

7835~~~
I think we're flogging a dead horse. Continuing to try and find a way of using a player who's lost the reaction time to play at the top level, isn't going to bare fruit in my opinion.

7836~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2015/2016/wayne_rooney/165/165/73/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/scott_sinclair/165/165/819/32/p|premier_league/2015/2016/callum_wilson/165/165/15153/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/jermain_defoe/165/165/77/45/p|premier_league/2015/2016/georginio_wijnaldum/165/165/7968/0/p#goals_scored/shot_accuracy/pass_completion/successful_take_ons#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...curacy/pass_completion/successful_take_ons#90</a>

How he compares with the top scorer of the bottom 4 clubs, goals/shot accuracy/pass completion/successful take ons.

7837~~~
I don't think he is a very good #10 either, but he was our best player in the 10/11 title & CL run-in, playing as a 10 behind Chicharito. He was unbelievable in that role for several months, winning us many games and carrying us at times. He is a different player now, however.

7838~~~
They should blame van Gaal, not Rooney for that.

7839~~~
How do you measure 'lost the reaction time to play at the top level'? If he scores a goal today and sends us top (which lets not kid ourselves, he is still capable of) does the reaction time argument go on the shelf for a week until the next non productive game?

I see you point and somewhat agree but bold statements like worst player in the league, can't play at the top level (general statements made by many) are just wrong and don't give the topic much perspective.

7840~~~
My anger has turned squarely on Van Gaal for this situation. He looks like a player begging to be dropped

7841~~~
They do. And they suggest he sells him in the summer.

7842~~~
But why does Rooney get hate for van Gaal playing him?

7843~~~
Law of averages means he'll be in the right place at the right time at several times during the season. Should he be there to benefit from it? I'm sure several of the youngsters played and played, irrespective of form will score an important goal for us. The reaction time is why he's slow, immobile, and unable to bring a ball under control quickly.

I'll sing like a canary in the sunshine if Rooney scores today, but it'll change nothing as far as United's progression is concerned, in fact it'll probably harm us  if Rooney gets another ten games on the strength of it,  whilst LVG procrastinates.

7844~~~
I don't really understand how four months into the season his poor play is still being excused and Van Gaal remains unwilling to drop him. 

Here's Rooney's chances created stats against players that I have read many times are not good enough to play for us.

Rooney - 1.10 Chances created per 90 minutes
Fellaini - 1.37
Milner  - 2.31
Zaha   - 1.72
Ayoze  - 1.31

7845~~~
He doesn't. He gets criticized for his performances.

When people say he's rubbish they're saying he's playing poorly. When people say he needs to be dropped/sold they're talking about what the club/LVG should be doing/should do.

7846~~~
I have seen plenty of abuse aimed directly at him for being selected. I agree that the idea behind criticism is directed at van Gaal but Rooney is the one copping it a lot of the time.

7847~~~
He's not been short of generally poor performances in the last 3 years or so, but he's hit the lowest form of his career this season and it's not a coincidence at all. The tactics might play some part in this, but it's an empty excuse. 

He came, he grew, he peaked and now the almighty fall is happening. He's still a reasonably good player, but he can't cut it at the level we need him to. 

He's not the sole reason for the rubbish football, but there's no excuse for the touch at times. It's dreadful.

7848~~~
<b><i>Louis van Gaal insists he is “very satisfied” with Wayne Rooney’s contributions to Manchester United this season and claims it is not just the captain’s armband keeping him in the side.</i></b>
<i>
Only Sir Bobby Charlton has scored more goals for United than Rooney, but he goes into the trip to Leicester on Saturday evening with just two in the Premier League this season as the club has struggled for goals.

Van Gaal’s philosophy has come in for plenty of criticism, though <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/news/van-gaals-philosophy-dour-for-now-but-rewards-will-come-for-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our feature explained why United fans must stay patient</a></b> with the Dutchman and success will arrive in time.

But Rooney’s form remains a major line of questioning at Van Gaal’s pre-match press conferences, and it was no different on the eve of the Leicester game.

But United’s manager was again unequivocal in his backing when asked whether Rooney would still be picked if he was not skipper.

“Yes, of course,” Van Gaal said. “Otherwise he is out of the team. Wayne is doing a lot, has a very great contribution in the team. I am very satisfied with him.”

Rooney has been switched between No 10 and an out-and-out striker’s role this season, and Anthony Martial was preferred up front for the midweek draw with PSV Eindhoven.

“At this moment, he doesn’t play in the striker’s position, Martial is playing there,” Van Gaal said. “But it is possible he shall play other matches there.

“It is dependent not always on the quality and shape of the player at the moment, but also the game plan. And we have to decide that every week.”

Taken from Teamtalk
</i>
I'd really like to know what he is doing that is keeping van Gaal satisfied. What can it possibly be, footballing wise? This team seems to ghost through difficult periods in games, no intent, no evident leadership and he is our captain. The only late rally we've had was against Watford, and he coincidentally didn't play. So I question his leadership.

For footballing reasons I obviously can't see it, he gets wrestled of the ball easily, can't turn with it, lacks vision for through balls or the left flank.
No nous for intricate one-two passing. He seems to be totally the opposite player for van Gaal's philosophy yet he is his favorite player! It's just lunacy.

There is no footballing reason to keep him in, Herrera is better, Mata is slightly better, you could try Memphis and Martial together, That would indicate some hope of improvement, because Rooney isn't even arguably declining anymore, he has declined.

7849~~~
I don't get it. In his 18 months as manager, nothing has shown this to be the case. He wasn't even substituted in his worst ever performance in a United Shirt against Aston Villa. If he is really happy with his performances, then I think we need a new manager.

7850~~~
I just hope this is all a facade from LVG. Noone can think he's made a "great contribution" this season, and noone can be "satisfied" with his performances. 

Care to quote a few posts <i>blaming </i>him for selection? Most of the frustration is one of the highest paid footballers on the planet a) playing like turd and b) constantly picked by LVG despite aforementioned turd-level performances.

Also, you're in a thread called "Wayne Rooney 15/16 performances". It's slightly unrealistic to expect to be containing much other than criticism of his performances.

7851~~~
Although his comments sound odd he can't rightly come out and say 'If he wasn't captain he wouldn't even make the bench' or 'He is captain so he plays but he is a bit sh*t' can he. He has taken a position and whilst he sticks with it he will have to defend it in what he says otherwise it would completely undermine the choice he has made.

I don't agree with his decision but can understand his rhetoric regarding it.

7852~~~
I don't think anyone expects him to say that if Rooney wasn't captain he would be dropped when he's picking him while he is captain.

It's the overall treatment of Rooney that is not borderline but miles past absurd. The whole "Rooney has special privileges" stance, the whole Herrera has <i>one </i>bad game and is dropped but Rooney can stink up the place for 3 months and still always start, these are the things that no fan enjoys seeing.

And forget dropping Rooney which should have been done prior to all these injuries, but beyond that, there's never any criticism of Rooney.

Here's LVG criticizing De Gea:

He called Smalling and Matial's errors "stupid" when they got a red card and gave away a penalty respectively.

But Rooney plays terribly week after week but there's not a word.

The only time he did criticize Rooney was in the beginning of his tenure when he said that Rooney wasn't doing well as a striker and maybe Falcao can be expected to do better, so he's changing positions.

Something has changed since this whole captaincy stuff, though. Rooney has become this untouchable figure only in second half of LVG's short time here. And it's not that people are dying to see Rooney criticized so we all can be happy once and for all. It's the disproportionate importance given to one player in the team.

7853~~~
The issue is that he has decided to make a grossly underperforming player the central figure of the team. Shifting other players roles and positions all over the place just to accommodate him.
He then gets annoyed when the form of this underperforming player is brought up with him.
It's getting to the point where I think he would have had to discuss Rooney less, if he wasn't starting games.

7854~~~
Don't worry I agree. Rooney should not be anywhere near the starting line-up and LVG's decision to make him a fixture of the team reflects badly on him, making me call in to question his overall judgement for all things United.

The point is that if he offered a genuine opinion on Rooney (or lets say an opinion in line with a growing majority of fans) then he would make himself and his 'captain policy' look cretinous. He would find it incredibly difficult to describe all Rooney's faults and yet make his choice to continue playing him appear valid or rational. He is just playing the PR game the only sensible way he can based on his, apparently, fixed choice.

Based on the idea that he is set on playing Rooney, he is best to feign ignorance or play up the idea that he sees something we don't (the great intangible). This way he comes off as a bit mad or "absurd" rather than wilfully self destructive (as he would admitting he is consistently playing a player not good enough to justify his place). It ain't pretty but once he has decided to stick with Rooney it is the logical follow-on.

Your point about other players is true. It is often muted that dropping Rooney would be bad for squad morale, continuing to play him can't be particularly good for it when other players are displaced or seemingly marginalised (if only temporarily) for much smaller failures.

7855~~~
Yea of course, players like Wijnaldum are miles better this year, but there's some serious dross for Sunderland and Villa that he must be better than.

Taking that dross out of the equation was my point - he's probably the worst player for the top 16 clubs.

7856~~~
feck off Louis.

7857~~~
He is just dragging the team down and being no where.near as good as Mata would be playing his position.

I can't honestly see why LvG has not dropped him he is just not good enough simple as that.

7858~~~
christ almighty...

7859~~~
It's those stats comparing him to Scott Sinclair, Defoe, Wijnaldum and Ighalo that are really damming. If he were being outplayed by Aguero, Costa or Kane only you could reasonably argue it's a slump and he will come through it. To be outplayed by 4 average players scrapping for their lives in poor sides leads me to think he isn't even good enough to play in the PL anymore. Honestly if you were a Watford fan would you leave out Ighalo for Rooney? I couldn't

7860~~~
Van Gaal can get fecked. If he's just trying to avoid criticising Rooney then he can say nothing.

But praising him? He makes contributions to the side? Feck off you old fool.

7861~~~
Please get rid. The guy is finished.

7862~~~
Absolute piss take that this oaf is captain over BFS.

7863~~~
Schweinsteiger and Smalling are our leaders on the pitch.

So what, exactly, is Rooney supposed to be doing for us now?

7864~~~
He can feck off for good. Useless. Can't control a football can't run can't dribble and can't shoot. Idiot.

7865~~~
Still shit. Forget the stats, just use your eyes and you can see how Martial is levels above him now.

7866~~~
1/10 performance so far. Yet again.

7867~~~
He needs a month out of the team, his form is awful. Half the reason we don't create chances is because so many moves break down through him.

7868~~~
At least he didn't score an own goal right?

7869~~~
Broken record.  He is finished at the highest level.  The sooner LVG, or anyone else that can make big decisions at our club, realize that truth the better off we can be by moving on.

7870~~~
Get him out on the left.

7871~~~
Worst performance since Arthur Mullard on <i>Top of the Pops</i>.


Well, not really...

7872~~~
our best player today, makes things happen and works his socks off.   <span style="color: #ffffff"> lol</span>

7873~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a joker

7874~~~
I have to say that for the first time I am truly comfortable with saying that Rooney needs to be dropped for an extended period of time from the playing XI. I tend to be on the conservative side with regards to criticising players but Rooney's performances over the last few weeks have convinced me that he's the biggest problem we have in our attack.

7875~~~
He can get a new career in wrestling entertainment, no need to drag the team down

7876~~~
He's absolutely appalling. Our attacks die when the ball reaches his feet, we'd be better off if he got sent off and we played with 10 men.

7877~~~
Crap again. Not that it matters to him. He has nothing to play for whatsoever. Guaranteed a spot as the boss is up his arse.

7878~~~
Has he done anything of note at all? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7879~~~
It's like watching Gary Neville in his final season. He's lost absolutely everything; he can't pass,  can't shoot,  can't run,  can't jump, can't press and in all honesty I think he has a major problem with his eye sight as he relentlessly tries to pass through an opposition player 2 yards in front of him.

It's like playing with 10 men week in, week out. Actually no... It's like playing with 10 men against a team of 12.

7880~~~
End of November and no sign of improvement...

7881~~~
Pissed quite many people off, an achievement that's not all that easy to achieve.

7882~~~
Honestly don't know what I was smoking when I said he wasn't past it, I really thought he would have a decent season. Back in the day when he was playing shite, at least he would get a goal. His performances have been ridiculous at times.

7883~~~
Golden Blunder should apologise for his thread. Still can't believe why some are so loathe to admit he's finished.. and then people wonder why LVG takes so long to drop him. Half our posters are blind as bats when it comes to this fat feck.

7884~~~
He's finished. Terrible player now would struggle to get a game at a mid table club.

7885~~~
What a day: Vardy beats Ruud's record of goals, and Rooney beats Lineker's record for shit on the pitch.

7886~~~
He really is shit, isn't he?

7887~~~
Its sad to see, but he is clearly finished at this level, Ferguson knew he was on the way out the season before he left. If Ferguson was still here make no mistake Rooney would be gone and certainly wouldn't be captain.

7888~~~
A disgrace he still starts games and plays 90mins.

7889~~~
Hopeless so far.

7890~~~
let down by his team mates, manager, tea lady, milkman again

7891~~~
Lost for words how to describe what Wayne has become.. A Wayne half the player he once was would still be useful.. This Wayne is just utter shite.

7892~~~
He wouldn't struggle, if his name wasn't Wayne Rooney he would struggle to get into some Sunday league sides, especially when you consider in the lower leagues the games are more about the physical side.

7893~~~
He's been as bad as he was at Villa Park when he genuinely looked like he'd never played football before.

Any other player this bad for this long would have long been dropped.

7894~~~
I agree he had been bad but how has he been any worse that the rest of the team. Looks like the entire team is being played out of position.

7895~~~
It's looking like he won't become our all time top scorer at this point.

7896~~~
Looks like he has gave up. If it wasn't for that armband i'd never guess he's our captain.

7897~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7898~~~
I thought he was a shoe-in but at this point it doesn't look likely, does it?  Amazing that.

7899~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I had completely forgotten about the record.

He'll be doing well to break it, that's all I'll say. He doesn't fecking deserve to break it based on this season, put it that way.

7900~~~
How long before that's the next excuse? Sir bobby is making him play badly to save his record?

7901~~~
Good!

7902~~~
The article in the Telegraph made the suggestion that Rooney's constant inclusion was because of the political power that he holds within the squad. ie. Drop him and he could rebel and bring half the dressing room with him, like what happened to Moyes. So LVG has a vested interest in keeping him sweet.

7903~~~
Fecking shit how bad is this..  His worst performance ever..  Terrible terrible terrible.

7904~~~
Just what will it take for him to be dropped? I honestly can't think of what more he can or can not do for the manager to see that he's nothing but a liability and that he absolutely doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the first XI.

7905~~~
Now that Keane has said something I wonder if it opens the door for other pundits to have a say.

7906~~~
About fecking time!!

7907~~~
Woah! What's this?!

7908~~~
Injured wasn't he?

7909~~~
Don't get our hopes up.

7910~~~
Seemed to be pulling at his boot in the dugout with some attention from the trainer. Praying it was a tactical substitution.

7911~~~
Which half? There have to be quite a few players that would like to have his spot on the pitch. Maybe some of the english players want to keep him there, but it's hard to believe that there are enough of them to start a rebellion.

Everything comes back to Ryan Giggs imo -- him sitting there on the sidelines like the spider in LOTR, waiting to take his spot as manager with no obvious qualifications. He is one who wouldn't want a meritocracy to suddenly sweep thru Old Trafford.

7912~~~
likely that knock he took getting clattered infront of goal

7913~~~
Fingers crossed he is out for quite a time. We looked three times the team when he was off

7914~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7915~~~

7916~~~
Hilariously bad yet again. That's what, at least 15 awful games out of 20 now, along with 4 mediocre and 1 good game (against Brugge)

Still starts every week.

7917~~~
Another very poor performance. Offers no threat, no presence, looks sluggish for someone in a passing team, and just looks poor all round. LVG actually taking him off suggests that he's surely seeing it himself.

7918~~~
We looked better when he went off.

Just like how we looked better without him before Herrara got injured against Watford.

Surely not a coincidence.

7919~~~
He is shite.

7920~~~
Not as bad as his performance against Villa away this season.

7921~~~
No white text? 

He's been poor but so has the rest of the team. Rooney is just this seasons scapegoat.

7922~~~
Looked way better when he went off. He is past it

7923~~~
A shame Fergie didn't continue for one more year, then we would not have seen Rooney at the club anymore and with £40M to spend on players who care.

7924~~~
We weren't great when he went off either, but we did improve a bit. We need to get this guy out of the team and make a signing or two in January.

7925~~~
No the rest of the team wasn't. Basti was way better. Smelling was way better. Martial was way better. Delay when he came on was better. He was probably the worst out there today and not for the first time either. Our best earner of the club better gets sold asap

7926~~~
Was he complaining when he substituted?

7927~~~
No, he isn't. A scapegoat would be someone who is used to detract from other poor performers. As it stands, plenty of players are getting criticised; Darmian, Young, Carrick etc, while the manager is coming in for hefty criticism too.

Our team has been poor, but Rooney has been one of the worst performers. Surely if a team is playing poorly, the first players you criticise for the poor performances are those who are playing poorly?

7928~~~
Can you seriously not see it? He has been awful, 2 league goals and no assists and we're nearly in December. If we're not creating anything maybe he's a reason why.

7929~~~
Some of his "passes" were abysmal. Talk about killing rhythm and movement.

7930~~~
Hope that was his last appearance for us.

7931~~~
It's part of the problem with our supposed possession game. For all of the possession we have and the passes we make, players like Rooney just don't suit the system at all. He's always been more of a direct footballer than a passer, but the fact that he's playing some of his worst football magnifies the problem.

7932~~~
Rooney isn't just one of the many players being criticized here. You see it a lot on this forum: Rooney is holding us back, drop him and play Martial upfront etc etc. Blaming all/most of your failures on one player is scapegoating.  

Then I disagree with you. Apart from Smalling they were all poor.

7933~~~
He's so ineffectual. Isolated a fullback on either side twice and the end result was the worst attempt at a cross that ended straight in Schmeichel's hands and the other was the worst dive I've seen in a while.

7934~~~
Can I not see what? We're not playing poor because of Rooney. Rather, the whole team is playing poor including Rooney.

7935~~~
Yes, he is! Go to the Carrick thread right now. You'll see people criticising him. Darmian is being slaughtered in his thread. Young is being heavily criticised. As is Mata. To suggest he's the only one being criticised is nonsensical.

7936~~~
He's just not that good anymore.

It's clear that he's declined and he's shot. 

He was a superb player for us, but his time is up.

7937~~~
It makes sense don't you think ? I mean Rooney plays on the pitch like he's our best player, he has special privileges and is our striker (a very important position at the club).

7938~~~

7939~~~
Can't wait to hear how Scholes, Merson and the rest explain that.....

That was awful...

7940~~~
This is what puzzles me. The players must see he's holding the team back. I cannot believe people in a competitive environment would be unhappy if he's dropped. We obviously not great at the moment but did look better after he went off. I just can't get my head around it. Weird.

7941~~~
People aren't saying we're shit because of Rooney. They're saying we're poor <i>and</i> Rooney is fecking shite and isn't helping us play any better. It's pretty obvious.

7942~~~
Not his fault mate. Apparently. 

Bad tactics. Crap manager. The fact our other strikers are young blokes finding their feet and aren't prolific apparently proves that it's the system at fault.

If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, chances are....

He's finished and has been for months.

7943~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YVrxFmheSc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Someone posted this before about Rooney. It's so apt.

7944~~~
The funny thing about Rooney is, he manages to look terrible in contrast to his team mates, who were not necessarily lighting things up out there. Would he have glided pass people like Martial did on a few occasion, would he have done the double touch thing Schweinsteiger did towards the end of the game, would he have managed that flick/back heel pass Memphis made for Young?

He was just not anywhere close to resembling a Premier League footballer, let alone one who captains the one of the bigger clubs in the league.

7945~~~
Anyone got a gif of that toepoke straight to the keeper that was meant to be a cross? I was looking forward to the replay but sky wouldn't oblige. I actually laughed out loud at it

7946~~~
Lineker shat just once, Rooney did it 11 times in a row, so he beats Ruud's record too in some way.

7947~~~
Everton away was good.

7948~~~
Just awful. Offering nothing whatsoever.

7949~~~
The pass accuracy is probably an improvement. Yaaaay!

7950~~~
Is he even playing anymore?

Big Rooney fan but I think his best days are either behind him or Van Gaal is strangling the life out of his ability.

7951~~~
Van Gaal: <i>Wayne Rooney was limping and that is why I changed him. I already wanted to change one of the strikers because they were not always running in behind. There were some times when if we were quick we had space to do that but we didn't so that is why I wanted to bring Memphis in. Maybe I would have changed Martial.</i>

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

7952~~~
I said it was due to injury. I'm kind of losing patience with LVG if this continues. Moyes had no clue what to do, this guy just wont

7953~~~
I hope LVG is just saying that in public to not let the papers start a lot of speculation because surely he can see how bad Rooney was?

7954~~~
Awful, we will have at least another year of this dross as well. Sooner he is gone the better.

7955~~~
We can't expect to improve in our overall attacking until he's permanently dropped. I agree he's only part of the problem but all the others have potential to improve, he isn't in bad form exactly, he has just declined. That's so obvious looking at his performances.

7956~~~
Reminds me of Robson in his last season, literally looks on his last legs in a football sense. Absolute dire again, we are carrying him week in, week out. Its criminal that he hasn't been dropped.

What amazes me is none of the ex Fergie clan will criticise him or highlight how bad he currently is and how detrimental it is to the team.

7957~~~
Think that might of been me, although I tend to use that a lot <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

But yeah, we're all beginning to sound like broken records here. The evidence is growing that he's not go it anymore.

7958~~~
We did alright against Liverpool and Watford without him, we should just try him on the bench for a few games and see what happens.

7959~~~
No one is taking his pathetic toe poke at Kasper seriously enough to count it as a "shot" on target <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

If being the captain makes a player undroppable, then make Smalling the captain.

7960~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I forgot about that one.

7961~~~
Imposter of a star player.

7962~~~
He doesn't have a single assist so far this season.

7963~~~
Correct. Also in a team where we have 3 players that are tasked solely with the attacking side of our game (Rooney, Martial & Mata), having one who is completely ineffectual in every respect isn't just one bad performance, if effects everything. 

Imagine if De Gea couldn't catch the ball or Smalling couldn't head a ball... It wouldn't just be a bad performance,  it would cost us game after game. Attackers are the same even though it's much more subtle. Rooney not being able to pass, shoot or control the ball has far reaching consequences. 

You can blame the lack of chances, but when one third of the people tasked with creating those chances are playing like they've won a competition...

7964~~~
When was his last assist? Can't remember. Was it this year?

7965~~~
Surely the Rooney issue will be addressed in the summer, if not in January.  At the moment we just don't really have a lot of good alternatives.

I wonder how Rooney will exit - phased out of the team gradually like Stevie Me or a clean break and leaving the club soon?

7966~~~
Alot of members on here don't seem to grasp this.

It always goes back on Van Gaal for why Rooney is so poor. Forgetting that Rooney is one of the players (given his position on the pitch) tasked with creating chances. Van Gaal is a nightmare at the moment but the Rooney issue is totally separate as far as his performances go.

Nevermind the fact he constantly demands the ball and drops deep (stupidly) to get it if it's not coming to him.

7967~~~
Hes only a year older than Vardy as well. He gets worse every game, his first touch is so good that his second is a tackle and we play better without him in the team with his predictable "OMG what an awesome ball out to the wing" style.

7968~~~
Exactly. People defend him by saying we don't create any chances but he is one of the players supposed to be creating them!

7969~~~
No way any top club would take him given his wages, it would all be down to Rooney and whether he fancies a new challenge in America, Qatar, or China, I would say no, and he'll see out his contract with us, so once again Rooney has all the power.

7970~~~
His performances are laughable. 300k a week, holy fecking sweet Moses. I am in the wrong business. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7971~~~
We can easily afford to pay out the remaining contract . If the club wants to, it will. Especially with the windfall from the new premier league deal. 

I'd prefer a Keane like exit. Swift and unexpected.

7972~~~
I think it depends which striker we try to sign next summer. We spent this summer trying to get Muller which was unrealistic, if we bring in a striker or two to compliment Martial next year Rooney's days could be numbered. When the press turn on him after the Euros he might want to go somewhere new anyway.

7973~~~
We need the Glazers and Ed to wake up and realise that we're going nowhere with him. They will just have to bite the bullet and pay him off. Part of the problem is that even though Moyes sanctioned his contract extension, Woodward was the one who approved it. I'm not sure he fancies explaining himself to shareholders and Glazers if we have to pay out such a huge fee to get rid of Wayne. I wonder if this is the real problem. Maybe LVG's loyalty is not to Rooney but to Ed?

7974~~~
I'd get rid of both.

Wayne Rooney's performances for England haven't been good for at least a year or so now. And they have a completely different philosophy to the one United have. Rooney's problems go far more than Van Gaal.

7975~~~
He could convince them to sell ADM for a loss after just one season.

Woodward helped the Glazers in their 2005 buyout, he's a trusted ally, and I doubt that would change because of this Rooney issue.

7976~~~
I guess so but we would lose far more money paying Rooney off than we did in the ADM deal. I mean £300K a week for the next 3.5 years? We could find a buyer for ADM, but we won't find a buyer for Rooney. We'd make absolutely nothing back. That to me is a different scenario. But who knows really.

7977~~~
Think of it another way.

Keep a struggling Rooney as a guaranteed starter for the next 3 years, and I cant see us challenging the big teams especially in Europe.

The contract and its length, were a terrible business decision, but they are a sunk cost.

7978~~~
Makes sense. So I guess we just wait for Ed and the Glazers to wake up and realise he's not what we need going forward. Hopefully, it won't take too long for this to happen. I hope LVG is playing him all the time to show the money people how much of liability he is... well I can hope as I cannot find any rational argument for this strange love in.

7979~~~
Feck sake, that attempt at a cross with the outside of his foot that ended up straight at Schmeichel <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That made me laugh, but what really pissed me off was the failure to play a simple 5 yard pass that would have put Mata one on one with the keeper.

7980~~~
You guys are so fickle, put him up top and he'll get you 30 goals guaranteed.

7981~~~
Awful yet again, no real effort either, just looked disinterested.

7982~~~
think you posted in the wrong thread

7983~~~
My personal highlight was a miscontrol (on the left wing) where the ball literally bounced over his head after his first touch.

7984~~~
I liked the header where it hit him in the face and bounced miles wide.

Or the bit where even his diving was shit.

7985~~~
Its not doing him any favours either, especially when Van Gaal has left him as the only senior striker in the team, with much more games than last season.

I have faith that we'll cut the cord soon, financially it will be a hit, but we should absorb that and move on.

7986~~~
Absolute shithouse of a player these days. Wouldn't look out of place in the Championship.

Lets hope his injury keeps him out for the rest of the season.

7987~~~
Hopefully he'll have to see a doctor about that knock van Gaal said he was substituted for. If that doctor is a fan, he'll rule him out for the season.

7988~~~
That interview from LvG is just infuriating. He really wouldn't of subbed him... Just baffling. The teachers pet thing is unprofessional.

7989~~~
I honestly don't believe he dived; as soon as it happened I realised his legs just couldn't keep up with his body. His legs have completely gone.

7990~~~
Also the M.E.N. is saying LvG has said he will be fit for next game. Sorry to dash hopes.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7991~~~
So Van Gaal was going to keep him on? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You have to laugh, its just so ridiculous.

7992~~~
At least we know it couldn't have been Rooney that made that comment about being half the player under Van Gaal, at the moment he is nowhere near half the player he used to be more like 5% of the player he used to be.

7993~~~
He's absolute sh*te. How can anyone ever defend him? He offers nothing anymore.

7994~~~
my favourite was the toepoke cross straight to the keeper

7995~~~
My overall rating of 4.1 for Rooney this season is too high. How he's averaging 5 out of 10 in the collective wisdom of the caf I just do not know.

7996~~~
We're literally playing with 10 men.

7997~~~
I think the big problem for the club is that Rooney is the "face of United" commercially - has been since Ronaldo left, and they haven't got a replacement within the club.  They tried to bring in a new one in the summer (Muller, Bale, Neymar) but failed so I think we are stuck with Rooney until we can replace him in this role

7998~~~
You could see once Memphis came on for him and made that chance for Mata and then almost scored himself that with a better player than Rooney playing the first 70 minutes, we'd have very likely gotten the 2nd goal and the win. 

This formation is even worse for him, I think.

7999~~~
Yeah. It would be best for all if he went on loan in January to a team that plays better, more open football and needs a striker since in such a situation Rooney's finishing would probably be enough for him to still be sort of useful. We'd pay some, they'd pay most.  

Then in the summer he can go for a last big paycheque in America or somewhere else, or join Everton or do something else for fun at a massive financial loss.

8000~~~
Rooney, still has about £35m left on his contract. Even we can't afford to pay someone those figures to terminate a contract. I cannot fathom the Glazers sanctioning that.

8001~~~
shit

8002~~~
He is bigger diver than Young these days, yet I don't see anyone mentioning that, while media destroys Young for every diving attempt.

8003~~~
We clearly aren't gong to be terminating his contract ffs. When does that ever happen with one of the main players at a top club? Let alone the fact that we wouldn't ever pay 35million pounds to do so.
Our only hope is some oil rich club is stupid enough good to make an offer. Unfortunately, that's highly unlikely. We are stuck with him for a while yet, and what's worse is our manager refuses to drop him when it's so painfully obvious that he's past it.

8004~~~
This is what I also think is the case. Rooney wont go until we can get someone else who can do this, the problem is getting that player (Like you say Muller, Bale, Naymar) to leave there clubs for ours.

8005~~~
The problem is FFP has forced the oil clubs to invest wisely even if they spend a lot of money.
I honestly think it's part of the reason why the club is so desperate to play him into form. From an economic point of view, they may think they have to make him work.

8006~~~
I feel like my 5.9 rating is being too kind on him. Another awful performance. He just kills any attacking intent we have (which is very little to begin with). Also the media are doing a good job of ignoring that dive. As someone above said, if Young or a foreign player had done that they would be copping it.

8007~~~
We should be looking for replacements for him now, get the replacement in the summer and him out.

8008~~~
It's bad when you look at his performances and consider he's a Manchester United player.

It's completely and utterly unacceptable when you look at his performances and consider he's meant to be our start player / talisman / best player.

8009~~~
If you took away the name he wouldn't start for any side in the league on this form.

8010~~~
I don't think he's going anywhere anytime soon. No one will pay a fee and his wages and I don't see the club just leaving him go. He's here until the last year of his contract, imo.

8011~~~
Time to cut our loses. We'd be paying his wages either way, at least drop him so we dont lose money and pts and hairs at the same time. 

Better to lost 1 then lost 3, he really offers nothing else at the moment

8012~~~
Surely one of the MLS teams has the money to pay him and we can let him go on a reasonable fee.

8013~~~
He's shit at playing football.

8014~~~
He doesn't want it, he wants the captaincy, the fame, the living in england, the club records, he wants everything. 

He can say no to moving and still got the wage for the next 3 years

8015~~~
Where are folks getting their £35m figure from? Even at £300k per week for +-3 years, it's about £11m?

8016~~~
So take the Captaincy off him and sit him on the bench, he'd soon change his mind.

8017~~~
Contract runs until June 2019. That's 183 more weeks. 183 x 300,000 = 54,900,000.

Plus the reported commercial sponsorship rights rolled into the deal, which we don't really know the details of. Apparently he is paid extra for direct involvement with sponsors.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/21/article-2564990-1BB6CAA200000578-586_634x393.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/21/article-2564990-1BB6CAA200000578-586_634x393.jpg"/>

8018~~~
This guy captaining Manchester United is a fecking joke. (Unless he's a fecking star in training and in the locker room.)

8019~~~
His basic wage is not 300k. That's with all bonuses included which clearly he is not activating much atm. I would estimate his basic to be around 200-220k.

8020~~~
The excuse is served on a plate, "Rooney tried his best despite being injured". It's like a lot of medias are under collective hypnosis.

8021~~~
Serious question... Can United buy out his contract?

How much would you pay to have him go away?

United will not win (and I mean the league or the champions league) with him in the line up.

8022~~~
One scenario i find interesting is that if you were Roy at this moment in time... how on earth could you justify having Rooney start over Vardy and Kane?

8023~~~
Its an absolute ball buster, and a similar position to Van Gaal right now. Rooney is the most senior face in the dressing room of club and country and his voice holds a hell of a lot of weight to the point where the cost of dropping him for a superior player has to outway the potential cost of him causing a big rift in both squads. we've seen how important dressing room moral is in sport.

Not that im advocating it at all but the only realistic solution would be an unfortunate long termish injury which would negate the choice having to be made in the first place.

8024~~~
"Vardy now has 14 Premier League goals for the season, a figure Rooney needs the past 15 months to reach".
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8025~~~
He can't justify it, and he either doesn't have a choice or he's deluded as every Rooney supporter in the media.

8026~~~
I agree that this is likely to be a serious consideration, But we are a FOOTBALL club,and not just another business. Its sad that probably counts for quite a lot.

A poorly performing Rooney hurts both his brand and ours though.

8027~~~
We simply do not have the numbers in attack for that though, so i'd keep him and bring an extra foward or two.

What would help us get rid would be dropping him imo. Gerrard at Pool left after that had happened to him, Rooney has shown in the past is that he gets restless when benched, perhaps that could be the trigger for us.

8028~~~
They've sanctioned quite a lot in recent times, and they do trust Ed quite a lot for  such big decisions.he's their guy.

I dont think we'll have to pay Rooney for all of his contract, just the shortfall . Chelsea paid 10 mil to get AVB, then paid 15 mil to get rid,sometimes you just have to grind your teeth through it. Cause either way, this will cost us money.

8029~~~
Pretty sure if we make it clear that he won't get many games here, him and his greedy agent will find a club. If not a transfer, I'm sure some Italian side would love a loan to buy. Those Milan clubs love themselves a geezer.

8030~~~
He isnt going anywhere.
If he doesnt get the record this season, he'll linger around till he does.
And if he does get it, he will score enough to get another season.

Either way, he isnt leaving anytime soon

8031~~~
Vardy breaking records
Rooney breaking the team

8032~~~
If he just wants money, then yes. At the very least we could bench him and play better players. Hopefully he'll be willing to take a paycut or go to the MLS if he's not getting games here.

8033~~~
He's shit and he's still playing, I say we both donate £10 on Saturday if he starts against West Ham.

8034~~~
This, people forget who we are talking about here, Rooney doesn't have the mental strength to sit out a few weeks without throwing his toys out of the pram. I think there might still be time for the January window if we drop him now.

8035~~~
This really rings true and is in stark contrast to several of his own teammates, past and present (RvP and Ander are two that immediately come to mind).

8036~~~
Agreed squire. At least he's been subbed off and that's a start.

8037~~~
A player on the serious decline....

8038~~~
How? There are more than 4 weeks in every month and 52 weeks in a year. To earn £11m in 3 years he'd have to be making £300k a MONTH and that translates into £70k a week. Not a chance Rooney is on that low.

8039~~~
Yep agreed. The amount of money coming in from tv now is insane and if Rooney is deemed surplus it's relatively buttons to pay him off.

One thing is for sure if I was Pep Guardiola and I was being sized up for the manager's role I think I'd be saying "OK I'm in but I won't be needing Wayne Rooney - deal with it please"

8040~~~
He should retire at the end of the season

8041~~~
When a coach of the national team/ex teammate says he is on a decline that is worrying, he's supposed to be our captain and it just seems like he's given up even trying now. He can't even play a five yard sideways pass without giving the ball away, he gets shoved off the ball so easily and doesn't bust a gut to get it back like he used to. He's lost all of his confidence in front of goal now as well which isn't good seeing as we're really struggling in that position.

8042~~~
Subbing him off is a start.LVG is a human he can't be patient forever even if Rooney was his son.

8043~~~
He's absolutely finished.

8044~~~
That sheepish smirk when he makes mistakes shows he himself is embarrassed with how he's playing. Please put him out of his misery and get rid.

8045~~~
Who's going to take him on that wage?

David Moyes is a complete cnut.

8046~~~
He's so painfully shit.

8047~~~
I've said it before but I don't think it's a matter of him not making an effort.

I think he's trying as hard as he can and he's still fecking woeful. That's why he's absolutely finished as a top player in my opinion. 

I could give everything I had playing for Utd and I'd still be shite. Same as Rooney.

8048~~~
Could you imagine this Wayne scoring that overhead kick against City. Getting onto the ball against Newcastle despite chipping away at the referee to volley it into the net. I can't.

8049~~~
It's really sad seeing him like this, but he's got falcao written all over him. He's not suddenly going to get back too how he was. 

In my eyes his fire has gone, he's playing but he's not hungry anymore. His body doesn't have the same strength it once did, maybe he's not working in the gym like he should do. 

It really was summed up when he tried to run passed Fuchs into the box, he dropped his shoulder and then tried to run but just couldn't accelerate, then decided to dive once he thought a challenge would come in. He can't dribble, his short passing and Vision is average, his long range shooting is non existent and his movement is minimal and lack lustre. 

If his name wasn't Wayne Rooney, he would probably be gone this January. It's weird as I said under my breathe "jeez I almost wish he got a small injury he's so limiting these days", then he started too hobble <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> never thought I'd see the day that I would want him out the team, but it needs too happen.

8050~~~
Watching the highlights of City's game with Soton, highlights to me a problem with having such a passenger up front. When City are on the attack, players like De Bruyne, Sterling, Aguero are so dangerous that they naturally cause defenders to gravitate towards them, leaving space for other 'competent' players (full-backs, other midfielders) to take advantage of. 

Rooney doesn't get this treatment. One player will always do the job against him and sometimes, he pretty much marks himself. Martial is the only striker or forward in general that causes this panic (and it's not going to happen every game if he's having a form dip). Mata gets that swarming treatment a bit at times but not to the same extent I admit. 

Rooney isn't the only one not pulling up trees and no one is trying to suggest that but he is comfortably THE WORST up front we have and it's so easy to mark him which is allowing opposition defenders a head start every single match. That's why we need to drop him. I cannot believe that a reserve/u-21 forward couldn't do a better 'job' than him at the moment.

8051~~~
There's only one way out of this,, the cruel way. No way he's going to hold his hands up and leave by his own accord, not when 50m is guaranteed on the table

He probably thinks he earns it and we are obligated to pay him even if we bench him

I dont think he cares so much about keepimg playing top level either,  he'd be 34 by the time the contract ends and he can just retire a legend anyway

8052~~~
Rooney forever! Thanks for the memories.

8053~~~
He really pulled off a big con on the club, his performances are not worthy of 20k a week, what more 200 or 300k/w.

8054~~~
Its problematic to keep him here. For both our sakes(from a non-financial pov), this would be best for both parties.

He can get a fresh start elsewhere, we can finally get a forward of sufficient quality for our stature.

8055~~~
That's the sad part. No one.

8056~~~

Thought he signed a 5 year contract when Moyes was in charge, ergo, 2.5 years would already have lapsed, but fecking hell.

8058~~~
Yep, my bad Sarni! I was using £300k a month and not a week <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8059~~~
I think something has happened behind the scenes already, with him finally being subbed and the recent spate of anti-LVG leaks. I suspect he will be dropped soon.

8060~~~
5.2 average ratings from the caf.... someone must have been jacking his rating by giving him 10, cause I'm sure he got all 3's and 4's mostly

8061~~~
he was subbed only because he was injured. LVG said so after the game, and wanted to take Martial off instead but the injury made his decision

8062~~~
Moyes is the gift the keeps on giving, we are 18 months removed from his shit show here and there are still bombs going off that he planted.

8063~~~
Problem is Van Gaal is still stepping on the land mines instead of defusing them and then doing it again and again.

8064~~~
It's the club's fault, IMO - if they hadn't appointed a manager who'd need propping up via gestures to the fans and senior players, the Rooney extension might not have happened.

8065~~~
I am wondering how it's possible, too. He's been nowhere near a 5/10 player for us this season.

I see we both have him as a 4.1 average for the season. I personally think that's a bit high. 3.5 would be closer to the mark. Would you agree?

8066~~~
I would definitely love to know the truth behind why he wont drop Rooney, some say he's not the sole problem for our crappy attack which is true, but removing him would be a step in the right direction. 

True, we appointed Fergie's replacement for all the wrong reasons and we are still paying for the board's lack of exerting control of that and allowing too many old heads to have their say.

8067~~~
Once we drop him and make it clear that he is no longer our first choice he will find himself a new club, the wages on offer there won't be our concern. A player of his ego is very easy to get rid of.

8068~~~
If you look at his lowest rated game, he got a 5.2 in that. That's not even the Villa match, it's the league cup against 'Boro.

8069~~~
Yep, probably. After all, we're discussing a player who answered SAF's - and his coaches' - statement that he (Rooney) wasn't doing enough by claiming that he <i>was</i>.

8070~~~
The graph seems to show something different... Either way, I think a bunch of Rooney fan boys are padding his numbers after every game. It feels like a split in the club between those who are objective and those who will never criticise the guy.

8071~~~
You do realise he won't leave? Why would he leave a 300k contract for a 70k one unless we pay it off in full first?

8072~~~
He effectively put in a transfer request when he was dropped for the Madrid game and got moved into midfield when he came back. A few months out and he will be gone just like that. He is not the strongest mentally so I doubt if he would be able to out bluff the club on this one.

8073~~~
Park him in the reserves. He'll be desperate to remain the England captain and will take a pay cut at another club. We'll most likely end up having to give him away to the MLS, who will hopefully pay him a higher wage than they would normally as a result.

8074~~~
If it becomes clear that he is no longer first choice do you think he has the mental strength to sit it out for the next three years being ridiculed a la Torres for that period? He won't accept that he's done at this level that easily and will seek a move to prove the doubters wrong, if he is dropped in the next few weeks and fails to regain his spot he will be gone in January 2017.

8075~~~
The club needs to make a decision on this earlier than later. Let's face it, it's almost 90% sure that he's not coming back to an acceptable level, so whether or not they want to - the club will have to get rid. Brace yourselves though, the circus around Liverpool or Rodgers when he tried to freeze out Stevie G will be nothing compared to what will happen with Rooney. Be total bedlam and I don't trust him not to create tension in the dressing room, not to mention the madness in the press, constant leaks etc etc. Maybe that's why LVG is indulging him (nothing else makes sense). The club and the team is still shaky from coming down from the high of being certain of top four to now being vulnerable. It would be one more distraction that I don't think the current team has the mentality to deal with imo.

8076~~~
I find this talk of Rooney's influence being so big that a dressing room that has BFS, Carrick, De Gea and Smalling will be swayed by his attempts to destabilize the ship. Some of them will benefit from his fall; BFS and Smalling the captaincy, Herrera more playing time whilst other forwards would get to play without him hindering their moves, I think the whole dressing room would find LVG's case more acceptable than a has been that's been holding them back. The press would be an obvious problem but if Van Gaal is factoring in the press on team selection then I'm afraid we have the wrong guy steering the ship, he has to go.

8077~~~
It will be like nothing we have ever seen before. But its worth it.

We need to do this now, another season of this too much . Nothing he's shown in the last 3 years consistently is worth 300k.

8078~~~
in recent weeks LVG has said he is sick of answering questions on Rooney. I'm not sure where the backlash would come from, everyone can see he is below par and want him accountable for it. Even on Sunday supplement this morning, they couldn't defend him anymore club and country

8079~~~
if an underperforming and overpaid player leaves us then good for us.

8080~~~
Not for one moment I believe LVG factors in the press - let's face it, if he did then he wouldn't continue with this playing style, after the abuse he gets from the press and people close to the club. I myself would think the players would be relieved - that seems logical. But am actually not so sure. Chicarito was not performing for us when he came back from Madrid - yet there were talks that players were 'unhappy' about his treatment - even if at the time he wasn't actually performing to the benefit of the team. I know his situation is different, but it seems like footballers have a different set of rules that they live by. I don't know, everything about this seems odd to me. LVG demands perfection, yet he's indulging the worst performer in the team. This does my head in because no matter which way I turn it over in my mind, I can't find the logic for this decision. So Rooney must have some kind of influence. What it is I don't know because it defies logic...

8081~~~
Nice to see Sunday Supplement coming around<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Now we just need LVG to do the same<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8082~~~
The English press will turn against him after Euro2016, they love a scapegoat, and seeing his recent England performances,he'll give them plenty of material.

I dont think they mind him doing poorly at United, even if it cost us points.

8083~~~
What did they say about him on the supplement?

8084~~~
I would think if I were his agent I would encourage him to retire or move to the MLS if anyone will have him. The longer he carries on, the more the value of his 'brand' will plummet. It would be a slow painful demise imo. I've read Rooney places a lot of emphasis on money, so maybe the knowledge that he could do further damage to his image might wake him up. I can't think of anything else as no matter the criticism he won't admit that he is doing anything wrong - it's not how he rolls.

8085~~~
Debating whether he should be a starter and if Hodgson has the balls to drop him, asking would you rather have Rooney or Vardy in your team for the Euros. Then one guy admitted he probably shouldn't currently be in the united lineup

8086~~~
he will be expected to hand in the England armband after the tounament, that would be the right thing to do. Don't think he will go quietly though

8087~~~
Hopefully it encourages more critical voices in the media.

8088~~~
LvG could use the press response as a galvanizing tool on the rest of the team, challenge them to prove the media mongrels wrong and create an us vs them mentality.

8089~~~
Call Collymore on Talksport are asking the question about if Wayne should still be in the United team and if should actually be sold. The media are turning.

8090~~~
The only thing stopping Van Gaal from swinging the axe is his ridiculous statement that 'my Captain shall always play'. Rooney won't destabilize the dressing room because the players he cqn influence are on the way up and won't risk everything to fight in his corner when they stand to benefit enormously from his fall, Smalling will likely be named captain, Jones has his own issues to deal with and Carrick has been around long enough to remember Rooney insulting him and other team mates by questioning the club's ambition back in the day.

8091~~~
He's not bad enough to retire imo.

He could still do a decent job as  a premiership player, with his experience too. I dont buy the "He's championship quality " narrative, especially as someone like Jozy Altidore was a premiership striker. 

What he isnt good enough to be though, is the undroppable talisman for a club with United's ambitions. There's no shame in that, and I think a lot of fans would accept him if he was actually dropped when he played poorly. As that is impossible, getting rid is the better option.

8092~~~
Agreed. But LVG suddenly seems to have gone soft in his old age<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

8093~~~
He's gonna be 31 then, quite young to retire from England duty. 

So I can see him clinging to his captaincy.

8094~~~
That's what he is portraying outwardly yes, but the alternative is the current farce we see with Jose and Costa, he could well be keeping his Rooney stance consistent until he has an opening to get rid of him rather than drop him and suffer issues within the camp his discontent could cause.

8095~~~
I'm sure LVG has said things before and then down a 360 degree turn. I don't think saying my captain shall always play is something that he would be bothered about if he had to change that stance. It's trivial in light of the fact that keep playing Rooney and LVG's arse will be on the line. LVG is human, the survival instinct would kick in, especially in the ruthless world of football. I can only think Rooney must have saved a family member's life as there is no reason to carry on like this. As I said before, I'm completely <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

8096~~~
he is older than his age and we already have better options, the public will vent. He isn't ageing gracefully

8097~~~
I hope this is the case. But who knows? Like I've said before, I think the team is not mentally strong, and seems like everything gets to them. i've noticed how hesitant they are playing at home now, when they should know the boos are for LVG - not them. Yet they still seem so mentally frail. The circus that Rooney being permanently dropped would cause would certainly affect them irrespective of whether or not they are secretly relieved. At least that's what I think. Again, I really don't know what to think.

8098~~~
For sure he's not. Never been blessed with the body type of Giggs, nor does he have Giggs' professionalism when it came to keeping his body in tip top shape during his playing career.

8099~~~
It will be depressing if England play the second international tournament in a row with a has-been "talisman" captain while someone like Kane or Vardy is on the bench. It wouldn't surprise sadly me given Hodgson's lack of backbone but, if Van Gaal similarly lacks the balls to make a big decision, he has no place in the United dugout.

I find the whole situation bizarre in any event. At United, Rooney is not a local youth team product, supports Everton (which is fair enough) and has tried to leave United at least once. He has also not played consistently like a genuine elite level player since 2011. For England, he has not performed in a major tournament for 11 years. And yet people are tiptoeing around the decision to drop him like it's a discussion on whether to send the Queen to Dignitas.

8100~~~
It'll depend on how England does, only an embarrassing tournament like the 2014 world cup would lead to the public clamoring that badly for senior heads.

Woy likes him too, so there's always that. 

One thing is true though, the next 6/7 months are huge for him.

8101~~~
yeah, last world cup there was a debate whether he or Sterling should be the 10. Against Italy Sterling ran riot, Rooney played left and we got ragged on the left hand side. Next game Hodgson bottled it and put Rooney back in the middle. People got sick of Gerrard/Lampard for so long, time to give someone else a turn

8102~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8103~~~
I'm not sure if the crowd gets to them or if they are frustrated as they want to respond on the pitch but are afraid of repercussions from LvG. I think dropping Rooney would probably create a huge problem, what I was meaning is sell him and then let the team galvanize without him around at all.

8104~~~
I was actually referring to Gerrard as the has-been captain in Brazil but, as you say, there was definitely an argument for leaving Rooney out of the XI as well. Now that argument has gone from being slightly contentious to blindingly obvious.

8105~~~
I'm not sure that Hodgson's lack of backbone will be the deciding factor; I think the collective nostalgia and hopeful, wishful thinking when it comes to Rooney's form is perhaps the main thing: he burst onto the scene in such a dramatic fashion that people understandably long for the return of that swashbuckling, fearless player even though the signs are far from promising (and, in fact, practically non-existent.) In reality, nobody should be surprised at the current state of play re: Rooney; we signed a steaming hot, fresh pie n' chips typically British footballer...and now we're left with a stale and outdated pie n' chips typically British footballer. So, I suspect that Wayne will keep his places & captaincies unless his form deteriorates to a disastrous level, simply because Roy, LVG and numerous others <i>hope</i> that the new 'old Wayne' will return to replace the current 'old Wayne'. This attitude has little to do with cowardice; it's more to do with a touching sentimentality on one hand and the entire want of pragmatism and common sense on the other. Still, football as a sport isn't exactly renowned for its progressive thinking, and this often costs managers their jobs, as we may well see.

8106~~~
We're fecked.

No one is going to want him when he has yet another terrible international tournament next summer. 

We're doomed to have this thing at our club for the next 4 years <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> .....I've no interest in what he has done in the past. If Eric, Giggs, Keane, Vidic, Ince, Stam, Sharpe, Irwin etc etc phoned in performances the way he has done the last 6 months, I'd be going apeshit too. 

Football is about the here and now. Think ofthe past for too long and you become stuck there...AKA, Liverpool

8107~~~
We are a billion dollar business, Rooney will be removed long before his contract is up, people are making him out to be some sort of of cat stroking Bond villain, at the end of the day the media will turn and he'll be given a golden handshake by United and head off to the US.

8108~~~
Hope so. To be honest, I've no time for him since the League Cup game and his behaviour

8109~~~
I think that's where we have been for the last few years - hoping against our better judgement that we will see the old Rooney back (by which I mean the 2010 version rather than the boy wonder). And there was at least some basis for that belief as we saw the occasional glimpse of class - last season for example in his effortless finish away to Arsenal in that smash n' grab result or his impressive all round performance at home to Newcastle - even if it was surrounded by increasing spells of mediocrity. But, after the last 4 months of this season (in which his performances can only be categorised as "disastrous"), surely cold hard logic has to extinguish any remaining sentimentalism towards "the White Pele", even in a sport so prone to romantic guff as football? We are not even talking Torres levels of decline - it's the full Falcao.

8110~~~
I'm sick of the sight of him as well, he just lumbers around arguing with the ref from time to time, in the past when it was merely form you could still rely on maximum effort, these days he looks shagged out after 20 minutes.

8111~~~
Then there are the commercial factors too, of course. Doh.

8112~~~
I think they are overstated at this point as well, wasn't he not even our best merch seller in the latest list that came out?

8113~~~
He'll go back to Everton to see out his career. They'll welcome him back and he'd love to rejoin them.

8114~~~
The armband thing done it for me that night. No time for him since. 

Couldn't be anymore like Steven Gerrard if he tried

8115~~~
Yeah, maybe so, mate. Though I noticed that Wayne is front-and-centre of the club's <i>2015 Annual</i> in many book catalogues' children's sections...<i>The Lack-of-Hunger Games</i> might've been a more appropriate title though.

8116~~~
Who's he going to displace? 
Lukaku at no.9 or Barkley at no.10?

8117~~~
Would Everton be able to afford to pay him even if we gave him a £10M going away present? Plus I don't see him getting in their team these days.

I forgot about that, he took it off whoever had it when he came on, right? Did he actually give it to anyone when he came off yesterday?

8118~~~
First thing he done when he came on that night and the only thing he done, except miss a penalty <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

I don't know. I didn't see anyone wear it but, I also didn't see him have it on when he came off <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

8119~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'd trade him for Jennifer Lawrence up front for us as well! I'm sure right now he still figures into anything we do marketing-wise as he's captain and a world name, but the club won't sacrifice success for that money as we stand to lose more continuing as we are than that kind of merch brings in. Man Utd are bigger than any player and I believe the player is made a star by playing for the club in most cases, we can replace him easily enough on posters and books etc...

8120~~~
That might have been an even lower point than the Villa and Leicester displays come to think of it.

That remains a mystery then, still haven't seen anything concrete on where the armband went.

8121~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8122~~~
Deplorable isn't it?!

8123~~~
He would ruin Everton's style of play. He wouldn't start for them.

8124~~~
Rooney + 35m for Lukaku? I doubt even that'll suffice, to be honest. We might have to further sweeten the deal by paying a portion of his wages.

8125~~~
He probably would. I don't think that he is good enough to start at Championship.

He has been comfortably the worst player in EPL I have seen this season, and one of the worst I have ever seen.

8126~~~
Yeah it was pretty bad. I myself can't remember where the arm band ended up yesterday. Completely missed that. 
But his behaviour is not so surprising if we're honest. Do you remember after that group match they played during the world cup in South Africa? The team and him especially had played really bad and our fans booed or something. He turned to the camera and made that statement about the fans lack of support (I can't remember the exact phrase he used). I'm not being RAWK but I felt truly embarrassed. He frankly started to lose me from then. The fans who have mostly no money have spent what they probably can't afford and gone to South Africa to support the team and he thought it was a good idea to have a go at them?
Footballers nowadays are really like major hollywood actors - completely devoid of reality and insensitive to people who don't have their good fortune. Sorry, but I don't like that kind of behaviour.

8127~~~
The problem is, I don't really believe many Everton supporters want him back. Maybe I'm wrong but that's the impression I get...

8128~~~
All this and the fact he gets his eyebrows done

8129~~~
And botox! Don't forget the botox!<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8130~~~
He doesn't, does he?

8131~~~
He's an ugly beggar, botox won't change that.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8132~~~
That's what I've heard. Tbh have a look at his face next time round. It's looking stranger and stranger - definitely having some kind of 'procedure'.... though as <span style="color: #ff4d4d"><a class="username" data-user="60388, @DomesticTadpole" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/60388/">@DomesticTadpole</a> </span><span style="color: #404040">it's not exactly doing much good<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/></span>

8133~~~
He's obviously evolving into something or other.<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

8134~~~
Rooney isn't the only underperforming player in the final third but as the captain and top earner he deserves more stick than the rest.

Players like Herrera and Memphis have been criticised by the manager and dropped from the team for a missed pass.

8135~~~
Isn't this a slight problem with this manager, he will pick them up continuously on the slightest little nit picking thing. Maybe he should praise something they have done well for a change. I think he is decimating the players confidence.

8136~~~
According to the oracle of cosmetic surgery he's had those injections for sure. Girlfriend said that without me asking, she just looked at his image when I had it up on my ipad. " He's had Botox" came her voice from behind me.

8137~~~
Seems like it<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
Well we can't say he doesn't provide some entertainment, what with doing his eyebrows and getting his botox.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously, when you think of past United captains - all tough bastards - and then you think of Rooney and his beauty treatments<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

8138~~~
There you go. My eyes were not deceiving me..

8139~~~
And they give us stones in return <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

8140~~~
He's a footballer not a model. A model for toby jugs maybe.

8141~~~
I can't see why he'd need Botox, tbh. It's probably a case of Colleen pushing him through the door of the Liverpool salon she frequents:

WAYNE: "But I don't want Botox, Mum...I mean, Colleen."
COLLEEN: "Just get inside, yer daft lump. I'm not havin' people saying that I only went out with you 'cos you matched my crocodile-skin handbag."

8142~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8143~~~
Gary Neville was spot on with his criticism after Rooney failed to make a simple pass to play Mata through on goal. He said something along the lines of, "its ok people complaining about Utd not playing attacking football but they actually have a lot of good possession in good attacking positions but the final pass is shocking"

Spot on. Add Ashley Young and Matteo Darmian into the mix and every time we got into threatening possessions our attacks petered out with poor crosses, passes or first touches

8144~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8145~~~
That's why he missed that header yesterday, it must feel like a pound of bacon superglued above his eyes!.

8148~~~
I wonder if he goes to the same salon as Jeff Stelling?

8149~~~
Stop it<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Our Wayne is quite vain though. Surprised most fans hadn't realised this before to be honest.

8150~~~
Or the same butchers?

8151~~~
Or didn't think it was worth messing his hair up

8152~~~
That's just re routed nasal hair, it grows an inch every time he sneezes.

8155~~~
For all the criticisms I could throw at him, I don't think botox is one of them.

8156~~~
He looks permanantly surprised. Probably because he is still in the team.

8157~~~
Looking at those photos, his eyebrows remind me of my girlfriend's after she's had them threaded. Rooney<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

8158~~~
A more... natural explanation.

8159~~~
Depay+Martial

Try them for 2-3 weeks in a row and then see

8160~~~
How do women cope with it all? The sheer barbarity of threading one's eyebrows; I now have horrifying images of human taxidermy in my head.

8161~~~
Apparently it takes minutes, no sweat at all. Let's face it, women are tougher. The shite they go through in the name of beauty<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

8162~~~
But not tougher than our Wayne, theoretically.

8163~~~
Be nice if he showed it out on the pitch...

8164~~~
Something when his eyebrows are more interesting than his football.

8165~~~
The absolute state of it<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Bloody hell, his contract extension got to be the daftest thing the club ever did.

8166~~~
Maybe there was a beauty clause in it, that's why he's having all this work done.

8167~~~
Judging by those photos, there's not much chance of them being dropped either.

8168~~~
Wouldn't surprise me<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Our club is bloody nuts. Always do things the hard way - why I love United<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I was stood pretty much behind where he was warming up before the game yesterday, and was watching the drill where a few of the players play a few short passes and cross it in to Rooney. The amount of times he shinned it wide (from about 8 yards with no goalkeeper) was ridiculous. It was laughable, but worrying at the same time that he was about to lead our attack. He's absolutely finished, of that there is surely no argument now.

8170~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8171~~~
What was the reaction from the other players?

8172~~~
If he's like this in training too I wonder what the other players think of him.

8173~~~
Hodgson will get sacked after Euro 16, so with a new manager it might not be in his hands to cling on to.

8174~~~
Yep. Was evident more then ever yesterday and I think Gary Neville realized that too. We get in a lot of very good positions, and are solid throughout, have very good possession. But that clinical pass, the final ball, final piece of decision making whether it's a cross or cut back, or even pass before the last easy pass, is absolutely woeful. Most of the time the players just don't even attempt it. Our wingers pick up the ball in great positions, 1 v 1, and just turn back the vast majority of the time and recycle the ball. Or just over hit the cross or hit the first man. You look at the other top teams, and compare their final ball with ours, and it's absolutely worlds apart. That's a big reason our attack isn't working I think. Van Gaal has a very functional style, but our wingers are wank. Like mid table quality. 

Memphis is young, adapting to the league, and while he was a good, consistent goalscorer for PSV last season, he was by all accounts still inconsistent. Young does the same thing always and has been our most reliable winger even though his final ball is shocking. Valencia the same, always hits the first defender. Lingard gets in so many good opportunities but ruins what feels like over 90% of them with a bad extra touch, or just bad pass. Mata can't beat a man and doesn't put really put crosses in, or useful ones. He's class on form, and that's why we were actually scoring in September when he was, but he's more the man to pass before the final pass as he does give it to wingers in good positions often. Our fullbacks bar Blind when he played there are hopeless with the timing of their overlapping runs and delivery. Rojo has a good cross on him but he's a center back at the end of the day playing left back. 

Compare our wingers/fullbacks attacking wise to Arsenal, City, Bayern, Barca, Madrid... That's where the biggest difference is I think. Arsenal have Sanchez, Monreal on the left, Bellerin and then Ozil drifting around. All are very good attacking wise and have very good decision making and create loads of chances for them. City have Silva drifting, De Bruyne who is very reliable with his final ball, Kolarov who has a great left foot, and Sagna who is a good crosses at right back. Barca, Bayern and Madrid are obviously streets ahead in this regard. 

United in the past had Giggs, Nani, Valencia (on form), Evra, Rafael, Ronaldo, Beckham, Neville, and then players like Young as the back up who we were all frustrated with, but is now our best winger. Shaw played a big part for us but he unfortunately broke his leg. He was one of the only ones in terms of the players who play wide to consistently be a threat that could fit in with the others in our past or other top teams. Martial on the wing is also capable of it, with memphis having the potential but still being to young/inconsistent for now.

8175~~~
He looks like what would happen if Biffa bacon and simon Weston had a baby!

8176~~~
Couldn't really make it out mate because they obviously just turned around and did the drill again, plus couldn't see their faces from the stands, but the Leicester fans found it hilarious!  Looking past the comedy of it, and I know it was only the warm up, but it really showed where he is at the moment.

8177~~~
There were a few guys yesterday saying that the players think that his legs have gone and he trains like a 40 year old. Tbh it was probably just a bunch of lads pretending they were in the know and I don't really believe any of the 'my mates got a contact in the club etc etc', but at the same time you would think that the players probably have the same opinion as we do but probably even more so seeing as they see him close up day in, day out.

8178~~~
Survived after that disastrous world cup, but his decent qualification process may save his skin.

8179~~~
I came on here to give Rooney a bit of stick but after reading the last couple of pages I decided to leave it.
Poor lad.

8180~~~
Think he'll need to get to the semis to survive. Rooney should retire from Internationals and let the younger lads take over but I can't see it happening.

8181~~~
Hodgson says he will leave if not wanted

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32926371" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32926371</a>

This is the Rooney thread, lets stay on topic.

8182~~~
good post....you wonder about Januzaj....he wasn't always productive and his decision making wasn't great but at least he took a man on.....think that's why Lingard has made an impact - his first instinct isn't to recycle the ball

8183~~~
Our best periods of attacking play in the last two matches were when he wasn't on the pitch.

8184~~~
Out for three weeks apparently. (Getting his eyebrows done again probably)

Captain's armband to be left vacant in his honour until he returns (Probably)

8185~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

If he really is out for 3 weeks it will at least be a chance to sort out how much of our shitty attacking play is him and how much is LvG's methods.

8186~~~
Make the most of it because, he'll come straight back into the team after 3 weeks and the whole "he has to play himself back into form" crap will come into play

8187~~~
Oh yeah, for Christmas Rooney will be getting a fresh excuse for his awful performances.

8188~~~
More than anything about his game, it's Rooney dropping deeper and deeper that really annoys me. No idea if he is under instruction to do this but it's so infuriating, we don't need him back there and he does nothing useful. 

He is so slow on the turn I genuinely can't think of a position that suits him anymore, his flaws are exposed whether he plays No 9, 10, or 6/8 as he seems to do a lot. His first thought these days is on how to hold onto the ball, rather than how he can use the ball in an attacking sense.

8189~~~
Nothing performance from Rooney. It's really sad to see how much he's regressed. The guy looks absolutely gassed and seems to have very little left in the tank these days. It's not even as if he's a threat but manages to mess things up every time in the final third. He genuinely is a non entity fairly consistent these days. I can't see any other option for us than to let him go at the end of the season. The club can't afford to keep carrying him.

If he's injured it would be a real shame if Herrera is also out. Would love to see Herrera behind Martial given a good run for a few weeks.

8190~~~
Absolutely no one is paying anything for Rooney. Look how we struggled to offload Nani. Rooney's on twice as much as least.

8191~~~
It's sad that it has come to this situation. Hope he leaves United in good terms.

8192~~~
Just not good enough. The sooner he is benched the better

8193~~~
He's is of the most marketable names/faces in the sport. So if someone were to sign him there's the benefit of that. But yeah the issue is the wages he's on. No ones going to want to pay him anywhere near that. What a mess we've got into with that contract. I wish Jose hasn't gone for Falcao and Rooney was his "I can bring out the old player this guy used to be" mission instead.

8194~~~
Forget who's writing it, just read it.

8195~~~
Looks like there was some sort of gentleman's agreement to protect Rooney until Keano broke it. Why has it taken this long for him to get criticism in the media?

8196~~~
can you link it pal, as I'm at work and can't see the tweet.

8197~~~
Here's the article, mate:

8198~~~
its not that big an issue if its just united suffering, its a good talking point. But with the Euros its means England...

Keane was first person to have the balls to be blunt about it

8199~~~
thanks pal. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

8200~~~
I just think journalists, newspapers and pundits don't want to be seen as barraging Englands captain. 
How Neville tried to sidestep his decline when Martin Tyler brought it up was sad to see.

8201~~~
Chelsea pretty much had to write Torres off.. We might have to do the same.
Take the financial hit. He is on crazy wages. Top teams wont want him. Any other club wont take him.. even on a free.


that said.. he isnt going anywhere till he gets the record.. and that is unlikely this season the way he is playing.

8202~~~
So Neville didn't say anything of note then?

8203~~~
They'll wait until England go out and then rush to publish "Wayne Floppy was at Stereophonics gigs at ELEVEN PM when he should've been doing keep-ups!!!!" stories.

8204~~~
he said Rooney hadn't reached the 'Gary Neville' stage just yet, where everyone could clearly see his time was up

8205~~~
He's reached the fronkin' Neville Chamberlain stage.

8206~~~
appeasement.

agree mate.

8207~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8208~~~
Said at the start of the season I didn't think he'd pass Sir Bobby's record, and it is certainly looking that way now. Stan is absolutely spot on with his assessment down to the people that say "he's back" when he scores. I'm amazed he starts for United considering how ruthless LvG is with certain other players, so for this alone I agree with what <a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a> suggested in that he has something in his contract that says he plays X amount of games a season. What other excuse is there for him constantly being played?

8209~~~
I'm interested to hear what <a class="username" data-user="68652, @MajorTom" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/68652/">@MajorTom</a> 's thoughts are on Rooney?

8210~~~
Probably but getting the record with insipid performances would leave a bad taste. It's great to break such a record while still playing well and helping the team.

8211~~~
Of course if we struggle in his 3 weeks absence the narrative will swing back in his favour.

8212~~~
Surely, we'll appreciate his forward passes.

8213~~~
It wont be his choice, he may be a big star but United is a billion dollar business that wont operate at the whims of Wayne Rooney when it gets to the point of being detrimental, we reached that point a few mile markers back there just hasn't been a window open at the convenient time to deal with the problem..

8214~~~
The right back will miss him.

8215~~~
Getting torn apart on talksport right now.

8216~~~
In the past when he's been criticised he would usually come out fighting - wanting to shut everyone up. Now this is not even working. Same when SAF benched him - it would motivate him, but I think we're past that - his body and mind are just not there anymore. We got ourselves a big problem - or Ed Woodward does.

8217~~~
Ive said it before many times but I'll say it again. He's shot. He's been playing top flight football since he was 16! He's 30 now so that's 14 years of top level football. 

If we consider that on average a player establishes himself at 22 as a regular. Add 14 years playing time and said player will be 36. A lot of us would agree that at 36, the player would be considered as past it and close, if not already retired, give or take freaks like giggs, zanetti etc. 

We need to see Rooney in the same light. Perhaps 'past it' might sound a bit crude, but in footballing years, he is and he needs to retire, if not from the game entirely then from the top level at least.

8218~~~
At Leicester he was inside the box and you thought if he took a touch and blasted a shot it would have a decent chance of going in. But he was lumbering with the ball at his feet, he knew he didn't have the pace or the strength to get past the defender...I think it was Robert Huth. He just passed his back because he knew he was going to lose it.

Whatever peoples opinions of LVG are he's not telling them to pass it when they're in the position he was. It was just a small moment, but they all add up and point to his decline.

8219~~~
Just how powerful is he as a commercial machine?

If he continues playing shit, will people want to buy his shirt or his products. Will companies want to be associated with a fading star who can no longer keep with the pace?

Also he's not sexy like Becks or Ronaldo so it's not like he can still be a model in spite of how well he does on the pitch. The younger kids won't look up to him much either (they'll idolise Kane, Neymar, Bale, Reus), he's a player of the past now, the ones who grew up with Rooney are now in their 20s.

8220~~~
I've been wondering about this as well. Of course we have no way of knowing I don't think. But I can't understand how he can have this enduring marketability. In any case, it will start to decline pretty swiftly if he continues like this. That might be the time the suits at OT start panicking and wanting him out asap.

8221~~~
I'm in stitches listening to talksport<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's been destroyed. It's not only the Caf fed up with him.

8222~~~
to be fair its like Collymore has been reading this site

8223~~~
There are plenty of England fans ringing in. They haven't forgot him slagging them off.

8224~~~
Not surprised - Rooney was quite out of order. Reckon if this gathers anymore steam, Hodgson will drop him before we do.

8225~~~
Rooney holds a lot of influence and respect within the squad and IMO VG is hoping that a happy Rooney will mean a happy squad.  I think the same goes for Carrick.

8226~~~
I hate it too. He did it before Van Gaal, so I doubt he has been instructed to.

8227~~~
Collymore's article was absolutely spot-on.

8228~~~
Henry Winter has written an article in the times saying he deserves more respect.

8229~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8230~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://t.co/ocsnwbL5qc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/ocsnwbL5qc</a>

8231~~~
Using the tribute in that way is a truly cheap and desperate attempt to do some special pleading for Rooney.

8232~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> Good grief.

8233~~~
If it's that way we have a pussy in the dugout and he needs to make way ASAP, ensuring that the dressing room stays focused under whatever circumstances is a big part of his job but sending the team in a man down from the first minute, every game, is stretching that aspect of his his job a bit too much. In fact handling Rooney with kid gloves hasn't helped him at all, now everyone is taking potshots at him and the longer this continues Rooney's place in the England side will be under threat and he will take the Scholes route - blame Van Gaal's tactics for his fall from grace.

8234~~~
He's crap.  We need to move him on quick.  Qatar, USA. Somewhere like that.

His quality is rapidly dropping.  Nevermind tactics he's playing in, his touch, penetration going forward, passing, pace, power, shooting, positioning, it's all shite.

Every week you just know he's going to be crap to average.  And you're hoping he just doesnt get in the way.  How bad is that ffs...?

I was laughing at Liverpool last season for playing Gerrard, now we're in the same position.

8235~~~
He's been abysmal this season, and all the criticism is deserved. 

I really hope that he can take a step back, get focused and start performing again after this spell out. I've been very critical of him, but i'd still want to see him back to his best. Until he is though, he shouldn't be starting. The league is wide open this year and we have a shot, but we need to start scoring goals.

8236~~~
Has anyone seen what odds you can get on him never breaking Sir Bobby's goalscoring record? On current form, I can't see him doing it, especially if this season is his last. Which could tie in after his testimonial.

A swap deal for Stones?

8237~~~
Jose should take up the challenge of reviving him. Replace Costa with Rooney.

8238~~~
I read that this morning over a coffee - a slightly depressing start to the day I have to admit as I initially thought it was a desperate defence of him. But in hindsight it almost reads like a eulogy ie the old Rooney is gone and his time is now coming to an end. The piece is quite damning really in that the focus is entirely on his qualities off the pitch and even, at the end, can state only that he remains a "good" player and nothing more.

I've been thinking for a while that maybe Sir Bobby's record will stand. He looks that shot. I think I'd like Bobby to keep the record too.

No way in hell would Everton swap Stones. Even they will see the decline in Rooney so why swap a lad who looks like a future England Captain for the one who is about to bow out?

8239~~~

8240~~~
Tbf, Wazza was a dick to Lindegaard in a recent interview.

8241~~~
That wouldn't surprise me though. RedCafe is a well known football forum and has been quoted a few times on media-websites if I'm correct?

8242~~~
Yes you are. But Stan has been calling for Rooney to be dropped for ages.

8243~~~
Lose all respect for the opinions of Jurno's blaming other factors for Rooneys form, Yes, LvG's side doesn't create much, especially for it's no.9, it's an unforgiving position to play just now, but that doesn't explain how he can't seem to complete simple 5 yard passes, legs looking as if he's waddling in slow motion and seems hard pressed to trap a bag of cement these days.
Open your eyes FFS.

8244~~~
what happened?

8245~~~
The worst example I've seen of the media defending Rooney was when Garth Crooks suggested that the reason Rooney has been so shit is that he's having to help our other players, specifically naming Herrera, acclimatise to English football.

Mind boggling stuff.

8246~~~
He also said the others had not yet understood the philosophy so weren't on the same wavelength with Rooney is well versed in the philosophy.

8247~~~
He has 5 PL goals from open play and 1 assist in the WHOLE of 2015.

Seriously, how the feck can anyone defend him? Thats an utter disgrace.

8248~~~
I wish Rooney was stuck in an elevator for the next 4 years.

8249~~~
wow, that doesn't even seem in a "banter" type of way either, he's legit saying feck you <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8250~~~
especially for someone who's reportedly on 300k per week.

8251~~~
Rooney said Lindegaard was the most annoying teammate he's ever had.

8252~~~
Ill never forget that article, one of the most ridiculous things ive ever read connected to the club. 'People like Ander Herrera are very lucky to have such an accommodating captain as Wayne Rooney...'

8253~~~
I'm convinced part of the reason there hasn't been any trouble within the squad is because the players are soft. 
In some other teams, while Rooney is yelling at his teammates, the other players will tell him where to go.

8254~~~
Rooney was probably joking right?<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

8255~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> for real? The hell did he get his job.

8256~~~
Look what Crooks wrote this week:

(Source: <i>Football365</i>)

8257~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's a card isn't he?

8258~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He sounds like he's trying to summon the ghost of King Arthur, not Frogie.

8259~~~
He'll have to summon the mighty Merlin then.

8260~~~
He also has 5 goals for England in 2015 doesn't he? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8261~~~
To be fair to him it's not that he's not trying. He's just fat, slow, has a poor touch and now that his physical attributes have declined, has nothing whatsoever to offer. 

We should appreciate his loyalty though. Despite angling for a move on multiple occasions he's been very loyal to our money.

8262~~~
More rumblings - this time from The Times. Unfortunately I don't subscribe so only see the first couple of sentences: which says basically Rooney must improve or leave United etc
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/article4628276.ece" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/article4628276.ece</a>

8263~~~
"In Wayne Rooney’s last 30 Premier League games, he has played 2619 minutes, scored six goals and managed just one assist. That is 374 minutes (over four full games) for every goal/assist."

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.punditarena.com/football/english-football/bbarry/this-wayne-rooney-stat-will-have-fans-calling-for-his-head/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.punditarena.com/football...ney-stat-will-have-fans-calling-for-his-head/</a>

One assist in 30 games and we are currently playing him as a no 10, it's pathetic.

8264~~~
Back in September I said, LVG keeping Rooney I'mthe team could cost him his Jon and I stand by it.

8265~~~
Anyone with a subscription?

8266~~~
Floodgates well and truly open. I knew this would happen after Keane had his say. It's like the media is afraid to break rank, but they can't ignore it forever.

8267~~~
The coaching team will know all these stats, and it just makes it even more baffling that he'll still play every week. 6 goals in his last 30 Premier League games is absolutely appalling.

8268~~~
Never mind that he isn't scoring. He isn't even playing well.

8269~~~
Yeah. I could understand a bit more if he was still playing shite but getting a goal every now and then, but he isn't and it's like playing with 10 men. I didn't actually realise that his goal record was that bad. We need shot of him asap.

8270~~~
He's clearly worth more than 9 or 12M, so he'll be back at Barca next year, even if they just plan to resell him. They need the money.

8271~~~
You sure about that?

8272~~~
<a class="username" data-user="70411, @van der star" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/70411/">@van der star</a> oops, I thought I was posting about another Everton star, Deolefoauaolua.

8273~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://i.imgur.com/k79by5Z.jpg" src="https://i.imgur.com/k79by5Z.jpg"/>

8274~~~
he's played almost full time for the last 30 matches and records a goal/assist every 4 or so games.

we have to make up a new word to describe his "performances" at this point. he'll have his legacy and I don't have anything against him, but right now he is absolutely stealing a living. how much is vardy on for comparison?

8275~~~
It's the system that makes him look shit...or something

8276~~~
Yup, it's a steal having him grace the pitch for merely 300k

8277~~~
as bad as that is, I feel his general play and loss of possession more offensive

8278~~~
Yeh he was just angling more money tbh.  And he played us well.  We're the mugs.

Ive not had the feeling Rooney has had passion for the club for a while now actually. :/

8279~~~
Made me laugh. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

8280~~~
The longer he stays at this club with these types of performances, the more damage he does his standing with the fans. I have a 10 year old cousin. When I tell him that Rooney was the best young player I've ever seen, he laughs.
He looks like a boxing champion who comes out of retirement after 10 years to earn one last score.

8281~~~
Ya, same boat, the Mrs has been trying to get into football lately, she's only been watching a few months and she can't stand him, I keep saying... <i>He used to be really good I swear!</i> the last game vs Leicester when Schweinsteiger gave a pass to Rooney, she actually groaned, loudly. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
You have to laugh, otherwise you'd cry.

8282~~~
Absolutely the worst time to try to get her interested in United, mate.

8283~~~
People saying that Rooney is playing like Falcao from last season...Well, this is isn't exactly true.

Falcao scored and assited 8 goals in 1287 min in the PL. That is, he needed 160 min to score/assist a United goal.

Rooney is far worse actually. He's played 1050 min so far and has contributed 2 league goals. In other words, Rooney has needed 525 min to score/assist a league goal.

Has there ever been a United forward with such pathetic end product in the league? Seriously?

8284~~~
As bad as those stats are it's actually his overall play (touch, passing, positioning) that has been driving most people mad the last few months. He really does offer nothing these days

8285~~~
Yeah, I have been a massive fan of his but the sooner he leaves my club, the better it is. How many goals to the record now?

8286~~~
His overall game hasn't been impressive for years. However, he used to score/assist goals at acceptable level and thus his fans used stats as a stick to beat his critics. Now, his game has deteriorated to such an extent that there is practically no end product. Even now, however, there are fans and pundits willing to blame the system, the manager, the other players, etc. but not Rooney himself. It's amaizing really.

8287~~~
13 or 15. Allegedly, Charlton scored 2 goals in official games which haven't been taken into account so far.

8288~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Wait, so his output in the league is worse than Falcao's was for us? That's so sad you can only laugh.

8289~~~
That's what i keep telling people. As bad as his stats are, his general play makes for worse reading.

8290~~~
Rooney being taken off penalties was a real blow for him. I remember a few seasons ago his defenders would always answer critics by pointing to a relatively good return of goals/assists and those numbers were always propped up by him monopolising set pieces post-Ronaldo. It was like that with Ronaldinho towards the end of his Barcelona days, relying more and more on set pieces because he struggled in open play, and is clearly linked to physical decline.

8291~~~
The patience LvG has with him is baffling. This won't happen at Bayern, Barca or Real Madrid nowadays, they'll bench the fecker and sell him.

8292~~~
Scores points for fun in The Sun Dream Team

8293~~~
It'll all come to a head soon enough. Either he'll get dropped or the manager will.

8294~~~
We all know what is going to happen next. 
He is going to get lucky a couple of times in the next 2-3 games and then go back to being rubbish. Just enough to get the press off his back.

8295~~~
That's the fortunate thing for players who are in a slump: they can always shut critics up by scoring a goal or two, or by playing well; it's up to Wayne.

8296~~~
Who would people prefer, Falcao from last year or Rooney of this year? 

I actually think I would prefer Falcao <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8297~~~
Rooney, he can actually stay upright

8298~~~
Falcao, and the logic is simple. Falcao wouldn't be the captain and therefore, be on the bench.

8299~~~
This is so true. I was watching the game with my missus and trying to get her to like the game. At half-time she asked me, "Why do all the players move all the time even when the ball goes to them (pardon the language; I'm quoting), while the captain seems to just stop and stand all the time? And why's he captain if he can't stop the ball properly?" I just had no words to be honest. It was all so true. Watching Rooney against Leicester, it was so clear that he's unable to even receive the ball when moving even slightly. If you're playing as a 9 or a 10, that's absolutely unacceptable.

I have supported LvG throughout - he's tightened up the defence and sorted out the central midfield which had been in crying need of help for years. I don't mind possession-based football. In fact, I quite like to see us take that approach. As I said in September though, Rooney is costing him and the team massively. The position LvG insists on playing him in is integral to linking midfield and attack and right now, the midfielders don't even seem to want to pass to him!

8300~~~
Falcao didn't have privileges.

8301~~~
thats really quite telling coming from someone who is just saying what they see. Not tainted by bias either way

8302~~~
Funny.
So even someone who doesn't watch football was able to spot our weak link.
So, why are LVG and Giggs unable to see this?

I'd choose Rooney.
Falcao is a 5 goals/season* striker.
Rooney is about 8 goals/season* striker.

Lets not forget that Falcao can't even start a game for Chelsea, he is so bad.
The last I saw him starting a game, was in the league cup and though his team scored 4 goals, he could not score any. So, he really hasn't improved. Like Rooney, he remains a non-scoring striker. Totally useless.

<i>*league goals</i>

8303~~~
Does his current state make you reevaluate some of the odd things about his game from the past? We hard many times in recent years how Wayne has to "play himself into form" or "needs a run of games" or "is lacking fitness". Were those actually early symptoms of his decline that were blamed on these excuses?

8304~~~
I have been firmly on the anti-Rooney side for a while now, starting in 2012/13. I've felt that his bad touches and slow, predictable and inaccurate passing has hindered the team going forward for a couple of seasons.

However I think the hate in these pages is a bit much. At the end of the day, regardless of consequences, it's LvG's job to pick the team and Rooney isn't going to say no when asked to play. Not just does he keep getting picked, he gets sky-high praise too. Either LvG lacks balls or he lacks eyes, and in this insane situation, he should be blamed first. Rooney just can't do much better at this stage. He's trying, I think.

8305~~~
true, ultimately its the managers fault. and he is looking stupid while it costs him points

8306~~~
Berbatov.

8307~~~
Anyone who is watching the Liverpool game tonight, just goes to show that you don't need 4 months to get going. Sturridge and a few other PL strikers come back from injury and start banging the goals in straight away. Is it going to take Wayne another 4th months to get going after getting a slight knock?

8308~~~
Is so washed-up he doesn't turn up for games anymore. In the Greek first division <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

All I have left of my man is videos.

8309~~~
Still has infinitely better control and vision than Rooney.

8310~~~
Gotta appreciate how Sturridge comes back from injury and bangs 2 goals today and Rooney just keeps doing feck all.

8311~~~
Slightly related to some of our speculation on why Rooney keeps starting:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-revealed-to-be-paying-southampton-10000-every-time-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-plays-20-minutes-8775909.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...ade-chamberlain-plays-20-minutes-8775909.html</a>

Anyone remember this reported about Oxlade-Chamberlain?

If that was true, then it's not inconceivable that we have to pay Rooney a certain amount if he doesn't start. Pretty sure Paul Stretford wouldn't have let a little detail like this slip.

Apologies if it's in the wrong 'Rooney' thread... am losing track<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8312~~~
How much is he out for? Any chance of playing with 11 men these next few games?

8313~~~
So, do you think we have to pay him more to not play? As conspiracy theories go this one is a bit left field.

8314~~~
Did you actually read what I wrote? I pointed out it was related to some speculation we had on why Rooney keeps starting even though his performances are crap. The point of the link was there was a a 'playing clause' of some sort in Oxlade-Chamberlain's contract - so therefore, it's not totally inconceivable that Rooney might have a 'playing clause'. Obviously relative to his situation, it would differ from Oxlaide-Chamberlain's. However, the point is that if a 'playing clause' existed in his contract, why is it so far-fetched to think that one wouldn't be in Rooney's? That's all I'm saying.

8315~~~
Tevez

Sturridge has the same amount of PL goals as Rooney, and he's played just 4 PL games this season.

Aguero scored double Rooney's current PL total in just one game (6-1 Newcastle)

8316~~~
"He always needs a few games after injury to find his form". <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8317~~~
The only form wazza's likely to find, is the one he has to park his arse on during games. ( coming soon)

8318~~~
Yes. Did you read the article? It was a clause for the selling club for minutes played by a player they sold. It wasn't a clause saying he has to play every minute. What relation does it bare to Rooney?

8319~~~
Perhaps, but I do recall that there was a lot of chatter at the time he signed the last contract that the contract's clauses assured him of 3 things:
1. Captaincy, regardless of the manager in charge, as long as he was at the club
2. A say in transfers in terms of whom we signed / let go
3. Assurance that he would start regardless of all else, as long as he was fit an available

Now, I dismissed this as idle speculation by the rags. I'm sure most of us did, at the time. However, since then, the data is telling. He's been captain and remained captain, despite arguably better options being available. He's also seen the club jettison all their striking option other than him and has started and played almost every minute except when injured, despite his horrific form, touch etc.

All in all, I'm not wholly convinced, but the evidence that there's some contractual clause does seem to be mounting...

8320~~~
It sounds extreme but I wouldn't put it past our regime at the time of Moyes+Youngblood Woodward to do something calamitous like that. There were a lot of rumblings of this at the time. And the absurd importance he's given despite poor performances has been jarring and inexplicable. Would be a brilliant bit of opportunism by his agent too taking advantage of our temporary vulnerability. If it is true, then he and his agent have rogered us nice and proper. Going to be a tough one to get out of either way.

8321~~~
Greedy cnut eh, as if 300k is not enough. I doubt he really cares about ambitions and all that as long as the paycheck is keep coming.

No. 2, I don't even think Messi/Ronaldo/Neymar would go that far, let alone anyone in Manchester United, that's practically giving him the manager job. 

No. 3, is probably, but again that's selfish from him, we will be paying his salary regardless of whether or not he plays.

8322~~~
Never had any doubts on this. To be fair, most footballers probably fall under this category as long as they're in the "top echelon" of clubs. Top echelon nowadays is clearly about who can afford to pay the most...

I don't think it means he can select or veto; the Press reports were more about him being "in the loop" on all transfer business. Something that other players aren't except when they're used (typically by Barca and Real) for the public tapping-up...

Very selfish, but something that the reports were unanimous on. I'm torn on this one. It's hard to believe a club our size agreed to this, but we have to remember that at the time, Moyes was in charge. We had been through absolute disasters in the transfer market and Woodward was new in the job. Could it be? Playing stats suggest it's true, but how could this be enforceable? Oh well, in a way I like to believe it's true since that would reduce the blame on LvG and Giggs for refusing to drop him. The alternative is to believe that the two of them are completely blind to what the whole world and its dog can see -> Rooney is done or at least in need of a period on the bench.

8323~~~
I don't think a contract like that would be legal in any way. And I don't think anyone would be stupid enough to agree it.

8324~~~
Was there ever a player with a must play contract ever in football? 

Personally i dont think that's the case, this accusations started on the Internet, i really dont think the club would want that, neither the player, not on top of a guaranteed 300k/week anyway. 

Besides, what's wrong with being dropped a game or two, any other job it'll be treated as holiday. Wasn't so bad to get dropped right? 

Besides,  if that Clause is there rooney must be one hell or a passionate footballer,  something i didnt see on the pitch. What he could possibly gain by always playing? More money? More fame? The only reason for that is guaranteeing his chance to break the record. And either way you look at it very stupif from us and selfish from him

8325~~~
No because his endorsements etc are based on him being United and Englands no1 player, getting dropped regularly will impact him financially.

8326~~~
He knows his end is coming he has to hide behind a clause. 

No way player like messi neymar ronaldo thinking they will not be good enough and worry about being dropped constantly at the age of 28

8327~~~
If it ever does turn out that he's got a clause in the contract - then he's more spineless than I could ever possibly imagine. Basically protecting himself from any future (fair) criticism that results in him being rightfully dropped from the XI. I suppose it wouldn't be hard to understand given how he reacted to Ferguson dropping him in his final season - throwing his toys out of the pram. 

Contractual equivalent of taking his ball and going home. Then again, that would mean Moyes is an even bigger tosser than we already thought and Woodward was green as hell.

8328~~~
The only other thing I can think of is a clause like Thiago had at Barca where he had to play a certain percentage of games, and LvG is trying to get them out of the way before the business end of the season..........???

8329~~~
I said I suspected a clause quite a year ago, to which I was shot down, and still do. I don't see why Van Gaal can't have a quiet word with Phil Jones (or Phil Bardsley if need be!) to get round that.

The smart money was always on Persie being mad captain, and even on Rooney being pushed out according to a lot of rumours. When he was made captain, I first thought it may have been contractually promised, but didn't overthink it at the time. Moyes was in charge when he got his new deal, and he was pandering to his boy. It was already known that Vidic would be joining Inter in the summer, so the topic of captaincy was already in existence. I don't think it would have been something so outrageous, Moyes probably decided he'd make Rooney captain following season, and they may have put it in writing. Woodward, for his part, could not afford to lose Rooney at a time we were struggling. It was also wierd that a player approaching 30 would sign a 5 year deal, with agreements as to what would happen once the 5 years was up. The whole ambassador stuff was odd, 5 years was a long time in football and obviously, there should have been no guarantee that Rooney would still be connected to the club in his mid 30s. 

My suspicion is that Van Gaal inherited this. Rooney's 'privileges' may have been agreed in print. Also, his treatment of Rooney has not tallied with his general ruthlessness for underperformance, and goes above and beyond the protection afforded to any of his previous captains. 

I'd be in favour of us paying him off £40m rather than spending it on signing another top player this summer if I had a choice. He's holding the team back, and no matter how much you build around him, there will always be a clear question of how much better we'd be if we had a competent #10 instead.

8330~~~
I refuse to believe there's a clause. The club is not that far gone.

8331~~~
I agree, I'm particularly talking about Rooney and why the clause in his contract might actually be true

8332~~~
If there was a clause I'd suspect van Gaal would be more cynical of Rooney in the press. He's too eager to praise him and never criticizes him.

8333~~~
Is there anyone who still wants him to play?

8334~~~
Me. For Delhi Dynamos.

8335~~~
Did you read this sentence from what I wrote?
<i>".....so therefore, it's not totally inconceivable that Rooney might have a 'playing clause'. Obviously <span style="color: #ff0000">relative to his situation, it would differ from Oxlaide-Chamberlain's</span>..."</i>
I didn't say the content of Oxlaide-Chamberlain's contract would be the same if Rooney does indeed have a clause. The point is there was a playing clause - that's the point for those that believe they don't exist. How the clause is constructed is entirely up to the individuals and what they negotiate - obviously for Rooney whatever is in there would have to be beneficial to him. I can't see what is so difficult about this to understand.

8336~~~
He switched OT lights on yesterday, maybe we could just send round to all your houses to switch on your Christmas lights. Especially the ones who live the other side of the world.

8337~~~
Blimey. First, he's choosing what the team has for dinner; now he's doing the electrics at the Theatre of Wayne; is there no end to Rooney's Reign of...um...Doing Stuff?

8338~~~
He's our own little Handy Andy.

8339~~~
Him being chosen to turn on the Xmas lights doesn't suggest he's going away anytime soon; in fact, quite the opposite.

8340~~~
There again it was him and Carrick so maybe they are both retiring. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8341~~~
Captain and Vice Captain. I don't think there anything in that. Or at least I hope.

8342~~~
Surprised they didn't pass the switch back n' forth between them.

8343~~~
Maybe they were the only two not doing something more interesting.

There's a story about it in the <i>Daily Fail</i>, if anybody's interested:

8347~~~
I don't think there's ever been any topic that everyone has agreed on before on Red Cafe.

Even towards the end of Moyes you still had people defending him, with Rooney this season it's unanimous he's shit.

8348~~~
Regarding Moyes, there are people on this forum who still feel that we were wrong to fire him and should've given him more time.
If you ask them, I'm sure they'd be happy for him to be re-hired.

8349~~~
It wasn't a playing clause though. It was part of a selling fee. It's a buying clubs way of ensuring they don't overspend on a dud. It would have no relevance to any mythical clause in Rooney's contract. If such a clause existed it would surely be illegal and we'd have heard about it.

8350~~~
It will be very interesting to see what happens if he misses 4 or 5 games and the team collectively improves in his absence.

8351~~~
Would love for that to happen just to see the meltdown when he comes back and a performing player is suddenly on e bench.

8352~~~
Unfortunately that's what I suspect will happen!

8353~~~
Anyone think this is a face saving way of dropping him?

8354~~~
Don't think so. If we were to drop Rooney, this is not the time to do it when Herrera is also injured and we are generally very thin in terms of squad availability.

8355~~~
I guess. I wonder what team he'll play now. It would be the perfect time to implement 433

8356~~~
The longer he's out for the better.

Preferably, for the rest of the season.

8357~~~
Nice.

8358~~~
It might sound harsh, but right now its the only way to get him out of the team, with LVG's refusal to drop him.

8359~~~
If everyone was fully fit then I'd understand not wanting him to be fit enough to play, but we have no options right now, especially with a busy schedule coming up. And his performances had picked up recently, though still not scoring/creating (like everyone else though). The players who can play in our front 4 that we have fit and available are Martial, Memphis, Mata, Lingard, Pereira and Fellaini. 3 of them are u21 (with Lingard only 22 but only recently even started playing), 1 is only good for bringing down long balls. Mata is the only one who is a very good player at his best and in the prime ages of his career. With Herrera out and Young needed at fullback, we just have no options up top so it's stupid to want Rooney to be out.

8360~~~
Rooney's been far and away our worst attacker this season. He's been absolutely appalling. The longer he's out of the team, the better. 

Right now I'd happily play any of Martial, Memphis, Mata, Lingard, Pereira and Fellaini ahead of Rooney.

8361~~~
Well it's finally happened gentlemen. Rightly or wrongly I must say i'm looking forward to the game tomorrow much more now.

8362~~~
How Fellaini played against PSV when he came on was pretty much as bad as any player has played this season at United. He was terrible. And generally just not suited to us. So I don't know why you'd want him up there as it would be a lot worse then Rooney, even if he's been shite. Pereira, Lingard are just youngsters basically. Sure for 1 game it's fine, but if Rooney is out for more then a couple of games then we're fecked as they can't play too many games in a row. We've left ourselves short of numbers so have to make do with what we have, that's why it's stupid to want anyone to be injured.

8363~~~
Lingard and Pereira might both be youngsters, but Lingard for one has looked a lot better then Rooney this season, while Pereira has looked quality in his brief appearances. I'd much rather see him get a run in the team, as I highly doubt he can play as badly as Rooney has. As for Fellaini, he's not my favourite player, and I don't particularly want him in the team, but I'd prefer him to be there ahead of Rooney right now as he does offer something (compared to Rooney who offers nothing). I wouldn't want either of them upfront though. They're both shite there.

Agreed that we've left ourselves short, I've been saying that since pre-season, but wanting the worst player in our team to not play, is hardly stupid. If it means having to play more youngsters, then so be it. They wont be any worse then Rooney.

8364~~~

Posted as an example of more media attention being given to his poor form. And also for the opening paragraph, which I found pretty funny.

Still includes a lot of the bollocks excuses, unfortunately.

8365~~~
I am not on redissue, but they were right about lot of stuff at time of moyes (this is how jagielka would do it,rio,cleverly etc). Anyone who knows exactly what the "rumor" is?

8366~~~
Maybe toothache from eating all those sweets.

8367~~~
Well, i hope its out in the press soon. I wonder if he has issues with coleen? Or maybe he wanted a christmas break and decided to sod off.

8368~~~
Been let down by so many has finally got to him

8369~~~
it was strange how he came off with a blow to the body but currently has a bad ankle injury

8370~~~
The mirror says he was actually dropped/rested. There are concerns about his form at the top level of the club and he is given time off to sort himself out.  I think if his form does not pick up, we may as well be seeing the last of wayne rooney.

8371~~~
Wow. That's a surprise - provided it's true of course..

8372~~~
Wish it were true. Too good to believe.

8373~~~
Life is never that kind. He's probably in the process of completing his take over of the club.

8374~~~
Amen. We cannot go into next season with Wayne Rooney a fixture in our XI. Ideally he won't be at the club at all, but if he is, at least let him be asked to earn a place on merit other than name.

8375~~~
His fans can deny it all they want but we created more chances yesterday than we have in weeks. Apart from maybe Watford, another game he missed.

8376~~~
I'm all for dropping Rooney as well but he'd have scored the chance Martial missed yesterday. If there's one thing he can still do, it's finish.

8377~~~

That's true. Also, fellaini's

8379~~~
Isn't Rooney getting boring? I'm kinda tired of having him <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Appreciate his footballing talent though. Football is always about the next big thing

8380~~~
Somebody's gotta do it!

Any publication that draws attention to how shite Rooney is gets a plus from me.

8381~~~
I thought this on Friday - not a real injury but a face-saving excuse to pull him out of the firing line for a while

8382~~~
Bloody Rooney, completely his fault we didn't win yesterday, can't believe Van Gaal...blah blah

no wait...

8383~~~
Cracking decision then, with Rooney playing we might have scored 0 yesterday..

8384~~~
has moved on recently from he has to play, to never being subbed, to now being subbed occasionally, and now "left" out.

Can definitely see it going the way of VP, depending on who we can attract in the summer, and how we and Rooney deal with the huge wage and him not necessarily being a regular.

3 seasons left on a contract of somewhere in the 200-300k territory would be madness to walk away from for the lad, who you surely can't imagine doing media work or staying on a manager/coach

8385~~~
If the charisma black holes that are Gerrard and Scholes can get pundit work I don't see why Rooney can't.

8386~~~
DIdn't he miss a sitter (from one meter or so) in the games against PSV?

8387~~~
You can't go on playing a player who has played poorly almost every game this season (and the majority of games for the last two years). On the other hand, LVG is too proud to go back on his word that "his captain shall always play". So a solution shall be found. 

It's so obvious.

8388~~~
And lets never forget the wise and articulate Robbie Savage.

8389~~~
it's a horrendous situation Moyes has dumped us in for sure!
Like Gerrard, but way sooner, on way too much money, and with way too long a contract left

8390~~~
Ok I've just seen elsewhere.... Apparently blood tests were done at Carrington and Wayne had alcohol in his. This it seems is the reason he's not playing - it's nothing to do with him being injured.....

8391~~~

8392~~~
What? Is alcohol completely banned or something?

8393~~~
Saw this on twitter earlier... nice to see his punishment was sitting in the stands sharing a bag of sweets with his kid.

8394~~~
Probably hangover food

8395~~~
Rossi is the issue that he had an excessive amount of alcohol in his samples? Or are you not allowed any alcohol
See Rossi's post above.
I don't know about alcohol being banned but as an elite athlete you really shouldn't go anywhere near it really. However, having one glass of something shouldn't be a problem I don't think. If it's an issue it might be that there's an excessive amount that's shown up in his samples, and this I believe would have a negative impact on your performance. I don't know enough though on alcohol and performance - I'm just thinking logically a huge intake is not good for an athlete.

8396~~~
Don't know how LvG works but, it could be he went out without permission from LvG.

Not really fussed anyways. Lost any interest in Rooney the moment he came on against Boro, demanding the armband

8397~~~
I don't think they are supposed to drink at certain times before games. That might be the point.

8398~~~
Oh ok..

8399~~~
Yeah that 'Boro' thing pissed me off as well. But I wonder if this incident means LVG will treat him like everyone else now... i.e. not playing him because he's Wayne Rooney but only on merit as he seems to do with the others...

8400~~~
He's been playing drunk? That might explain his first touch.

8401~~~
Would be a rather hilarious explanation. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> (well not that funny I guess).

8402~~~
If this is true and it was an excessive amount or it was at a bad time (before a game or important training session) then it is an absolute disgrace. 
Captain of Manchester United and playing poorly is not the time to be drinking anything. If it's true he has no shame and is taking the club for a ride.

Hopefully the story is just bullshit

8403~~~
The Leicester squad have, today, been photographed supping beers in Copenhagen as a reward for topping the league. Nothing wrong with that if the morale at the club is good.

8404~~~
United do not ban them from drinking. It is when they do the drinking. After a game when there isn't another on straight after is fine. I always thought it was after the Wednesday if playing Saturday.

8405~~~
He was out at a Stereophonics gig last Thursday. Whether that constitutes evidence for him being pissed is a matter of opinion.

8406~~~
YEAH! No beer, no wine, no lucozade, no god damn water, its not time to be drinking ANYTHINGGGGGGGGGGG.

8407~~~
Didn't Fergie drop him a few years ago after showing up to training hung over?

8408~~~
So, if he is not injured but instead dropped for having alcohol in his system does that mean that he can be dropped and there isn't a clause in his contract which prevents it or not?

8409~~~
Sure he did.

8410~~~
They don't get tested during it though. I'd assume, if this is true, that Rooney drank the night before his test, which would mean he had to drink quiet a bit to get tested positive the next day. Would be even worse, if he started drinking early in the day.

He did.

Hopefully.

8411~~~
Indeed.

8412~~~
Well played <a class="username" data-user="10035, @psychdelicblues" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/10035/">@psychdelicblues</a>. Burned him.

8413~~~
That was a joke moment. "I am Rooney and i have arrived"

8414~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8415~~~
Him, Johnny Evans and Clark Gibson was out on the town wasn't it? Can't remember what happened with those two though.

8416~~~
That's right, they were the two with him, it was around Christmas when we played West Brom I think, might have been the infamous Nevs last stand game.

8417~~~
LVG has stated the captain gets special priviledges. Like a free tab at the bar

8418~~~
It was the Blackburn game the following season. Park and Rafael in midfield. Infamous for three reasons.

1. It sent Pogba over the edge.
2. Gibson, Rooney and Evans acting the cnut
3. Probably costing us the league

8419~~~
I wonder how the video analysis meeting is at Man Utd. Must be awkward seeing Rooney feck up chances, slow down counters, lose possession consistently, misplace passes week in week out.

8420~~~
That OP sure does look silly now.

8421~~~
On the other hand, the second  post is now quite relevant.

8422~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8423~~~
Harsh on the MLS to be fair. Guy doesn't look fit enough for football full stop. I'm not sure how he possibly can fit (no pun intended) under their salary cap.

8424~~~
Obviously this gets cut out.

8425~~~
To be honest, it's all a bit sad, that it's all come to this....In an ideal world, you'd think our captain would be something other than an object of ridicule. I know not everyone shares the same view, but I can't see this ending in anything approaching pleasant. I wonder if it's true that he has it in his contract, that he has to play in a certain number of games, if fit? What is apparent, I think, is the lack of a senior striker to take over. It's all very well in having Martial, an amazing prospect, but it's unfair to expect him to bear the responsibility of being our main striker in his development years. Similarly, we need established wingers who can come in and take responsibility. To expect Lingard and Memphis to be consistent is a bit much given how young they are. It'll be difficult to get suitable targets in January, but I think the summer transfer window is going to be a massive one for us, and one we cannot afford to feck up. Get it right, and I honestly believe we can win the title next season.

8426~~~
All over social media this. Happened twice apparently.

The end is nigh folks. Reckon Bobby's record stands myself.

8427~~~
A lot of people on Twitter saying the guy who broke is is the real deal. Don't know what to think. I've never been on the site. 
Whatever it is, it can't be serious because LVG said he'll be back in two weeks. If it were true, he'll be suspended from training also.

8428~~~
He'll be back as the first name on the team sheet soon. He has privileges after all. 

I'm hoping Woodward has a nice long chat with LVG at the end of the season to end this mess.

8429~~~
God I wish he got a lengthy ban.

8430~~~
Absolutely huge summer. One where the club has to be brave and take a big call.

8431~~~
I'm sure LVG will just sweep it under the carpet if it's true. His love for Rooney is just too big.

8432~~~
If it's true that he arrived at training with an excessive blood alcohol level surely we could terminate his contract for gross misconduct? That's what would apply in most workplaces.....please?

8433~~~
There might be some truth that it isn't injury related but I still don't believe it's cause of alcohol. The injury circumstances seem strange. He got his injury during training on international duty. The injury kept him out of both England gamesbut Hogdson said it want a big deal. He came back and played two games but had to be subbed in the last game due to a bang in his ribs. LVG said he had thought of taking him off, not because of any ankle injury but because he wasn't playing well. Nothing about his ankle. The next press conference LVG says the injury to his ankle is worse than feared and he didn't know when he would be back.

8434~~~
Lurkhurst from the MEN said for the first time, he's beginning to think this will be his last season. No info but his gut feeling. First journo I've heard say anything like that.

8435~~~
It's not that easy. Rooney will be missing out on about £40m in wages. It will surely go to court. That's even without all the bad press and dragging through mud on both sides.

8436~~~
It would be worth it to see the confused and angry look on his little face.

8437~~~
Man, after all these years of disliking Wayne, I would have thought this season would have been your season to shine. I have more posts in this thread than you ! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8438~~~
He was probably drinking with LVG. That would explain the lack of logic in Louis' punch drunk assessment of our West Ham performance and his definition of creating chances.

8439~~~
Samuel Luckhurst (is that the name?) from the M.E.N has said that Rooney <i>does </i>have an ankle injury, but didn't rule out the alcohol story either.

8440~~~
Im trying so hard not to gloat, im just reveling in the fact that I can see the finish line and Ive outlasted him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I am taking some satisfaction in the fact I said about 3 years ago he would decline by his 30s and it would be rapid and extreme......and got roundly slaughtered for it.

8441~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

If you look closely, you'll notice that he missed that because he was playing in the 10 position/in midfield/as a striker/tactics were holding him back/he didn't have enough pacy team mates playing with him/he's more of a creator than a finisher/we pay him too little/he's angry and frustrated at not being in the first team/we didn't buy Ozil/the Caf was being to harsh on his performances.*

*delete as applicable.

8442~~~
That Martial chance wasn't even all that easy. His technique in opening the body up so quickly was really good, the space between the keeper and the post wasn't that big and he was very close to finding it. He could have hit the target of course, but his shot was not that far away from being unsaveable.

8443~~~
It was only his 25th game after coming back from injury, everyone knows that he needs time to get to his best after he's injured for 3 days.

8444~~~
I really hope he`s off next season, would be great if he didnt manage to break sir bobbys record..

8445~~~
Rooney at Goodison Park with Kai.. Can they buy him from us in January? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8446~~~
Why is our club captain and apparent "inspirational leader" at Goodison Park, cheering on Everton, while we have the biggest game of our season so far tomorrow and when every other player travelled?


Sorry but, surely he can't have privileges this special

8447~~~
For a guy who has a "very heavy" Ankle injury he seems to be moving around alot. I think he has been dropped due to being pissed.

8448~~~
Isn't he injured? or banned for having alcohol in his system?

8449~~~
He's dreaming of a return... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> once a blue etc etc...

8450~~~
being  at goodison today,playing in  duncan ferguson's testimonial...i do think he's testing the waters for a return.

8451~~~
We can only hope

8452~~~
Wait I just realised that even Shaw has travelled with the team, and not the captain?????<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>
What's going on?????? This makes it even worse him sitting there cheering on Everton. Gives no fecks to United does he?<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

8453~~~
Have all the injured players travelled or just Shaw?

8454~~~
Did Shaw travel with the team? Rooney probably needs to stay behind for treatment.

8455~~~
Maybe he's not been allowed to travel?

8456~~~
Same as always, Wayne Rooney cares about Wayne Rooney.

8457~~~
Sounds like not only Shaw but I will have to check if that's correct.

8458~~~
Yeah, that would be great. Fingers crossed he never gets another goal for us, eh?

8459~~~
Would think Shaw would stay behind as well in that case...? Dunno. Will see if I find more info.

8460~~~
I would have thought they want to keep him involved as he is out for such a long time? He must feel isolated at times. Herrera and Jones might be near to fitness so wouldn't want them travelling, make sure they are fit. Rooney don't care.

8461~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8462~~~
Why would any of our injured player be going to Germany?

8463~~~
As suggested above to keep Shaw involved....a good idea. Plus the team has a big game tomorrow, so why not I guess?

8464~~~
Irrelevant if he's not allowed travel or not. (He travelled to Goodison so clearly he can make a flight) 
Manchester United captain is at a match, cheering on another team. I don't care if he's an Everton fan or not, we'd be pissing ourselves if Henderson went back to Sunderland to cheer them on or Kompany went back to Anderlecht

8465~~~
Has he nicked his kids sweets yet?

8466~~~
Rossi did any of the other injured players go?
Also agree with you on above comment.

Obvious he wants to go back to Everton. Wants his little one to see him playing in blue before he retires<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8467~~~
Just know Shaw went. 

Jones would have went but, they were worried he might damage the plane

8468~~~

8470~~~
As if it was in any doubt<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8471~~~
Everton taking Rooney is like us getting Moyes. You've no idea what you're getting into, but we do

8472~~~
I don't want to get my hopes up but it really does look like Rooney is testing the waters for a return to Everton.

Please let that be the case.

8473~~~
A straight swap for lukaku sounds fair.

8474~~~
His shit giving towards United is at an all time low.  Hope for Everton's sake that he buggers of to the MLS after this season..

8475~~~
There's a lot of things to bash the traitorous wage stealing club captain for, but going back to watch his childhood team isn't really one of them. Maybe he was just there to watch how an actual centre forward plays.

8476~~~
He's just following his kid around. Someone has to drive him.

8477~~~
I doubt he is not travelling away and choosing to go Goodison against the club's will. He's likely been told not to go for one reason or another

8478~~~
Doesn't Rooney get caught drinking around Christmas most years? I remember it happening twice when Fergie was in charge and god only knows what he was doing when Moyes was here.

8479~~~
So all those stories about our Wayne meaning so much to his teammates and van Gaal aren't really that true, considering he isn't even travelling with the team even though van Gaal said it's probably his biggest United game so far.

8480~~~
I think somethings going on.

8481~~~
It is a bit strange. Even if he is injured (but it is only a minor one) I would think it'd be a good idea to have your captain travel with the squad for the biggest game of the season so far.

8482~~~
Considering we constantly get told how important he is to the squad. Yes.

8483~~~
We've probably told him we're playing at home.

8484~~~
More likely he can't tell the difference between home and away.

8485~~~
He probably had to ask Kai to lead him to 'Goobisn' to be fair.

8486~~~
I just thought traveling was usually discouraged when you were injured, especially if flying, but obviously he's been cleared to do so and I agree it is good to keep him involved, which makes it doubly strange that the greatest captain LvG has ever had is staying behind to watch another team play.

8487~~~
maybe this is his 'beckham alice band' moment

8488~~~
I dont care if he scores a goal or not for us, I just want to see players who are not fit and not good enough dropped.. he is certainly our worst player this season, hard to pick anybody else really, and he captains us, this is fecking ridiculous! let alone he has wages of 6+ better players who could play for us, hes in fact worse than Gerrard was for Liverpool in his last years...

8489~~~
So done with this fecking guy. So done

8490~~~
I'm starting to get that feeling he's off in the summer. It's going to be interesting to see what happens, I can't imagine he'll go quietly.

And if he does go at the end of this season he won't be breaking the record.

8491~~~
He doesn't deserve it. I'll be glad to see a true red hold on to the record

8492~~~
Being driven around by his son, can't he afford a driver?

8493~~~
Too many fantastic psychics on the caf, it is fascinating. We barely have any information and already stories are created.

8494~~~
Maybe he's just on a different flight than the match day squad?

I find it hard to believe that the club captain is not travelling with the team for what's probably the most important match of the season so far. Unless of course, he's under orders and is staying back to recover from his ankle injury. (Although that apparently doesn't preclude him from travelling to Goodison to watch Everton.)

8495~~~
His kid looked like a fan y'day and at the weekend so I reckon he wants to go to matches, and Wayne has to drive him.
We're looking at our next big prospect here.

8496~~~
Erm, we are?

8497~~~
I was kind of joking but who knows?

8498~~~
1. LvG says Rooney is the best captain he has ever had.
2. The game vs Wolfsburg is one of the most important of the season.
3. LvG's best ever captain doesn't travel with the team. Instead Shaw travels whereas Rooney travels to Liverpool to watch Everton.

Something doesn't add up here.

8499~~~
Injured players never travel. Are Schneiderlin, Jones, Valencia, Rojo, and Ander travelling?

8500~~~
Not all injured players are captains. And Shaw who is injured has travelled. Why Shaw and not captain fantastic?

8501~~~
It is irrelevant if he is captain. Injured players have a routine to train and go to physio and that doesn't involve travelling to away games disrupting their recovery. 

Where is this proof that Shaw has travelled because I have yet to see it.

8502~~~
Don't know about Shaw, that was said above. The point is: If Rooney is really that important to the team with his captaincy (LVG's best captain ever) he should be with the team for the most important game of the season so far. It would be a big blow to finish 3rd in this easy CL group. Everything that can help in some way, no matter how small, should be used.

8503~~~
I've heard this phrase a few times now and I'm not sure what people think he'll do..

Turn up outside OT pissed up at 2am shouting "cnuts" and offering the ground a fight? Some LVG flavoured revenge porn perhaps?

But yeh I reckon he's finished. Bit part player for remainder of the season then gone.

Ogden in today's Indy quotes unnamed ex teammate as a saying that Rooney is "done".

A pretty rapid descent from top flight football beckons and, to paraphrase Morrissey, he knows it's over.

8504~~~
Yeah I think people blow that part out of proportion. The real problem is how do we get someone to buy and him pay him obscene money.

8505~~~
He missed this so that Herrera wouldn't feel sad and it further helped him accomodate. Unfortunately Herrera is a cnut and terrible human so he is still despicable shit player.

8506~~~
It's completely relevant, he is club captain, he should be there. I'm not buying all this bull shit, if he was injured there is no way he should have been allowed to go and watch Everton, the day before the biggest game of our season so far.

And if he was, it's a stupid decision. The captain should be with the 1st team, giving them advice and encouragement, otherwise what's the fecking point.

8507~~~
Don't r ally give a shit about him not traveling with the team. However, LVG said his ankle injury was nasty. So what's he doing walking around Liverpool and Evertonians at the game said he wasn't limping.

8508~~~
Has all the hallmarks of him being gradually phased out to me. He's also not daft and knows that being pictured watching Everton sends out certain messages.

Personally I don't think he's good enough for them anymore.

8509~~~
Subsidise it.

A team in the MLS can afford 6m/year. We'll cover the rest. I'd rather the club do that than have to suffer through the strange dominion he has over the team.

8510~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8511~~~
I've mentioned this before and how I think we can get around it.

As of next summer Rooney will have 3 years left on his deal. According to Stretford, Rooney can make over £300k a week but it's based on image rights and performances so lets assume that his flat rate on his contract is £250k a week which would make us liable for £39m.

If we can somehow manage to get £15m for him (not impossible for a player of his profile in this climate despite his obvious decline) we can hand that over to him as a severance package.

In his next contract he might hope to get a 4 year deal at a very conservative £100k (just think about the types of player who are picking that up these days). That would mean he can also get another £20.8m leaving him with £35.8m. We might need to negotiate and pay him another £4m on top to give him parity.

Obviously that's just rough figures based on what we know but you get an idea of how it could work. While its not ideal, we're going to have to take a hit but being £4m out of pocket with no Rooney is preferable to £39m and being lumped with him for the following 3 years.

8512~~~
He's suddenly getting nailed in the press from all angles. Weird. It's like everyone was scared to speak out or they weren't watching us play and just jumping on the bandwagon now. The press are shite

8513~~~
Not really bothered about him not travelling with the squad but it is peculiar seeing our club captain openly supporting one of our league opponents.

He has the freedom to go and see whoever the hell he likes but perhaps he should consider how it could be perceived? Perhaps he just doesn't care anymore.

I hope it's a sign he's on his way out.

8514~~~
At least half of this forum had their grannies shagged by Rooney so they can't wait but have a pop on him whenever possible, it's only logical explanation really!

8515~~~
Yeah this seems to be only logical way. Now, who would be willing to pay 15 million for him <i>and </i>100k to him..

8516~~~
Ogden: "Van Gaal has let Rooney down by failing to provide him with the necessary support and competition up front and the price for that could be paid in Wolfsburg."

Just cannot understand this reasoning, at all.

8517~~~
Ogden is a fecking idiot. Please give me a link to the article or post the article here. I don't want to give him clicks.

8518~~~
Bunch of johnny come latelys, Ive been waiting ten years for this, damned if Im not going to get stuck in with both boots!

8519~~~
LVG's only mistake was believing Rooney's promise that he would get him 25/30 goals. It is Rooney that has failed Van Gaal.

8520~~~
LVG failed himself, anyone with a brain could have seen Rooney wasn't going to get 25 goals this season

8521~~~
Ever met any newspaper journalists? Shithouses to a man. They smell blood now and have a sense that it's safe for them to have a pop. A pack of dogs they are.

8522~~~
I actually think that would be a nigh on impossible fee. Clubs outside of Europe tend not to pay fees - and if they do, they are nominal - for 'star' players (see Robbie Keane, Gerrard, Kaka, Anelka, Drogba, Giovinco, Beckham).

Then you look to the clubs in Europe - very few are going to pay such a relatively high fee solely on the basis of marketing potential because, let's face it, they won't be getting any return in terms of on-field performances. And which club could afford that, realistically, for an over-the-hill player who will demand massive wages? PSG - I don't see them having any inclination towards buying Rooney, simply because he's not good enough for their 'project'. After that, you've got some of the Turkish clubs - again, I can't see them willing to put in €20m <i>and</i> at least €6m in wages.

Basically, Rooney is our conspicuous lemon, and no manner of car salesman tactics will be able to shift him in a cost-effective way. The only viable way of moving him on is to subsidise his wages at another club.

8523~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Imagine watching us this season and thinking that instead of "Rooney has let Van Gaal down".

8524~~~
How's Rooney supposed to motivate himself (on £300k a week) without someone better than him keeping him on his toes.

He's only the club captain, he can't be expected to be mature enough to push himself.


Regarding Ogden, his networking skills far outweigh his journalistic integrity.

8525~~~
Not a very good article, really.

8526~~~
My comments are in response to Ogden saying LVG has let Rooney down. If there is anyone that has been let down here, it's LVG. Ogden's comments are madness.

8527~~~
I feel like I've let down Rooney with my last post. #justice4wazza

8528~~~
Ogden is stupid. We should have signed Kane or Lewandowski? As if their clubs will give them to us on a plate. The only thing he's right about is at we've backed the wrong horse. Rooney isn't a fading player. Compared to what we need, he's faded already.

8529~~~
You look how Martial's wife posted pictures of their baby in United gear. Martial might not be a United fan but he knows it is what fans will be delighted to see. Rooney always shows his kids in Everton stuff. He is not and never will be a red. Whoever his PR people are they are idiots.

8530~~~
Just found out he's now with the Independent.

8531~~~
Hardly, I have always said this guy has the best PR and agent in the business. How this guy can be United and England Captain and be on 300k a week given his shower of shite performances for club and country for the last 3 years is amazing. Also most of the press around him up until a few weeks ago have been uber positive, almost as if anyone who said anything negative would be assassinated.

8532~~~
Noel Gallagher was right about him you can't change a Scouser. It has always been obvious, he doesn't have any affection for he club. He's wanted to leave twice. We don't owe him any loyalty.

8533~~~
"United would have been transformed with a Robert Lewandowski or a Harry Kane in their ranks, but instead they backed a fading force who will not even be in Wolfsburg when it truly matters tonight."

Ogden is right here. He is making some superficial excuses for Rooney's performances but his actual message is that Rooney is declining and LVG has made a huge mistake by backing him.

8534~~~
As in we'll start hearing reports that Rooney is confused and angry and all that bollocks. Like the last time a manager dared to drop him for playing like shit. His pals in the media doing his dirty work, that sort of thing.

I think him going to Everton last night is more than just a bloke going to watch a team he supports. There'll be all sorts of petty shite going on now until the Summer,

He is finished though yeah.

8535~~~
Spot the odd one out <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8536~~~
But he says LVG has let him down by backing him. If we signed any of those players, Rooney would have been on the bench permanently.

8537~~~
Giovinco? He's still a 'star' player in terms of the MLS, and is currently tearing it up there.

8538~~~
LvG has let United down by not signing a big name striker, yes, but Rooney has also let LvG down by now repaying the faith shown in him.

8539~~~
That is probably the other way round. Pretty sure he probably asked Woody for one, United didn't deliver. We were linked with Benzema, Lewa, Kane and Muller

8540~~~
Ed has let United down. I'll get it right yet.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8541~~~
That article is the usual list of excuses for Rooney's form, propped up with the (reluctant) criticism that can no longer be avoided now that reality has set in.

8542~~~
I will say this. Rooney has been poor and we should have never went into the season with him as our main striker.
Saying that I have no doubt if we had bothered to invest in a quality wide player for the RW and played a more expansive style, he still would be shite but he would have scored more goals this season.
We still don't score goals when he doesn't play anyway because the team plays shite football with or without him. Slightly better without him though

8543~~~
He's wary of coming across as being too harsh on Rooney and therefore makes some stupid excuses. Rooney is still England's captain after all.

8544~~~
We hear that about anyone who is about to be shipped out don't we? RVP, Chicharito, Falcao, ADM, Nani etc etc Always the same bleating deserved or not. As for the press they're turning on him and ex team mates are now admitting he's done. He has nothing to be confused about (I think he knows the game is up) and the decision to end his career with us will I think be proven the correct one as he continues to decline elsewhere.

He'll be gone and forgotten remarkably quickly for someone who has scored so many goals for us.

8545~~~
Robbie Keane

8546~~~
Robbie Keane has been better than any of those players since moving over there.  Never top top class but a severely underrated player by many.

8547~~~
Not like Noel "Renaissance Man" Gallagher to stereotype. Seems you can't change a Bertie with a chip on their shoulder either.

Rooney's loyalty has always been to himself and there's nothing particularly wrong with that. He kissed a United badge in front of the Everton fans and would happily kiss theirs in front of ours if given the chance.

Like I said earlier this is no love affair and when he's gone there'll be no great anguish on our part despite his achievements.

8548~~~
Using Shearer and Sheringham as examples is a bit disingenuous, too. 

Okay, yes, statistically Shearer's scoring rate did drop off, but he still had a better record than most when he became ancient (every day post-30 apparently). Sheringham played until he was about 48 so obviously his post-30 rate will be considerably lower than that pre-30.

Also neglects to mention that Drogba had his best season ever for Chelsea at the age of 32.

8549~~~
Ireland's all-time top scorer with 67 goals. Consistently proficient in the PL. Possibly the best MLS player since he went there.

He's still a <i>relative</i> star in that league.

8550~~~
Absolutely. It feels a lot like when we let Falcao go, I was never for a second worried that he'd go and prove us wrong. He was clearly finished.

8551~~~
Relative is the key word

8552~~~
This is the first time Rooney has ever been seen/gone to an Everton match since playing for us right?

This could be something very innocent, or he is making a public statement. It really does feel like it's going to end soon and badly though.

8553~~~
How did you come to that conclusion?

8554~~~
Nope

8555~~~
LVG has let Rooney down by making him captain, playing him every game regardless of form/fitness, publicly defending him to the death and saying he is his best ever captain? i thought the Garth Crooks piece couldnt be topped, bloody hell

8556~~~
Another contract extension? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

8557~~~
It will be an absolute travesty if he ever breaks the goal scoring record.

How any United fan can want Rooney to overtake Sir Bobby as our all time greatest goalscorer is just beyond me. Sir Bobby represents everything that this great club is about, he is the perfect icon for the club. Rooney taking over that mantle would make me sick to my stomach.

8558~~~
To be fair, as much as I agree, I wouldn't be half as bad if he was playing well when he broke it.

It's more frustrating to think he might end up crossing the line purely from penalties, 3 yard headers and deflections off his arse (all while playing shite for 89 minutes).

8559~~~
Yeah, Rooney scoring goals and helping the team would be really frustrating.

8560~~~
Not what was said at all.

8561~~~
You agreed it would be a travesty for Rooney to break the goal scoring record and would find it even more frustrating if he did it through shit goals. I honestly don't care about the record and don't see how any United player scoring goals- especially the way we're playing atm- could be a 'travesty' or 'frustrating'. I'd much rather just see us getting on the score sheet, even if it means Rooney breaking Sir Bobby's record with his arse.

8562~~~
he crawled to the England record including penalties against shit teams

8563~~~
How is he the odd one out? His career is easily better than Giovinco's and he was consistently as good if not a better goal scorer than Anelka. He even continues to be successful compared to Anelka who has done feck all in the last 5 years. His international record is also miles better than Anelka.

8564~~~
Anyone else find it weird that our captain isn't even there to cheer the lads on? It's a 2 hour flight and it's not like he's hospital bound...

8565~~~
I remember reading many fans stating that Falcao would go to Chelsea and immediately become the best striker in the league.
Apparently LVG was the one who was preventing him from scoring goals (or staying on his feet).
To me, it was obvious that he was "done". I see Rooney and last year's Falcao and he will will be sold in the Summer.

8566~~~
whereas every single goal of Charlton's was a 45 yarder against Brazil at the world cup finals

8567~~~
Was at the Everton match last night with his sons. Can we please swap him with Lukaku?

8568~~~
He had 1 in a world cup semi in the year he won the Balon d'or though.

But you are right, record is record, no matter how you get there.

8569~~~
Glad he got the England one, but I can't see him getting the United one, as at his current rate he'll have to stay a regular until a couple of seasons time. Which is pretty optimistic
Don't overly want to get to a Beckham-esque mode, where he's wheeled out for pens or against Exeter in the league cup to help hype it up

8570~~~
He just really wants to watch the BT Sport coverage.

8571~~~
Who did that with Beckham?

8572~~~
Couldn't make the flight cos he went to the Everton game, which is really weird.

Is it true that even Luke Shaw travelled?

8573~~~
he wont get it this season,but can see him getting it next season if he stays...just 13 goals...already has 7 this season.

8574~~~
He might be talking about Beckham's last few England caps when he was chasing the outfield record for most caps.

8575~~~
Fair enough I guess, England aren't that good though and Beckham was still good enough.

8576~~~
Him going to Wolfsburg and going to the Everton game aren't related at all.

I'm yet to see any proof that Shaw travelled and neither have any of the other injured players.

8577~~~
the majority of his last caps were bit part to say the least

8578~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2015/12/photo-luke-shaw-snapped-on-man-utd-flight-to-wolfsburg/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2015/12/photo-luke-shaw-snapped-on-man-utd-flight-to-wolfsburg/</a>

8579~~~
Some shit site who link to a tweet that has been deleted, so no proof.

8580~~~
He was  a 34/35 y.o playing in the MLS, and I think a lot of England fans would have preferred someone younger. In the end, playing Beckham didnt really reap much dividends for England.

8581~~~
I tried.

8582~~~
Playing other young players like Joe Cole, Bentley and Downing didn't reap much dividends either. Beckham showed on during his loan spells he was still better than them.

8583~~~
Not having a go at him. Would be stupid considering he did not play. But we have created more chances in the last two games than we have in many weeks put together. 
Even though we didn't get the results we wanted in both games,I think the attackers have shown enough for Rooney not to walk back into the team. 
But I'm not holding my breath.

8584~~~
I agree.

8585~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3355194/Wayne-Rooney-offered-75m-join-Sven-Goran-Eriksson-Chinese-Super-League.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...Sven-Goran-Eriksson-Chinese-Super-League.html</a>
The size of that contract<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>   Probably tax free also.

8586~~~
Can you imagine him in China though?

8587~~~
No. Coleen would have non of it.

8588~~~
Yep. Very fat after 12 months on sweet & sour pork balls and half a dozen Tsingtaos every evening.

8589~~~
The Chinese. A great bunch of lads.

8590~~~
I think Wayne would be great for improving the global appeal of the Chinese league, and although I will be said to see him leave, I am prepared to do so for the good of world football in general.


<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">like feck</span>

8591~~~
Flying is generally not so good for injuries. He will recover far better at home.

8592~~~
It could actually be an interesting move for Wayne, if these tabloid rumours are true with the Chinese Super League and Sven. Of course, the money mentioned is obscene, so nothing new on that front, but do any of the "reports" mention a price, cause all I see are potential wages...

8593~~~
Tbf, I'm sure quite a few of us on here would be happy if United paid them to take Rooney off our hands.

8594~~~
If we wanted Rooney to leave, I don't think we would ask a team prepared to takes his wages on, for a transfer fee.

8595~~~
Maybe so. But would you not have thought differently before this season started? Not that he'd fetch 20m + but a fee nonetheless. This season may have changed all that. The quickest regression in the history of football.

8596~~~
fixed it for you <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

8597~~~
RI seem convinced about him not being missing through injury...

8598~~~
If it's true, we will know soon enough.

8599~~~
Great time for Rooney to experiment again.

8600~~~
It's speculative, and it's not anyone on this forum saying it....

But.....

It's very strange how RI are digging their heels in over this

Personally, him at the Everton game and the whole "gimmie the armband" is/was enough to wash my hands off him but, this whole thing is quite strange. There are lads on GOT(Everton forum) saying they saw him on Monday and he wasn't one bit injured...

8601~~~
The claims are pretty serious, especially the UNICEF gala stuff, they surely must have some proof.

8602~~~
What happen at the UNICEF gala?

8603~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8604~~~
I would take what they say with a pinch of salt, going through their twitter they seem to be very aggressive in their opinions. Calling Woodward an idiot, sharing his number and e-mail etc. Probably just bitter.

8605~~~
What thread? Looked in the Rooney thread and don't see any mention of him not being injured. Granted I'm falling asleep so I may of missed it.

8606~~~
Calling this up on the whole "oh you're bitter" thing

Don't care about the Rooney thing but, it seems to be a growing trend on here, that when someone doesn't like something, they are forever labelled as "bitter" <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> It's ridiculous and laughable

Not saying anything against <a class="username" data-user="78579, @Womp" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78579/">@Womp</a> btw. Not having a go at you

8607~~~
Best look at RI's twitter. Quite bizarre how they are not backing down over it. Their choice of language is a bit much

8608~~~
We've all said about how poor Rooney's become and the buzzards have been circling for some time.
I think they've now  landed and have started to rip and tear at flesh!

Will this toxic atmosphere stop Rooney from ever returning?

8609~~~
He'll be back soon enough, could well be his most important 3-4 months at the club in a long time for him though, as if his bad form continues then I'm pretty sure that will be that, and we'll do everything we can to move him on the summer. 

That though won't be an easy thing to do, who will possibly want him in those wages? And btw there is no chance he'll go to China.

8610~~~
Has the club denied the rumours in any capacity? Directly or otherwise?

I haven't seen anything and that's what I find the most intriguing aspect here. As captain and the leading player/figure of their brand (through honorary title and ambassadorial duties over performance), it would be Rooney that offers the greatest damage to that image should his professional integrity be tarnished in any way. Letting these rumours persist (they've been shared onto other higher end media outlets too, not just forums and hearsay) and not nipping them in the bud goes against the standard PR practice and code for any company. I've not seen even a standard response detailing a (even possibly an obvious) ghost injury to mask these claims as a rebuttal.

8611~~~
What happened at the UNICEF gala?

8612~~~
No. The club haven't made any comments. The journalists have refused to ask.

8613~~~
I'm starting to think that these guys might not like Rooney...

8614~~~
What are the claims then? Why exactly is he absent then?

8615~~~
Going to china at the age of 30 is an insultingly humiliating situation. If it's me i choose retirement.

They'll treat you like some kind of exotic panda and make you clap anr smile infront of the fans, who likes to see a guailo, a white walkers being tamed and performs funny battle dance as he can't actually do any real battle and probably features on some chinese erection medication 

fecking humiliation i tell you

8616~~~
No need to slag Rooney off. We know he might be reaching a point of no return. It's not like he's playing 'bad' on purpose. He's given us the best years of his life and if he moves on at some point, he'll have had plenty of great moments in a United shirt. He's done things we don't like but so do a lot of players. I like Wayne and I hope he can find that spark again but maybe United need something new at this point.

8617~~~
I want him gone so much so that I won't bat an eyelid if the Scousers waned him.

8618~~~
I said immediately that he wasn't injured. He needed to be dropped and they didn't want to deal with the shitstorm that would result. Rooney himself surely knows how bad he's been, they rewatch every game as a team so I'm sure it's blindingly obvious to everyone. He probably agreed to it cause none of them want to deal with the media fallout of LVG dropping his captain.

8619~~~
Not sure I buy that he's simply been dropped . . . there could be other things going on behind the scenes, but if it was all simply down to his form, then why not at least have him on the bench? I mean, what, Nick Powell is a better option?

And if they're too scared to put him on the bench because of some potential media 'shitstorm', then that is extremely weak management.

8620~~~
Hungrier, more energy, while we wait to sign a replacement in January.

8621~~~
<i>Slightly</i> dramatic scenario there, Sky. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8622~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Nick Powell's career at the top level is going to the dogs, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11314422/Manchester-United-FC-news-Leicester-City-rip-up-Nick-Powell-loan-deal-after-exasperating-coaches.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">precisely because</a> he's said to lack the hunger and professionalism required to be an elite player.

8623~~~
Perhaps Wayne tried to sneak Valdes in? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

8624~~~
Couldn't agree more. The most sensible thing would have been to drop him a few months ago due to poor form. Offically. 

Then we have van Gaal hinting at something he doesn't want to say out loud, that we are nowhere near good enough (which Moyes said time and again). But he had loads of cash to rectify that and he's let go of a host of players, with Hernandez tearing it up in Germany and he's had time to build a team that should be a hell of a lot stronger than what we currently see going forward.

8625~~~
He has look much more determined since coming back from that injury.Joyce also said he's in greater shape than ever.

8626~~~
Re: him not being injured - was there not an image of him with a fairly long gash down his quad-region?* I seem to remember seeing a picture.

*Ignore. It was across his abs/side of his stomach. I'm losing it.

8627~~~
Where, in training? It was his first game for United since August 2014, and his first game for any club since December 2014.

8628~~~
That would certainly backup our claims that he's out with a heavy ankle injury.

8629~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8630~~~
The clue that he might actually be dropped for me is in LVG post Leicester comments. He said he was already planning to take Rooney off due to poor performance,when he got injured around the 55th minute. That's very early and shows LVG was already getting frustrated with his showings. LVG almost never takes Rooney off.
He might really be injured but LVG might also be in no rush to have him back.

8631~~~
U21s matches.

8632~~~
From what he said it seemed like he was going to take off Martial if not for Rooney's injury.

8633~~~
Heh. I think he'll be back soon. Can't get rid of Wayne Rooney like this. It's too easy.

8634~~~
He also said he was thinking of taking Rooney off because he wasn't running in behind.

8635~~~
Which might be a slightly lower level than the champions league.

8636~~~
I think he's injured. But the club should have given more info about the nature of the injury and the period of recovery in order to avoid the rumours.

8637~~~
We're talking about how determined he looks isn't it?If he's lazy he'll be lazy whatever level he plays in.I'm not talking about how he looks like a world beater in U21s football or something.

8638~~~
Well, the captain has special privileges.

8639~~~
Okay. But if the argument for having him on the bench ahead of Rooney is that he's looked more determined in youth football - after having played no senior football for a year - I think it's a weak one.

8640~~~
They said it's an ankle injury and heavier than first thought. We don't always give an ETA on each player, usually just when it's a standard injury with a predictable recovery time. Ankles are complicated, especially fat ones.

8641~~~
What's suspicious about all this is that no one is even trying to make news about it, even if there isn't much to write about. Just "Is Rooney dropped or injured" headline would cause lots of reactions but from what I have seen everyone is quiet about it, except fan boards. Probably just shows how pretty much everyone in medie is up his arse, probably because he is paying lot of money to them to keep things quiet if it isn't in his favour. Weirdest thing of all is that no one even mentioned him in last press conference, not even van Gaal. 

I mean, there are reports that Manchester United captain was drunk/hangover(?) on Manchester United training and no one even asks anything about it, really?

8642~~~
Not a single journo asked for update on his injury. LVG is probably relieved at he isn't a topic of discussion.

8643~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Remarkable conclusion to draw!

Anything remotely positive about Rooney in the media = Media are up his arse.
Negative news in the media about Rooney = Must be true! Rooney is the wurst!
No news in the media = OMG! Rooney must have paid them off!

8644~~~
You don't think it's suspicious they don't ask about their/your beloved Wayne showing drunk on training during our CL exit after they ask pointless questions  about him every time?

8645~~~
So what happened at the unicef gala?

8646~~~
given December off, chills out at Goodison Park, we crash out of champions league and the captain hasn't had to face any of the shitstorm whatsoever. the boy's done well

8647~~~
"Beloved". Yeah mate, it's the media's fault and fault of the tiny majority of United supporters for not putting much stock in news until it's been reported by people who are not a bunch of complete cnuts. Instead, what we should do is assume the worst and criticize Rooney and the media for not being complete bellends like some on this forum.

8648~~~
Ignorant answer as always from you on this forum.

8649~~~
I don't think you know what ignorant means.

Instead of replying to my points you have twice resorted to mundane nonsense.

8650~~~
You actually think it's realistic to believe that Rooney is paying off every journalist that attend our pressers? It's really suspicious that only fan boards believe a bunch of retards on Twitter. The media should obviously write and base their articles on those rumours.

8651~~~
What points?

I only made one conclusion out of three you said I did in your first post, which was fairly accurate. I didn't even say I believe those reports.

Of course it's shocking that no one asked about him showing drunk when they are asking ridiculous questions about him all the time. When you have United press conference without any Wayne Rooney question it's weird, let alone when there are reports of him being dropped.

8652~~~
Player or two made arses of themselves apparently

8653~~~
Not every, but there is lot of his pals in media. And I was talking about media in general, not just those who attend our press conference, I can't blame them all because they mostly have just one question to ask, few of them don't even get to ask single question, right?

8654~~~
Actually, that's the very reason I think it's bs. If there was anything true to it the media would have got stuck into Rooney. You need to look at past behavior to see that the media love sticking into star players who have personal issues off the pitch. Rooney is a prime example of this in the past as well. The idea that Rooney is paying off people is just ridiculous.

8655~~~
Was Rooney one of them ?

8656~~~
The key word there is "past". They blamed him for everything in the past, I agree, however majority of them refuse to criticise him in last few years at all, even this year when he is one of our worst players.

8657~~~
Drunken embarrassment according RI.

8658~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8659~~~
I don't give a shit if he's injured or dropped, I'm just happy he's not playing. You should enjoy it while it lasts.

8660~~~
I've lost count of the number of Rooney is past it articles I've read in the last few months. People love to point out the more positive reviews which help in painting this image of Rooney as someone who controls the media. Rooney, like Beckham before him, has been subject to as much criticism as praise by the English media.

8661~~~
Don't know. Depay's name was thrown about

8662~~~
I know some have criticised him, but lot of them still refuse to do it at all, and not just that, but they actually write same old rubbish that's quite embarrasing for kids in school to write, not even his fanboys here would agree with that, but yet people who work for big newspapers who have massive influence on football fans' opinions write that.

8663~~~
I thought the drunken stuff was just rumours?

8664~~~
The Christmas party was cancelled too...

8665~~~
as opposed to weekly professional embarrassment

8666~~~
No one called Beckham's professionalism into account. That's because he gave them no reason too.

Rooney's professionalism is shite.

8667~~~
so this was at a private party? him getting drunk?

8668~~~
I've absolutely no idea. I just know the club's Christmas party was cancelled

8669~~~
Performance thread <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> So even when he's not playing he plays shit.

8670~~~
Anyway, I was hoping he'd get a slight injury a few weeks back because I think he needs time off. I do believe he's in a steep decline, and isn't going to get out of it, but he's not <i>as </i>bad as he's shown in his last few games.

I also think LvG has been consciously trying to drop him all season (when it became apparent how bad his decline was). But he can't just drop him. He had to play him and let everyone see how poor he was, otherwise he'd have been ripped to pieces by supporters and media alike. Rooney in this form (decline) represents a massive problem. Will have to be moved on, but I have no clue how or where.

8671~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8672~~~
if he comes back into the starting 11 without any competition I am going to switch my mind to wanting van gaal to be sacked ASAP. against wolfsburg and even in the 0-0 vs west ham our attack looked more functional without him.

didn't moyes get absolutely leathered here for doing something similar with van persie?

8673~~~
He got ridiculed because he admitted he didn't sub RvP off against Newcastle because he was afraid of the reaction from the fans.

8674~~~
We know about LvG. What did Rooney do?

8675~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8676~~~

8677~~~
Let's see if some of you have the balls to give him some love..  "We don't need him, he adds nothing to our squad and to our performances"..

8678~~~
Yeah because he would have done so much better today...

8679~~~
Not exactly missing him, but we're not exactly playing brilliantly like most thought we would be without him.

8680~~~
Games without him this season:
2-1 loss vs PSV
3-2 loss vs Wolfsburg
3-1 win vs Liverpool
2-1 win vs Watford
0-0 draw vs West Ham
2-1 loss to Bournemouth

Clearly the problem goes a bit further then he's just past it doesn't it?

8681~~~
Of course. It was ridiculous when people were suggesting if he was dropped we'd suddenly improve. He was far from the only cause, he just simply didn't help matters.

8682~~~
He was never the whole problem, far from it. But he is not the answer either. We need a better player.

8683~~~
WTF would he have done today?

Pointless post.

8684~~~
Defend like a pro, create chances, hold everybody accountable when we got down and maybe the most important thing: play for the crest..

8685~~~
No one said otherwise. There's a lot of problems with this team, starting with the manager.

Doesn't change the fact that he <i>is </i>past it though. And his performances have been woeful.

8686~~~
yep. although reading the amount of idiots saying he was the main problem was unreal.

2 defeats and a 0-0 in the biggest historical home banker we've had in premier history

8687~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ok.

8688~~~
a lot, of people said otherwise. This place can be very foolish, especially after bad displays

8689~~~
Things have played out well for him by being absent for our CL exit and some lacklustre results, I would hope as captain he would return and lift the squad because we really need somebody to do that.

8690~~~
I'm not saying they haven't, but at the same time, I'm basically 99% sure that he would look <b>a lot </b>better under a manager who played a more counter attacking style, as would the rest of our attack. He's just not suited to Van Gaal's style at all, and it's making him look a lot worse then he probably is.

8691~~~
When was the last time he did all that then?

Usually too busy puffing his guts up after 5 minutes or chasing his first touch.

8692~~~
Absolutely. Since LVG took over not a single striker has looked competent in our system. Doesn't change the fact that Rooney should still be gone in the summer though.

8693~~~
I'm certain we've been a far better attacking side since Rooney's been out. We created chances again today, vs Wolfsburg, and vs West Ham. We've gone to shit at the other end of the pitch, but lets not pretend this loss of form is anything to do with Rooney.

8694~~~
We absolutely have been. Unfortunately it's not enough but there's no denying we look better (at least more dangerous) without him. 

But again, it's not enough. 

Rooneys still finished.

8695~~~
errrr.....

8696~~~
Rooney's defending is so fecking under-rated here..  Sick and tired of hearing how all the fault always goes to him(of course he has to take some, because his level should be carrying us to win trophys) and some others are never put to the sword.  The simple fact is we are a better side with #10 playing.

8697~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This is a pretty good attempt at trolling, a little bit too obvious though.

8698~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8699~~~
Obviously yes. I was surprised to see so many being happy that he is out because in the end it's never going to help Man Utd to have less players available.

8700~~~
You lot a probably the same people that booed Fellaini in pre-season..  Maybe call Dortmund if Kagawa is for sale at 25m..?

8701~~~
I try to be supportive of underperforming players as much as anyone, but Rooney has just been woeful this season. He's made one assist in 30 Premier league games.

With Fellaini getting a goal that now ties him with Rooney on 2 goals in the league. Fellaini has however managed this playing about 440 minutes wheres Rooney has played 1048.

Fellaini for me is an example of a player who gets far too much stick unfairly, Rooney on the other hand is a player who should be sat on the bench until his level of performance improves.

8702~~~
Our Under 21's losing a league game doesn't alter the fact Rooney is finished, he's not the whole problem, but him and LvG between them are the bulk of it and should both move on down the road.

8703~~~
Rooney's work without the ball is getting no love and that's the main reason I keep bringing this up.. Of course he needs to produce more but feck me, that second goal isn't happening if he's the in the box. Defending set-pieces cost us a UCL spot and is putting our title challenge in jeopardy..

8704~~~
Whats telling is, Im sure we are creating more chances without him and more importantly, no one is saying 'if Rooney was playing we would have won'

8705~~~
His work without the ball as a striker/forward is to link-up well with other players by making runs and finding space. So far this season, he has been shocking at both.

Him falling back to the half-way line to knock 5-yard passes sideways, bumping into BFS half the time, then making his way to left-back position against PSV is not something to celebrate or admire. It's an incredibly immature and ill-disciplined way to conduct yourself when you're supposed to be a forward on the pitch to score goals. He's a headless chicken, there's no method to the madness when he does that and the fact he's still doing it at 30 years of age is testament to his lack of intelligence (football intelligence I mean). That lack of intelligence is why the suggestions he could drop deep in his later years and become a Giggs/Scholes figure is so laughable, it's frankly frightening how some people would consider that.

And as for your set-pieces stuff. Well then we might as well just play Fellaini up top each match from now on then.

8706~~~
Rooney remains our best outfield player. 

Yes, he is not the fantastic young Rooney of years past. But he is still much better than anyone else we have. 

Until we get better players and a manager who can utilize them... it is foolish to blame Rooney for our problems.

8707~~~
News flash. You're high. Go recover.

8708~~~
That is just blatantly not true. Either you're trolling or you haven't seen Rooney play for the last few seasons.

8709~~~
nick, this isn't 2004! In the words of Sam Johnstone, 'your drunk'.

8710~~~
Rooney being out the team is not the problem, his actual replacement (herrera) being out is. I honestly think if Herrera was playing we would be doing better.

Whilst were not playing well, Rooney was just terrible. He was playing like a player past it, with his passing and first touch. Its one thing if were playing terrible which is not helping him, but he was not helping us either.

8711~~~
Decent goodnight fairytales. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8712~~~
Play for the crest?  The one he held for ransom twice now?  Yea, right.  Loyalty.

8713~~~
That'll be the same Wayne Rooney who removed <i>every trace of Manchester United imagery</i> from his website and his Facebook account when he had his dispute with SAF.

8714~~~
Spot on.

8715~~~
Rooney has been terrible this season.

Average last season.

The best player in the Moyes season.

Terrible the year before. Excellent in the second half of the season before that.

I hate when people say he has been finished for 3 years.

8716~~~
Best outfield player. De Gea was our best player that season.

He's certainly not been <i>finished </i>for three years, but 2011/2012 is the last brilliant season he had. The last season where you could've realistically ranked him as one of the best players in the Premier League.

8717~~~
He is nothing now-a-days, almost a 10 vs 11 every time he starts. When he's injured, we play Fellaini and Mata in his position. One is not the player you rely on to play the ball on the feet while the other will never grow into the position in this league. We needed Herrera, sadly he was injured too. Pereira, he didn't exist until Bournemouth.

We haven't won not because he was absent but because the competent replacements were not in contention.

8718~~~
Our attack has generally (bar West Ham) looked better without him.

8719~~~
Our problems were never down to one individual. If that weer the case we'd be doing well in attack and even his laughable peformances would have been masked to a small extent. We are poor in attack. There's no doubt about that. The issue with our attack is that it's being let down by individuals that aren't good enough (other than opinions on system etc). And Rooney is a big part of that. He isn't the only part but a very big one especially considering what he's being paid and him staring every single game he's fit unlike other problem parts like Fellaini.

8720~~~
Why do people always have to rewrite history when a player has been out for a while or playing in another position?

8721~~~
And games with him:

0-0 draw vs Newcastle at home
2-1 loss vs Swansea
3-0 loss vs Arsenal
0-0 draw vs Palace
0-0 draw vs Boro at home (played 75 min, missed a pen)
0-0 draw vs Eindhoven at home

Now, you'd struggle to find a single post claiming that Rooney is our <i>only</i> problem. But he is a <i>big</i> problem. Not only because he has scored only 5 league goals from open play this calendar year but because he provides zero creativity (1 assist in the league over 30 games) and has been generally terrible while collecting higher wages than virtually any other player on the planet bar Messi and Ronaldo. The problem with his presence is not only his poor form and decline but also the fact that we have not strengthened our attack because of him. We should have signed at least 2 class strikers in the summer and we added only a highly talented kid in Martial. We planned the season with Rooney as our main man in attack and this was a crucial mistake that has already costed us in the CL and could well cost us a top 4 finish in the league if we fail to sign a class striker in January.

BTW, the sample of games you mention does not take into account two important facts: (1) we've had many injuries recently and (2) we've created more chances without Rooney. Our losses this week do not vindicate Rooney in the slightest. On the contrary, they highlighted the mistake not to strenghen enough our attack in the summer.

8722~~~
The problem is that most of you compare Rooney to the old Rooney, and not Rooney to the other players we have NOW.

Can you please name a couple of outfield players who have been so much better than Rooney in the past 18 months that we have been under LVG?

Mata? He has been shit. Plus... Rooney helps him a lot because the opposition defense is more concerned with Rooney, so Mata has more space.

Martial? He has been here a few months only, we don't know what will happen long term.

Di Maria?
Young?
Valencia?
BFS?
Carrick?
Fellaini?


Who???

8723~~~
Had me until this. Now I know you're not watching.

8724~~~
But you didn't answer the question.

8725~~~
The answer is that any player has been better than Rooney this season, even Fellaini and Memphis. Smalling, Blind, Schneiderlin, Mata, Martial have been substantially better than Rooney. Rooney hasn't contributed anything in the league. If you took out his 2 goals, we'd be on the same points and the same position in the league. Take out Mata's or even Blind's contributions in attack and we would be worse off. Rooney's only important contribution over nearly 20 games this season has been the winner vs CSKA. Even a conference level player could score that goal though, it wasn't anything special.

8726~~~
Glad he's injured, because we're proper ripping it up without him.

NOT!

8727~~~
And? This shows that Rooney has been good for us?

What do you thnk about his future at the club? Do we need him in order to make progress?

8728~~~
Said it yesterday. If we can replace him with someone better, then great. But right now? He's useful. Experienced, influential, can play in a number of different positions.

The hounding of him by the boo boys is a disgrace to this football club.

8729~~~
Half the squad is out injured at the same time you can't really draw any conclusions from that.

8730~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

He can play in a number of different positons. Badly. A No 10 who has assisted one league goal all year (and it was off-side, tbf). And a No 9 who has scored 5 league goals from open play this year, i.e., as many as Lewandowski scored for 9 min. He is ridiculously bad if you take into account his wages. That's a disgrace.

8731~~~
You can if you are a Rooney fan though and think that he is still one of our best players. Delusion reigns.

8732~~~
Whatevs. Been out for 3 games, we haven't won one of them, and he's still somehow the issue and the problem.

8733~~~
Of course he is part of the problem because we've wasted a lot of time in trying to play him into form and failed to strengthen the attack in the summer. We used him when Herrera was fit and on the bench. We didn't buy a top striker because we had to play Rooney up front. He's not the only problem, no-one claims this. He's just a substantial part of the problem.

8734~~~
I have a feeling his privileges have ended and even when he returns, he isn't guaranteed to start. LVG at this point has nothing to lose.

8735~~~
LVG has already lost a lot by making Rooney our main man in attack. It is too late to rectify this huge mistake unless we sign a top forward in January. I'm afraid the wheels may be coming off.

8736~~~
Outfield player who have been better than Rooney over the last 18 months:
Herrera
Young
Smalling
Blind
Shaw this season before injury
Bfs
Lingard

8737~~~
I tend to think that he's injured indeed but nothing I saw on tv suggested that it was the ankle that got injured? Or I'm wrong?

8738~~~
<a class="username" data-user="95966, @Maradona10" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95966/">@Maradona10</a> keep the conspiracy bullshit out of this thread. If you want to discuss that nonsense make a new thread in the United forum.

8739~~~
I saw it on TV too. I thought it showed him having his ankle looked at after he was subbed off.

8740~~~
Agree with the rest of the post, but Lingard?

8741~~~
Looking at that we have had only 1 nil-nil without Rooney in the team out of 6 this season.

9 goals in 6 games is an average of 1.5 goals per game which I would suspect is a lot higher than when Rooney's playing.

8742~~~
I dont understand this, its very normal to post this in the rooney thread. Why should i post it anywhere else. May be you are just another fanboy who fails to see there are deper issues behind such a sharp decline of a player. The things you call "bullshit", were proven right when rio released his book and what he said on moyes. If you dont like the post skip over it. You dont have to reply now do you?

8743~~~
My feeling is that the Rooney supporters don't actually watch our games or check the stats/numbers.
If any player in the EPL or Championship had those stats, he'd be benched and then sold at the earliest opportunity.

8744~~~
What the feck are you on about? This thread is to discuss his performances, like I said if you want to talk about other shit make a thread. It's quite simple.

8745~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/12054616/Man-Utd-news-David-de-Gea-praises-Wayne-Rooney-for-keeping-the-dressing-room-together.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...y-for-keeping-the-dressing-room-together.html</a>

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>David de Gea praises Wayne Rooney for keeping the dressing room together</b></span>

De Gea said: “As our captain he has a big personality. He always tries to motivate us. When things are going badly it’s always him who speaks up and encourages us.

“He’s breaking all kinds of records for goals scored and games played and I reckon he deserves it as he is such a great player.

He added: “This league is very tough to win and there will be a number of teams who will be in the shake-up for the title.

“That’s what we all want, to stay up near the top, and to get to April and be in a position where we can win the league. That’s what we’re going to try to make happen.”

8746~~~
Breaking all sorts of records. 

If by records he means scales. Then yes.

8747~~~
True Dave but hilarious timing to bring up goalscoring.

8748~~~
I think it's different with Rooney. I never boo any United players even the likes of Fellaini and Young when they were getting criticised for long periods. I agree that some players should be sold for the good of the club but never hound them out.

Rooney on the other hand has taken this club for a ride at times. Two transfer requests, claiming we don't show enough ambition and that we need better players, now he's the worst player in our team but yet still the highest earner, captain and starts every week. I've never respected him and don't consider him a United legend like some do. No doubt he was a fantastic player and played a big part in our success but if he was bold enough to come forward and challenge the club when he was at his best then it's not disrespectful to challenge him when he's playing like this and being paid outrageous amounts of money that he basically got from forcing the club into a corner.

8749~~~
He's far from the worst player in our team. That is just silly to say that.

8750~~~
He is the biggest let down

8751~~~
Who has been worse than Rooney for Utd in the calendar year of 2015?

Nobody.

8752~~~
Erm, no he clearly is. Based on actual performances so far this season, he is comfortably the worst footballer we have regardless of his past exploits or his current salary.

8753~~~
Who in 2015 has consistently looked good as a striker at United. Is partly him partly the system. Can't compare what has generally been his role in the team to other players, as his role is possibly the most demanding.

8754~~~
Nice to see the new defenses of him. 

Reminds me of Rawk fever with Lucas. The longer a player is out, the better he seems to be. 

Give it a few games. Welcome back captain.

8755~~~
Martial. He's been class apart from 2-3 games. He hasn't been prolific in the league but unlike Rooney he has been good on the ball and dangerous.

The other strikers - RvP and Falcao - are past it and it is obvious in their new teams as well. Mind, they were still better than Rooney. Falcao scored/assisted a league goal every 166 min. Rooney has needed 525 min to contribute a league goal this season. He's been terrible.

8756~~~
2 league goals so far.
I believe DDG is referring to a negative record. You know, the sort of records which Moyes was breaking during his time here. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

8757~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

8758~~~
Banned for being shit, there I made that joke. 

Seriously though, can it be related to the drinking rumours or is this something bigger?

8759~~~
A lot of Rumours on Twitter that a gag has been put on the press. 
I thought it was strange that LVG wasn't even asked about Tooney in the last pressed. Not even one question.

8760~~~

8761~~~
There was rumours about depression, but it seems like total speculation

8762~~~

8763~~~
Depression and alcoholism. I'm not sure I believe that. There's no way he would have been a starting player for that long for LVG with those problems.

8764~~~
Just seen the rumours, sad if true, wonder if its being about because of his decline or because of this its bought about his decline. I've criticised him a lot but that was for his performances on the pitch, I think a lot of people take these personally and thus give out personal insults.

8765~~~
DailyStar saying he's fit and ready to play against Norwich FWIW

8766~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/wayne-rooney--an-apology-370612.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/wayne-rooney--an-apology-370612.html</a>

8767~~~
Irish examiner are an abomination. They aren't the ones that started it, they were basing their story on the red issue rumour. 
Mail are reporting that it's extremely unlikely that he plays.

8768~~~
I hope its not depression. That's an illness that is far worse than any metatarsal injury. That over takes every aspect of your day, week, month etc. When you are suffering with that kind of illness, there's an imbalance that makes you dont want to get out of bed, let alone perform on the pitch. Depression has no prejudice, but he's been a star since he was 16. I know footballers have a lot of money, but that's what a massive burdon he's had since he was still at school. He was a Gazza like prodigy. It wouldnt surprise me in the slightest that things have built up to the point where he's suffering.

8769~~~
This guy said this 5 days ago but couldn't say what it specifically is due to obvious reasons.

If Rooney is suffering from depression then it's incredibly sad.

8770~~~
If heard the rumour that he tested for alcohol in his system tonight, interesting how this has quickly spread. The guy that told me has connections to the club albeit through another person. Tonight was the first I'd heard of it.

8771~~~
Sounds like something serious going on. I really hope it's not depression, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

8772~~~
Speaking generally. Alcoholism is quite common in men suffering from depression. How would a club solve deal with that kind of issue hypothetically?  I know we had the same problem with Roy Carroll.

8773~~~
If there is any truth to this, he needs our full support.

Want to see him come back strong.

8774~~~
Hopefully it's not true, it would be very sad.

8775~~~
Been giving him stick like everyone else but if he is unwell or suffering with alcoholism then fingers crossed for him. Becomes more important than football if true

8776~~~
If this is true it's sad and the best course of action would be to retire and focus on his health and family.

8777~~~
When he was going through the motions in the second half of last season, I wondered if there was another major 'personal life' story about to break but after not hearing something for so long I just assumed his failing body was the reason for his poor performances. These rumours would support my thoughts albeit depression is not what I was expecting!

8778~~~
Theres zero foundations to these rumours, someone just starts it, then you have everyone reporting it with no evidence, lets just wait for facts before we start shedding tears, and offering our condolences

8779~~~
I hope its not true but if an international icon earning 300k a week while captaining the most popular football club in the world with a wife and 3 kids can suffer from depression and alcoholism you truly have to wonder how many normal people go through it in their lifetimes. Mental illness is a seriously under-diagnosed condition.

8780~~~
The comparisons to Gazza from his youth are becoming too real.

Hope it's not true - I'd rather his poor form being down to not caring without depression than not caring because of depression, if that's makes sense.

8781~~~
You think? Gazza was an entertainer on the pitch, something which Rooney really never has been, and he was a drunk, something Rooney isn't. Rooney is lazy in the summer but he works his bollocks off in pre-season and over the course of the season. For the first time in his career he doesn't look like he's working his bollocks off but that doesn't mean he isn't doing so, it just means that he's doing so but that's as good as he's got left in him.

Depression is a very serious matter that never gets talked about in football. You rarely ever hear about a footballer having troubles because he's depressed. It's especially strange considering all reports that point to professional athletes being generally more depressed than people who aren't professional athletes. Obviously that means that too often it's being hidden and/or isn't being dealt with properly by professionals.

8782~~~
In his early days I remember Rooney being compared to Gazza and now there are (hopefully untrue - and probably untrue) rumours of him being an alcoholic and depressive - two illnesses Gazza suffers from.

He's obviously fulfilled a lot more of his potential, at least in terms of success, than Gascoigne, but there are some, albeit minor, parallels.

8783~~~
Well, this is shaping up to be a shit end to 2015. Rooney must be the worst captain we've had for a long time.

8784~~~
I don't think that depression is anyway linked to a person's well being to be honest. It is more affected by your personality than anything else.

8785~~~
So much empathy.

8786~~~
Sounds like the press making stuff up. Not believing these random rumours timed just with his injury and bad form.

8787~~~
This.

He's more than likely just had an ankle injury.

8788~~~
Yep.

8789~~~
I don't believe that he suffers from depression or alcoholism. But he could inflict serious problems on himself if he doesn't move/retire soon enough because of the risk to become a laughing stock. The discrepancy between his wages and the expectations from him, on the one hand, and the quality of his insipid performances, on the other, is staggering and invites ridicule. He has either to improve significantly or to leave - for his own good.

8790~~~
I'd be surprised if he wasn't aware of how far he's fallen. In that case, it's unlikely he isn't somewhat down at present. Whether it's full-blown depression is another thing and that term shouldn't be thrown around casually.

He may well have a drinking problem. Which is not necessarily linked. Plenty of footballers have that issue.

8791~~~
I think what you're referring to here is reactive depression versus clinical depression. Reactive/situational depression is in response to something that has occurred and is short term. Clinical depression is, more often than not, due to chemical imbalance and requires long term management.

Having a problem with alcohol abuse will impact on depression because alcohol is a depressant.

Lots of legal warnings flying around apparently re Rooney and what can be reported.

But I think he knows his days at the top are over. Whether any of this is connected  or not we can only guess.

8792~~~
The papers are trying to prevent us from getting huge money when we sell him to Ghangzhou or any other Chinese club. It is vendetta.

8793~~~
At personal level, he seems to be in good place and he himself has talked about it quite a lot. How his outlook towards life has changed after having kids etc. So it will be very surprising if he is going through depression. Hopefully these are just rumors.

8794~~~
Money doesn't buy you immunity from mental health problems and, in fact, can even add to them. Difficult to understand when we're all fed the lie that it's a route to happiness.

8795~~~
Neil Ashton, in his article wrote that Rooney himself is beginning to wonder if he'll ever regain form and is starting to think if a move would be good for him.  I have a feeling he's expecting to be told he doesn't have a future at the club.

8796~~~
I don't believe the alcoholism and depression stories. There's no way he'd be playing as much has he has, if they were true.

8797~~~
Perhaps this has already happened?

8798~~~
It is also not as if he is out of public view since his injury(the injury was apparent as well). He has been involved in promotional/social/PR activities like when he did surprise visit to a fan visiting the training ground. He is posting pics of his kids on social media and wishing team luck etc like his usual social media activity. Doesn't indicate someone undergoing treatment for depression or under serious depression. Maybe we will get some indication in today's press conf.

8799~~~
It has gone from getting pissed at a Charity party to suffering from depression in the space of week, incredible that people get paid to write / make up this crap.

8800~~~
Really hope the depression rumours aint true. Its horrible <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8801~~~
I wouldnt. From a ridiculously young age he has been praised and adored beyond all sensible levels for over a decade. Successive managers including SAF until the very end have protected him, kept playing him when out of form, refused to criticize him and afforded him special privileges. It would be a minor miracle if the poor sod isnt completely deluded.

8802~~~
Yeah I suppose I didn't think of it as clearly as that. Point taken.

8803~~~
People really need to stop mentioning his wages.

Its frustrating seeing him play shit but he still sells tickets and merchandise more than any currrent player.

On the oversees tours people pay to see Wayne and not Martial or Herrera etc.

8804~~~
That's obviously rubbish rumour about the depression. Van Gaal is an idiot at some things, but to insist on playing him all the time while he is suffering from depression would be something else. Especially because he was playing like crap, it could just make it even worse because his performances turned his fans against him. It would definitely be one of the worst therapies I have ever seen. 

No way it's true, I am sure we have no reason to worry about. 

If it turns out someone made it up just for fun, that person should just die. You don't invent stuff about people's health just to have more followers on twitter.


Stadiums we visit would be full with or without Rooney. We didn't even took him last year on a tour ffs.

8805~~~
Van Gaal, quoted by <i>The Guardian</i>:

8806~~~
Oh feck off.

We've been demonstrably better as an attacking unit since he's been injured, I can see that on a jittery stream that gets taken down every 5 minutes. How van Gaal can't I don't know.

8807~~~
Saw this on Skysports

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.skysports.com/15/12/Others/3386646.jpg" src="http://img.skysports.com/15/12/Others/3386646.jpg"/>

8808~~~
Paul Sholes didn't make his 500th appearance for us until age 32. Considering he was with us from school boy age and quit England at age 29, it shows how many miles Rooney has in his legs. He has played a ridiculous amount of football for his age. 
Anyway, credit to him for reaching this milestone, will go down as a top player for us.

8809~~~
Joe Spence is goin' down!

I have Rooney at 101 Premier League assists, though, I believe 'official' PL didn't track them in early 2000s. Or they are just crap at tracking them. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

8810~~~
Well shit because that's more important than improving our performance isn't it.

8811~~~
he starts

8812~~~
Congratulations on your 500th appearance Wazza.

8813~~~
Congrats to Rooney on 500th appearance. Well done.

8814~~~
Let's hope he can celebrate with a goal and an assist.

8815~~~
Congratulations Wayne. Now time to show us you still got it!

8816~~~
Every move seems to break down with him.

It's encouraging to see us play the 'give and go' and one twos, quick passing and movement, but none of them come off with him. He's past it.

8817~~~
Thought he showed the occasional sign of improvement, but he's mostly still been average. Needs to do a lot better.

8818~~~
So slow. That's the main thing you notice. 

One scenario we saw Martial burst from inside our half, reaches the edge of the box, fires it into Rooney, who can barely turn or shuffle his feet before the Norwich defender pressures him to lose it. 

He's pointless.

8819~~~
Saw just last 15 minutes but that run when Mata passed him through the defence would put any striker on one on one with the goalkeeper, but not Rooney who always end up being catched by the defence and we usually get nothing out of his run. It's ridiculous how slow he is.

8820~~~
Plays like a £30k/week footballer. LvG can be sacked, but what's the solution with this guy?

8821~~~
Get him to replace Fred the Red?

8822~~~
and he plays him again from the start<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8823~~~
He's been good, made some good moves, had a nice finish but was offside, a fantastic pass to Depay, and just generally okay. He's been much better than what we've seen as of late.

8824~~~
Much improved. The fact he has done nothing means he can't do anything wrong. Keep it up Wayne!

8825~~~
He's been so awful this year that this performance has been deemed fine by many. The standard is so low for him these days. Should not be our starting striker, but we are awfully light on forwards so we're stuck with him.

8826~~~
I don't think he's good enough for the Chinese league.

8827~~~
When the captain puts in this kind of performance, you can't demand better, from the other players.

8828~~~
Can't lay too much blame at his door other than that rather poor left foot shot (and he's always been quite average on his left side in truth)

8829~~~
That first touch. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Deary me.

8830~~~
Why does every first touch of his end up in the air?

8831~~~
Captain of Manchester United, Ladies and Gents

8832~~~
Lost the ball after a mix-up in the middle for the second goal there.

Captain fecking fantastic.

8833~~~
The fact that he's captain of Man Utd, earns 300k a week and still has three years left on his contract is symbolic of the shite this club is in at the moment.

8834~~~
Slower than Blind for that Smalling through ball.

8835~~~
He's so past it.

8836~~~
Has there been single defender who didn't outrun him this season?

8837~~~
He can feck off from this club. No fecking need for testimonial. Bugger off.

8838~~~
Even Frank Sinclair would look better leading the line for us.

8839~~~
He can feck off forever. No matter what the price is to fire the cnut I'd throw him out. Seeing the back of him is worth every penny.

8840~~~
He is so bad it's not even funny.

8841~~~
Frank spencer would do better!!

8842~~~
He had an assist today, what more do you people want?

8843~~~
He wasn't even doing well that when match fit so today is not unexpected.

8844~~~
He's not Premier League quality. Completely finished at the top level.

8845~~~
Frank Sinatra in his current state would be livelier.

8846~~~
His constant inclusion will be part of the bitter memory of Van Gaal's second season here before the latter's inevitable sacking.

Ferguson knew. He fecking knew.

8847~~~
at this stage id give Bud Spencer a go...

8848~~~
Useless, pathetic, turds, even a poor kids from Brazil plays better than this lump of turd

8849~~~
Another weekend when Kane and Vardy scored and Wayne missed everything in sight. He''s even taken to running into team-mates to help the opposition.

8850~~~
Fergie knew it 3 bloody years ago. He's only got worse since.

8851~~~
Of course he did. He worked with the bald cnut since he was a young and still good footballer. Every day. He sure as hell knew better when Wayne is finished than the idiots Moyes and LvG.

8852~~~
Great captain. Comes back from injury to spur his team on when needed - really lifted the lads spirits tonight. What a performance to cap off his 500 appearance for the club, wow. Takes your breath away.

8853~~~
I wonder if he'll be criticised for losing the ball for their second? I guess the answer is easy.

8854~~~
Hope he gets tanked at Christmas and fails the blood test again.

8855~~~
Please just get rid in jan

8856~~~
Never seen a player give the ball away as much as this guy. 
The next manager better not put his hopes on this guy. Cause he will fail.

8857~~~
I can't believe he couldn't even get on the end of that cross from Young.

8858~~~
For the sake of United's season, Rooney needs to be sidelined, long-term (Where's Jones when you need him), because that man with the notepad ain't dropping this fat useless shit.

8859~~~
Watching him run after that ball when Smalling put him through... wow

8860~~~
It's one thing to be shit (and he was shit)... It's another to spend most of the game looking completely disinterested, not being ready for the ball coming your way (number of times he got caught on his heels was ridiculous) and not even trying to get onto the end of balls that are going into the six yard box.

Bloody disgraceful performance.

8861~~~
I'm not sure he is even a football player anymore, let alone a captain.

8862~~~
As captain he's worse than Fabrico Colocini. Might even be a worse player. He's very bad.

8863~~~
Shit performance from a shit player. Harsh to target him alone though, they were all shit.

8864~~~
If the alcohol thing happens to be true (doubt it), surely we have grounds to sack him without having to pay out his contract?

8865~~~
I said this at the start of the season - he is a Championship player at best. 
Once LVG goes, hopefully the new manager will remove Rooney with immediate effect.

8866~~~
People will legit be using that in his defence come judgement day too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8867~~~
I was thinking about using the word 'shocking', but it's not really is it? It's exactly what you expect from him this season.

8868~~~
Giggs won't do that as Rooney is his mate

8869~~~
Can't add much to this. Not strengthening the attack because of Rooney has undermined LVG's stint at United. Only a miracle could save his ass now.

8870~~~
Great player.....but it's over. He's been on the decline for a while. Anyone who has played the number of games he has would be the same (if they've not looked after themselves like he hasn't).

8871~~~
Giggs will not be the next Utd manager.

8872~~~
I would not count on that. Giggs will do what is needed.

8873~~~
like really? he's
was funny how he mistimed his jump before the martial goal, he is absolute shit, there is nothing he can do and he starts for manchester fecking united and wears the band.. this is the biggest joke.. some tough times ahead of us United fans as we're getting to rid of Van Gaal and the next manager will give rooney another chance and you know it will happen :-D

8874~~~
I hope to God you're right. But I have no faith in the decision makers at the club to apply some common sense.

8875~~~
<a class="username" data-user="84491, @m1y2" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84491/">@m1y2</a> , I posted that at half time, not the final whistle! He was OK in the first half, reverted to shite in the second.

8876~~~
He's not only slow covering ground, his reactions are slow as well, he used to have a yard in his head.

8877~~~
please somebody gif that and he was meant to be refreshed.. its really annoying how the commentators give him and easy ride, he never is the one who fecks up and if he does basic things good  he's praised like God.. that pass to Martial or Memphis or whoever made that good run in behind the defence was really shit as well and he was praised for it!

8878~~~
500th game of his career today. Cant really blame him for the mess of today. The whole team was under part.

8879~~~
sry man but he was barely OK in the first half, flat footed all the time, abysmal final ball, absolutely off pace and no interest in the game. How can it be considered any good.. People are getting used to this shit standard, thats really worrying, he should never wear our jersey again, I never wished a palyer injury but he jsut needs to get injured again or we will finish the season with 10 men out of top4..

8880~~~
Regressed heavily this season.

8881~~~
Just a yard of ale in his system now.

8882~~~
Are there actually millions of fans in Asia who still think Rooney is this mythical world-class player?

8883~~~
I've always thought like this also. I started noticing his decline in the latest stages of Ferguson and wanted him out. 

We hired Moyes, Moyes even sued him and I thought surely he'd sell Rooney and find a fresh player in stead. No he made him the highest paid in all the land, and on a new five year contract.

Then we hired van Gaal. A man notorious for dropping big egos and falling stars. He makes him captain, with the special privliges of a van Gaal captain.

I'm afraid of what the next manager does. It's this invisible power he seems to possess, if a new manager comes in and continues playing him I will give up hope of us improving to a real force again while he's here. This player, without any excelling traits as a footballer anymore, is performing at such a low level we surely can not keep this up. 

And I see so many comments saying he can't be at fault because the whole team is under par, that doesn't really apply when he can't even keep pace with the Norwich defence. His physical state is beyond repair, the lack of pace is just so obvious.

8884~~~
Wynae Runny sure player GGMU!!!!

Yes, his play has regressed like his hairline.

8887~~~
Giving him that assist is a bit generous.

8888~~~
The only one in the squad who can play a striker is shifted to the wings to accommodate this player. Great tactics Van Gall!
Neville voluntarily quit when he knew he couldn't contribute to the club. Scholes did the same. Lets see if Rooney is a true legend or a selfish shit.

8889~~~
Indeed, this is criminal.

8890~~~
Theres a reason Fergie wanted him out. I think in the Moyes season he padded his stats but didnt do much IMO to lead the team. Him being a captain is a problem, cos it means LVG will keep on playing him, and of course, I dont think hes captain material. Because of the former, we play people out of position which hurts the team.

He also ruins our attacks cos hes not good with the 1-2s and hes not quick enough to get onto through balls.

8891~~~
Look at the two goals Norwich scored - would Wayne Rooney have had the pace and strength to score either? 

The number of times we go on good breaks and work openings only for players like Mata and Rooney to completely grind the move to a halt through lack of pace is what causes most of our attacking problems

8892~~~
China beckons!

8893~~~
Still can't understand why Rooney was allowed to play the whole match.
He should carry a plant wherever he goes. What a waste of oxygen.

8894~~~
sale him now

8895~~~
Is he even good enough for the MLS?

8896~~~
we would be better off playing 10 men instead of starting him every game.

8897~~~
Absolutely dire, as per.

8898~~~
Well, sounds like he performed as expected again, who did lvg take off for Powell this time?

8899~~~
Powell who scored a couple of goals during the week for the reserves wasn't on the bench, which left us with no strikers on there.

8900~~~
he's been well off the pace all season, so it was always going to be an ask to come in and do well when he's probably only 60% fit.

8901~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8902~~~
He's waiting for LVG to get sacked so we can start all over with the trying him all over the pitch while making excuses for him.

8903~~~
Its funny because its so tragically true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8904~~~
Please don't <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8905~~~
He must be the worst striker in the league currently. I mean I'd even choose Eder over him.

8906~~~
I'm genuinely sick of him. He doesn't deserve to play for Manchester United. It's almost inevitable that he'll mess up every second thing he does. Please just get rid of him.

8907~~~
Right up there. Most strikers in the PL are at least physically up to the task. Rooney plays like a 50 year old.

8908~~~
Fvcking pathetic display. Sick of the sight of him

8909~~~
Definitely.

8910~~~
How can we demand performances from other players when the captain plays like he does.
He's a disgrace. There i said it. Touch of a trampolin. It won't surprise me if he was busy shouting at his team mates in the dressing room at full time. Hopefully they told him to feck off.

8911~~~
I won't be surprised if he's a United player next season.

8912~~~
would be interesting to know Rooney's thoughts.

On the one hand, he's got a manager who overrates his importance, and must always play for.
Yet it's a style of football that does nothing at all for attackers.

8913~~~
100% odds on.

8914~~~
Renewed enthusiasm of him making history and breaking the record, in the summer. Sigh.

8915~~~
Partly because Rooney is the main man among them.

8916~~~
This kept running through my mind as well. I mean look at Cameron Jerome today, he's a decent forward in the championship but is only just about good enough for the top flight. Yet you compare his performance to Rooney's and he looks twice as good as our captain. Just because he can run a bit and show some strength and generally control the ball with one touch.

The other thing I was thinking is that when Rooney gets the ball all I'm hoping is that he controls it and passes to the nearest red shirt. That's it. Not that he beats a man, or tests the keeper or creates a good chance for someone. I no longer have any expectation that he will do anything positive and I'm just thankful when he manages not to kill the attack.

8917~~~
We're not a serious club so it won't surprise me if we keep a player on 300k a week just to score 10 more goals.

8918~~~
Depends on who's in charge, Moyes brown nosed him from day one and LVG made him the undroppable captain. There aren't a lot of manager who can walk into a club and strip the captaincy from his highest earner, Fergie was the only person to have managed him who had the balls to get rid of him.

8919~~~
If he was even half decent, that pass from Mata in the first half, would have resulted in a one on one. He's a thief.

8920~~~
The worst striker in the league by a country mile.

8921~~~
Yeah nothing surprises me these days with United. 

It shouldn't be up to the manager IMO. I remember all of us being so proud of our "manager is king" policy when SAF was in-charge, but in truth, it worked because it was SAF an he was "the boss". Given the short managerial stints these days, the club HAS to be capable of making decisions too keeping in mind that managers can change. This is one such decision. Rooney has to go for me irrespective of the manager. Woody has to show what he's made of. His image is of a tough chap who makes things happen even if they're not easy decisions. This is his real test.

8922~~~
for all those wanting Jose in charge you can be sure we'll be stuck with this clapped out donkey if he is made manager, we are in a rut because of this guy as much as LvG, neither are doing the job they are paid so handsomely for.

8923~~~
Even if a change of management is imminent, you just know he'll be around to hinder another regime, having to be shoe-horned somewhere in the team because of his name and reputation. All the while getting a free pass from the media because he's either not played in his best position (which constantly changes in order to be different from the position he's currently occupying), or perhaps some nonsense about his team mates not being good enough. He's got it so damn easy.

8924~~~
With his wages, who else would take him? He's not going anywhere until his contract is up unfortunately.

8925~~~
Any manager that isn't prepared to place this charlatan where he should be, should he can feck off.

8926~~~
The club is financially a behemoth. If we want to, we can get rid of him. There's always a way. We might have to take a financial hit but it would be the right thing to do.

8927~~~
exactly that.
My old boss was probbo on 80k+ a year. Apparently got a 2+ year payoff to retire, probbo 200k or so.

So multiply the money up a heck of a lot, and I'm sure United could pay him 10-15m or so to "ease" him off somewhere exotic to make up for the shortfall in wage.

8928~~~
Indeed. We could also pay part of his salary at his next club. If we keep him it's just because we want to keep using him as a marketing tool and are afraid of making big decisions the club clearly can handle financially. Whether we have the will to do the right thing is another matter.

8929~~~
Mourinho would get rid of him (or put him on the bench).
Last year, we kept playing Falcao even though most knew he was not EPL quality.
Chelsea bought/loaned him and put him straight on the bench, even though the Falcao deal was for a mate of Jose's.
Jose is ruthless and doesnt give a damn if he upsets 1 or more players.

8930~~~
That worked out well.

8931~~~
To be fair, Mourinho wanted to sign him when SAF was trying to get rid of him.

That said, I do agree that at this point Mourinho wouldn't want him anymore.

8932~~~
He's become symbolic of everything that is wrong with the footballing side of the club. Overpaid player, living off his name and past glories.

8933~~~
Yes it did, he is now favourite for a bigger job than the one recently lost.

8934~~~
Yeah, he's had a shit career hasn't he?

8935~~~
I agree with literally every post of yours, they're all harsh and negative but at least you're not in denial as most of the others. Too many things at this club just arent good enough anymore, but because of sentiment they're being held.

8936~~~
This year by making tough as nails decisions against individual players and blaming the everyone else, he sure has been shit.

8937~~~
No it didn't. He's been the worst manager in england this season. Worked out piss poor. Maybe he should worked harder at bringing people together rather than fighting with everyone.

8938~~~
What about last year. Or the year before. Or the last 10 years.
He has won so many trophies which most managers would be envious of.
You can't judge a manager on half a bad season.
[Mourinho]

8939~~~
I'd be careful admitting that around here if I were you <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

But yeah, there is a lot wrong with this club atm, a lot that many are just refusing to see. They're used to everything just working themselves out with United, and because of that have that false sense of security. We're Manchester United, we're too big to fail. But the only reason we're used to things being okay in the end was because of Fergie. Without him, we're just like any other big club now. Any future success will rest on the decisions we make. And atm, we're continually making the wrong ones.

8940~~~
Stop being an idiot, his methods have served him well previously.

8941~~~
They don't count. Or something.

8942~~~
harsh but true.

8943~~~
Even commenting on this thread I feel like I'm devoting too much to him. Waste of time he is.

8944~~~
Agree with both of you

8945~~~
In a word sort of way, he's the perfect reflection of the club at he minute. The perfect captain. I will throw a party the day he leaves the club. It will mean we have have closed a chapter and are starting to move forward.

8946~~~
Yup

8947~~~
Can I have an invite please?

8948~~~
I'm not so sure.
LVG did a decent job last year. He brought stability to us and gave our players a direction.
He got rid of the deadwood and has started bringing in some young players who may serve us well for the next 5 years or so.
He has done A LOT of good things. 
Unfortunately, the results are now so bad, he has to go.

Moyes was a bad decision. But LVG (for the work he has done so far), was a very good decision.

8949~~~
Rooney wouldn't start on any top 10 team in europe except ours <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8950~~~
But he also got rid of too many players and didn't replace them which worked against himself, he should have known not to rely on Rooney and martial,we could all see it why the fu,ck couldn't this clown

8951~~~
We aren't a top ten team in Europe currently but he isn't good enough to start for a top ten team in England, never mind the whole of Europe. I genuinely think he would struggle in the MLS.

8952~~~
Rooney wouldn't start for any top 10 team in the Premier League except ours.

8953~~~
Rooney has been on a decline for years, how lvg didn't know this is beyond me, add to this he only got martial on the last day, can you imagine where we'd be if martial wasn't here and this was the plan of a top manager.

That is not the plan or foresight of a top manager.

8954~~~
Sadly, that's true. I detect an unspoken assumption among some that this is all just a blip, some minor turbulence, before normal service is resumed. After three years of mediocrity while rivals have been strengthening, we are at a fork in the road now. One way involves appointing a qualified manager with a record of recent meaningful success along with the adoption of a DoF model to help Woodward; the other involves handing the job to Giggs so that three years without a title becomes 5, then 10 etc...

8955~~~
Spot on.

8956~~~
if we appoint giggs, we're certainly going to be doomed for the forseeable future like you said.

just look at what happened to AC milan with seedorf and inzaghi.

8957~~~
He will lose LvG his job and will lose his mate Ryan his job as well.

8958~~~
I have never been the greatest admirer of Rooney, but now he is quite useless. Two things I noticed today that have become quite noticeable with him:

1) He must soon becoming our slowest player. That pass from Smalling should have resulted in a one on one with the keeper. RVP would have buried that even - Hernandez would definitely been free, as would Welbeck and Martial. But no, play Rooney.

2) I think he might have a neck problem as he always looks right. There were at least a couple of instances where there were huge openings to the left, but his eyes never searched that area, instead he drifted right. One was so obvious it was hilarious to look at. People compare his passing and vision to that of Scholes, but Scholes actually had a fully functioning neck and could pin point passes left, right and through the center.

8959~~~
I've actually started to worry that it is the club that is putting pressure on LVG to play Rooney. If LVG was ready to ship RVP, who was even then a superior player, why stick with Rooney and even put Martial out wide. Is he really THAT stupid, or is it politics?

8960~~~
Can't even say he's better than what Falcao was showing last season.

8961~~~
At least Falcao was genuine in his efforts. Rooney looks even slower actually, which is quite the accomplishment.

8962~~~
This is so true and it's scary because it's looking likely that we will go the Ryan Giggs road. We really need to make carefully thought out decisions from this point on because, if we feck up, we are done as a top side. We should also be making decisions like a top club and a top club doesn't accept the shit that's been served up by Rooney and Van Gaal, time for Woodward to man up or ship out.

8963~~~
am honestly baffled to see that he keeps getting starts despite not even close to looking good enough for a (should be) top 4 team.

is everyone in the club seeing things that we don't see? is he playing like lionel messi every day in training? I don't get van gaal's insistence on playing him every match possible despite not showing that he's good enough. while others get temporarily axed for making 1 mistake or not having 1 good game. (or in hernandez's case, permanently - if the reports are to be believed)

he's the captain and the captain has to keep playing? well, that didn't stop van gaal from kicking out van bommel when he was at bayern. even if that didn't happen, it's not an excuse to keep playing him if he's performing poorly.

8964~~~
How is his average rating 5.1? He's been our worst player this season, and this season has been poor.

8965~~~
He needs to go every bit as much as LvG does, he's stealing a wage.

8966~~~
played full 90 minutes coming back from injury/match fitness, wouldn't happen with any other player. As much as I feel bad for LVG stuff like this justifies the shit he is getting

8967~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8968~~~
Unless his hands are forced, which is just as worrying.

8969~~~
Exactly, yet another screw up supposing Rooney actually was injured it's not the best idea is it.

8970~~~
The idea that it's orders from above is beginning to seem plausible but then I thought LVG is this badass that takes no shit from anyone, what's happening here?

8971~~~
Cost us the second goal. He's given the ball away and initiated counterattacks all season. He needs to get out.

8972~~~
He used to lose the ball a lot in the past as well, but then he would work his socks off getting down the pitch to win the ball back again, which he often managed because of pace and sheer determination. Now, he just stops and looks up into the air.

8973~~~
This is probably bullshit but I remember hearing that when he signed his new contract shortly after Moyes took over, there were clauses stating he'd play every match when fit and get the captaincy after Vidic.

8974~~~
Cast your minds back to early 2014. The media were running (no doubt well briefed) stories about how United had played the Mata transfer so coolly, conducting all communications with Chelsea solely in writing so as to avoid getting dragged into counter-negotiations about Rooney. The post-Fergie era reads like a black comedy at times.

8975~~~
I hoped a few weeks out would do him good but he's still useless. Surely he has a decent run of form left him before the end of the season to help us out a little bit. If his second half of the season matched the first it would be one of the worst seasons by a so-called top player I can ever remember.

8976~~~
The one I remember was that he was to have a say in transfers. I took it as BS at the time. Can't believe the club will descend that low.

8978~~~
I've been backing him for most of the season but enough is enough now, time to get rid of him.

8979~~~
that can't be right.

otherwise our club is much more of a mess than we thought if we're leaving those kinds of decisions to 1 player.

rooney supporters gleefully marked that delightful assist down as another poisonous arrow to add to their bows of dark arts when the time comes. 

Unfortunately it won't, no surge of form will come this time, he is truly past it.

8981~~~
Can we still reply to their original bid of £20 million in the Summer of 2013? Maybe the original fax is still lying around somewhere.

8982~~~
You want to laugh it off. But considering the ineptitude of Moyes, coupled with the fact that Rooney actually does seem to have played every match under LVG when fit, and you do have to wonder....

8983~~~
That's why I mentioned it. I want to believe there's no way it can be true, but considering the way the club has been run since SAF retired, you never know...

8984~~~
If I was LVG and I lost my job this season, I would absolutely berate the club for putting such a clause in Rooney's contract (if they actually have). It really has been a big factor in why LVG might be about to be sacked.

8985~~~
Great post ,  I hope the board shares your views. We need a DOF and a top manager asap. Woodward needs help. 
I wish I knew what was going on with the board because our inadequacies are staring us in the face now.

8986~~~
So RVP had to play with the U21s but Rooney gets a full 90 mins . Our club is a joke

8987~~~
I refuse to  believe a club like mufc would put a clause like that in a players contract.

8988~~~
I'm just too tired to even complain about him anymore. He's done.

8989~~~
He just makes it up as he goes along tbh. Different rules for different players, new rules when it suits him, relaxing rules for some when he fancies its.

Theres no logic in any of his decisions. And his loyalty to Rooney just epitomises it all.

Never has one player seemingly held so much power at Old Trafford, as Wayne Rooney currently does now. Not Keane, not Beckham, not Van Nistelrooy. When they all fecked up, they were kicked out. Rooney, however, seems to be allowed to get away with anything he fancies. Its a joke.

8990~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/19/manchester-united-wayne-rooney-70m-contract" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/19/manchester-united-wayne-rooney-70m-contract</a>

Article from when Rooney signed his latest contract in 2014. Here's something that caught my eye:
As we know, Rooney was appointed captain the following season, after Vidic left. The transfer consultation part is interesting though- this is very "tinfoil" but I wonder if there's any link between that and the fact that all the competition he had for his position has been sold.

8991~~~
<i>
</i>
Moyes proper fecked us over on this one <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8992~~~
He's a future club ambassador, he will do what he wants <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8993~~~
He'll end up as Giggs' managerial successor at this rate <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8994~~~
I'm not a fan of Rooney, but I think the 'degree of consultation' doesn't add up. How would they even quantify that? I think it's bollocks personally. And it's ludicrous a club of our stature would promise such a thing to a player.

8995~~~
Maybe he only gave his consent to the Martial deal as he'd never heard of him and presumed he'd be shite and no threat to his position. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8996~~~
agree.

8997~~~
360 degrees. I agree.

8998~~~
360 degrees of consultation.

8999~~~
Send him off to China.

9000~~~
I had the same thought.

9001~~~
Don't be ignorant and deliberately obtuse. His methods have spectacularly failed this season.

9002~~~
I didn't judge his entire career. I'm saying his methods have failed miserably this year. Maybe he needs to work on his tendency of fall out with everyone. We certainly don't want it going tits up in year 2 or 3 if he comes here.

9003~~~
Obviously Rooney isn't the <i>only</i> problem with LVG, but my god, seeing him out there, stinking the place out, costing useful players their places on the pitch, it's just unbearable. Van Gaal's mollification of Rooney is equal parts bizarre and infuriating.

9004~~~
To be fair to Mourinho, I think some of his players have acted shamefully. Not liking your manager is one thing, but purposefully playing badly (or halfheartedly, at best) is unjustifiable, and I don't think Mourinho should be apportioned the bulk of the blame if his players' professional morals are so low. (Man, that sounds dramatic.)

Even though some of out players probably don't like LVG or his methods, I still feel they're all trying their best.

9005~~~
Updated this to include the most recent games. 

1 x Our best player. 
2 x Average. 
7 x Below Average.
11 x Our worst player.

9006~~~
watching him yesterday he is getting slower by the week, ageing in dog years

9007~~~
The fact that Martial is being moved around for this guy angersme.
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Our captain

9008~~~
His legs are gone, it's so obvious.

He couldn't play himself in to form when he played every minute for the first half of the season and a couple of weeks rest and he still looks no better. 

He's finished at the top level

9009~~~
He's been the worst player in half of the games he's played and close to the worse in nearly the other half.  This is what we get for 300k a week.

9010~~~
The one around 2.45 was hilarious <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

9011~~~
And we're stuck with him. No way is Giggs going to put his mate on the bench. It's a bloody nightmare with him. Wish Ed had the balls to kick him out now. Club is a bloody nightmare bending over for him.

9012~~~
I agree with that. As always it's not simply the fault of one side. The players' attitude at Chelsea has stunk and they've driven a manager who I believe the club would have benefited from staying. At the same time, Mourinho also has to bear the brunt of this shocking managerial performance this season. He's been appalling. He's got a top team completely shattered and created an atmosphere of conflict and finger pointing. So yeah, Mourinho has to learn from this big time otherwise he'll tarnish his reputation.

9013~~~
The way they played yesterday is proof that it wasn't all joses fault.

9014~~~
I swear at least half the Caf have better ball control than this guy. Every positive forward ball Carrick hit to him cannoned it's way back to our backline.

9015~~~
If we had discussions on which striker to buy, Berahino, Lukaku, Cisse, etc pretty much right through the league, there would be someone coming up with an argument of why it might be a good idea for each.
Hypothetically, if this incarnation of Rooney was at another club and was available, I strongly suspect that not one single person would want him here.
That speaks volumes. 
Add to that the guaranteed start and mega wage,  and it would be like suggesting we do the same for an injured Titus Bramble.

There was a diagonal cross from the left in the first half (by whoever) and a delicious low cross from Young in the second that Rooney could have reached. I looked at him on both occasions,  and he didn't react. 
His legs may be shot, to not even try to get onto quality crosses, or even notice them until so late, shows that he won't even compensate for his physical failings by intelligence,  ala Giggs and Scholes.
Time to get shut.

9016~~~
No, really??!

You really are a waste of space and time.

9017~~~
the irony is we don't have any senior striker in the team or any striker all bar Martial. It all boils down to bad planning in LvG's part.

9018~~~
Are there worse players than him in the league, seriously?

9019~~~
If it wasn't so sad it'd be funny

9020~~~
All Moyes and Louis had to do it's have a word with the Scottish knight sitting in a stand with his bloody name in giant capitals about Rooney, but nooooooo rather than do that, both pandered to this fraud and even made him captain and highest player, selling RVP in the process.

Utter incompetence and piss poor management , the board need a good hard word about decisions made, maybe all the success under Fergie left us with a soft underbelly as the concession of shocking decisions post Fergie is really starting to grate.

9021~~~
At this rate I am hoping those Cavani rumours start up again in January <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9022~~~
Yeah, you're probably a bit slow and haven't understood what's been happening this season as usual. Do try and keep up chap.

If I was such a waste of time and space you wouldn't spend time writing shitty posts in response to me. Now run along and insult someone else.

9023~~~
The sad part is that you know he will start the next game and play 90 mins. He and Van Gaal can feck themselves.

9024~~~
When LVG writes about his time at United in the future. Im sure he will say that relying on Rooney was one of his worst decisions ever.

9025~~~
He'll be the first name on the team sheet.


Somehow I dont think so. Even now, with his job on the line and about to be sacked, he continues to play Rooney, in the blind belief that he can score goals. And will continue to do so, until he is fired. He says Rooney is the best Captain he has ever worked with and I don't think he will change his opinion anytime soon.

9026~~~
His contract runs out in June 2019, we will pay him around £35m in the next three and a half years. He's not going to move is he?

9027~~~
Rooney is one of our most senior players and obviously the main man in the dressing room. I can only assume that is why van Gaal sticks with him. JUST BIN THE cnut. Picking up bad results becos he is useless as feck is more detrimental to squad morale than pandering to him purely cos he's a figurehead.

9028~~~
Moyes ought to offer to go halves as a gesture of good will.

9029~~~
Fact remains that Mourinhos methods have worked for him far more than they have against him. But continue to be a moron if you like, it suits you.

9030~~~
Maybe. If he never plays for the first team again.
Then again, he may be happy just taking the money.

9031~~~
I can only see him going back to Everton if he does move, we'd probably let him go on a free and even then he'd have to take a pay cut.

9032~~~
Would they take him?

9033~~~
that contract looks more and more insane by the day. What the hell were Moyes n Co thinking?

9034~~~
They didn't want to look weak by selling to Chelsea, instead they looked weak by pandering to someone who bent them over a barrel.

9035~~~
Picking Rooney over Lukaku or Barkley would be a downgrade, he will leave for MLS at some point.

9036~~~
id say it will be one of the worst decisions of his whole managerial career

9037~~~
Of course they have. He's a top manager. But your brain wouldn't understand a well rounded opinion. Bother other people.

9038~~~
No matter who we get as manager they'll struggle to do anything here as long as Rooney's death grip on the club remains. He's our Casillas.

9039~~~
I feel largely its because he is still living in through it now. When he has time to reflect on it, he wont believe how bad a decision it was.

9040~~~
Isn't MLS really physically demanding though? He'd get fecking slaughtered there. He should go play in Malaysia or something.

9041~~~
and Casillas even had a few decent games here and there. Rooney is very consistently average.

9042~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

9043~~~
My bad <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Just trying to avoid bad words and all <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

9044~~~
True, and the position he plays is more disruptive to a team.

9045~~~
The honest truth is that Rooney has been in decline for quite a while now.

The poor first touch, poor passing ability...those things didnt just spring up now. When he was still scoring goals, whenever anyone tried to bring that up, his defenders constantly threw stats around at why Rooney wasnt so bad. 

I understand why we didnt sell him to Chelsea in 2013, but if an overseas team had come in for him then, I would have definitely sold him. The problem is that they werent interested in all. When asked about Rooney in 2013, Michael Sammer of Bayern said that they werent interested in him as they couldnt see what he could add to the club. That was 2 years ago.

9046~~~
You think the opinion you put forward was 'well rounded'? That's laughable.

Anyway, you should get a life. Try to experience the touch of a good woman (or man, whatever floats your boat). Maybe that way you won't be so obsessed with trying to win pointless internet battles on here all day everyday.

Good luck!

9047~~~
Moyes has ruined United in more ways. The biggest mistake of his was giving Rooney a big contract. One of my favorite players to turn up for United. Serves me right. Always adored Giggs and Rooney and they both turn up to be the worst character / players United have in the dressing room currently.

Do not give a damn about how great Rooney was. United are being left behind. Seeing Bayern, Barca, Madrid, City and even Liverpool (for god's sake) play football that's great on the eye hurts. The other 4 also win playing such football.

We are so crap up front due to Rooney's inclusion. LVG just needs to kick him out. Enough of this guy. No need for a fecking testimonial.

9048~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Already have that. Cheers. I don't try to battle. I try to converse and discuss instead of petulant abuse and squabbling like you.

Hope it gives you happiness either way. Bah-bye.

9049~~~
Why does he give so few interviews after the games, especially when we lose. He's supposed to be the captain. Even on social media he just goes silent, almost no messages of encouragement or apologies for a bad performance. Van Gaal has to face the press multiple times a week and so should Wayne.

9050~~~
I clipped this graphic out of the celebratory "500 games" promotion the club did for Wayne. Hidden in all the numbers is a graph showing his peak and subsequent decline. The graph shows the number of goals he scored in each 50 game period of his career.

His peak goalscoring is 150 games in the past.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s16.postimg.org/dfqhwqyyd/goals.jpg" src="http://s16.postimg.org/dfqhwqyyd/goals.jpg"/>

9051~~~
Pretty weird thing to pick up but did anybody else notice that he's late for crosses in the box? Not in as he's not in the box but when a cross comes, he's doing the nod that's supposed to attack the ball with his head (you know, he's simply attacking the ball with his head) either too early or too late, resulting in looking like a proper idiot.

I'm pretty sure it will be visible in extended highlights from last couple of games.

9052~~~
In the last game he also resorted in running to the sideline when a cross was incoming in the last seconds of the game. The Rooney of old used to run into the box whenever he got the chance. All in all, he is not the only reason for the current state of this United.

9053~~~
Even for Martial's goal, his jump is so mistimed it's unreal. Whenever I wanted to take a piss out of my mates when we played football (I'm not tall so usually I was hardly any good during corners) I did things like that. It's like he's 'just pretending' not to be accused of doing feck all.

9054~~~
Sack LvG.

Rooney as player / manager till end of season, who's with me?

9055~~~
Coleen.

9056~~~
LVG.

9057~~~
He already is one.

9058~~~
He can hardly be expected to manage both the first team and the kitchen staff.

9059~~~
More importantly, this is now the joint worst spell of his career.

9060~~~
Were Liverpool playing great football In the 3-0 defeat to Watford, or the stolen 2-2 draw v West Brom out of interest?

9061~~~
but it's probably arguably the worst team we've had in his time here, now and the Moyes year

9062~~~
Maybe if Rooney were any good, this team wouldn't be the worst in his time? He is the main man in attack and he is shit. How could we have a good team? Him being a guaranteed starter is a big reason why we didn't strengthen enough our attack in the summer.

9063~~~
I'd like to see us as an attack based team before finally writing him off.

I can't imagine many strikers exactly fill their boots in this style of team

9064~~~
Formations, tactics etc don't change the fact he can barely control the ball or make simple passes. So many of our attacks have broken down because Rooney has been unable to do those two things all season.

This guy has two assists all season and he didn't mean either of them, it's ridiculous.

9065~~~
Well, it is easy to see that Martial is much better than Rooney. Why a kid playing his first season at United is much better than the supposed main man in attack? Because Rooney isn't good enough to play for United anymore. United deserve much better.

Falcao and RVP weren't good in this system (still better than Rooney, especially RvP, Falcao had a much better league goals/assists to min. ratio) and they aren't good in their new teams. It is not about the system. Falcao and RvP were poor under LvG because they are past it, simple as that. The system has nothing to do with Rooney's slow reactions, poor touch, inability to turn players, etc. etc.

9066~~~
Wayne needs to play on the edge vs Stoke - he is twice the player when he has the bit between his teeth and a bit of anger in his game - need him to set the tone against Stoke if there's any juice left in that tank!

9067~~~
Playing in attack based team is not going to make Rooney's awful touch or his lack of pace or strength suddenly change, he's physically shot.

9068~~~
You know what i mean. They have played some good football with the new manager in. Liverpool might not even qualify for the CL this season but there is a renewed sense of vigor at that club. Next season with proper buys, they might even go ahead of United.

United's morale and football is at an all time low even when we were in a worse position in terms of points (i think)

I want LVG to retire with dignity. I hope he kicks Rooney out of the team but it's a long shot.

9069~~~
agree. I think Mourinho will get the best out of him.

9070~~~
Oh God not this stuff again. That will be the next excuse for Rooney, oh well of course he played like shite there he's adapting to Mourinho's tactics. He'll need 6 or 7 games to get up to speed.

He's finished, Mourinho could get the best of what left of his talent and it still wouldn't be good enough.

9071~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9072~~~
Supporters thinking regime or playing style changes will breathe new life into Rooney, are going to be disappointed.

If some of you can't see that 50/50 balls are now "candy from a baby" confrontations ( he moves like he's up to his ankles in mud) then you need to go to spec savers!

9073~~~
Just like he got the best out of Falcao right ?

and yes, Rooney has looked as bad as Falcao did for us last year. Even worse at times.

9074~~~
Exclusive interview about to start on SSN. Announcing his retirement would be an early Christmas present.

9075~~~
'im delight-deligth-delightndtdn to anonce that i'm new club mangager, director of football or something and captain'.

9076~~~
You're both deluded as feck.

9077~~~
Standard interview, we're behind the manager, criticism hurts, we're working hard.

9078~~~
You must be on a WUM mate. How much more can Mourinho do than hasn't been done for Wayne already? He's been made captain, is played constantly although not performing. He's been shiftet around various positions just to get the "best" out of him. Just that he has been pretty wank in every one of them. THere is nothing to come from Wayne ROoney anymore. He's physically done.

9079~~~
I missed it, what did the little shit say?

9080~~~
Missed it but he still looks like he's been on the beers...

9081~~~
Interview available here - <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/10109365/wayne-rooney-says-manchester-uniteds-players-back-louis-van-gaal#ooid=Vhd2lweTqJ238pRRhBS9VAxFIza6oKPb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/football/n...an-gaal#ooid=Vhd2lweTqJ238pRRhBS9VAxFIza6oKPb</a>

9082~~~
Feck that. Got through about 10 seconds of his <i>umms</i> and <i>ehhss </i>before I closed it<i>.
</i>
I know Roy Keane isn't a philosopher/orator or anything but I do miss a captain/representative that can actually talk properly.

9083~~~
what would anyone expect?

"he's a rubbish manager, getting nothing out of anyone, and will be off soon, like me"

9084~~~
just took a look at this video posted in this thread: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/are-united-slow-due-to-initiating-moves-from-a-stationary-position.412906/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/are-...ting-moves-from-a-stationary-position.412906/</a>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDAkmRkbVNI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

fast forward to 3:40. that's what we're paying him 300k/week for.

9085~~~
Overall it's basically what we've been saying about LVG's tactics. There is absolutely zero movement off the ball. Zero supporting runs, zero decoy runs, zero channel runs.

Henry was really insightful with Pep's approach. I know this is the Rooney thread but this is precisely why in all my previous posts criticsing LVG's approach I said that these things can be worked on during training. It's basic attacking football.

9086~~~
There was an attempt at a counter during the game in the second half. Mata was running at their defense  and the Norwich players were struggling to get into position. Instead of Rooney, who was ahead of Mata at the time to continue running to create an angle for a through ball, our captain came short. We can blame Van Gaal all we like about the state of our attack but how does a team expect to score when the striker makes a decision like that?

9087~~~
Louis van Gaal could have signed a better striker and put Rooney on the bench after dozens of disgraceful performances. He made him the captain himself as well.

9088~~~
Van Gaal's approach (or his lack of pragmatism and insistence on his way of doing things) and Rooney's performances should not be talked about in the same conversation.

It's really two different things despite the temptation to argue that Rooney is suffering due to it (he may be a little but it's really not the big picture). When he can't control the ball, take a first touch (without it ballooning into the air), pass the ball properly or accelerate enough to lose his man, it's clearly not the tactics.

The tactics aren't helping but Rooney's career is dead.

9089~~~
Is this the first hint from Hodgson that Rooney's place is under threat for Euro 2016?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.us/england/story/2769312/england-need-wayne-rooney-at-his-best-roy-hodgson" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.us/england/story/2769312/england-need-wayne-rooney-at-his-best-roy-hodgson</a>

9090~~~
Yep I agree with this. That was mental and has been happening far to often with Wayne. He likes everything to his feet instead of in behind.

9091~~~
He'll play every minute mark my words and we'll be dire. 

England aren't going anywhere fast until he retires or is dropped for good.

9092~~~

9093~~~
Confirmed: Benched.

9094~~~
Deserved. Should have happened a long time ago.

9095~~~
Laterz Wazza!

9096~~~
God I'm so happy

9097~~~
Thanks LvG.

9098~~~
Is he dropped or just rested for the Chelsea game? got a feeling he will start against Chelsea regardless.

9099~~~
About fecking time.

9100~~~
Everyone is so excited. LVG will probably say he picked up a knock and isn't 100%.

9101~~~

9102~~~
Rooney always finds a way not to play on Boxing Day. It'll just be because he over-indulged a little yesterday.

Don't panic, he'll be back next game.

9103~~~
Finally!

9104~~~

9105~~~
He surely picked up a minor injury. Stop hoping it's too late anyway.

9106~~~
This will be a news worth celebrating if his ass is stuck on the bench vs chelsea too. Otherwise it's just squad rotation.

9107~~~
Most probably rested for Chelsea, like Morgan and Bastian.

9108~~~
Not buying the he's being rested excuse. In a game you say is a must win, you play your captain. He has been dropped.

9109~~~
Bet he still gets in-game criticism in the match thread.

9110~~~
This is Van Gaal we're talking about here. He's underestimated our opponents on a weekly basis. Rooney is being rested, with Schneiderlin, for Chelsea.

9111~~~
The love-in for Wayne on Soccer Saturday is an absolute joke.

Pundits demanding Rooney to play because he's a big name just solidifies how much BS some of these so-called experts spout. I'm looking at you Alan McInally.

9112~~~
We will either beat Stoke without him, in that case it would be extremely harsh to take anyone out of the team to fit Rooney in. Or we fail to beat them in which case LvG is probably gone.

9113~~~
so its a win win scenario? i hope you are right....

9114~~~
Finally. Time to start phasing him out

9115~~~
The soccer Saturday panel are a shambles.

9116~~~
A few months too late.

9117~~~
Wow, small steps LVG...small steps...

9118~~~
Tactical decision according to Louis in SS pre-game interview

9119~~~
He'll come on and score. It's inevitable.

9120~~~
Absolutely delighted.

9121~~~

9122~~~
This will happen and I'll be doing a Darth Vader 'Nooooooooo' at the TV.

9123~~~

9124~~~
Dropping Rooney doesnt mean we will suddenly improve leaps and bounds.


Even worse though, bringing him into the side doesnt do much for us.

9125~~~
Rooney with best performance of the season so far.

9126~~~
I'm pretty happy with him today.

9127~~~
We're definitely missing Rooney ... of 2009.

9128~~~
Game over. Nice goal btw.

9129~~~
We look so much better without him!

9130~~~
Rooney's not been great this season. But on a blustery December afternoon at Stoke, with my job on the line, I'd want his experience and battling qualities if nothing else.

9131~~~
Career on the line, Wayne gets dropped. Telling.

9132~~~
He hasn't even brought that this season.

9133~~~
i've criticized him plenty of time, but he's been lively and looked up for the fight.  (something  some of our players today dont seem bothered with)

Well done for that at least.

9134~~~
<a class="username" data-user="96887, @K2K" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96887/">@K2K</a> spot on.  Looks hungry and up for the fight.

9135~~~
What's he trying to insinuate here? Literally putting Giggs, Rooney and United fans in a sentence to be provocative.

9136~~~
Arnautovich looks better than Rooney. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9137~~~
Kind of him to let Carrick be the captain the whole match. Might have read the caf after the criticism he got for taking the armband in the Boro game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9138~~~
He has been much much better today in terms of commitment, it's the first time I've seen him play with a bit of desire and look annoyed things aren't going our way, he should have finally got an assist too with fellainis mistake.

He's still nowhere near his top level but baby steps I suppose.

9139~~~
I think its more likely he couldn't find wherever Carrick was hiding either.

9140~~~
Only player to show a bit of fight today to be fair to him.

9141~~~
Probably true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9142~~~
Yeah let's praise a 300k player for showing commitment and passion. The guy should be turning defenders inside out and score at least 1 goal every 3 games. Instead he has been beaten by Wollscheid for the majority of their 50/50 duels and now failed to quickly act when given space in the 16.

9143~~~
Lol true Carrick needs retired.

9144~~~
Where has this commitment been all season?

9145~~~
On a team that performs so poorly, every positive is magnified and rightfully so. It just shows how poor we have been as a team.

9146~~~
He can handle 45 minutes, particluarly when all he has to show is a bit of fight or determination to be better than everyone else

9147~~~
Looks like LVG hurt his pride by putting him on the bench today and he finally showed some passion. What a piece of shit.

He was our best player when he came on, though.

9148~~~
Yep, our standards have fallen steeply since Moyes.

9149~~~
Showed some fight for a change. Excellent work to set Fellaini up who failed to convert. Poor control when Pereira set him up though.

9150~~~
It's easy to come on as a sub when its going bad and charge around showing a bit of passion. Did well for the Fellaini chance but that's it.

9151~~~
Thought he was one of our best players, but the bar was obviously extremely low. Robbed of an assist when Fellaini couldn't finish that easy chance he set up.

9152~~~
Showed some fight but I still thought his quality was lacking. He didn't impact upon the game.

9153~~~
Looked up for it? Barring the one good ball he put in for Fellaini, I only noticed him when the camera pans to the ref.

9154~~~
Fight and determination with little quality. Hopefully him being dropped for 'tactical reasons' is the beginning of the end for Rooney and Van Gaal.

9155~~~
Made a clear chance that Fellaini should have buried, other than that he spent most of his time shouting and arguing with the ref, I guess that's the "fight" being talked up.

9156~~~
Should of scored after Periera set him up.

Lack of control let him down.

Let's praise him for running around and working hard though right guys?

9157~~~
He should have hit it first time.

9158~~~
Whinges at the ref. Bout it.

9159~~~
probably one of the better performances from him in recent times. Actually looked like he wanted to be out there and put the effort in. Fellaini should have converted the chance Rooney created. Though saying that, it is clear from the chance his poor touch ruined that he isn't suddenly going to find form. Guess we just need to hope that he shows the same desire in the next game as well, instead of going back to just going through the motions.

9160~~~
Should have scored but instead almost fell over. Still one of our better performers with a 4/10 performance. Pretty good for him this season. ALmost had an assist as well.

9161~~~
he's done a falcao, basically.

tries to give it his all but nothing is working out, constantly makes poor decisions in attack.

9162~~~
I f'n hate the agenda of the press who will talk about dropping Rooney back-firing and it being a failed experiment, even the BBC are going with it in their match report. 2 league goals in nearly half a season is what they should be focusing on.

9163~~~
Thought he was pure shite as per the norm.

Ran around  little bit more, but spent most of his time whinging to the ref and shouting at Stoke players.

9164~~~
he looked a lot better today, probably due to the fact philiosophy went out the window

9165~~~
Thought he did alright today. Created a couple of clear cut chances that we should have scored from. fecked up an attack when he took a bad touch which forced him to pass it to Mata, but still thought he did well. Looked like the only one who actually tried today.

9166~~~
he looked like he tried in the opening minutes of the game but when you watched Kane today you could see he tried much more, chasing the ball in the 90th minutes etc.. than fresh Rooney all season, that alone deserves him to terminated the contract with us let alone his actual zero ability and the fecking wages we would pay another 5+ better players, hes not a premier league player anymore, it took one and a half year to Van Gaal to bench him, the ridiculous old man deserves being sacked and I cant wait for that..

9167~~~
silly observation but he's at the age where the gerbil cheeks have arrived.

9168~~~

9169~~~
In terms of a pure physical comment - he's going to balloon when he stops playing. He's already a fat git as far as footballers go and I can only imagine what weight he'll be when he retires.

Also fecking hate how gobby he is. Genuinely wanted the ref to send the cnut off with the amount of grief he was giving him.

I'm unapologetic - I do have an agenda against him. He's shite, paid too much and an absolute embarrassment to this great club.

9170~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/01/article-2196938-0067916700000258-740_468x286.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/01/article-2196938-0067916700000258-740_468x286.jpg"/>

9171~~~
He could be in better physical condition though, it's not all down to genetics and bad genes. Ronaldo doesn't naturally have the body he does, he works for it and is disciplined on and off the field. Schweinsteiger is older than Rooney too and he is constantly bombing up and down the field. He's just a lazy git, he'll do a fat Ronaldo eventually.

9172~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This. The people praising him for passion and effort should go work with John Barnes where they can come up with piss poor punditry like "Rooney is showing all the right attitude by warning up with the team"

9173~~~
I like it when he's fired up - maybe Mourinho will be able to rejuvenate him?

I doubt it though, he doesn't look capable.

9174~~~
word

I have limited/no knowledge of how football contracts work, but is there any way we can just terminate his contract, even if it means paying compensation? (though I know it's not going to happen, even if it's possible)

9175~~~
Has he invented a time machine?

9176~~~
I'm not sure, has he?

9177~~~
That image that showed his goals over the 500 games really tells the story.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s16.postimg.org/dfqhwqyyd/goals.jpg" src="http://s16.postimg.org/dfqhwqyyd/goals.jpg"/> 

That's not luck or formations or tactics. He's passed his peak and his career is winding down. Fergie could see it coming.

9178~~~
He'll need to if he wants a rejuvenated Rooney back.

Couldn't be any clearer really. 

The only people who don't see it are the ones refusing to see what they're seeing in front of their eyes.

9179~~~
The worst of it is we could see another 50 appearances (at least), and I'm pretty sure we'll see less than 18 in those.

9180~~~
On the plus side, Wayne Rooney is 100/1 to win the WWE Royal Rumble next month. Get your bets in.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.paddypower.com/bet/sports-novelties/wwe?ev_oc_grp_ids=1164955" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.paddypower.com/bet/sports-novelties/wwe?ev_oc_grp_ids=1164955</a>

9181~~~
We pay out the remaining the £45m that we owe him over the next 3 years.

9182~~~
Yup, this annoys me more than anything.  He's been worse than useless for nigh on a season and the press ask why he was dropped... maybe because he's shite?  But no, they refuse to see it!

9183~~~
Maybe the WWE will sign him from us.

9184~~~
Deal!

9185~~~
It is one of the most annoying things about today. And honestly it works to the detriment of the managers. There is no way Hodgson can keep him out of the team as it would be a media circus. He can make his little comments or veiled threats in the press but he will start him at the Euros. He has been woeful all season yet they fully back him. It's bizarre.

9186~~~
His England record is better currently in the last few years than when it was during his prime. He has been poor for us this season but he's still been useful to England, tbf.

9187~~~
Ashley young tried too,  he was motm for me.

9188~~~
Im not sure if that ever happened before, only if player misconducted but rooney seems "fine" in that manner but I guess there is no clause which would guarantee to terminated contract without any penalty, it almost seems like its the other way round

9189~~~
Yeah I doubt there is any exit clauses for us. Why the hell did we give him such a contract that even grooms him to become an ambassador when he is done? Lionel freaking Messi doesnt have a contract like that yet we gave it to Rooney??

Also shame on Rooney. He is what, 15 or so goals away from the United goals record, And couldnt put a decent season together? Before anyone says he is too old, Thierry was around this age when he was at Barcelona and even though he wasnt the Arsenal Henry, he was still an above average player.

LVG banked on him and it backfired massively.

9190~~~
Penalties against San Marino etc?

9191~~~
England's qualifying group was very easy to be honest, he was always going to bag a few goals in that group but he still needed a few penalties to get over the record.

9192~~~
I hate the media narrative around him. 

In LvG's interview after the game they started quizzing him about Rooney and if it was a tactical decision that backfired etc. 

It's just so lazy - you dropped your captain, you lost the match, therefore poor decision. Ignoring that he's been playing like a hippo on diazepam all season.

9193~~~
It feels like the commercial deals need to fall through before the media will actually come out and criticise him.  It's a conflict of interest for most of the media.

9194~~~
It irritates me that he seems to take next to no criticism from pundits and former players. I saw a headline about Dwight Yorke claiming LvG was wrong to drop Rooney... what a load of shit.

9195~~~
He was the main reason we tanked in WC 2014.

9196~~~
Yep, otherwise it would be trophies galore as it was with England NT before Rooney.

9197~~~
Its not about trophies.  Its about at least being competitive in your games. 

We were decent against Italy but the fat cnut couldn't stand not being centre of attention and sabotaged us on the left wing. . Refusing to track back and was shite in general bar the assist.  

He's hindering club and country.

9198~~~
A big part of that was Sterling playing as no.10 against Italy and played really well, next game Rooneh moved back in the middle

9199~~~
Agree with the club part, but England is average with him up-front or without him, there's no difference whatsoever.

9200~~~
Nah, I'd say poor tactics and poor personnel in midfield were the main reason. Past it Gerrard and Henderson in midfield were nowhere near good enough to compete. Rooney was better against Uruguay than Sterling was against Italy. Sterling was poor against Uruguay in the same way Rooney was poor against Italy on the wing. One player however scored or assisted both of England's goals at the World Cup yet is blamed for the whole team failing.

9201~~~
I'd say if things continue then he'll be behind Vardy, Kane, and Sterling come the summer.  Unless Roy is the same sort of gutless manager LVG is and sticks with Rooney based on the player he used to be.

9202~~~
FYI Rooney: 6

9203~~~
but he's mega off the pitch!

9204~~~
LVG put all his eggs in the Rooney basket and it'll probably cost him his job.

9205~~~

9206~~~
Just saw this on Reddit:

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9207~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9208~~~
Nah life ain't that fair

9209~~~
Please happen.

9210~~~
And Charlie Austin has scored more than both.

Source: Reddit.

9211~~~
Would solve alot of things, but doubt Rooney would be that generous as to let us off the ridiculous contract we got him to sign, plus if he goes there he can kiss his England carrier goodbye, and any chance of breaking Sir Bobby's scoring record.

9212~~~
If Rooney has anything left in the tank, he better show it this afternoon. With a new manager pending, today could be a huge game for him.

9213~~~
Am I alone in thinking Rooney is playing poorly due to poor tactics?

He doesn't seem to be struggling at international level.

9214~~~
He does, got the record over the line with a pen, and in those couple games he was poor. Kane came on as a sub and showed him up

9215~~~
He can't control the ball half of the time, mate, how can that be because of the tactics?

9216~~~
Our tactics are shit but he's shitter.

Doesn't take much to score against San Marino et al.

9217~~~
He is really 

His last performances for England have been poor and masked by penalties

The best I've seen Rooney play for a while was when he came on against Stoke..... lacked quality but seemed to have fire in his belly again 

I hope to see snarling, angry Rooney later - his future is as much on the line as Van Gaal - apart from his massive contract of course

9218~~~
Well I guess we will only know for certain when a new manager comes in and changes the way we play.

9219~~~
If only..

9220~~~
Wow. Go for it Wayne.... don't pass up all that nice money..........

9221~~~
<b><i>Football365</i>: Wayne Rooney is ‘simply dispirited’</b>

Wayne Rooney’s self-confidence is at its lowest ebb after being ‘dragged down to a level of under-performance never seen before’, according to the Daily Mail.

The newspaper’s Manchester United correspondent Ian Ladyman is clearly keen to absolve Rooney of any blame for a disastrous run of form which has seen him fail to score in the Premier League since October 17.

He played 90 minutes as a striker against Norwich on December 19 but failed to register a single shot on target; he was subsequently dropped for Boxing Day’s trip to Stoke.

Any suggestion that the 30-year-old Rooney is in decline has apparently been dismissed from within Old Trafford, with the Mail claiming: ‘It is merely a matter of mental fatigue. Rooney is, according to some of those who share a dressing room with him, simply dispirited.’

Rooney is expected to be restored to the starting line-up against Chelsea, when defeat could signal the end of Louis van Gaal’s reign.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football365.com/news/wayne-rooney-is-simply-dispirited-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.football365.com/news/wayne-rooney-is-simply-dispirited-report</a>

9222~~~
To be fair, it could well be. 

Unfortunately it's gone on so long that it's the same result at the end - he'll have to go.

9223~~~
He's started well. More of this please. His movement has been great.

9224~~~
Herrera buzzing around as a 10 has brought 18 minutes of life into him so far.

9225~~~
He's been as poor for England with Woy even saying his place isn't guaranteed. Has looked lively today though

9226~~~
Much better from him so far, glad to see it.

9227~~~
Solid so far.

9228~~~
Best game so far this season by a mile even without goals or assists. Touch is good, passing good, movement is there too. Efforts at goal with conviction.

Let's see if it lasts.

9229~~~
Having a very good game.

9230~~~
Looks like an actual footballer for a change

9231~~~
Been decent.

9232~~~
Yup, been good.

9233~~~
Very good half.

9234~~~
That's more like it.

9235~~~
Much better. If he plays like that.. he's good enough to merit a place in a premier league side.

9236~~~
Good half from him, finally.

9237~~~
Better from him today but we still need more goal threat from our centre forward.

9238~~~
A lot better from Rooney today. Hope it continues. Would love him to score.

9239~~~
if he scores, the confidence will be back. The fact we are faster getting the ball last third has helped overall. Still need to be quicker.

9240~~~
I thought he did alright on Saturday too. Sometimes he needs to be reminded that he has to work for his place.

9241~~~
Playing against  Matic, Mikel and Terry. Let's not get carried away.

9242~~~
Where are those people that said he's been worse than Falcao? Not defending him. He has been terrible this season but his lack of form had been really exaggerated  (by those who said he's pulled a falcao)

9243~~~
Much better, needs to stop dropping so deep and stay up top though

9244~~~
Carried away?!

People saying he is playing better, which he is.

9245~~~
He's playing better than he has, but I miss when he used to be able to take players on.

9246~~~
...why didn't he head that?

9247~~~
Should've scored.

9248~~~
Open goal, unmarked, couldn't have asked for a better chance and he goes and does that. I don't even know what to say anymore.

9249~~~
300k per week, guys

9250~~~
Disgusting challenge to finish off the game. 

Everytime he starts off well, it never lasts.

9251~~~
Missed a key chance. Should have been sent off. Ran around a bit though. "Star man" says McMannaman for BT Sport.

9252~~~
Who couldn't have predicted BT would give man of the match to him? They have been tripping over themselves to pretend he's brilliant all match.

9253~~~
General play was good today so that's one part of his game that was fine. But he has very little goal threat for a centre forward, and when he does get his chance he tends to screw it up.

9254~~~
He's wank. Bottled it again and should've been sent off.

9255~~~
Actually don't think he'll  break Sir Bobby's record.

His finishing has become so bad.

9256~~~
Decent performance, but still not good enough

9257~~~
man of the match??? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9258~~~
Absolute load of wank. 

He's stealing a living.

9259~~~
One of his better games this year. Still not good enough.

9260~~~
disgusting.

9261~~~
Hopefully if a new manager comes in, today is the last we'll see of him playing for Utd.

9262~~~
Unsurprisingly a huge overstatement. 

He was better today. Not good enough, definitely not MOTM, but better and certainly not a load of wank.

9263~~~
2nd half, that's how we know him.

9264~~~
Didn't even succeed in getting himself sent off.

9265~~~
Still not good enough. Compare him to our other attacking players and he's still miles away (and yet our attacking players were not great either)

9266~~~
Decent 1st half. Very poor 2nd half. His first touch deteriorated as the game went on. In the last ten minutes, it looked like he was just smashing the ball away if it came near him.

Man of the match?! Hilarious.

9267~~~
I'm assuming the fact that Atkinson gave the foul means he can't be banned? Really nasty tackle.

His performance was improved but still not up to much.

9268~~~
Needed him to finish that chance. Would have been such a big lift for the club.

9269~~~
He missed an open goal....again. 

How many is that this season? 3? 4?

9270~~~
Missed chances, misplaced passes, a shocker of a tackle.... man of the match.

9271~~~
Second half wasn't good enough from him but he was good in first half. Much like our whole performance.

9272~~~
I think this is the highest I've rated him all season. Should've scored. You expect that kind of finish from a kid making his debut season, but not from your striker, captain and highest earner.

9273~~~
The true rebuilding of our club begins when we finally are free of this albatross.

9274~~~
usually gets himself up for the Chelsea games.
Good chance lashing it over the bar.

Same as ever though really, not worth the wage

9275~~~
I still wasn't impressed, he's the centre forward and it's his job to score goals and he fluffed his chance and created nothing else all game. Yeah really great performance. Marginally better than absolute shit is still shit.

9276~~~
did you even watch it?

Got man of the match on the channel I watched.

I think you might have an agenda

9277~~~
He's atrocious.

9278~~~
He was good in this game. Very good first half, faded a bit in the second but so did most of the team.

9279~~~
Why do you have to overstate things so much? 

He missed a good chance and should have scored, that's plenty critical and actually true.

9280~~~
Average first half, woeful second half.

9281~~~
He's exaggerating for sure but the fact he got MOTM is still an absolute joke. He missed an open goal (should have put his head on it but for some bizarre reason didn't) and should have been sent off.

9282~~~
Whole of Britain is laughing at that decision

9283~~~
Better today but nowhere near good enough. If we're going to stick with playing a lone central striker than we need someone with good close control, raw physical power and pace. I'm thinking Lukaku. As for the chance, all he needed to do was redirect the ball, not blaze it.

9284~~~
MOTM <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9285~~~
Hardly.

9286~~~
How am I overstating things? He's missed a goal few of those open goal chances this season. Today, the one in the CL from Martial's pull back..one against Liverpool at OT I believe...thats 3 I can think of off the top of my head.

He's simply not good enough anymore.

9287~~~
That's just sam.

Rooney was okay today. His overall game was decent. But we need our main striker to be a goal threat, and take his chances.

9288~~~
While he played alright giving him man of the match was ridiculous. Who picks that, Gerrard, Rio and Scholes in the studio? The media bias towards him is unbelieveable.

9289~~~
Any half decent striker can take it and play the ball off to the midfield, but he missed a sitter and was lucky his wild swing was called offside because that was shite. MOTM? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he should've won us the game

9290~~~
Because there was no open goal. Obviously.

9291~~~
He didn't play.

He has missed a few whoppers this season though, obviously.

This is amazing. Eulogising about him!

9294~~~
Not an agenda, just high standards. Especially from the captain and highest paid player at the club. 

Something half of this forum seems to have lost since the Moyes era.

9295~~~
I thought the one thing with Rooney today is that if we are persisting with him, and he had some decent spells today then I really think we need to play with two wingers who are almost pushed up ahead of him, almost like a false 9. I'm not saying he'd be great there but I think we/he would look better for it. Most the time he picks up the ball is where he's almost an am/10. He seems more effective there rather than too high as he can't run the channels well or hold it up as well as he once did. But with the wingers ahead of him then we'd get players stretching the game and opening things which might let a runner like Herrera get in centrally as opposed to us constantly having to work it wide where we can't cross.

9296~~~
He had 3 or 4 good lay-offs but can't run with the ball or turn with it, his mobility is shockingly poor and he can't get ahead of a CB in the box or finish a sitter, he missed 2 today but the incorrect offside flag saved his blushes. The commentarey from Hoddle and McMannaman was unbelieveable, someone check their bank accounts for Paypal deposits from Rooney.Org

9297~~~
Falcao last season in EPL: 1287 min, 4 goals and 4 assists

Rooney this season in EPL: 1275 min, 2 goals and 1 assist

In other words, Falcao was about 3 times more productive in the league than Rooney this season.

9299~~~
Amazing isn't it<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

9300~~~
Yes there was. Any quality striker would have scored from that CBJ cross. 

Rooney, unsurprisingly, managed to balloon it over the bar.

9301~~~
Wow, I know Rooney has not played every game up front (I don't think) but that's pretty damning.

You should have off-loaded him to us when you had the chance.

9302~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9303~~~
Just the perks of belonging to the England club.

9304~~~
Do you actually know what an open goal is?

9305~~~
We <i>know</i> that, but the powers that be at our crazy club let themselves be conned by Roo and his agent<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> 
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> for us...

9306~~~
He was decent, but it's not good enough.

9307~~~
If we don't expect more from our so called "talisman" then maybe we deserve to be where we are. I can have time for young player not less for the team leaders.

9308~~~
He doesn't.

9309~~~
That miss was truly shocking, and he had some poor touches occasionally. But it still was a very decent performance imo. Did his #9 duty fairly well .

Still not good enough, mind.

9310~~~
Anybody claiming that to be a good performance needs to add the disclaimer, "... for Rooney." Honestly, that was about as average a performance from a PL striker as you'd expect. That's before you even recognise his shocking miss. 

Still not good enough, and still should be sold.

9311~~~
I missed most of first half, probably he was good. Second half though he was poor.

9312~~~
It's the only explanation.

9313~~~
He has shown improvement today, and people are still moaning. Yes, he's not the Rooney he used to be, and by his old standards, or the standards of a typical United striker, his performance today probably wasn't anything special, but surely it has to be good signs that he shown an improvement today. We should be hoping he continues to put in these type of performances and better, rather than saying it still isn't good enough.

9314~~~
I am seriously doubting him now.

9315~~~
That would have been a master stroke.

9316~~~
His mates after the game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Inspiration. Sensational. 

Wow.

9317~~~
Do you agree with everything the TV says too?

Just a quick insider tip for you, English TV want the English captain to be seen to be the MOTM in every opportunity.

9318~~~
An unguarded net. Which, considering Courtoius was on the floor, it was. 

Any decent contact and he scores.

9319~~~
Don't get me wrong, but when 19 year old Martial plays better then him, and still Martial send to Play LW or RW just to make Rooney ST, People going to moan.
Yes he has better game but I still think Martial could had done better job then Rooney.

9320~~~
Or we can do both.

9321~~~
Better than he has been, although that's not saying much.

9322~~~
Not his worst game of the season, but nowhere near good enough.

Some nice touches, but not enough threat.

9323~~~
Anyone in the media, on the caf or in life that defends that tackle he made on Oscar too needs to re-evaluate their views on football and their innate bias towards Rooney.

9324~~~
Bloody pile of shit, should have scored that instead of skying it high. Also ridiculous studs up on Oscar and comical attempt to swipe at the ball for that play(although it was offside). That sad thing is that because he has had so many stinkers this season, this performance (which was wank at best) ranks as one of his best. It is embarrassing how the standards have been reduced for our strikers, we should have a 30 goal a season striker yet we have nothing but dog shit up front. Just shows us how far we have fallen.

9325~~~
I'm pretty sure that MOTM award on BT was decided by Rio, Gerrard and Scholes in the studio so it should be taken with a huge pinch of salt.

9326~~~
Better.

About it.

9327~~~
Martial wasn't exactly pulling up any trees when up top. Much better on the wing, in my opinion. Even when he's up top, he likes drifting wide anyway. We need a focal point, and today, Wayne was a lot better today at doing that, in my opinion.

9328~~~
Thought he played quite well. Should have scored though, and should have seen red at the end. Overall though he was fine. A few times when he gets the ball with his back to goal in the box, he should try and shoot instead of lay it off always.

9329~~~
The two positions are not mutually exclusive.

9330~~~
He actually had a good first half but his best situations in today's game were those when he layed the ball for our other players to score. Says a lot about him as a striker these days really, he doesn't present any threat whatsoever.

9331~~~
He drifting wide for creating space, its not like he love to play wide profession.
He might not pulling up trees but you can sure he can deliver much better performance then Rooney.

9332~~~
We won't make top 4 if Rooney continues to start for us in the second half of the season. LVG has made a big mistake with Rooney and it is already too late to rectify it. He will get the sack within a month.

We have to sign a top forward in January. It is difficult but it may turn out to be the diffrence between finishing in and outside top 4.

United deserve a much better player than this Rooney: if not someone like Suarez or Lewandowksi, at least someone like Benzema. Rooney is about 1/3 the player that Suarez is and I'm being generous.

9333~~~
Overall he was better but he still missed a couple of relatively easy chances and never looked like scoring, which is still a pretty big problem when you consider he's a striker...

9334~~~
Will he ever score another goal for us?? And Gerrard is idiot if he thought Rooney was good today.. Should have scored and lucky to not getting a red card.

9335~~~
Not blatantly fecking up your side's football constitutes MOTM now? That's where we are

9336~~~
Thought he wasn't shit. Having a striker not lose the ball instantly seems to have contributed towards us being decent going forward. Second half, he was back to his normal self. Not MoTM worthy.

9337~~~
Any chance of us appealing his booking and admitting it should have been a red? Atkinson did us no favours by not sending him off.

9338~~~
Those misses..

9339~~~
Wouldn't pay him with washers!

9340~~~
watching MOTD. Martial rinses ivanovic all game, creates a chance for himself hitting the post, sets up Herrera for a sitter yet Rooney gets motm

9341~~~
Seeing the chance again I don't think it was as easy as I first thought. Came across very quickly. First half was his best of the season by a mile. Sloppier in the second half but resembled a footballer at least today which is a positive step at least for now.

9342~~~
I don't see what was much improved ... He gave the ball away, should have been sent off and missed several good chances, more than that, he was voted as MOTM by a panel of 2/3 ex United players.. Come on.

9343~~~
His second best game of the season.

Not even close to man of the match though. And also when you look at that performance and realise that it was the second best performance of his season, at christmas, it's pretty pathetic

9344~~~
He showed improvement, he played better, and man of the match. My god standards have dropped!
£300 grand a week player getting judged like he'd just come through the academy.
Can't believe what I read and see.

9345~~~
I agree with everybody when they say that that performance was the least we should expect from our captain, a guy on 300K a week, and I have probably been as critical of Rooney as anybody for a couple of seasons now

But credit where credit is due, he played well today, performing a difficult job as a lone front-man against two good centre halves. Should have gone with his head at the end from the CBJ cross and would have made it all the better

9346~~~
Past it.

9347~~~
Just got home from the game. Whilst he looked much better in the first half, hes a shocking player considering what we need from him.

Whilst some may say thats harsh, he really is done. He should not be playing 90 minutes for us. At this stage, he should be playing 20 minutes or something (and even then his finishing is so poor). He should not be our captain nor should he be seen as our taliman. More like a "luxury" or something.

Whatever he does in training or how he is in the locker room, theres no justifying him starting up top every match with output like that.

9348~~~
Anyone notice in the highlights package BT used to justify him being man of the match, most of the highlights of "great" hold up play involved him not actually being marked? It's easy to hold the ball up when no one is bothering with you.

9349~~~
That's his plan. Play so shit for one year that nobody even bothers to mark you, then rake in all those champagnes from BT and SKY for man of the match.

9350~~~
Maybe he got the MOTM for his silent domination again?

9351~~~
Yep, and every time he held onto the ball for more than a couple of seconds he lost it, and in the 2nd half both him and Schweinsteiger struggled as Chelsea started to actually press.

9352~~~
His general play was better than it has been (he actually controlled the ball). His finishing was poor, should have scored. Definitely not MoTM, strange decision to give him that. Decent.

9353~~~
It's annoying when people (not on here) say that we should play him because he's "still our best player" using achievements from 3 or 4 years ago as evidence. I wonder how they'd react if we brought up LVG's achievements from the 90's as a defence?

9354~~~
Were the golden boots he was wearing an ironic act of trolling?
Missed a sitter and should have been sent off. 

1/10

9355~~~
Our inspirational captain, not producing where it mattered.

9356~~~
Seems he can't receive and control a pass in his stride anymore. I think his legs are done. Looks as if he is in too bad physical shape to coordinate his body like he used to.

9357~~~
Surprising to see he was actually controlling the ball and had a first touch. Any improvement is welcome improvement i guess.

9358~~~
He's earned £1.65m since we last won a game.

He's earned £3.15m since he last scored a league goal.

Spare me the appreciation that he finally 'put a shift in'.

9360~~~
It was quite obvious during the game too, they didn't decide to press him at all for some reason. Still, he had some decent lay offs, but that's just in first half, in second half he was invisible.

9361~~~
It's funny how the English media and pundits are banging on about how great Rooney was and how he seems to have the old fire back etc. He plays not-so-shit for one match and already they are bigging him up, ignoring the miss kick, the clear chance missed, the attempt to break Oscar's leg (and soul). They really are Rooney-cock riders... shit this reminds me... Garth Crooks team of the week isn't up yet. Expect narrative porno tomorrow.

9362~~~
Yesterday's game was further proof IMO that Rooney is finished as a top-level striker. His overall play was better than recently no doubt, but his striker instincts have completely vanished. He's just a nonentity in the box these days. The sooner we replace him the better it will be for the club's ambitions.

9363~~~
At the start of the season there were many bullish about him getting 20-25 league goals this season, so far he has 2 and we are at the half way point, that's 2 league goals in 15 games from a 300k a week forward. As much as I feel LvG needs to go I'd argue that Rooney is every bit as big of a problem in getting United back on track, he's the deadest of dead weights.

9364~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> cracking post! Nail on the head too.... I can't wait until Woy brings him to the Euros and the English media have to eat humble, over paid, over rated, out of date pie!

9365~~~
Couldnt have said it better myself

9366~~~
Worryingly, it kind of reminds me of the way Torres was perceived when he went to Chelsea. Once it became clear that he wasn't just on a poor run of form and had actually gotten a little bit shit, every goal or decent performance was used as a catalyst to say that, "The old Torres is back!" I wonder how long we'll get that sort of stuff for with Rooney, providing he doesn't significantly improve.

9367~~~
Nope, they won't eat humble pie. They're building him up now, they'll burn him down when he fails miserably for country.

9368~~~
That's what I was getting at.... Not for a second do I think he'll ever come back to   goal scoring form worthy of £300k a week!

9369~~~
I really do hope that he'll get his big money move to MLS or Qatar or wherever on coming summer. I'd be fine with him going in upcoming window also but he has this testimonial thing coming up in summer so I guess he'll be here at least til the end of the season. Maybe him having the testimonial means that he'll be off and because of that he doesn't care anymore. Either way, I genuinely feel that there are players who would contribute more for 300k a week.

9370~~~
If he continues on his current track then he'll manage 4 league goals all season...which is beyond embarrassing.

9371~~~
The MLS is our best bet as he is already popular out there and I just cannot see Rooney in Qatar or China no matter how much money they offer him. The testimonial should serve as a farewell.

Yep, I'd be amazed if he reached double figures by the end of the season.

9372~~~
His attempt to dribble around Terry was hilarious. Really just goes to show that he isn't a threat at all anymore. Yeah his touch and passing can still be fine at times but that doesn't matter at all if he never looks like scoring.

9373~~~
Couldnt get past his man a single time. Also was quite funny how he tried to stretch his fat leg to score that sitter after CBJs cross. He's a bit hopeless. Tried though.

9374~~~
We all know the stick Falcao got last season for his performances here. Well here's how he compares to our captain this year

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/0cysLiM.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/0cysLiM.png"/>

(Goals/Shot accuracy/Assists/Pass Completion/Success Take-ons)

9375~~~
That's disgraceful, the club is hopefully ignoring the big English media cover up and has a striker as a priority target ASAP.

9376~~~
The standards are so low now that yesterday was considered a good performance, a man of the match performance by fellow professionals. I really fear for what will happen if we appoint Giggs, as I can't see him confronting Rooney. I can only base that on his mates in the media always blaming everything else, and Giggs and Rooney having been playing together for a decade.

There isn't a goal threat in him, he can't turn and take on a player and his runs into the box are almost always second wave, no darting run to the near post ala Solskjær. He doesn't offer a thing we need to improve on our impotent attack, and no one in the mainstream media will admit it.
He was dropped versus Stoke, and the narrative there was like we were dropping someone who has actually done something this year. Sometimes I feel like it's like the Truman Show with this guy, nobody is genuine, saying everything's allright and not willing to confront what's achingly obvious, that he's simply been shocking and all of his physical traits are gone. What does it take him to be called out? Sometimes the pundit mentions the poor form he's in and the co-commentator becomes very uncomfortable, like he just came out with a racist slur or something.

He had an ok first half where he actually managed a shot from outside the box and a couple of good lay-ons, but we need so much more.
This club can't move forward with him here, for me it's as simple as that.

9377~~~
Of course he won't. Look at how Scholes and Rio are still up in Rooney's arse. MotM ffs after Courtoises and DeGea pulling off worldclass saves. They are clueless and Giggs might be as well. That's why I'm saying. If we are seriously considering Giggs as our next manager I'll give up football.

9378~~~
The thing about the Herrera chance, how he darted straight into the 6 yard box is what our striker should be doing...but cant

9379~~~
'<i>The Emperor's New Clothes</i> is a short tale by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those who are unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent. When the Emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, no one dares to say that he doesn't see any suit of clothes until a child cries out, "But he isn't wearing anything at all!"'

(Wikipedia)

9380~~~
The miss at the end was criminal. CBJ put that on a plate for him and the keeper was already beaten.

9381~~~
It's my general feeling as well. The club is becoming less about the collective and more about certain individuals. I think the only player who threatened to be bigger than the club was Cantona, and he was a big enough man to walk away when he thought the time was up.

Ex players feeling like they deserve something from the club, players like Rooney having "privileges" despite stinking the place up, it's all starting to get on my nerves.

9382~~~
If he doesn't go at the end of the season all the people who feel we're a poorly run club when it comes to footballing matters will be proven correct. Let's see how Woodward does on this one.

9383~~~
He's going to be very difficult to sell, if the club chooses to. Who would want him now? He's most likely going to continue to have a poor season. He's one of, if not THE highest paid player in the Premier League with 2.5 years remaining on a massive contract. Who could possibly pick up the tab? Is he going to leave on his own accord and take a paycut? I don't see it. He got the contract he wanted, and I think he will do all he can to see it out.

Two and a half years ago was the time to sell him, and the majority of the Caf were shitting it at the prospect of him going to Chelsea and banging them in for Mourinho. It was considered good work by Moyes at the time to tie down Rooney and Januzaj. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that.

I don't see United selling him in the summer. Even if they want to, I think they will struggle. Rooney has no reason to leave. IMO, he never had a reason to leave. He just knew he could get what he wanted, and he always got what he wanted.

9384~~~
The silver lining currently is if he keeps up his current goal scoring rate he won't surpass Sir Bobby even if he sees out his contract. That's something at least.

9385~~~
He has a testimonial.

9386~~~
Well put.

9387~~~
He's obviously in dire form still but he looked a thousand times better in the setup against Chelsea; higher tempo, lots of attacking. I think he's 100% worse in van Gaal's slow-tempo possession system, and if he's gonna play every game we should do like against Chelsea.

9388~~~
Huge protests and condescension from 'level headed' hardcore reds in that thread back then. Anyone else could see he was well on his way to become the caravan dwelling hilbilly he portraited in that euro 2012 commercial several years back.

9389~~~
Shocking. Especially that last stat.

9390~~~
The way the club is being run at the minute, you know he won't be sold.

9391~~~
Where are these cheeky buggers who were laughing at people in the summer when they said he won't score 20 this season? 

He is lucky that he played Brugge (even Depay scored vs them) and got a hattrick against that crap. Might still fluke it with Europa League goals vs minnows with 10 seaters as stadiums.

9392~~~
After watching the match again without the emotions involved, Rooney wasn't all that decent. It was a below average performance. If a player serves a 3 all season, then a 5/6 performance is almost 100% better but its still not good enough. I wonder how the United board and pundits would have treated Rooney if he is from say, Macedonia.

9393~~~
Since Wayne Rooney signed his huge contract at United he has scored 29 goals, that's cost the club £910,345 per goal.

9394~~~
Depressing.

9395~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What an investment.

9396~~~

9397~~~
He's actually stealing a living (or 300).

9398~~~
He ran a lot against Chelsea, I consider it a massive improvement. Alright, it was Terry the snail marking him but at least he looked busy.
MOTM was a bit over the top, this notion he has to be coaxed back to form by friends in the media is not helping him. Come the euros in this form the nation will crucify him.

9399~~~
A shocking footballer. On similar money as Messi and probably earning more than Suarez and Neymar. Shocking.

9400~~~
His fans justy that by saying he's a commercial juggernaut. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

9401~~~
He has the first touch and turning circle of an 18 wheeler

9402~~~
Just sold him in my current FM save for £33m to PSG in summer of 2017!  he was rubbish and only scord 3goals all season.

 Fans did not rebel either as Lukaku and Memphis score goals in buckets for fun!

9403~~~
how the standards have fallen...

9404~~~
He's always been truck-ulent.
<span style="color: #ffffff">Truculent </span>

9405~~~
And he's definitely a wide load!

9406~~~
6 league goals this calendar year.
What a man.

9407~~~
He's scored 6 league goals in 2015.

Costing Utd £2.6m per goal. Staggering.

Worst captain of all time & should be axed as soon as humanly possible.

9408~~~
What the actual feck, unfeckingbelievable!

9409~~~
Don't know if anyone heard what Carragher said after the 2015 review, said if Kane keeps playing as he us with his 27 goals this year Roy will have a big decision on his hands for the euros, I mean fecking hell!

9410~~~
I wonder what he himself thinks of his performances. Surely he must have some personal ambition?

9411~~~
'300k quid lol'

9412~~~
I think he knows. He alluded to it in the last interview.

9413~~~
Genuinely think I could have done that myself

9414~~~
Unless we're just waiting to find out and announce pep is joining us in the summer, this is the biggest screw up in the clubs history and we even had the Moyes era to show us what not to do, absolutely mind blowing!

9415~~~
The on,y reason whe will go to the Euros is because Daniel Sturridge will probably be injured.

9416~~~
*prays*

9417~~~
He shouldn't even be in the England squad.

Kane, Vardy, Walcott + Sturridge if fit should be the four. 

Considering England only play one upfront I'd possibily not even bother with 4

9418~~~
Ozil and Sanchez combined with a little change left over.

9419~~~
bournemouth starting XI is probably on less wages compared to rooney.

9420~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I would love to say that Rooney has his pride, and would like go away with that intact and play at a lower level somewhere, but I get the feeling that he knows we're not littered with quality, and the club wants to maintain it's image/standing/marketability, and feels he can find a way to stay relevant for a good while yet.

9421~~~
I suspect the press and media won't make much of his performances for the remainder of the season but once the Euros are over unless England win it they will turn on him (and Hodgson and question why he was starting anyway) and I think we'll sign a new striker and Rooney will have a think about the rest of his career. I can see him going abroad after the summer.

9422~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> bravo

9423~~~
There's absolutely no reason for him to be in the Euro squad. Shown to be a rubbish captain as well as being in terrible form.

9424~~~
Isn't he going to play as a second striker/playmaker for England? And Barkley will be the one to be dropped.
I can't imagine that Roy will have the balls to drop him, until maybe the last group game.

9425~~~
It fecking irritates me that this guy can do no wrong in the eyes of former club and international team mates, or any of the pundits for that matter.

And a captain? What the shit is this all about? He has one of the worst attitudes on the pitch! He will throw a tantrum after every decision, is always mouthing off to the referee and his discipline is still shocking.

In fact, he should have been sent off against Chelsea, was sent of against West Ham last year, and wasn't there also another incident last year when he could have walked (Swansea seems to be the team that comes to mind). Not bad for someone that has cut out that side of his game...

9426~~~
For me, I look foward to see way Roy does. It will be a sad day if Roy can show he has more bollicks than LVG with regards to Rooney.

9427~~~
Hodgson will find a way to include Wayne because:

* The fallout resulting from England doing badly, and Wayne not being given a final hurrah, would be England-career-suicide for Hodgson once the press scare the FA into action. And...
* Roy, like so many at United, is still dazzled by Rooney's past exploits, name and reputation. And the FA don't employ innovative thinkers as England managers, only ambassadorial types; so, Rooney goes to the Euros at the expense of expendable lesser names from lesser clubs (like Vardy, for instance).

9428~~~
One of the best decisions in football was Aragones deciding to leave Raul out of the Euro 2008 squad for Spain. Taking a young Villa and Torres was a masterstroke!

Raul wasnt even as bad as Rooney is now.

9429~~~
To be fair, England have much better options up front than we do.

9430~~~
If Rooney is as bad in the second half of the season and  Welbeck, Walcott, Vardy are fit and in good form come May, it won't be easy for Hodgson...

9431~~~
Honestly, the only way I can envision Wayne being excluded is if his form is utterly dire, if his rivals continue to thrive, and if the press push extremely strongly for his exclusion.

9432~~~
Happy new year

9433~~~
Selling him in the summer would be almost as big of a boost to us as any signing.

9434~~~
Six league goals in a full calender year. That is pretty amazing. Has any regular striker for us had a worse record recently? 
What was Coles scoring rate when he came first and was getting criticism?

9435~~~
He's pathetic.

9436~~~
It's unbelievable that, in offering up that massive contract, neither Moyes nor Woodward stopped to think why Alex Ferguson was so keen to offload Rooney. He has been and continues to be a symbol of United - from bright promise in 2005-2006 to glory in 2008 to good but not quite as good as might have been expected post-Moscow to living out on past glories at extravagant expense.

9437~~~
We were sliding on the table. The club was keen to make a statement.

9438~~~
They certainly managed that - "our wealth greatly exceeds our knowledge of football". Various A list footballers took note for when they needed some leverage in negotiating a new contract with their club.

9439~~~
Rooney you have had alot of good years and can see back on a very good career with alot of titles, but the end has come now.
You are shi*te and frankly we don't want you at our Club anymore so could you please just go and grab the last big paycheck in China or USA so we don't have to pay a wage you don't deserve anymore? That would be a big gift to all of Manchester United's fan base.

9440~~~
24 goals in his first 18 months. We had higher standards then mind you.

9441~~~
<span style="color: #ffffff">...</span>

I like You SteveJ, you are a funny dude, have a great night!

9449~~~
LMAO.
It looks like Football Manager has managed to accurately simulate the real-life Rooney.

9450~~~
<b>So Rooney ends 2015 with:</b>

5 PL Goals from open play 
1 PL Assist
2841mins in the PL
1 Goal every 568mins
1 Assist every 2841mins
1 Goal+Assist every 474mins

Oh dear. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9451~~~
do you think we'll be selling him in 18months for £33m? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9452~~~
That is a huge if with Welbeck especially, but to a fair extent Walcock.

9453~~~
The Anti-Messi.

9454~~~
Goes hand in hand with this current United.

9455~~~
Herrera and Mata have better figures. As does Martial who  has only played half a season.

9456~~~
And people laffed when some said he might not get 20 goals this season.

9457~~~
Kinell!, basically £1million a goal, we're going to shit and the board doesn't seem to mind.

9458~~~
I am assuming that assist is against Norwich when he tried to head the ball but he only managed to touch it a little? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Also there is at least one goal he knew nothing about among those 5 he scored this year when Martial hit him with the ball and it went in... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9459~~~
A quick check shows Raul scored 18 league goals, 24 overall and played well to help Madrid win the league that season.

9460~~~
Yep hence my last sentence. Aragones was slaughtered for the decision in the media but it proved to be the right one in the end. Can Hodgson take a similar gamble and leave Rooney behind?

9461~~~
Of course not. England managers are not really managers. They are mostly some kind of face of FA or something. They will keep the players of high profile and generally dont care much about what happens next.

He's genuinely pathetic.

9464~~~
The numbers back up with the eyes see:  Rooney has been dire for at least 12 months, and the truth is that's he's been in serious decline for three seasons.

But the masses want to watch Rooney, either in anticipation of an outstanding performance or out of some kind of morbid fascination with dreadful football. Either way, he's our "name" player and attracts attention.  And thus, cash.

I don't want to start a new thread with this question -- as we have enough Rooney threads and Van Gaal threads already -- but if I could wave a magic wand and get rid of Rooney or Van Gaal it's an easy call:  Rooney.

I'm curious what the result of that poll question here would be.

9465~~~
Some still harbour belief that it's van gaal that is at fault for Rooney's performances and that once a new manager comes the shackles will be off and a monster will be unleashed. Lewlzies.

9466~~~
How does Rooney's current form compare to Torres at Chelsea?

9467~~~
There is no comparison, Torres had a better all-around game, he was completely unable to score but he wasn't a liability in the build-up.

9468~~~
According to whoscored:

Torres in his last season at Chelsea: 5 goals and 5 assists in EPL in 1572 mins, that is, Torres contributed a league goal every 157 mins.

Rooney has scored/assisted 3 league goals this season in 1275 min, that is, every 425 mins.

Some might think that Rooney's stats are down to LVG's tactics. But last season Falcao had similar stats to Torres: Falcao scored/assist 8 league goals in 1300 mins, that is, every 163 mins.

9469~~~
He also wasn't an "undroppable captain"

9470~~~
He's the football version of self harming.

9471~~~
so stats say he has been worse than Falcao, who didn't start every game

9472~~~
The fact that our midfielders who have at some point been out of the team are getting better numbers than him, shows it's not the tactics or Van Gaal.

9473~~~
Just point him in the direction of a tree with a tyre swing and release him into the wild!

9474~~~
Yeah,he was rubbish all of 2016 too.  I signed Lukaku in September 2015 and he scores for fun, so Rooney was only ever a squad cover player.   Made no impact at all that season or the next.  Its amazing to also get him off the wage bill - can get 2 quality players in for his salary.

One of the key reasons I like Football Manager is that it shows you how things will most likely map out in the future.  Rooney is massively in decline and offers less and less as the months go by.  We should move him on asap as we are just delaying the inevitable.  Or he should accept a squad rotation role: the team cannot depend on him at all, but that should also be on a significantly reduced salary.  Moyes really screwed us with that contract.

9475~~~
Our players are looking to him for inspiration. We are doomed

9476~~~
Smalling is brainless. Have they not seen him play and the irrefutable stats? Rooney is a nothing player and has been for a while.

9477~~~
No wonder we have stunk if they are waiting for Wayne to happen.

9478~~~
That explains why we've been shit in attack for so long.

9479~~~
His supporters are very quiet now because they used to be able to trot out the statistics to tell everyone he still contributes alot. It's all gone now though, ka-shush, snuffed out.

Look at those horrendous statistics in the past three pages. Absolutely horrifying. It resembles us under LvG: play like utter shit but still somehow flatter to deceive. Then december comes and we have been exposed. Rooney symbolizes United and his career is almost done.

9480~~~
So Smalling saying that makes him brainless? Christ man. You don't expect him to say anything else do you?

9481~~~
Don't see many defending Rooney these days and except for the media/pundits most realise he's past his best. Well they probably do too but don't want to go there yet.

9482~~~
Exactly. Still a few hardcore ones though who get a sneaky comment or two in in other threads. I guess it he's earned these fanatics after so many years of service, like the breaking traces in your boxer shorts that just won't wash out.

9483~~~
reminds me of Darmian saying how impressed he was with Rooney losing possession but always trying to get it back

its embarrassing all these punters (his mates) defending the England captain leading to the Euros. When the summer is over he will be slaughtered

9484~~~
That's really sad. I swear if we put any of our defenders in his shoes he would have better numbers. He wouldn't probably be any worse in his all around play either. 

That's really embarrassing, if we don't try our best to sell him or even plan our next season(even this so far is one big farce) without him as a starter then this club is truly run by idiots, I seriously can't see how anyone can think otherwise. Absolutely pathethic.

9485~~~
I actually used to be one of those people who backed him using statistics.

but now that he can't contribute to our team by scoring goals at least, so there's nothing to defend him for any longer. therefore I've jumped the ship.

christ, he's worse than falcao was last season and falcao was pretty bad last season!

9486~~~
You deserve nothing when your "main man" is present day Wayne Rooney.

I wonder if this is how they speak in the dressing room, still treating Rooney as if he's this great player, and pretending to think highly of him. I imagine it would be slightly uncomfortable for a few to do that, and I find it hard to believe that it wouldn't sometimes become an issue.

Funnily enough, as things stand, 20-year Martial is our talisman and the one we really rely on.

9487~~~
I can't click that link, but I seriously cannot believe that Smalling would say that out of nothing. I reckon they asked him if Rooney is a good captain or something like that so of course you can't expect him to criticise him, because I saw many of similar interviews from our other players praising Rooney like that. Surely they aren't that stupid and that's just PR bullshit, I wouldn't be surprised if our club is forcing it too making players to say things like that.

However, it's sad.

9488~~~
The hosts on talksport have just Destroyed him to be fair to them. First time ive seen the press swing against him.

9489~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9490~~~
About time. What did they say?

9491~~~
They had a go at him before with Collymore's show.

9492~~~
I heard Jason Cundy say Waynes legs had gone and that next summer there might not be any justification in taking him to the Euros.

9493~~~
<b>Wayne Rooney PL Stats (Minus Pens):
</b>
2012 - 13 Goals, 9 Assists - 115mins per contribution
2013 - 13 Goals, 12 Assists - 92mins per contribution
2014 - 15 Goals, 5 Assists - 119mins per contribution
2015 - 5 Goals, 1 Assist - 474mins per contribution

2015 not a year to remember for Wayne despite it being the most mins he's played in the PL in all 4 years. His average mins is 2516, yet he managed 2841 this year.

<b>Wayne Rooney PL Stats (Including Pens):
</b>
2012 - 21 Goals, 9 Assists - 84mins per contribution
2013 - 14 Goals, 12 Assists - 89mins per contribution
2014 - 16 Goals, 5 Assists - 114mins per contribution
2015 - 5 Goals, 1 Assist - 406mins per contribution

A pretty grim downward curve, although 2012 to 2014 stats aren't too shabby. Either Van Gaal has destroyed Waynes confidence in the final third or that's it for Rooney as a striker. I'll do a quick summary of those years but with Manager breakdowns shortly.

9494~~~
In I the only one that thinks even his "good" years were very standard for a so called elite player. I mean 21 goals and 9 assists is pretty meh considering the numbers the likes of Henry before him and Suarez now are outputting.

9495~~~
<b><span style="color: #ff0000">Stats taken from 2012 onwards</span>

Wayne Rooney PL Stats (Minus Pens):</b>

Sir Alex: 18 Goals, 12 Assists - 116mins per contribution
Moyes: 13 Goals, 10 Assists - 103mins per contribution
Giggs: 2 Goals, 0 Assists - 45mins per contribution
Van Gaal: 13 Goals, 5 Assists - 230mins per contribution

<b>Wayne Rooney PL Stats (Including Pens):</b>

Sir Alex: 26 Goals, 12 Assists - 91mins per contribution
Moyes: 15 Goals, 10 Assists - 94mins per contribution
Giggs: 2 Goals, 0 Assists - 45mins per contribution
Van Gaal: 14 Goals, 5 Assists - 218mins per contribution

Now whats interesting about Van Gaals stats is that if you remove 2015 terrible stats then it actually reads as 109mins per contribution. Which is a bit worse than Moyes but not by much. So to conclude, the issue for Rooney comes from his 2015 stats and doesn't seem to be an issue with Van Gaal given that his first 6 months under Van Gaal was bang on his normal form.

9496~~~
He got away with it because there was always somebody else to carry the load, RVN early on, Ronaldo outshone him for years, Tevez contributed, Hernandez, RVP. Once RVP went he has been found out.

9497~~~
Are those  2015 statistics correct btw? Surely he's statistically one of the worst players in the entire league with those stats?

For instance what are Danny welbecks goals and assists for 2015?

9498~~~
For years people have been banging on about his work rate and the fact he is all over the pitch, and to some degree that is a good thing, but to me it has always smacked of positional indiscipline. I want my 10 or 9 to be in the final 3rd creating or scoring,  not  at left back. Had he been more disciplined over the years he would have had more impressive stats. 
Depending on how irritated I am on any given day by the spud faced chancer I either put it down to an unselfish willingness to work  for the team or a case of Stevie me syndrome and wanting to do it all himself and be Roy of the rovers. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9499~~~
Im on a facebook United group with mostly older United fans and those guys won't hear a bad word about Rooney. The delusion is incredible. Red tinted glasses

9500~~~
He was never an "elite" player. Was a level below even at his peak.

9501~~~
This is truth that has always been hidden from him. Fans, media and pundits alike has continually feed him and his convoy that he is in the same breath as the top players. His success has mainly hinged on the fact that he was a young prodigy and his goal count is as a result of his long career. United fans have fallen into the false that Rooney was one the top players. He was very good in his pomp but not as good as it was exaggerated. I believe his fellow pros dont help when they keep saying that Wayne Rooney is currently among the world's best. Yaya Toure said he's the 3rd best player in the world. This will only feed his ego.

It's times like this I really wished we gave Fergie more credit. He was aware that Rooney could not lead the attack but be a support act at best, which is not a bad tag. Rooney always had superior attack leaders ahead of him while he flourished as a support player and team player. RvN, Saha Ronaldo, RvP et al come to mind. Any wonder why Fergie consistently brought in more forward players to the club since Rooney joined the club. Smith, Diouf, Manucho, Rossi, Hernandez, Berbatov and many others were brought in quickly to lead the attack of United. Fergie realised that the spearhead didn't have to be the best player but a player that was able to be the point of attack, Rooney did not fit that profile.

I am aware that there were two seasons where he bagged at least 30 goals (and sadly we came second), he still didn't look comfortable in the aforementioned role as attack leader. Fergie was quick to attack this problem but I feel Rooney must have believed that it  was time to be promoted into the exclusive role. This is where the problem got worse IMO. Rooney had been heralded as the "white Pele", now been mentioned alongside Ronaldo and Messi who were leading the attacks of their respective clubs, he was now closing in on the English and United scoring records. Fergie just knew, I believe he could not shoulder that burden but Rooney being the new " big man" begged to differ. If he could have accepted that he could not bear that burden but continue as a support player we could have brought in a major striker IMO. What Rooney is currently suffering from is trying to be the team leader and attack leader at the same time. It's too much for him.

United (regardless of who we bring in) and England will continue to suffer IF they keep thinking that Rooney is the guy to "lead" attacks. He needs to humbly accept that it's too big for him. I appreciate Rooney the United team leader but I think Rooney the United attack leader is about championship level IMO. If he really wants to be the team player in my books, he needs to drop this silly pride and play for the forward progression of the team. Of course, the media, pundits and fans must help him along with the truth. Fergie was truly a genius.

9502~~~
For the last 3-4 years, definitely. He transformed into a player who would put up decent numbers but put in ordinary performances. Plenty of us would criticize him for it, because it was evident that, despite his goals, his overall game has degenerated big time. Funnily enough, that mirrors the situation with our football team as well. Just like Rooney went from end product masking other issues, United went from trophies masking other issues.

Having said that, he's never been as good as Henry or Suarez.

9503~~~
A goal or an assist every 84 mins is 'pretty meh' now? Are you taking the piss?

Did he get away with it when he scored 34 goals twice then? He had his best individual season after Ronaldo left. Just because he's struggling now past his peak doesn't mean he wasn't great before.

Not all elite players have to be the main striker. That's like dismissing Di Maria's contributions in his final season at Madrid because Ronaldo scored all the goals, or dismissing Ozil's contribution to Arsenal this season because he's the one assisting and not scoring, it's ridiculous. Rooney made a fantastic contribution to United from 2006-2012 where he was a top 10 player in world football with some of those seasons pushing top 5. 

I can understand people criticising the current Rooney, but I don't understand how United fans can underrate his contribution during his peak. He wasn't Messi or Ronaldo but he was an elite player.

9504~~~
He was an excellent young player and between ages say 23-26 he was one of the best in the world. Never the best but worthy of his reputation.

9505~~~
That's really not true isn't it?

In 2006 he was nowhere on the list for Ballon d'Or, in 2007 he finished 26th, 2008 - 13th, 2009 8th, 2010 not even in top20, 2011 5th, 2012 15th.

Ballon d'Or list doesn't have to be crucial argument, but it probably helps him more than not considering he was one of our best players during that period, is Englands best player and worldwide he is one of the most famous players, and we all know that's more important for Ballon d'Or than his qualities as a footballer.

9506~~~
I'd argue these awards favour the main goal scorers rather than the support act. Also he came 17th in the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year and 13th in 2007 but I wouldn't really use these lists as a crucial argument like you've said.

I'm more inclined to say in my argument that:

In 06/07 he was a key player in a team that won the prem and got to the semis of the CL, earned praise from Carlo Ancelotti after he scored a brace against AC Milan who claimed that United don't just have one special player in Ronaldo but also Rooney.

In 07/08 he was a key player in a premier league and champions league winningteam.

08/09 he was a key player in a team that won the prem and reached a CL final, he also won golden boot in the CWC that we won as well

09/10 34 goals, he was voted best player in the premier league

10/11 shit first half but his second half was some of the best football we've seen from him

11/12 34 goals for us in a season where we finished level on goal difference with the champions, had one of the best big game scoring records in Europe.

So yeah I'd say he was an elite player from 2006-2012 and in my opinion he was a top 10 player in the world during that time. I'd say he was top 5 in 09/10 and top 5 during the second half of 10/11 and start of 11/12.

9507~~~
Your argument is even more filmsy that the balon d'or one.

He was nowhere near the top 5  after 2010...that's just laughable....especially considering the form of Barca, Real players at the time, with Sneijder , the Bayern players. 

Consider that he wasnt even the best in the league either since then...or in the top 3 at any of that time. 

I'll give him 2009/10 as he was sensational around that year, but he's been just a good player other than based on any tangible metric.

9508~~~
It's not laughable at all, we reached the CL final with him being the key player. He also scored in the CL final. Pretty sure he came 5th in the Ballon D'or because of that form.

9509~~~
Isn't it a bit sad that he reached his peak at that age when most players have yet to reach theirs?

9510~~~
Most players weren't as good as him at a young age though.

9511~~~
That is likely what SAF was taking into account when he wanted rid. Wayne started playing really early so it was a possibility that he would go downhill earlier than most.

9512~~~
Herein lies the problem. The qualitative description of the modern footballer is so broad and the distinctive lines have become so blurry. It used to be bad, good and world class. The English media is particularly to blame for this, calling every Tom, Dick and Boris that puts in a "surprisingly" good shift world class. For me, I had to use the following distinct category to make it clearer.

<b>Poor</b>
This is a PL footballer who has no business being on the pitch or on the bench. He will barely be a regular player in a Championship side. Usually a player that comes into the league via a promoted side or a very young and inexperienced player. He may thrive in other leagues but the PL is too huge a step for him. Tyler Blackett.

<b>Average</b>
This is the MINIMUM requirement IMO for a squad player in a low to mid table PL club. He should be able to do the basics of football well enough that should warrant a starting place in any Championship side. This is also the minimum requirement for a youth player coming into a top PL side. Paddy McNair.
<b>
Good</b>
This is where it gets interesting. This PL player should be able to stand out in the Championship with ease. This is the minimum requirement for the squad player for a top PL side. The PL should be vastly populated with this calibre of player. Ashley Young.

<b>Very Good</b>
This is where I believe a lot of fans begin to exaggerate. A very good PL player is one that stands out in the PL in quality and consistency. This PL has the ability to put in world class performances once in a while but that will not stand out amongst the best of his peers. A lot of players that are called world class are really just very good players. Chris Smalling

<b>World Class</b>
World class players are players that can stand shoulder to shoulder with their peers in their respective positions. They may not make the World XI but will hardly upset the balance of the World XI side if they replace another in the line up. For me they are usually limited to the best 3-5 within their respective position. De Gea

<b>Elite</b>
Elite players are simply players that set new boundaries within their footballing discipline. They are consistently in the WXI even without hitting top form every season. Messi & Ronaldo (Lahm and Neuer are close IMO)

With the above, Rooney has never been elite and has not always been world class in his prime. An average player may put in the odd world class performance but that does not make him a world class player. It's called hitting a purple patch. Rooney is the typical very good player that could put in world class shifts. He will always be remembered as a the world class footballer but never the world class forward IMO. Rooney has never been as good as Henry, Suarez, Aguero, Ruud (and these guys have just been world class IMO) as a forward so how can he be called elite. Right now, Rooney is just a good player and won't be long before he becomes average is his decline is continuing at this rate.

9513~~~
Well I just assumed you meant world class by elite. For me he was a world class footballer during that period. Aguero and Ruud are/were better strikers than Rooney but I'll have peak Rooney as the better footballer or at least on a par with Aguero. He's also not just been great in the PL but also in the CL, hence a lot of players abroad have a lot of respect for him + top managers like Ancelotti and Guardiola. Peak Rooney is a tactical dream for any manager, passing range and work rate to drop back into midfield when needed in big games, able to be shifted out wide if a 433 is needed and you still get work rate + attacking quality. That's probably why Jose really wanted to manage him.

9514~~~
I'm not totally disputing what you are saying here but I submit to you that a lot of recommendations are a result of hype and marketability Rooney's main hype is drawn from the fact that 1) he came onto the scene as a child, 2) sold to the biggest club for a record breaking fee for a teen, 3) he is English (believe it or not, this makes a big impact on how people view players unfortunately), 4) he has been at United for a relatively long time, 5) he has won a lot in that time, 6) he was really good at football too. Now, this is not to discredit Rooney past, he has been a great servant to United and to football but a lot of times their is more hype than fact when it comes to Rooney, which is a common trend for many English players. The combination of English and Manchester United is very very marketable. Other foreign managers say what they say about Rooney when questioned by the English media and not voluntarily. Do you really believe it when a top player still says that Rooney is amongst the top 5 players in the world? I don't. If Rooney was from San Marino and played for Juventus (for the sake of it) , he wouldn't have as much attention attached to him.

No doubt about it, Rooney was one of the few players that epitomized being a "team player with a fighting spirit". Rarely will you find a player that couples that with a good technical and attacking attributes. This is what makes him stand out. He was a dream for any manager because he ticked many boxes and was good at them, making him a desirable footballer but he never stood out at any one thing.

9515~~~
He's gonna cost van Gaal his job.

9516~~~
Actually I feel quality English and Manchester United players are generally underrated in our own country but rated appropriately abroad. Rio Ferdinand for me is one of the best centre backs I've ever seen, but it doesn't seem like he gets that amount of credit. Michael Carrick seems to be rated more by people from abroad than in England. Paul Scholes has only recently got the credit he deserves. And for me, I feel Rooney has been underrated in recent years because England blame him for all their failures.

9517~~~
Not having it that Van Nistelrooy was obviously better than Rooney. He scored a lot of goals in a team that didn't actually win very much, and this at a time when there was no oiled up Chelsea and City (i.e. less competition).

I'll take Rooney's talents and contributions to the United cause every day of the week.

9518~~~
I think there's been a few signs of him turning this around. I think he's been very unfit this season, more than usual. Seeing him today he looks a lot better than before. I think a lot of our players have been looking awfully unfit, like Schweinsteiger, Depay, Carrick to name a few. There's a chance it's down to Van Gaals training methods. Sometimes these sort of things pans out during a season or LVG just upped the doze of training in the past month and that's why they've been looking so tired recently. I think it's 100% sure W.Rooney will come back strong in the second half of the season.

9519~~~
Some will say he's played better again today but for me, it's just a lowering of standards.

He offers so little as a striker (his job is to score goals) and he never looks a threat. It's a blunt forward line. We have to batter the ball over the line to score because Rooney offers zero finesse.

9520~~~
He's been alright today. He hasn't fecked up an attack with a shit touch so far and one of his hollywood passes even came off. Progress.

9521~~~
Agreed. OR Martial has to richochet it off his knee again.

9522~~~
Still not good enough.

9523~~~
His runs he makes and the timing of them are absolutely horrible. when we were countering with BFS he ran in a straight line offering nothing, and then when Mata had the chance he was standing miles offside. So frustrating!

I wish he would stop standing upfront with his back to the goal also, he's so easy to mark these days it's like night and day to when he was younger

9524~~~
Yup he'll definitely be 101% better come May

9525~~~
That was a fantastic goal to be fair. Fingers crossed for a better 2016..

9526~~~
Could that be a turning point? 

Probably not but it was a superb finish!

9527~~~
Brilliant goal!

9528~~~
Been good today. Happy for him.

9529~~~
Fair play to him for that finish. We needed it and he stepped up. Thanks. Hope it's the start of a revival (for United's sake, not his). Fear it's just the dragging out of the end though. Even a broken clock tells the time right twice a day.

9530~~~
Unfortunately we've been here before. 

Fine finish for sure (where the hell that's been all season I'll never know). However it would seem likely to be an anomaly. Could have easily bounced over the bar on the another attempt. Least he's scored a goal though - it is his job.

9531~~~
Er Young or Martial?

9532~~~
Scored in every game this year, class act

9533~~~
More delusional media arselicking of Rooney. It really is getting old. He has just about been acceptable today and scored am admittedly tidy finish from two yards out so therefore he must have been our best player, he is back, uniteds saviour blah blah blah.

9534~~~
In my opinion (hope I'm wrong) Rooney is past it.We may still get some sublime pieces of skill from him but he's just not consistent enough anymore.He looks like a guy who's played too much football to me.
Jaded.

9535~~~
Great goal but it doesn't change anything. I'd like see him actually put in a great performance once like an aguero does, or rvp used to.

9536~~~

9537~~~
As shit as he's been all season that was a really lovely goal.

9538~~~
Thought he was having a bad game myself. Usual poor touches but he was at least trying to shoot at goal. Wasted several attacks with poor passes or touches. Having said that, he reacted well to the equaliser and that was a terrific goal. Hope it shakes him up a bit.

9539~~~
It's been 2 good performances in a row in fairness

Maybe...he is back....ish?

9540~~~
He was good against Chelsea?

9541~~~
Well many didn't seem to think his miss at the end was all that bad...for a 300k/wk striker.

9542~~~
He was pretty good 

A 7/10 I would give him the same today

9543~~~
He was just about passable against Chelsea. He had a bright opening with a couple of layoffs and eventually missed a great chance.

He needs to have a few top class peformances before anyone can claim he's back. United's "main man" can't be a bloke no one remembers last having a brilliant game.

Smalling, for example, has had many quality performances this season.

9544~~~
188th goal in the EPL, 2nd all time scorer now behind Shearer

9545~~~
That's very generous, 5.5 or at most 6/10

9546~~~
Nice goal by Mark Robbins that <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9547~~~
Good game from him. feck off Rooney haters.

9548~~~
Good game by Rooney. Just like some people in England are delusional and overrate him, some in here are too emotional and hate him too much to acknowledge he had a decent game. It's far from the Rooney of old, but he's strung two decent games together. You take what you can get.

9549~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Some of the mealy mouthed praise he's been getting today! So many posters on the Caf are every bit as biased as the pundits they complain about.

9550~~~
Very good goal that. Was pretty decent overall today.

9551~~~
Come on lads, he scored a nice goal.  He is still not good enough and his age will just be more telling next season.  We need to ship him.

9552~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/b5pa" width="560"></iframe>

9553~~~
Martial was our best player, Rooney was good , excellent goal to win us the game, lets hope he can build on this.

9554~~~
7/7.5 today. We should really have scored a couple more than we did today and that has a lot to do with us looking like we had 11 on the pitch.

9555~~~
Is that the bumblebee man from The Simpsons doing commentary ?

9556~~~
6/10 at best because he was on the winning side. The goal aside he was pretty average like most of the team.

United fans need to go get DVDs of seasons reviews of the past and remind themselves of what a good performances look like. Our standards are so low these days.

9557~~~
Finally a good game from him again. He looked quite different today from the go. Was aggressive and chasing the opposition just the final ball and finishing touch he was his usual self but he didn't let up and rewarded himself in the second half with that great finish. That's the kind of attitude we need from our captain.

9558~~~
Maybe, just maybe, there's life in the old dog just yet... Maybe.

9559~~~
To be honest I think it was his best performance of the season. He actually added to the team apart from his goal which is a huge difference. I can geniunely say he was one of our top 3 players today.

9560~~~
The media will have the lube out tonight! He was solid, 2 or 3 decent lay-offs and took his goal well.

9561~~~
That was a crap goal, the kind I've scored many a time. Admittedly my dog was in goal though.

9562~~~
It's in all of our best interests if he turns it around - can't understand why some here almost don't seem to want that.

9563~~~
That commentator is quality <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Beautiful flick for the goal. We shouldn't get ahead of ourselves though, a new striker to lead the line is a top priority. It'd save us a lot of trouble if Rooney could turn things back around but it's very, very unlikely. If he can score like that on a consistent basis until we can bring someone in though that would be ace.

9564~~~
Decent performance and a great goal. He started 2011 in a similar way after struggling in the first half of 10/11 season. I'll be very surprised if he goes on to have an excellent second half of the season though. 5 years later it is difficult, nay impossible.

Signing a top striker is still a priority.

9565~~~
Energetic, involved and worked til the final whistle.  Superb quality winning goal which hopefully reminds him of his past powers and what it feels like to be a match winner. 

One game at a time.

9566~~~
That was an excellent goal by any striker's standards. Decent performance overall.

9567~~~
Read somewhere his last goal was against CSKA on 3rd Nov. So after today, will his next goal come against Watford on 3rd March? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/><img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/><img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/><img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

9568~~~
Reckon he'll play well till the transfer window is over.. make us not get in another striker and revert to normal once February strikes.

9569~~~
Wow! I I don't know where to start with that one. He is actually the 'chief' sportswriter of the Indy.  Great responses to that tweet though.

9570~~~
Can't fault him for that, great game. The heat is on him in January. Good, he needs a fire up his arse to get the best out of him. He needs competition.

9571~~~
Good goal. Now prove us that wasn't a fluke you thick scouse fecker.

9572~~~
I think most would love that, but with each month that goes by, the less likely it will happen. Hes 30 and looks to have been on the decline for about 2-3 years (when it really should have been his peak). 

He really should be our talisman instead of having a worldclass moment every 6 months and then getting leeway for 4 of those months or something.

I honestly think if he scores every game (or 1 in 2) people wont care about the rest of his performance. But when hes not scoring / assisting, his games are 6 at best. Like today, without the goal, he was 6 at best. He wasnt great, but in the end, he was a match winner with a brilliant finish.

9573~~~
Not great but better. Very well taken goal and I hope he finally finds his form

9574~~~
I've criticized him enough so I have to give him some credit when he does well. It's not even about the goal, I liked his movement in and around the penalty box.

9575~~~
Didn't know Wayne had a twin brother.

9576~~~
That's spectacular finish, hope this helps to bring him back to his old form,but i'm not convinced enough with his over all performance.

9577~~~
Against Chelsea, he was MOTM even though it was DDG who got us the point.
Today, it was Martial who got us the 3 points.
I have no idea why anybody would think that Rooney is MOTM in the last 2 games.

9578~~~
actually had a good game today.

that said, my mind hasn't changed as he's not going to miraculously return to form. I hope he does but the chances of that are extremely slim.

9579~~~
No dude. 
We are merely pointing out that 1 goal does not change anything.
I tend to judge players across several games (and not one).
He has scored 3 EPL goals. That's poor by any striker's standards. In fact, that sort of end product would get you sacked/sold/retired.

9580~~~
Been great all year, to be fair.

9581~~~
Yeah, I've been telling my mates for months how good he really is.

9582~~~
We just want a team full of capable players not someone who plays all the time nevermind the horrible performances, having a decent game like today he's gaining time for himself, he will play another shit ten games, if he wanted to turn it around he should have started three years ago

9583~~~
Its been one game at a time for how many years now?

9584~~~
Great finish, but another bang average performance for me. Didnt trouble Swansea at all when he had the ball, and relied yet again on crosses being put on his plate. His touch was inconsistent and made hardly any forward runs AGAIN.

This goal will mask everything that's bad about him, but no doubt he will be labelled world class for another month until it's too late to sign another striker.

9585~~~
His movement and energy has been much better in the last 2 games, also his touch has been decent which is a sign of a Rooney returning to form.

9586~~~
Had a decent game and his goal was excellent but he's still not good enough. Martial was a clear motm but if they gave Rooney the award despite being completely average vs Chelsea I expect he'll be on the Ballon D'or shortlist in their eyes after today.

9587~~~
Something quite poetic in his goal to go ahead of Law being a backheel.

9588~~~
Decent game, great goal. He's been a bit better recently

9589~~~
I agree he has had a lot more influence in the Chelsea game and today.  Genuinely seems to be trying to cajole himself back into form.

Would be great if we could get someone Lukaku to give him some competition for his place.  Oddly enough, I think thats the only way to save his career at our club.

9590~~~
Good post. An actual supportive one.

9591~~~
those players don't captain England

9592~~~
Completely agree with this. Drop him a few times and were more likely to see the angry useful Rooney. If he is forced to earn his place I genuinely think he will. He needs to be challenged.

9593~~~
I'd agree.

9594~~~
LVG dropped him versus Stoke. His privileges have gone. That has done the trick.

9595~~~
Maybe the threat of "competition" for his place has lit a fire under him?

9596~~~
He's not helped by the fact our wide forwards very rarely get to the byeline for cut backs. Plus all our play is slow it takes his counter attacking qualities to a minimum. Must be a nightmare playing as a 9 or 10 in this team.

9597~~~
Actually played like his he is supposed to as a 9. He came out wide, he tried to run behind, was in the middle for crosses and even did the whole get the ball out wide and bust a gut to get in position. A far better performance overall and like the win by the team, he needs to build on it.

9598~~~
That goal is the best contribution he's had all season. Still short of where he should be, goal aside it still wouldn't be a great performance by any stretch. Owes an awful lot to Martial as well, seen a few match reports just going on about Rooney winning the game with a bit of magic yet what Martial did was just as important. Hopefully the finish gives Wayne a bit of confidence.

9599~~~
The English media love-fest for him really is bizarre, you'd think he'd won the game for us single handedly today, it's as if Martial's contribution was irrelevant. He was a bit better but lets be real, he's well past his best and if the team is going to get back on track he needs replacing.

9600~~~
Was better today and took the goal well.  First touch, passing, free-kicks, were all still dog shit though.  The goal will ensure his place in the side up till the end of the season now.

9601~~~
Great goal.
What on earth were you twats all moaning about?

<span style="color: #ffffff">who's first, just who is first</span>

9602~~~
He's back. <span style="color: #ffffff">For the week.</span>

9603~~~
Think being dropped at Stoke put a rocket up his ass.

He has that bite and aggressiveness back, which is what Rooney needs.

9604~~~
I didn't watch the game unfortunately, but I did see Rooney's goal. Very clever from Wayne.

How was his performance though?

9605~~~
Better than usual actually. Not great, but pretty decent.

I just hope that goal will give him a kickstart. Though I said that after the goal against Everton.

9606~~~
Really happy for him, deserved his goal.

9607~~~
We can only hope he proves a lot of us wrong.

9608~~~
This is the worst kind of post you can read in the United player performance forum, IMO, and that's why any kind of decent discussion is impossible here. No matter which player some people are praising or criticising, the reason is simple, it's because they are fanboys or haters, it's impossible to criticise or praise any of our players without anyone accusing you of having some kind of agenda.

I think Herrera's thread alongside Rooney's(it's quiet lately because he is truly shit, but you'll still see this kind of post from time to time) is the worst, majority of people who post in Herrera thread are saying he is overrated by our fans, and that people praise his performance mostly because they like him in general but not because he played a good game. How exactly is he overrated when majority of the people who post there think he is overrated? I seriously cannot understand that.

9609~~~
I see where you're coming from, but that is not the case with Rooney. I've criticized Rooney's performances fairly this season I think - there are games where he's been absolutely diabolical. Other times, he's been "better" but still levels below what we should be expecting. But we've had the odd game this season in which he's performed well - maybe not world class, but still worthy of praise.

Now many of our players this season have had atrocious matches this season, but no player receives not only the unjust criticism, but actual abuse than any other player on this forum. If you actually think that's bollocks, then you seriously need to read a few random pages of each player's player performance thread and decide for yourself.

I notice the names who go well and beyond of slating him, and they are the very same names who go in hiding when Rooney actually has a good game - or alternatively puts in a petty dig that overshadows their initial compliment. 

Ignore the fact that he's our captain, but he's our fecking player. A player who deserves a lot more respect given his achievements at the club. Not directed at you Amar, but people on here need to realise that you need to support the player when he MIGHT be turning the corner. Not just belittle his performance. That is why I label them Rooney-haters, because they actually seem happier when he doesn't have a good game just so they can go on a justified rampage of him.

9610~~~
What a fantastic goal but it's one touch nestled between 6+ months of appalling performances...I'm convinced that he's done, not good enough any more etc and it'll take a hell of a lot more to change my mind. 

IMO the "hoping it's the start of something" brigade are just deluding themselves. I think that Football is pretty much the only sport where you can be awful for a whole game, score a tap in (or equivalent) and be 'Man of the Match', which is possibly why it's more difficult to chart the decline of a footballer...a goals cloud performances and are often the only statistic that 'experts' care about.

9611~~~
heard a lot that after the brugge game and everton game. in fact I thought the same the first 1 or 2 times he scored this season.

but it just didn't happen. not going to be fooled any more.

9612~~~
I thought he had a quite poor match bar his crossfield pass for Young in the first half and the outrageous goal in the second half.

But we've all grown accustomed to this now. At least he scored.

9613~~~
When he's shite, he gets stick. When he's good, he gets stick. The Caf for you....

Anyway...in the last couple of games, Rooney has shown improvement. Granted, as I stated before, it's probably not at the level we expect, but he is improving and that should be a positive. He scored today, and it was a well improvised goal. Absolute magic, but his overall play is what has been impressing me the most of late. Take the goal away and I'd still have he had a good performance. His passing, his touch, looked more of a goal threat, running with the ball, shooting, link up play, etc was all significantly better than what we have been seeing from Rooney this season. Hoping he can keep it up.

9614~~~
Lovely finish and a pretty good game overall. He still looked like he was slow or lacking desire at times, but he's been better since being benched. Should have happened months before it actually did.

9615~~~
Just watched it again - that was a stunning goal. Hopefully this has a galvanizing effect similar to his stunner against City back in the day.

9616~~~
He's definitely improved over the last two and a half games since starting on the bench.

Definitely still room for improvement (his movement up front is still quite bad), but at least his touch and passing seems to be back to a decent level.

9617~~~
I don't actually doubt that Rooney can be decent once again. I mean, someone who has achieved as much as him should be able to play at a 6-7/10 level consistently as opposed to 3-4/10, no matter if he's lost his physical edge.

The issue, for me, is whether he can be an 8-9/10 striker again. Because the importance and pay packet we've given him is of a player of that level. He's supposedly one of the highest paid players on the planet, and has "privelidges" that normally ensure he is the first name on the sheet. Is decent peformances fine for someone like that? Not for me, and it represents everything that is wrong with our football club. My fear is that Rooney reaches that 6 or 7 level consistently finally in the second half of the season and we still have a mediocre to goodish centre forward upfront for us as our "main man".

9618~~~
That really was a stunning finish. I am just trying to forget how terrible he has been this season just to appreciate the goal for what it was. Rooooonayyy!

9619~~~
I mean, it would be a shame if we have a talent like martial that deserves a class team around him and we're just interested in brand Wayne and prolonging his career/records while he keeps giving us "decent" or "fairly good".

That's my general and long term concern.

With regards to yesterday, terrific finish and just what we needed. Delighted for the team and him.

9620~~~
I agree with this sentiment.

9621~~~
I still hope he's sold before he has a chance to break Charlton's record.

9622~~~
Why?

9623~~~
I don't understand this logic a few people have. Did you not celebrate his winning goal yesterday?

9624~~~
very good goal

9625~~~
I think he means he wants Rooney to be sold in the summer rather than have him crawl towards the record next season, as opposed to desiring him to fail this season. I don't see why anyone would want him to stay beyond this season. I also don't see why anyone would want him to do badly this season.

9626~~~
Fair enough.

9627~~~
Quality goal, van Gaal dropping him against Stoke looks to have paid off.

9628~~~
Decent performance and a great goal.

9629~~~
He has done well in the last 2 games. 

I still can't stand him, tho.

9630~~~
A false dawn or the start of a hot streak?

He's been better in the last two games, but has still basically robbed a massive wage for the last year.

As captain of the club, he needs to do a hell of a lot better.

9631~~~
A lot of people saying he has been decent in the last two games, sorry but decent from out highest paid player, so called talisman and captain still isn't good enough, its better sure, but the minimum I expect from him is an average of 7.5/8 out if ten over a season, and before anyone claims that is unreasonable, he brought it on himself

9632~~~
I do think his performances have been a lot better since he was dropped. He was far more involved in and around the box and didn't drop so deep as much. He had a few half chances with headers and a shot into the side netting in the first half which showed promise and he deserved the goal he got. Excellent finish too.

9633~~~
A lot of people saying he has been decent in the last two games, sorry but decent from out highest paid player, so called talisman and captain still isn't good enough, its better sure, but the minimum I expect from him is an average of 7.5/8 out if ten over a season, and before anyone claims that is unreasonable, he brought it on himself

9634~~~
What's the chances he scores throughout January and we don't buy another forward cos of his form, and then from Feb onwards he turns to dross again

9635~~~
He's playing a lot better now than previously, but he slows us down so much with his 15 yard diameter 360s that he takes; he's turn circle is that of an oil tanker. Also, while I like that he is shooting more, he needs to look up more and find that killer pass; so many times there was an easy 45 degree pass for a player, like Herrera, in a much better position.

His goal was a beauty!

9636~~~
It's been quite a while since I've seen a whole match now, last time he was total gobshite, I think he looked way sharper now. Maybe he actually can pull off a good last half of the season, it's probably crucial if we want to challenge for the title, or even the top four. If he plays well the next couple of matches I have faith.

9637~~~

9638~~~
He looked much more lively, and  he got the much needed and deserved goal. He needs to be giving games like these as much as he can.

9639~~~
For what he is producing for the money he is on, we need somebody with the balls to feck him out pronto, he was a great player for us, but SAF wanted him gone and it that was the right decision, he is finished.

9640~~~
The chance of that is very high. 
We need to be building a team around martial and he is hindering that in a big way.

9641~~~
We can't. Nobody will take him and he won't reduce his wages. We are stuck with him, we just have to hope his form picks up. Also, let's not make the stupid mistake of another contract.

9642~~~
If you buy a scratcher and keep on buying one you'll bound to score a nice payout once in a while,  but the net gain is still a big deficit.  

It's like a broke drunken man bleating about he's going to get rich because he found 1 500 pounds scratcher after spending all his fortune on scratcher

9643~~~
I hope that he can keep scoring - if we insist on playing him. I'm all for supporting the team and giving a player his due when he performs, but I just feel sad that a Rooney performance of this level is now seen as worthy of praise. He's looked better than he did before and actually scored a belter. But he continues to be the slowest player in attack, missed some sitters and most importantly, continues to ensure that Martial is shunted wide. 

Still, as plenty (including me) have been saying for a while, none of this means he's going to be dropped. He'll be here and starting for he rest of this season at the very least, so we just need to hope that his level from now will be at least this good and that he'll score...

9644~~~
Who would have thought Carragher would become one of the voices of sense and reason. Whatever happens at the bare minimum we need a new starting #9 and the Captaincy switched to Smalling next season.

9645~~~
As shit as he has been in 2015 and maybe even 2014, I find it unbelievable how people are rewriting history with the "he never really was that special" stuff.

9646~~~
That's the precisely it. Hes playing like Gary Neville was in his last few games but with a few goals (given he's a striker). I couldn't say Giggs or Scholes because they were still technically wonderful. That's the issue for me. He'll get you goals here and there. He'll probably end up with 15 this season. But he'll do it like someone on his last legs. I totally wouldn't mind that if he was a squad player but if Wayne Rooney is the first name on the team sheet next season, we have no chance of winning anything and we deserve just that.

9647~~~
To focus on the team and not the personal issues, it's the amount of game time he will need at his current goalscoring pace to surpass the record. He will be given minutes not on merit but on the hope he will score and break the record. Who was it that said: "I tell the players that the bus is moving. This club has to progress. And the bus wouldn't wait for them."?

9648~~~
I only him to play on merit (it's up for debate whether that's the case this season.) However, I'll never be against him breaking the record, because that would mean that he's scoring goals for us.

9649~~~
It's pathetic. He's been average-to-awful for the last 2 years, but there was a time when he was up there with the very best in the world (probably from 2008-2011.)

9650~~~
Depends on how many players you allow into that category each year/season I guess...

2004-06 he was good but never a great player (but with evident potential we all wanted to see fulfilled).

2006-09 he was very good (big moments) but at times more a support player depending on who was the 'main' man in attack (Saha/Ronaldo). Rooney being played on the left for his 'work' against Barca in the 2009 CL final tells you his role and pecking order in that Ferguson side. To be fair Tevez struggled too with this.

2009-10 roughly is the only time he was seriously considered in the 'elite' bracket across Europe (outside United supporters) and that was due to his goalscoring record.

He's scored plenty since then but his game has regressed from that point, to where now it's just not good enough for a starting XI player at United.

So I do think there's a fair argument or discussion about how 'great' Rooney was or rather, how long his peak year were. Even in 2009-10, he was still nowhere near the likes of Ronaldo/Messi.

9651~~~
To be fair you cant use those two as yardsticks for world class, they are freaks of nature, between 2008/2010 he was in or around the world class bracket, even I cant deny him that.

9652~~~
2009-2010 he belonged to the very best. Easily. He was crazy good that season. Went downhill after that though. It was probably his peak.

9653~~~
Ripped from F365 mailbox.

9654~~~
If you exclude from the category of the very best Messi, Ronaldo, Xavi and Iniesta who are among the greatest attackers and midfielders of all time, then I agree. He wasn't up there with them at any point even though he was regarded as a world class player. He was a top 10, maybe even a top 5 forward for about 2 years (9-11), except for the fist half of 10/11 season.

9655~~~
in fairness a blind man could have told you Falcao was finished.

Rooney.. there is an argument about service and the way we play. I don't think he's as dead in the water as Falcao was.

9656~~~
Its as if people are blind to the clear chances he either misses of fluffs almost every game

9657~~~
Rooney looks every bit as finished as RvP and Falcao IMO, we'll never challenge for anything as long as he remains a mainstay starting fixture in the side.

9658~~~
Sorry, gb, but that's plain wrong. 

At least Falcao had the excuse that he had to share the space in the final third with RvP and Rooney most games (seriously, 3 strikers we played last season, absolutely mental).

There are no more excuses for Rooney. He's finished at the top level. He can get a couple of easy years in the MLS or elsewhere, but at Utd he's done.

9659~~~
Thing about Saturday's performance was that Rooney for the first time that I can remember in the 9 position was actually making the runs that he should be as a 9. He didn't come short as often and actually figured out that he should be pulling out wide once in a while. He's also tried to be a lot more direct like with the shot against Chelsea and also trying to dribble at people - unsuccessfully but, something that's needed from his position.

Maybe being dropped has something to do with it - sincerely hope he can continue to stoke the fire because there was a top quality player there one day and if he can come back out, we really could use that right now.

9660~~~
We will forever be making excuses for Wayne Rooney.

Not saying that Rooney hasn't been an awesome player in his pomp but is quickly becoming the most over hyped and the player with the most excuse attached to him in English football. There is always an excuse for Wayne Rooney for everything he does, just because we don't want to upset the "Great White Pele".

<ol>
<li>Whenever Wayne Rooney threw a tantrum on the pitch or acted erratically, they say it is because he is a street footballer and has a fire in his belly. So therefore let him be. False, He is not the only street footballer to grace the pitch as a professional. Many footballers from much humbler backgrounds had to learn football in less than suitable environments (especially South Americans and Africans) but you don't see them having some mythical fires in their bellies to play football. I coached a lot of young players and they say its not fair that Wayne can be excused for being angry on the pitch just because he is that good. Alan Shearer or Bobby Charlton did not need that attitude to play football. It's called mental strength and being a professional. What are we teaching our kids today?</li>
<li>Wayne Rooney is the only top flight footballer that can get away with looking the way he looks. Before anyone goes on about genetics, I played football for many years, being into body building and into coaching. While genetics can play a part in weight gain, it is not enough reason for Wayne Rooney not to be in top shape most of the season. I have trained people who were clinically obese to lose up to 15kg in a month without any supplementation or paid gyms. I am not saying it is totally his fault but from a young age, it is clear that Rooney did not do his utmost best to be in the best shape that his body can be in. I cringe when I see fans have a pop at Ronaldo for taking extra care of his body, more so United fans having a go at Lampard by calling him fat, meanwhile this guy has played football at the highest level consistently for many years and doing great things. Or at Yakubu (like many African players, allegedly) playing into the in England while they are accused of being 5 to 10 years older than they admit. An apparently 40 year old Yakubu still moved well enough. Arouna Kone is another one who has been injured for the best part of 2 years with a knee injury but my word, this fella has done well do come back playing the way he is playing. He is also older than Wayne Rooney, officially. When genetics get in the way, it only means that you have to do more than the average guy to get by, and with all the available sport science, doing what you love and the money that goes with it, there should hardly be any excuse. I know some non-league footballers who spent their first earning to make sure they stopped smoking, drinking and not eat processed food. That is sacrifice. Earlier this year, the grand master that is Messi, admitted he cut out processed food to be better. Messi, taking steps to be better? Let that sink in. But with Wayne Rooney it is ok, as long as you can play a bit.</li>
<li>Wayne Rooney is the only top flight footballer that needs at least 10 games to get into it, every season. I am so tired of this excuse. How bad must a high earning PL footballer be that he needs at least 10 games for everything. Everytime he has a dry spell, he needs another 10 games to find it again. Utter nonsense! Last season, Ronaldo did not score for 4 games, they said he needed a psychiatrist. Rooney does not score for 10 games, they say he is still finding his feet, the team, the manager and the formation are not playing to suit him. He is not Ronaldo or Messi, he should play around the team not vice versa. Even Fergie mentioned it but Rooney must never be dropped despite playing rubbish because he is on a 10 game road to getting it.</li>
<li>Wayne Rooney can hold United to ransom for the 3rd time and get away with it. But Ashley Cole or Berainho or Adebayor does it, they should be burnt at the stake!</li>
<li>It's a taboo to bring up how much Wayne Rooney earns because he is a great, loyal servant of United. I find this concept to be silly really. People act like Wayne hasn't cost financially. We took a gamble on a teenager for £28m, over 10 years ago! This guy has held us to ransom for money that he did not deserve, twice! I don't know how true but he threatened to go to City! We are just paying for his services and nothing more. I would have preferred if the likes of Giggs, Scholes or even Ronaldo did that to us but they never did. Yes, he is marketable but that is what United does for you. I know a lot of African born friends particularly from Nigeria who declared themselves to be Arsenal fans the moment they signed Kanu, even without ever watching a PL game. Its a mutual relationship.</li>
<li>I am happy he scored, happier that we won but that goal or the performance did not warrant headlines like "Captain fantastic", MOTM, Team of the week. This is the kind of thing and in form Welbeck would do but no one would rave about it.  </li>
</ol>This is not an attack on Wayne Rooney, the quicker he turns it around, the better for us. I just think fans have been so blinded and have their expectations and standards lowered when he it comes to Rooney. My main problem is that he doesn't look like leaving anytime soon, we are stuck with him and this can only hinder our forward progression.

9661~~~
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

excellent post, especially the part about Messi deciding even he could stand to lose weight

9662~~~
I'm sorry, but that was a lot of effort put into expressing something that pretty much everyone around here agrees with, and has been saying for years.

9663~~~
He is second behind van Gaal on the list of persons whose departures are necessary in order to transform and rebuild this United.

9664~~~

9665~~~
Deserves it tbf. Broke the all time record.

9666~~~
I was on the opinion that Rooney should have been sold as soon as Moyes got the offer from Mourinho, but you all thought Moyes had done a masterstroke by keeping Rooney on a ridiculous contract... Now we reap what we sow. Rooney has been shit since SAF benched him, but unfortunately Sir Alex couldn't get rid of him before he retired.

9667~~~
What? People are still slating him?
Isn't he back <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

9668~~~
Is the whole nation supposed to collude in the notion that Wayne is still a brilliant player? Jesus Christ...
There's a reason I posted that thing about 'The Emperor's New Clothes'.

9669~~~
That is the point. He will probably win a new contract based on that!

9670~~~
He'll be leading English attack proudly in the upcoming EC. He'll be the one to lead the brave Englishmen to the eternal glory

which is getting out of the group.

9671~~~
Voted Englands best in his shittest ever season. Untouchable

9672~~~
Next year will be the 4th out of 5 years on his contract won't it?

Guaranteed we renew it on a wage rise.

He needs to go this summer.

9673~~~
His contract is a sunk cost. We can get rid of him and free up at least part of what he is on. I don't think he will be of any use next season.

9674~~~
wisper it though.

9675~~~
I think LVG had a word with him. He told him that if he got sacked, Rooney's MUFC career was over. So, if he knew what was good for him, he'd better try and score/create....or something like that. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

9676~~~
Guys. I'm not too bright.
Can someone just clarify - Rooney has been voted by a group of knowledge football experts as the best English player alive, based on his 2015 performances?
Have I got this right?

9677~~~
Assuming it's for his performances for Country and not club. And no one has really stood out for England in 2015 and Rooney did break Sir Bobby's record, so the award is not too far fetched.

9678~~~
I just read that it was the Official England Supporters Club members who voted.

9679~~~
Yes, some of the 5 members are Rooney, Colleen, van Gaal, etc.

9680~~~
Scored 5 goals in 8 games, or 4 goals in 4 games if you only count competitive ones. Broke the all time England scoring record (which had stood for 45 years). Captained the team to European Championships qualification.

It's not really an outlandish a decision, given that context.

9681~~~
They are all building him up for a massive fall this year at the euros.

9682~~~
The media need to bear in mind that not all of the public are English.

9683~~~
He's scored in every game this year. What more could you possibly want?!

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9684~~~
Good post.

9685~~~
Having a debate with a boy at my work today. 

If you could have one of them for one season only, Prime Rooney, Prime Drogba or Prime Fernando Torres at Liverpool?

I would say Drogba > Torres > Rooney.

9686~~~
Prime Torres for me, was the best around in 2008/9. I would also argue that Rooney of 2009/10 had more to his game than Drogba did in his prime though though the latter was more difficult to defend against. You can make a case for any of them though

9687~~~
Not much between those three if you're questioning who was better at their absolute best.

9688~~~

9689~~~
Utter utter dross.

Scores 1 decent goal and he's back in his comfort zone. Think will Keane would offer more than he does at present

9690~~~
Next manager has to sell him.

9691~~~
He's not had much to work with, to be fair. Everyone behind him has been just as bad.

9692~~~
pure crap yet again with rooney

9693~~~
Nah, he's just completely finished. Every now and then he'll score a nice goal and some people will claim he's back, but look at the state of the chap. He plays like a 60 year old. Giggs at the end of his career looked a youngster in comparison.

9694~~~
Awful first touch again. And as a striker, his movement in the box is really static.

9695~~~
Will the real Wayne Rooney please feck off?

9696~~~
Yeah, this is it sadly. Its happened too much for it to be anything else.

9697~~~
please gif that, 55th minute, rooney trying to play the ball round defender and oversprint him, so hilarious how shit he is, he wouldn't get into their side..

9698~~~
Only tuning in now. Sounds like more of the same.

<i>He's back.</i> 

My bollocks.

9699~~~
It was like the moment he thought he could go past Terry.

Someone should make a blooper reel of Rooney this season.

9700~~~
Eddie Howe has been singing his praise all game on my stream. Cringe worthy.

9701~~~
Tactical move to keep him playing for United?

Eddie's not that silly. Privately he must know. The rest of the world does too by now.

9702~~~
He can barely control a ball with his first touch. Every second touch is a scrambling effort to keep possession. Useless donkey.

9703~~~
It is getting rather insulting the amount of sympathy commentators give him, unlike any other player. 

Are we all blind? Seriously, it would make more sense at this stage.

9704~~~
His legacy at United is getting ruined..any fond memories of a wonderful career will be obfuscated by the steaming turd of this season.

9705~~~
yay penalty... i guess

9706~~~
Man of the Match award incoming now.

9707~~~
He scores when he waaaaaants.

9708~~~
If any media outlet glosses over this performance because he scored that penalty they should be fecking embarrassed.

Ps thanks for scoring.

9709~~~
Don't be daft. They will literally say 'Rooney saves United'.

9710~~~
He's redeemed himself.

9711~~~
2 in 2. 

He scores when he wants.

9712~~~
He's been on fire lately.  Well done Wayne.

9713~~~
Commentator on my coverage: Rooney provides so much more than goals. 

This cover up is getting to conspiracy theory level.

9714~~~
90 minutes of shite will be forgotten.

9715~~~
Another one for the stat. He's having a statastical season.

9716~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Typical stuff.

He really knows how to win fans even when he's terrible, no doubt he will be praised for his effort too because he did that late tackle. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9717~~~
2 in 2. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9718~~~
There's no chance of him being sold anytime soon, is there?

9719~~~
Match winner, single-handedly won us the game. We're lucky to have him.

9720~~~
Good passes and good movement tonight.. And he won us the game. It's not his fault that he's got no one to pass to..  Captain

9721~~~
It's fecking ridiculous.

He'll get taken to Euro 2016 and slammed for being shite as well.

9722~~~
He was awful all game. That said, he did step up and took the responsibility when it mattered. It was a great penalty, taken under a lot of pressure. Deserves credit for that.

9723~~~
Yet the commentators on the game I watched were saying how excellent he was. I thought he was meh.

9724~~~
Goal aside, that was awful! A captain on £300k to score a penalty gets no applause from me.

9725~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9726~~~
I was going to give him the lowest rating (4) if it wasn't for the penalty. Was just thinking it around the 90th minute. Got bumped to a 6, at the end.

9727~~~
Atrocious game. He is physically so done

9728~~~
Captain Marvel saves the day.  It's too poetic

9729~~~
Good pen

2 goals in 2 games

But was very quiet this evening

9730~~~
Why cause he scored a penalty? Mata should be the lowest rating as he is an imposter of a player and we are down a man every game he starts.

9731~~~
Penalty will paper over the canyons given the protection he gets.

9732~~~
10 behind Charlton now.

9733~~~
Yes, because of the penalty. I explained it in my previous tweet. I was torn between 5 and 6 but decided to be generous, as the goal was very important. Mata gets a 4, of course.

9734~~~
It's shocking to see how much he has regressed.  In Fergie's final seasons, he would go on a drought every year but still hit a purple patch at some point, but that's not happening anymore.

9735~~~
No one dares criticize him. Would have laughed if I hadn't had enough.
Euro might finally be when his bubble bursts. Just have to endure this season.

9736~~~
He's been a lot more productive than Mata and is getting us points on the board. Fair play to him.. he's actually being the captain we need during this supposed period of crisis.

9737~~~
I would venture to say that Romario probably reached his goalscoring record with more dignity.

9738~~~
Scholes defending him to the hilt. "One of the best strikers in the world" i gagged

9739~~~
He's just physically done. It's so bloody obvious and so irritating listening to the media blaming everything else but the actual player for his performances.
He'll score the odd goal here and there but he will not provide us with performances that improve our situation.

9740~~~
He was terrible apart from the well taken penalty, don't think there's anyone who'll tell you different.

And what's wrong with that tackle, player went past Bastian and had a chance of getting cross in or something, should Rooney just stood there and look at him?

9741~~~
Scholes, just get the ball to Rooney. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's a joke how much he gets defended.

9742~~~
He'll break the record.

I'm sure we can get ourselves at least another 5-8 penalties this season. Another 3-4 off his arse.

9743~~~
Shite as usual. Get out of jail free card being gifted a penalty from Memphis' hardwork.

9744~~~
He's not the number one taker, though. It would have been Mata but he was subbed.

9745~~~
I gave him a five, for the penalty.

9746~~~
Scholes is spouting so much shite week and week out but his Rooney bias takes it all. It's ridiculous.

9747~~~
Alright Mr. Party Pooper...

(actually knew that about Mata being no.1 <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>)

9748~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> FFS

9749~~~
The sarcasm is strong in this thread today, and rightfully so. Woeful. Nice penalty though.

9750~~~
A superb footballer and he just proved it again.

9751~~~
Didnt he reach it while shagging prostitutes and smoking cigars all day on a beach in Brazil during the week?

9752~~~
Nothing wrong with the tackle, it's just typical of him to act like a captain in last minute of the game after doing feck all for 94 minutes.

As for the bolded part, are you sure?



Or you should have just watched the game with English commentary, or just listen what Scholes said.

9753~~~
He's more shot than a gun in Compton. Watching the punditry after the game is like WWF, you know it's not real yet they show maximum conviction in feeding their made up narrative.

9754~~~
Ipswich, Brugge, Sunderland, Sheffield United, Swansea. Flat track bully.

9755~~~
Really don't think he did that tackle so that he would be seen as some kind of brave captain or whatever, think he did it because Bastian failed to stop that player.

He started ok, so thats first 2minutes of the match, everything else was really bad.

9756~~~
Love to know what's wrong with me saying 2 in 2?

9757~~~
2 games this year and 2 goals, easy.

9758~~~
Well your post quite clearly shows you are quite happy with him. Excuse me if I am wrong.

It was a good tackle, I don't mind it anyway, just usually he is praised for that kind of thing more than anyone else, despite not showing any more effort than any of out other players in general.

9759~~~
One can imagine whether Giggs would ever drop him. Good that Sholes has nothing to say at our club.

9760~~~
Oh, didn't understood you first time. 

Agree with that, he's media darling and don't see that changing despite him being awful for 90% of matches played this season.

9761~~~
Very good penalty, but other than that - shit.

9762~~~
Wish he actually bullied.

9763~~~
2 for 2 this year - Rooney reborn <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9764~~~
Nope. My post quite clearly shows Rooney has 2 in 2.

I really despite posters like you, though. People who quite obviously have an agenda against one of our players. By no means was Rooney great today, but what the feck did anyone else do? Why are you not posting anything in the Mata thread, for example? A player, who, in my opinion, hasn't done nothing for the last month or so. 

If you're going to be critical of our team, at the very least lets try and keep it fair. Cheers.

9765~~~
Hmmm... Could easily make a blooper reel that would hit one million views, but I don't know when to release the comp. Need to contact my manager <a class="username" data-user="28685, @Cina" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28685/">@Cina</a>

9766~~~
He should not be playing as the main striker. Unlike most I won't write him completely off as I feel he's still capable of being our best #10 if the team is set up properly, but there is simply no way in hell he should be up front as the main guy.

9767~~~
It's funny with his penalties. He tends to score the ones that affect the result, and often missed the ones when we're already winning. Almost like a concentration thing.

Irritating one was when he started the season in great guns, smashed Arsenal in that 8-2 and then was on 2 v Chelsea in a 3-1 and missed one appallingly then, and was almost laughing about it

9768~~~
Never a better time.

9769~~~
If you accept that he's now an average player it was a fine performance.

9770~~~
If he had scored that, I think he was one goal away from getting a hattrick of hattricks (Arsenal, Bolton and of course Chelsea, - would have probably got it as well).

Anyway, yeah shocking again but scored another winner. TBH, I think everybody would take him playing pathetic the rest of the season but scoring winners in every remaining match. Honestly thats the only thing he can do now cos hes got no discipline to be a forward player (focal point of attack) and hes not good enough to be a play maker. (and defo not good enough to be a midfielder).

Maybe he can be a left back whilst Shaw is out.

9771~~~
Hope he gets the 10 goals this season just to see the total outrage in this thread.

9772~~~
Yeah, I am the one with an agenda even though pretty much everyone agrees with me that he is shit, except you who think he is actually doing well in last few games.

9773~~~
Mata writes blogs and is huggable and hasn't put in a TR at United.

9774~~~
He's also not on 300k a week, Captain of the club and constantly covered for by his cronies in the media. Mata is also getting plenty of stick on here, and so are Memphis, Fellaini and several other players. The biggest difference is the rest all get dropped and are all possible to be shifted out of the club, Rooney is stuck to the bowl.

9775~~~
Feast on this. He is worse than Falcao. Can not even trot out the "not played as a striker" excuse anymore. a nothing player.

9776~~~
You are really weird.

9777~~~
10 goals? What an accomplishment. Shall we give him the Golden Ball for it?

9778~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9779~~~
His defenders on here forget he's the only person in the squad with "privileges".

9780~~~
Trust you to ignore my point. Do you think Mata was shit?

9781~~~
Difficult to see how we're going to improve if we carry on playing him at the 9/10 (not that he'd be better elsewhere but perhaps less of a hindrance). He just miscontrols too many passes, as well as slowing down our play and making basically nothing else happen. 

I also find it annoying when he doesn't play a match, and we don't instantly improve, we get all the "so Rooney was the problem all along was he?" wise cracks. Just because he isn't the <i>only </i>problem, doesn't mean he's not a problem.

9782~~~
Of course he was.

9783~~~
So why not put that in his thread?

9784~~~
lol

I comment whoever I want. Why didn't you comment in Depay's thread about him winning a penalty or Smalling's how he had a good game?

9785~~~
Which seems to be only Rooney. Like I said, agenda!

Oh, and I did comment on Depay doing well when he come on. I try to stay away from negativity, though, and I never only target one player.

9786~~~
That was about as pathetic a display as I've seen from Rooney - absolutely rubbish. I desperately hope there is a twist to this transfer window that sees him somehow leave.

9787~~~
He scored the winning goal ffs.

9788~~~
10 <i>more </i>goals which would put him somewhere around 19 goals for the season.

9789~~~
You're the biggest agenda driven poster there is in this thread so let's not talk of weird. I accept Rooney has been largely poor this season and will be happy enough if he's dropped but I still want him to get the 10 more goals he needs to get the record. I'm sure there would be outrage amongst some of you fans that he dared to score 19  goals all season (all against shit teams)

9790~~~
Get a grip mate, it was a penalty. I'd say 8 or 9 others, maybe all 10, on that pitch at that time could have dispatched that past a third tier goalkeeper.

9791~~~
He shot a sublime penalty during a moment of true pressure. Captain's job done. He has done well the past few games.

9792~~~
For the bargin price of £300k a week.

He's going to limp over the line for the record with goals/penalties agaisnt Ipswich, Sheffield United, Brugge. Crap.

9793~~~
You seem interested in that more than anyone else tbh. For example, I am not sure I ever mentioned him breaking the record nor I have any idea how many goals he is short of the record. Probably because it won't change a thing about him as our player this year, he will still stay shit, and he will never be great as Sir Bobby, not even close.
The thing is, he doesn't even deserve being in the first XI judging by his performances and being able to break the record, even you acknowladge that. But if it will make you feel better about him then I hope he breaks it.


Yeah, agenda. How do you explain then me criticising Herrera, one of the players I like the most?

9794~~~
We are truly a blunt edged tool with this guy as our strker

9795~~~
shit

9796~~~
That compared to some of the stuff you say about Rooney? Behave!

9797~~~
Good penalty, well taken. I thought he started decently enough. His first touch was alright and he made some good runs. He faded in the 2nd half though. When he was moved deeper he just disappeared.

9798~~~
Thought it was hilarious when someone drilled a ball into feet (after we spent most of the first half playing the slowest passes known to man) and he, inevitably, couldn't control it.

9799~~~
+ Blind played a lovely fizzed pass that took out 2 defenders into Rooney on the edge of the box to the left. A normal player would roll it on and drive down the left hand side of the box and shoot / low cross or square it to someone. 

What does Rooney do? He pushes it back out and does a looped ball out to the right.

9800~~~
Shit. Never mind the penalty

9801~~~
This thread is boring, most posters here have already made up their mind. If he doesn't score then he is $hit anyway, if he scores an important goal then all credit will go elsewhere. If all else fails then 300k a week is a good dig. Never mind the fact that we have been more $hit to watch when he doesn't play. Any decent set of supporters will support a striker at least temporarily scoring 2 match winning goals in 2 games, specially with the results coming after a long series of disappointing results. Yes criticise, but it will help if it seems to be proportionate.

Also 300-k a week is a boring argument now. In today's time it only covers the wages of 2 decent forward position players at the max, and the ones who will not play every game at any top club. Our back-up to him is Fellaini but somehow it is his fault. The blame for 300k, for us having no back-up,  for us playing $hit even when he doesn't play, lies squarely with someone else. 

Lets criticise by all means but let's also remember that he is playing for our club and let's not let the negativity and hate override the objectivity.

9802~~~
He's finished. He plays like an old man. One in five games he might do one single thing well but realistically, he has been absolutely shite.

9803~~~
I haven't seen anyone post anything which is based on hate, it is all based entirely on his performances and the fact he's been by far our worst player this season. 
Do you honestly believe Rooney deserves  praise for any match apart from the hat trick against an awful Brugge side?

9804~~~
Never mind competing with best teams in the world. We will never win the league with Rooney as one of our main strikers. It's as simple as that.

Understandably some of England fans are still defending him, but the rest of the world see Rooney as one of the major reasons and signs for United decline.

9805~~~
You must be taking the piss. How much do you think Lewandowski or Aubameyang or Kane or Lukaku or Sanchez are on? The list goes on and on.

9806~~~
yes, based on all the games I (and most posters) have seen rooney playing we came to a sound conclusion that he's past it. only game he played well (i.e. coming close to justifying his status and wages) this season was against a depleted, injury ravaged brugge side.

I see plenty of people credit him when he scores. what same people do say though, is that just because he scored a goal doesn't mean he's back to the rooney of old. which is a completely valid statement.

the likes of neymar, suarez, lewa, muller, and aubameyang earn less than rooney does. they've also absolutely dwarfed him in terms of performances this season.

most rooney critics acknowledge that he isn't the ONLY problem with this team.

2 games isn't nearly enough to vindicate him of his poor performances throughout the season.

being objective right now is seeing that rooney is clearly past his best.

9807~~~
Lol. Your man isn't even producing the goods one decent foward should.

9808~~~
You're talking literally only Messi, Ronaldo and maybe a couple of others that get paid that or more. It will always be a valid argument while he isn't performing, that is supposed to be game changing, superstar, best in the world money and he's been nothing of the sort for about 3-4 years.

9809~~~
Cringe. Away at Anfield got forgotten quickly then.

9810~~~
Did it cost us? No
Rooney has missed penalties in the past and a lot of them but surprisingly he seems to always put away the ones that will win us the points/game. Took a super penalty to win the title at Blackburn as well.

9811~~~
I'm surprised he took the penalty anyway. Doesn't van Gaal take you off penalty duty if you miss one? And you go to the back of the line kind of deal.

9812~~~
Rooney playing, is no longer what's best for "our club". We won't move on until he's gone.

9813~~~
What's proportionate criticism to you? To ignore the obvious and play along with the Rooney-friendly "experts"? Well done with including the "any decent supporters will acknowledge my stand" [paraphrasing], you're no doubt in the higher echelon of hardcore United supporters. Here, have a cake.

You're missing the key element: He is playing utterly shit despite scoring a couple match-winning goals. The only thing that keeps him from never playing for United again is a stubborn dinosaur manager and the fact that noone else seems to be willing to step up. No wonder, since the manager has gotten rid of all competition for his place! So you're right about that part.

And I'm not surprised you see the 300k argument is boring now, when in fact it's so damn valid to point towards it. I see you trying to downplay the actual sum (two "decent forward positions" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>) but you seem to forget the factors behind the argument. It's not necessary the sum itself but:

-The symbolic factor about him our being our highest payed player by a mile, yet plays like a fringe player at best
-Him being on a salary level with the absolute best in the business while he's nowhere near being in the top 100

Yes, for the umpteenth time, he's been a legend for us, which is why his poor performances are met with sighs rather than boos at OT. The purchase of Fellaini might be the symbol for the direction the club has been taking post Sir Alex, but Rooney epitomises our rotten performances more than any. He is simply unable to perform at this level anymore, and should be removed before he damages his legacy completely.

9814~~~
Careful......His fans will accuse you of being agenda driven as apposed to what is the best long term interests of a club that purports to be competing with the likes of Bayern, Barca, and Real.....on the football pitch at least.

9815~~~
Mata and Herrera weren't on the pitch. I think they're supposed to be the first two. I imagine it wasn't a good time to try a new shooter in a moment like this and The Captain took the responsibility, as he should. 

I thought he'd miss it, to be honest.

9816~~~
Absolutely awful and we should just terminate his contact

9817~~~
LvG said Mata is first choice, Herrera second.

9818~~~
If the keeper picked the right way he would have. It wasn't a good penalty at all.

9819~~~
Nah, he hit it hard and low. Not quite in the corner but it was good enough. Few keepers would go down that quickly even if they picked the right way and only a great save would've caught that.

9820~~~
It was about half way between the goalkeeper and the post. If he went the right way I'd back him to save it more times that it goes past him. It's irrelevant though, he did enough to send him the wrong way so it doesn't matter. I don't want to be a complete pedant in looking for criticism with him because there's more than enough without being pedantic.

9821~~~
I also find the 300k argument boring too. Anyway its not 300 a week its 250. Also de Gea is on 200 a week and so is Schweinsteiger.

9822~~~
Are you sure? This one plus multiple other articles state he's on 300.000 pounds per week.  But yes there are many other articles stating he's on 250.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26246939" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26246939</a>

Anyway....it's a boring argument for those who still defend him because it's indefensible. He's probably the highest paid player in the league and wages should in some way reflect performances on the pitch. His performances have been underwhelming to say the least. It's irritating beyond belief that he's earning world class wages, being talked about as still being a world class player by the media and what's in front of us is clearly a footballer way past his prime. 
When his narrative in the media is so inexplicably positive, those who are calling him out on this forum like me become more cynical, more jaded about the situation, and probably repetitive and boring. It just seems so obvious he's past it, I just find the excuses unbelievable.

9823~~~
Imagine... if you will... if, instead of Wayne Rooney scoring the penalty yesterday... he turned around and booted it all the way back to David De Gea.

It would have been.... something...

9824~~~
Despite his lack of quality these days I really am starting to wonder what we'd be like if he wasn't in the side at all. Who would be the leader out there? Who in our current squad displays genuine leadership? Rooney does, more often than not at least, and I believe it makes a difference. No one is playing out of their skin to make an obvious case for dropping him. Our team has a worrying lack of personality and it's hard to know if that's down to LVG or the players.

9825~~~
Rooney isn't a leader. Never has been, never will be. Unless you think swearing at the referee is a sign of 'leadership'. A leader doesn't blame everyone around him - especially when he's usually the worst performing player on the pitch (see his reactions in the 5-3 against Leicester). But again, he never came across as captain material under Ferguson. His qualities were seemingly revised when Van Gaal made him captain. One quality of most captains is consistency - Rooney has never had that even at his best.

The bigger point is true. We have a shocking lack of mentally strong players in the squad who can drag their teammates on. I would say BFS and Smalling are the only ones I would say should be captain. Some might point at the likes of Carrick but he's far too weak and spineless for me.

It definitely needs addressed in future.

9826~~~
You make it sound like 10 goals is something to brag about.
He has 3 EPL goals to his name. 

While he is able to score against soft teams like Brugg and also a penalty against a league one side, his EPL goal count is more reliable when looking at stats.

9827~~~
Roy Keane would blame everyone around him that's for sure; although he would blame himself just as much. 

You constantly hear from different sources how much of an influence Rooney has in this squad, so I tend to believe it - players respect him and like him and seem to value having him as captain. I'm not saying he's an amazing captain or born for the role but I certainly can't think of anyone else in the squad who is an obvious choice ahead of him.

BFS would be a good choice a few years ago but he can't play all the time and is too new to the squad to be given the captaincy imo. Carrick can't expect to play every game either and like you said he seems rather spineless, even if that might sound like a harsh term. He's certainly no leader of men. Smalling I'm not so sure about either. He's having a good season but doesn't strike me as a captain either.

9828~~~
Balotelli has an influence on every dressing room he enters, influence and the ability to lead men are not the same thing. A captain needs the ability to influence but also needs many other additional qualities to properly make use of the skill. Maybe the players like Rooney as a captain because he doesn't demand that much of them or hold them to high standards. The best bosses aren't always the nicest or most liked people.

Keane didn't care about being liked but commanded respect due to the results his captaincy garnered. He demanded near perfection from those around him, and himself, and would do everything in his power to achieve it. Rooney shouts at people because they didn't pass to him or because he f*cked up and wants to pass the buck. He doesn't scream at them for slowing the tempo, loosing concentration or playing safe because his real interest lies in that which is good for him not that which is good for the team. #edit - comes across a bit harsh but what I mean is that it takes a certain type of person/character to see the bigger picture#

Leaders set the standard and provide an example to be followed. They spur the team on when faced with adversity and organise those around them if they go astray. A leader inspires the team to perform to their utmost abilities and provides the wiliness of experience on those days when it is not possible. Most of all a leader excepts responsibility both during and after the event. Rooney does none of those things and, bar the long since passed moments of drive and inspiration he used to display, never has shown (in a publicly available setting) any real characteristics required for leadership, on or off the pitch.

The idea that he qualifies as captain by default is maybe true but a poor decision nonetheless, it would be much more beneficial to go without than to appoint a captain that sets the wrong tone for an increasingly young group of players.

The team does lack personality but Rooney being our captain is the epitome of this rather than an exception to it.

9829~~~
Fair point on players liking him as captain because maybe he's not very demanding. I get what your saying about leaders but as you and I know there is no one in the team that has those qualities to what are we to do? You say giving Rooney the captaincy is a mistake but until we sign some new players what are we supposed to do? 

Stripping him of the captaincy mid season certainly wouldn't help matters and from Van Gaal's perspective I really don't see who else he could have named captain when he arrived.

9830~~~
The mistake has been made, nothing to be done unfortunately as you are right that stripping him of the captaincy now would only stir up more sh*t.

9831~~~
Which world is this then. From where I'm looking apart from a few dissenters on the Caf everyone still thinks highly of him.. and believe he is the man whose going to rescue us from our current decline.  

On match day I have not heard a single boo directed towards him. He has everyone on his side. He will stay here for another two seasons and break every record at the club .. retiring as a United great.

9832~~~
If this is a war and giggs and rooney is teh captain and general id probably desert. Not in a million year i would fight alongside them

9833~~~
Reminds me of what Scholes' ranted about last night. what good is being a leader and spokesperson in the changingroom, do something on the pitch

9834~~~
It's bad when the people getting outraged at the criticism can only really respond with "why aren't you criticising X as harshly?"

9835~~~
Where are you looking from? Your ivory tower?

Anyone who thinks Rooney is going to 'rescue us' needs to have their medication revised. 

If Rooney is still at United after this summer, the club as a group will have pretty much admitted they don't mind being mediocre and have no desire to challenge for top honours.

9836~~~
Get the ball to Wayne Rooney and all will be well, lads

9837~~~
With the amount of trophies and contributions to United success, I do think he's one of United great. There's no doubt about that. 

But as in Fergie's days, there should be time to get rid of players who could become a hindrance to United greatness. For various reasons, Fergie ditched RvN, Beckham, Stam, Veron, Keano, etc. who were considered 'stars'.

9838~~~
Where exactly are you looking from? Sometime in 2010? If so come back to the present and smell the coffee, he is done as a player at this level his continued stay is more a reflection of how the rot has well and truly set in.

9839~~~
He trulty is our talisman in that respect right now, he's as faded a force as a player as we are as a club at the moment.

9840~~~
Good comparison.

<a class="username" data-user="90856, @BarstoolProphet" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90856/">@BarstoolProphet</a> 
That "here, have a cake" bit made me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9841~~~
Yeah he is an over the hill, overrated and overpaid captain of a has been, stuck in the past club that is only good for one thing: getting overpaid in sponsorship deals

9842~~~
I hope this isn't the wrong thread for this, but how many goals is he missing for the all time record?

9843~~~
I think around 10? if he doesn't do it this year means he will defo be here next season

9844~~~
What a player gets paid is based on negotiations, when the contract is renewed, back-up players available, commercial worth, where he intends to go if sold etc. I hate to bring this point in, but his commercial worth for us is much more than any of the players you have mentioned and hence he is still cheaper if you take that into account.  Criticize the performance by all means but a salary is not a yardstick for a performance.

9845~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Just read that. Will shamelessly use more often.

9846~~~
Okay and who deserves praise for this season apart from De Gea, Martial and may be Smalling to some extent? So if our team is performing badly match after match, the average performance will stick out as better ones and the player performance thread is relative to the the performance of others.

9847~~~
I am not saying he is, all I am saying is that salary is a boring argument. E.g. if Man Utd come out and say Rooney's commercial worth to the club is around 10M per year and his net salary is around 50K per week, would it make his performances look better? No.

9848~~~
Fair point but he is playing for us now and until he is sold at least I would try and be objective. Also worth keeping in mind that we have been no better when he has not played, so the solution for what is 'best for the club' is not as simple.

Also different managers, different ex players, different commentators and different football experts do not share as negative a view of him as is mentioned here regularly. That's what I meant by being objective. There are lot of critical articles about him in the press regularly, but none beats even a single page of this mega thread. If nothing else changes and we just replace Rooney with a supposedly better forward, some people's happiness may be short lived. We need a very good striker but we have also been devoid of ideas, creative sparks, pace, lack of purpose, lack of width etc. in our play. A player's current performance is bound to be impacted by the constraints we play under.

9849~~~
When did I mention that any other players deserve praise? You are correct in saying that almost every player has been average at best, but if you think that exonerates Rooney then you are wrong. He is our highest earner, our captain and he has been absolutely abysmal. 
He has been a hit or miss player for years now, but even when he went on a poor streak you still expected him to turn it around whereas now I honestly think he's finished. 
I'd love to be wrong as when he's even half the player he was he's great, but I just don't see him turning it round at this stage in his career.

9850~~~
I'm grateful for what he has done. 
Unfortunately, he's half of the player he was. Maybe he can be useful for us but not as our main striker. To be honest, I can't see him going in the summer. We need a new striker, however, I think is probable that he will stay. 

I hope that the remaining of the season he can be in a good form and be an important player for us again (same with Memphis). If he stays, where do you think it could be his best position? CM? No.10?

9851~~~
That is not the point. You said 300k/week will only get us a couple of <i>decent </i>strikers. I only pointed out that is not true. Now you talk about Rooney's commercial value being more important to us than the top quality strikers available. It is quite funny you ask people not to point to his salary but then point to his importance to us in terms of commercial worth while trying to somehow justify his value to us in a business sense and then again go back to saying let us not point to his salary. Surely you can see the irony in that.

9852~~~
All well and good as an argument, but in Rooney's case it becomes more of a problem for some because he is supposed to be earning X amount per week. If we take that X out of the argument it allows us to be more objective.

It would be foolish for us to think that a player's salary (and any transfer budget) is only reflective of their perceived quality as a football player. If we sign Bale for 80m, for example, on a salary of 300k per week and lets say Abubameyang for 40M on 150K per week, in my opinion our decision-makes are not hinting that he needs to be twice as good (not even sure how you will measure it). When we analyze performance it has to be based on the football, not on some salary numbers that are not even in public domain and even if accurate do not contain the whole story (commercial worth, sponsor's interest etc). Based on the football, we have a lot of average performers in the squad right now and it may also hint that the problem is lies somewhere deeper. Hernandez, who we couldn't even get rid of easily, has been named the player of the month twice in a row in Bundesliga. A player's performance cannot be independent of the rest of the squad, the system, the manager's 'philosophy' etc. etc. and changing players may not bring about the quick change that we all want to see. Right now, based on how average our squad looks and how unsuited our system of play, a player scoring winning goal in game (when wins are almost a rarity) deserves some credit even if temporarily.

I agree we need a better striker than Rooney and whatever he does this season (bar a miracle) is unlikely to change that opinion. But even if its a unanimous given, I hope it doesn't mean that this thread should be closed now.

9853~~~
May be it came across incorrectly, but I didn't mean two strikers but more like two forwards players (covering number 10, 9 and wide players) who will not be in the absolute first-11 of any top 10 club but good squad players for them.
Also I didn't bring in commercial worth to say that his average performance is justified. All I am saying is that a performance should be judged independent of the salary (and other commercial elements). If you do bring salary just keep in mind that there are other commercial factors you may be ignoring which should also be taken into account. I am only going against the arguments similar to-  'Rooney is earning 250k while X player is earning only 100k' so he deserves more stick for the same performance by two players.

9854~~~
It has the perfect effect/combo of niceness whilst having a little dig. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9855~~~
I did mention quite a few players who are currently far, far better than Rooney and maybe on half his salary. So this notion which you put forth that 300k/week only gets you 2 "decent" options up front is not correct.

9856~~~
FWIW: Rooney's agent, when describing the deal Rooney has, implied that a large portion of it was performance based and locked into his image rights which are now owned and handled by United's PR team. 

So it's not like we're paying him £300k cash per week. He gets a base salary and then we pay him performance related bonuses (not going to be paying much there over the last couple of seasons) and we give him a cut of the money we generate through his image rights.

9857~~~
No, Rooney has the same wage than previously but according to the market he could earn up to 300k, one of the problem with Rooney is that he doesn't have a big sponsor portfolio, so the United PR team proposed to help him develop his brand. What Rooney really gained from his extension was the unsual length for a player of his age.

9858~~~
So.... Yes then?

9859~~~
Could well be. I am not too sure what provisions or stipulations are there in his contract. I would assume that many players have similar clauses in their contracts, where they get bonus payouts depending on where the team finishes in the PL and CL. If that is the case, I think we can replace Rooney with two absolutely top drawer players without having to spend significantly higher in wages.

9860~~~
They do but it's not linked to the 300k that every tabloids used, according to forbes it was only a suggestion made to Rooney by Woodward and Arnold, based on the difference between Rooney's marketing earnings and his image in Sport and Football.

Rooney doesn't have big contracts, mainly because he is not glamorous and can't land the fashion contracts.

9861~~~

A bit more information into Rooney's deal and how most contracts are structured.

9862~~~
Thanks for that article.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

9863~~~
Which I am assuming we have tried obviously last summer. We tried absolute top drawer  lewa, muller, bale, ronaldo etc and also players like kane, mane, pogba, benzema etc. At least some of this must have been true, if we go by rumours. LVG plan-A could not have been Rooney as striker with untested Martial/Wilson as back-up, and even if it was the plan it is not Rooney's fault if misplaced confidence was placed in him (specially when we were going to play CL as well). But unfortunately because of various reasons it is not just simply just a matter of putting money on the table. Multiple reasons - we are not the club players aspire to play for over other top clubs, foreign players prefer London, other players are well take care of by their current clubs or not at the end of their contract. PL has lot of money and even clubs like Southampton can easily fend off advances from top clubs, if they are interested (not all the time though). So while I think it's hard to argue against the fact that we should have replaced Rooney (or at least added to the squad) two top players in forwards roles, we couldn't get them. 

If Rooney is costing us 13m per year in salary, I am sure that is puny amount for the club and we didn't back out of any potential deals just because of that 13 million. We in fact paid 35 million (which can go up to 57 million based on bonuses) for a young and untested Martial and we would probably have paid much more to any top-drawer player. The point is that the salary is only one factor. Shweinsteiger is getting 200k per week but no one says that he should be playing better than Shneiderlin because he is earning twice. We all take other things into account other things (his age, his transfer price, wages etc.). And mind Shweinsteiger is on a 3 year deal which is only one year less than what we offer even to young players.

9864~~~
Very informative, thanks.

9865~~~
I wonder what is the impact of his wage on the locker room and on the negotiations with potential targets. Some players will think that they are better than him and therefore deserves bigger contracts.

9866~~~
And who can blame them, but once we give the tea lady or a cone a six figure salary where does it end?

9867~~~
Rooney reminds me of late Heskey without all the ridicule. Except for red cafe which is his unsafe space.

9868~~~
So now we are thinking of imaginary problems created by Rooney's salary to score a point. I have not seen one report suggesting the same and former players, if anything, have only mentioned of his positive influence in the locker-room. It would not be difficult for the press to get a hint if it was an issue.
All the top-drawer players we have targeted would have easily got a great salary package similar to Rooney's if the deals materialized. When we are routinely linked with 60 to 80 million figures for transfer of established players (most of who are not young and will no way fetch us anywhere even close to the transfer amount past the 4 year contract) we are already budgeting for 15 to 20 million of transfer budget amortization per year over an above the salary. I am sure the salary has not been a constraint for the right player. Also any potential transfer, assuming that they are only interested in getting the most money for them, will only be comparing our offer to what they are getting elsewhere (not to a figure that we might be paying to another player who by the way has been with us for 12 years and is near being the all time top scorer for us). So tomorrow if Pogba says I want 300k becasue Shweinsteiger is earning 200k, I am sure the caf will only blame Shweinsteiger for not fking off and giving us the chance to hire Pogba at 200k (also by the way completely ignoring the huge transfer price we will be paying to get a player like Pogba).

9869~~~
Calm down, I'm not trying to score points. I'm not against Rooney and I don't care much about his wage, I don't think that I have ever used it against him. 

In fact I liked your post and think that you are right.

9870~~~
No worries. I easily see the point when someone says Rooney is not playing well its just that I don't see the point of bringing the salary into the mix and then somehow expecting that because of the high salary he should be playing better than others. Also the last two games should have got him some credit but the caf is really stingy and it seems that everyone almost rejoices when Rooney doesn't score because it supports their argument even though we need all the goals we can find. Yes the performances should be much better, but at least scoring goals is better than not scoring (specially the match winning goals) and as a striker you mainly live by the goals you score.

9871~~~
Honestly quite surprising. Could make it 5 if he manages to score in the Europa League.

9874~~~
Was just coming to post that, that 3rd vote is super interesting.

9875~~~
He deserves to be criticised based on his salary as well, considering he held us to ransom to get what he is  earning, twice. He has not deserved his earnings. If the club had paid him £300k voluntarily, its a different matter. He knew what he was getting in to when he forced our  hands, he should deal with it.

Him being a commercial cow for us is not a great argument. Manchester United made him who he is today. It's not because he is the biggest name but because we have the biggest name. We are the ones that took the massive risk and paid crazy amounts for a teenager, helped him to pocket millions through other revenues, gave him a platform to be a big name. It's fair that we get to benefit from this association that we have provided him, don't you think?

If his wages will make it difficult for us to accommodate bigger and better names I want Rooney gone out of the club.

9876~~~
Can you imagine negotiations from now on for every young maverick thinking of joining united? "So that big lump upfront gets £300k a week? talk to me Ed.."

9877~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9878~~~
Didnt his agent come out and say that his contract wasnt actually that high (its still in the 200k range) in terms of wages. But it had the potential to go to 300k depending on Rooney's brand value to United. Basically if Rooney the brand does well, he gets paid more. Which seems fair to me.

Off course you then ask yourself, is he worth 200k a week? 






He isnt.

9879~~~
I fail to understand, how is it ransom. If we didn't want to pay what he wanted we could easily have sold him, Chelsea were willing to pay in the region of 50M. Every player negotiates for the wages and you roughly get what you deserve after taking all the crucial factors into account (quality of player, availability of back-up, ability to play in multiple positions, commercial worth to the club, age profile, positon they play in, do they have other offers etc etc). BFS is getting 200k, surely we just turned up at his door and said 'is 200k enough or you want more?'. Mata is getting in the region of 150k, Young was signed in 2011 for around 110K. Every single player is on the wages they don't deserve.

Just to correct when we signed Rooney, there was hardly any risk and he was already identified as one of the biggest potential in England. We had paid an even bigger amount for a defender two years back, so it wasn't something of a rarity. Also like Rooney we gave a platform to Ronaldo and so many other players, and I am sure they are loyally paying all their commercial revenues to us!! Lets come out of the imaginary world where every player should just consider himself lucky to even get a chance to play for us. The first destination of all the good players is the clubs higher than us in the pecking order (at least 5), and almost all of them can and do pay even higher than us. But yeah we are united, so they should come and accept whatever we offer.

Its just unfortunate to see people creaming over players who don't even want to come here, and even if they do it will be for an even bigger 'ransom' and still this overwhelming hate towards one of our own players. If you even so far as put in a mildly positive line after two match winning goals, you get slated. There was hardly any positive from the match apart from the penalty and the goal. No player stood out. Even De Gea was quiet. Converting a 93rd minute penalty in a pressure situation to win a match is at least something of a positive in my book.

It almost looks like people would have been happier if we had not scored, and the result more easily fit in with the 'doom and gloom' scenario that we are experiencing. Any win at this moment doesn't help anyone in this camp. I also want changes, world class players, hopefully a better suited manager, but I imagine  the people in charge already know about this as it is clearly visible. I am happy to take wins and survive on whatever other positives are there, until the changes do happen.

9880~~~
And people are saying he is having a bad season!

9881~~~
Don't ever do negotiating in real life, if your mind wonders.... Desist

9882~~~
They were not willing to go over £25m. It was wrong decision not to sell him, you can be certain that if Ferguson had stayed, he would have been sold and rightly so. Moyes was too much of a coward to make that decision so instead he gave him an utterly ridiculous 5.5-year contract which is beyond ridiculous.

9883~~~
2 goals in last 2 matches. Playing the captains role perfectly, don't know why people are complaining.
<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

9884~~~
2 in 2 this year is great. I know one was a pen against league 1 opposition, but its still the potential start of the run we so desperately need him to go on.

If he scores tonight he may just be turning a corner. Better late than never...

9885~~~
Even if he scores 3 hat-tricks in the next 3 games, he will still be not good enough to be a regular starter for United. Why? Because his renaissance won't last more than 6-7 weeks and he will be back to shitness very soon. To be past it does not mean to be poor in every game but to be poor in many games. We need a genuine star player in his position, one who can be world class for most of the season and a proper game-changer. If we want to be up there with Bayern and Barcelona, we need several brilliant forwards, not just one in Martial who may become world class in a year or two.

9886~~~
Of course his wage is a valid point. He held out for BPITW wages at a time when we were in transition and had a weak willed prat in charge and not once since signing it have his performances warranted that kind of outlay.

9887~~~
I think my point is pretty simple here. Falcao, despite having a relatively better season than Rooney is having was serially beaten with the wages stick all season but when it comes to Wayne Rooney it doesn't apply? It doesn't make sense. You use Young, Mata et al but what we do know is that Rooney openly forced our hands and that is a fact. Like I said, if the club paid him £300k without  the nonsense he was on, then fine. He brought this one on himself. I do not treat players differently just because they play for Manchester United. 

For every fair criticism that Rooney gets from fans, he gets 10 more crazy support from the media. Only last night another headline read
"<span style="font-family: 'Arial'"><span style="font-size: 15px">In-form Rooney looks to add to tally against Newcastle" </span></span>

9888~~~
He's on a rapid decline although he has still something to offer. Perhaps in different set-up than LVG's he would find himself more useful, but don't take that as a excuse for his poor showings, just think his goal tally would be little higher (4 or 5 goals higher, not much but still). What I don't understand is posters constant complaining about him. When he plays badly and doesn't score he's terrible (that I can understand), but when he playes good and scores then people find excuse to downplay that and still complain about him as if they hate seeing him getting goals which HELP United gaining points or going through to the next round.

9889~~~
Off course his wage and status is the critics points.  Otherwise we'd be slagging andy caroll and not wayne rooney

9890~~~
Exactly. 

You wouldn't see such outrage with regards to Rooney, if had the same importance in the squad <i>on the pitch </i>that Giggs had when he was towards the end of his career. But it's the fact that he's got "privileges", is seemingly now Mr. Manchester United/first name on the team-sheet, and one of football's highest paid, that is the real problem.

9891~~~
How many performances this season has he had where you could say he's been 'good' though, really? Brugge away, Stoke away, Chelsea at home maybe. Perhaps if you were feeling very generous you could throw in Everton, CSKA home and West Brom but that's about it. The rest he's either been below par or just absolutely terrible. I understand your point about people who hate seeing him score goals etc., that is ridiculous. If Rooney was willing to take a rotation role he might have something to offer, but I don't think he'd be happy with that given he's United and England captain and only 30. On that basis he should be sold in the summer (he'll be hard to shift admittedly), but for now van Gaal needs to stop playing others out of position to accommodate him.

9892~~~
I agree that there are too many 'good' matches, United captain should lead by example and so far he's failed to do so (also don't think he can overturn that). What's worse is that everyone around the club keep on praising him for being good captain which means he's trying his best in training and is good with other players, but if he's not contributing in matches then it's all for nothing really. After he was dropped from starting eleven he did show some fight and played better against Swansea than in previous matches, so agree with you that he should be used in rotation role like Giggs or Scholes were in latter parts of their careers, but he's on salary that's way too high for a bench player so not even dropping him is real solution. Also I don't think LVG is trying to accomodate him, he's just being cluesless about players, for example saying he bought Martial for his successor yet uses him on any given chance (after realising how good this kid is), playing Fellaini in midfield when everyone can see he's not CM by nature etc. Still, calling him names and abusing him won't get us anywhere, always though Caf is exception in that regard, but seems it's not anymore.

9893~~~
maybe he will get the Charlton record this season!! 9 off equalling it?

Tends to score the pens that matter, and miss those when we're already winning

9894~~~
3 in 3. Ruthless.

9895~~~
He's penaltied his way to the England record and will do the same for the United record too.

9896~~~
He's very lucky he's back on pens because he'll do feck all without them

9897~~~
The boy is back. 2016 is his year. He'll grab a hatrick in this game. Maybe 5 if he fancies it.

9898~~~
Credit where it's due, it's a fantastic assist that.

9899~~~
Great assist.

9900~~~
Should've scored that chance but othervise he's been very good so far.

9901~~~
That assist was exquisite. Much better tonight.

9902~~~
For me that assist was his best play of the season. Fantastic, I didn't see that coming.

9903~~~
Very nicely executed assist, not been all that good in possession other than that though and missed a sitter.

9904~~~
That pass to Jesse was sublime, fair play

9905~~~
Great assist elevated an ordinary performance, lets hope he keeps this up.

9906~~~
He's on his way back, at least we see a positive step. Good half.

9907~~~
Yep, I thought he'd been okay until then and the goal had arguably flattered him, but the assist was brilliant.

9908~~~
Played well overall, the miss aside. More of that in the second half please.

9909~~~
This.

9910~~~
Wasn't a sitter though.

9911~~~
great instinct and team ply for a beautiful reverse pass assist from Rooney for that Lingard goal.

However what really concerned me was how slow he was when he got the ball and tried to sprint away, he could just not get moving, a younger Rooney would have been through and slotted it into the corner.

He needs to quickly adapt and reinvent his game like Giggs and Ferdinand did so he can remain relevant.

9912~~~
Goal and an assist. Keep going Wazza.

9913~~~
Overly harsh.  If he was in great form you'd be more sympathetic. It was not a sitter by any means and players miss those chances more than score from them.  

I let him off that, just glad he was in position .

9914~~~
For a top striker that is a sitter.

9915~~~
Yep, stuff like the assist is what he needs to be doing on a more regular basis. He's no longer the explosive player he once was, but he could potentially have a role in our side if he can produce intelligent moments like that.

9916~~~
Nah, it's a very good chance but not a sitter. Keeper did very well too.

9917~~~
3 in 3 in 2016. Rooney for Ballon d'Or next year.

9918~~~
Don't think it was bad miss, more of a unlucky one, but it's good to see him getting into dangerous positions, hope he builds on that!

9919~~~
MoM so far from Rooney.  

Let's hope he completes a hat trick of goals or assists in 2nd half.

9920~~~
Actually looked pretty fast at one point. Weird player. Been good today.

9921~~~

9922~~~
One more open play goal....and he'll have the non penalty record for England. Still needs like 4 more pens to take Franks penalty haul.

9923~~~
Looks better when our attacks don't take 5 minutes to build up while they get 11 men behind the ball. What a shocker.

9924~~~
One on one against possibly the slowest defender in the league and he's afraid to take him on.

9925~~~
We know that already.  No need to beat him up about it all the time !

9926~~~
So. fecking. Slow.

9927~~~
Fantastic today, proper captains performance.

9928~~~
That's it!

9929~~~
That's a top finish.

9930~~~
What a goal

9931~~~
Yesss!!

He's been bang on today.

9932~~~
Lovely strike.

9933~~~
Is he back? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9934~~~
Van Gaal seen there dotting the I's and crossing the T's on Rooney's new 6 year play as you get paid deal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9935~~~
Is he wearing a yarmulke? Something odd with his hair tonight.

9936~~~
His best performance since...?

9937~~~
Beautiful finish. 

And scoring from outside the box. What a sight.

9938~~~
That was a great goal.

9939~~~
He scores 3 goals after an absolute eternity, of which 2 have been penalties, against the absolute bottom of the league and suddenly he's back as a Player? I love this place <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

9940~~~
Probably the Basel game, although this game carries a lot more magnitude since that could be the winner. Arguably his best performance of the season, even if that's not exactly a mean feat.

9941~~~
No, but it's certainly some very pleasing signs of a return to form

9942~~~
Yeah, because that's what people are saying.

9943~~~
He just loves playing Newcastle

9944~~~
He's  been excellent tonight.

9945~~~
I don't think anyone's under the illusion that he's truly back to his best, but there's been a definite improvement. He's been heavily involved in all three goals tonight, and his assist for Lingard's goal was lovely. His game still has a number of problems; mainly his lack of pace and inability to take it past a man, but he's shown <i>some </i>signs that he's still got some technical ability kicking about.

9946~~~
That's the Rooney we want to see.

9947~~~
tuned into the game at 2-2, minute later he does something I never expected him to be able to do ever again.

fair play.

9948~~~
You can't expect more than that. Quality goal.

9949~~~
Best performance for us since feck knows when.

9950~~~
Look at the gameday thread...and not only that one.

9951~~~
Happy for him.

9952~~~
How many goals is he away from Sir Bobby Charlton's record now?

9953~~~
You mean the very definition of kneejerk posts?- I'm sure a number of them are tongue in cheek also.

9954~~~
About 7/8 probably now, but if he played Newcastle every week he'd have doubled it by next January.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9955~~~
best display for a long time.

shame we made such a mash up defensively.

9956~~~
Very good performance (by the normal standards), if he maintains this, I can see us doing well this season still.

9957~~~
Our best player tonight, his best performance of the season. Thought he showed more desire and his second goal and assist were fantastic. He did miss a couple of chances but Fellaini and Lingard's should have sealed the three points for us.

9958~~~
Very good performance from him.

9959~~~
finally managed to put in a performance. long ways to go to come back from the slump but it's a start. happy for him.

9960~~~
It's surely no coincidence that when we play a more open style he shines. I have no doubt that our style has made him look many times worse than he actually is. Any striker would struggle to impress when our play style encourages the opposite to gather their entire 11 in the final third.

9961~~~
Best performance of the season from Wayne. Encouraging to see.

9962~~~
I have slagged him off something rotten this season, so after a strong performance I owe it to Rooney to give him some credit. Two goals, an assist and a good first touch. Can't argue with that.

9963~~~
Played a blinder tonight.Credit where credit is due.

9964~~~
His best game of the season. God please let it continue.

9965~~~
This 

Gotta give it to him, a good game. But I'm under no illusion that he is back. Despite the goals there some very poor to average moments from him.

9966~~~
Our best player... With a new No.10 and a right winger he could have better performances. Also, Martial should rotate with him.

9967~~~
Probably the only real positive from tonight. Well played.

9968~~~
So, apparently it's 9. Reckon he'll get it this season.

9969~~~
He was immense tonight. Hopefully he kicks on from here now.

9970~~~
I think tonight's performance in general showed us a lot of the positives he can still offer, while highlighting some weak points.

In a technical sense, he was excellent when it came to his goals. Penalty was fine...well taken enough. The assist was superb though, nice little touch and demonstrated intelligence, with his final strike being s very good one as well.

His inability to take it past Colocinni was worrying, though, and it highlights his lack of pace and inability to deal with one on one situations. Still, it was his best performance for us all season, and he's shown that he seems to have <i>some </i>sort of technical ability remaining, even if he's long past his best. I'd argue that he might benefit from playing in a front two alongside Martial, though, because having him as a lone striker arguably highlights some of his weaknesses. Martial's an incredibly hard worker, and he'd potentially be able to cover for Rooney's physical deficiencies while still allowing him to utilise his more positive aspects that he <i>seems </i>to be rediscovering. He does need to deliver that in a big game now, though.

9971~~~
Oh look he plays well and gets lots of praise and voted MOTM on here. Maybe it's not all agendas and he just needs to do better than the shit he served up in the first half of the season. And maybe our terrible attacking is linked to our main attacker's performances.

9972~~~
Excellent performance, best I've seen him since a few years.

9973~~~
The first proper performance he's put in this season.

9974~~~
Good assist and strike, but for me that doesn't change the sloppiness or the fact he cannot run at all, even one on one with Collicini he just didn't have the legs. At least we know he's not on 300K a week now, not once he's cut cheque's for Robbie Savage and Hoddle for their PR...commentary tonight.

9975~~~
Great to finally not be moaning about him tonight, if he can keep this up then I can be satisfied with him this season. Hope tonight wasn't the high point but he will need to convince me in the next 3-4 games that this is not just a fluke.

9976~~~
Fair is fair, he played well today, I still do not think he is consistent nor fast enough to be our main attacking threat though. I hope he proves me wrong.

9977~~~
Delighted with him. Absolutely zero problems with him if he plays like this on a more regular basis.

9978~~~
Easily his best game for over two years.

9979~~~
Reminds me if the current Totti - lost so much ability, sharpness and pace but, when given space, can still shoot with power and accuracy and pass the ball 50 yards.

Totti is 39 and barely gets in the Roma squad.

9980~~~
Quality. Please carry on playing like you're not a clown brother Wayne

9981~~~
Took the pen well, and a lovely finish from the edge of the box - but apart from doing what's expected of him he had a pretty average game again IMO.

That dribble at coloccini showed what a dinosaur he's become when running with the ball, it's really painful to see. 

On another day he could have had 4 goals really and a couple of assists.

Anyway if he keeps that 7/10 performance going every week we won't have too much to argue about.

9982~~~
He is coming back. But he is alone up there. Need to simply go to 4-4-2. But if we have a midfield like that out there, we are toast.

Where the heck is Carrick.

9983~~~
With Top 4 looking ever more unlikely, all I want from this season now is for Rooney to get the record. 8 more goals <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9984~~~
Well played Wayne.

9985~~~
If Rooney stays next season... Where do you think he should play? <i>striker, No.10 or in a midfield of 3?</i>

9986~~~
Yeah, blame his crap first touch on tactics.

9987~~~
Yeah, I didn't say that.

9988~~~
I'm really happy with him after that performance. Hopefully he'll prove me wrong and make this more like the norm, not the exception.

9989~~~
Credit where it's due, was very good tonight.

9990~~~
I will give him credit today, if he creates for and scores three goals per game, then I have no complaints about him to make the bench or start if he really shines even though he messes up everything else like he did today, could have score four today if he wasn't past it. he's no capt. material though

9991~~~
Should be playing like that nearly every week. MOTM tonight, 4 goals in 3 matches. Hopefully he scores against Liverpool (which he doesnt really do at their ground... )

9992~~~
Very good tonight.

9993~~~
Please let this continue, he was our best player tonight. Watch him disappear vs Liverpool as per usual on Sunday.

9994~~~
Good comparison, performances like tonight are fine if he's a bench luxury that we can use as and when we want, but not as a starting every game player, not if we genuinely want to compete for titles again.

9995~~~
Best player tonight, very happy for him and us.

9996~~~
Great finishing today. Good movement and a very clever assist for Lingard.

His best performance by an absolute country mile this season.

9997~~~
Fair play Rooney. I've talked crap about you for about 2 seasons now but today you actually showed up. Shame you couldn't motivate the rest of the team to show some composure. Motm and the first time you've looked a genuine threat this season. Play like this every week ffs.

9998~~~
You did. You said he cant be expected to perform because of tactics. One of the reasons people think Rooney is shit is because he cant control a ball well anymore.

9999~~~
No complaints tonight. Really was devastated that we didn't win as well.

10000~~~
A few more performances like that and he will do it. 
That was much better tonight, and that assist was lush.

10001~~~
I said I think our play style makes it difficult for him to shine. I think the same about any of our strikers under LVG, whether that be him, RVP, Chicharito, Martial, etc. I didn't say anything about his touch.

10002~~~
Scholes was right.

10003~~~
One positive to come from tonight was how good he was, he's starting to get back to his best. If he carries on playing like this then it gives us a chance.

10004~~~
You insinuate that if we played like today every week Rooney would shine. And I don't believe its as simple as that. Martial has been having a much better season than him, and he is getting played here, there and everywhere.

10005~~~
So wouldn't you agree Martial has performed better out wide than as a striker?

10006~~~
He has played more games as a wide player. I doubt he has played 5 straight games in the middle.

Anyhow lets end this, we agree to disagree.

10007~~~
Really going for next years Ballon D'or isn't he.

10008~~~
Would be brilliant to see him go on one of his runs now. 10 goals in 10 games or something like that from the old days would make a massive difference for us. 

I loved the way we were set up in that first half where Herrera was all over the place between our midfield and attack - it pretty much forced Wayne to stay forward and our shape was much improved. Not sure what happened in the second half? Did Herrera run out of legs, did our defence and midfield drop too deep leaving too big a gap between them and Herrera or did Newcastle just change something effectively?

Either way, we should be looking at that spell in the first 45 minutes where Ander was running the show, Lingard and Martial were maintaining width and where Rooney looked like a proper forward, effectively leading the line. That shape has to be the blueprint for this side.

10009~~~
Very good performance. Great assist and his second goal was superb.

10010~~~
He'd still be seen as a good player if he played for a team who attacked with pace every game. Today we did and he played really well. There's no doubting that for the first few months of the season he was woefully out of form, but individually, his touch and all that seemed ok the last 2 months for the most part. It's just we played so slowly so he and everyone else gets stifled. Every single one of our attacking players would look better if we attacked with pace consistently, so I think it was a bit harsh for Rooney to get as much blame as he did. Everyone just looks trash on the pitch when we play like we do most of the time, Rooney more so then the others because he has more of a loose touch and needs more space to do his thing.

10011~~~
How is he back on pens? He gets to skip Herrera because he was subbed at the weekend?
I don't think this has been discussed quite enough. What in the blue hell was going on there? It looked like he was wearing someone else's wig.

10012~~~
It's quite odd. Concurrently off-putting and captivating. He has his natural hair around the sides and back and the artificial puff up front. On the  crown of his head, though, he has hair like a coconut. 

Strange lid aside, he was much better tonight. Despite the bad miss and the sad lack of pace / confidence to go to his left, he should have been the match winner for us tonight. I hope he can wind back the clock and keep it up. He can't play as a 9, though, or he's got no chance.

10013~~~
Only got the highlights of the game. 

Looked a totally different player. Here's hoping he can keep this up. Van Gaal's job probably depends on it.

10014~~~
And you need to go and learn the meaning of ransom. May be we still have the cctv footage from the time when he put a gun on  Moyes and woody, and we can use the footage to claim the money back.

10015~~~
First off, if we had sold him in the summer of 2013, we would easily have got close to 50M (or very close to that). He had two years still left on his contract and Chelsea, Arsenal and PSG were all looking for a forward. After that it would always have been much less, as we would be seen to be a more desperate party. If he was not sold, it is not Rooney's fault. Its not like he wouldn't have moved out if we wanted to sell him. He couldn't afford to not play with world cup around the corner. We could pocket what we got and gotten rid of the excessive salary. It was clear that Chelsea and PSG would more than match his salary so he would obviously insist on that if he stayed. It was totally in our hands if we didn't want to give him a new contract, or only give him a new contract at a lower salary.

However some people here think that as soon as he turned rubbish he should somehow voluntarily agree to get his salary reduced, even when his contract is until 2019. No player in their right mind will do that. We were foolish to sign the contract, or at least such a long contract, not he.

10016~~~
None of them would have given him a 6-year old contract to boot. And I very much doubt anyone would pay him that much or give United the fee you're talking about. PSG had Zlatan at the time already and were signing Cavani (or didn't they sign him a year before?). You're having a laugh if you think Arsenal would offer him such wages.

No one has suggested that he should take a pay cut, just that he's not been performing as he should be given his status within the club and enormous wage he's on.

10017~~~
LvG always the job to whoever scores a penalty. Herrera and Mata were off the pitch on Saturday, so he got the job and scored. Now it is his job again until he misses.

10018~~~
Its really lazy to claim that Falcao was having a relatively better season than Rooney is having now. Even if you take out the last 4 goals that Rooney has scored, he is still on 7 goals for the half season compared to 4 for Falcao for the whole of last season. Never mind the fact that Falcao looked totally out of place in our side when he was not injured. Yes Rooney has been bad this season (and apart from De Gea and Martial, hardly anyone has been much good) but Falcao last season was another level. He was also a player who came to us on loan because Monaco didn't want to pay his wages  so he would obviously be beaten with the wage stick more. If he had already stayed 10 years and gave us his best, I am sure people would have been more patient. While we are on Falcao, its worth remembering that he was being paid 265K a week (from wiki) and we also paid a 6 million fee so in total he cost around 380K a week. We all know the return we got for that 380K a week.

How did Rooney force our hands? We had the chance to get a very decent sum on his transfer in 2013 which we didn't take. He was easily getting a better (or at least a similar offer) outside so he would insist on that. It was clearly up to us to not give him a new contract on his terms. We only gave him a new contract because Moyes and Woody thought it made sense (or at least I hope so). In hindsight may be it didn't. Whether we decided to give him 250k, or 300k or 200k or 150k, it would be the same Rooney. The money only shows our perception of what we thought we could give him. It wouldn't turn him into a different player. And yes as a fan you might have felt slightly better that a gash player is only getting 150K (instead of 250K) but nothing else would be different.

10019~~~
That's a fair point but status is only really based on past performances and the years he has spent with us and being involved in winning trophies. No one in their right mind should have expected a 30 year Rooney to match the past performances. Also if wage is a yardstick, hardly anyone is justifying their wages. For me earning 'only 150k' is not an excuse to play badly compared to someone who is earning '250k'. As I said earlier wages take into account a lot more than just the quality of the player. By all means criticize the performances but if we use wage as a stick then to me it somehow sounds like we are saying that as a player you will get less blame if someone earning more is playing gash.

10020~~~
Hope he keeps scoring.

10021~~~
So we can just agree that he's not been meeting expectations and leave wages aside.

Getting better though. I wouldn't get overly excited.

10022~~~
Maybe if you could consider the goal per minute ratio of both players. 

I strongly believe his tantrums were just tactics to force our hands to pay him more.

If he avoids injury and being dropped, he's got at least 20 games to score the 9 goals he needs to break Charlton's record.

The Wayne Rooney of 4 or 5 years could probably do it comfortably, but i'm not sure this version, in this set-up, will. Be nice if he does though.

Hopefully he has a season like 2010/11, where he was poor in the first half, and excellent from New Years day onwards (when he got that stooping, headed goal against West Brom).

10024~~~
That's the problem, if you just watch highlights it looks a great performance, but I can't help feel if we had an aguero/Suarez/Kane he would have scored 4 yesterday. He was 1v1 against coloccini of all people and failed to get passed him! Unless Wayne has runners around him he's unfortunately toothless these days, which suggests we definitely need pace in the team to make him "effective"

10025~~~
He is back lads <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
Put him upfront Woy!!!

10026~~~
I think the last handful of games maybe, he's been better. With Wayne, you have to cross your fingers but isn't it funny? How when we start attacking more we score goals. Maybe a coincidence? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Either way, we need to win against Liverpool so Wayne is going to have to keep this form up.

10027~~~
Better, but still a long way to go. There was one moment last night where he was 1 on 1 with the defender (think it was Coloccini, who they'd highlighted before the game as being dreadful at 1 on 1 situations) and he just ran straight into him. He still does that far too often and his touch is still shite. Cracking goal though and looked a lot better than he has done for a while so hopefully this is a turning point.

10028~~~
Haven't watched the entire game, but from what I have seen, good stuff from him. Probably MOTM and easily his best game of the season, probably of last two seasons too. I don't think his all around game was on that great level, but can't argue with two goals and an assist, plus couple of very bright moments. Even after last nights game I think it's quite clear that he is nowhere near great player, but if he can keep scoring goals and winning us games until end of season I don't mind seeing him playing even with poor all around play(not referring to last night).

10029~~~
We really want him to succeed so badly. Yesterday was much better. Rooney needs to understand that fans expect that performance EVERY game. Not just 1 in 20 as it is these days

10030~~~
I think that highlighted that while he seems to be finding his touch again, and is beginning to improve finishing wise, he's done as a player who can take it past people and as someone with plenty of pace. He's still got a lot to offer, but he will need to reinvent his game to thrive for us long-term.

10031~~~
Fair play to him. Finally, a genuinely good performance from him. Hope he keeps it up.

10032~~~
No, status has to be based on current performances. Respect can be based on past performances. Giggs was in and out of the team, in his last few years, as was proportionate to his performance levels. He was not this guaranteed-to-start Mr. Manchester United "privelidges" man, and was used in line with his footballing level (which had naturally dropped). What he did have, based on past performances, was respect from fans, team-mates, the staff and his manager.

10033~~~
The sooner he gets it the more chance we have of shifting him. I don't think he will be open to a move while he has a handful of goals to take a record like that at a club like this.

10034~~~
I didn't see the game, only saw the goals. His second was sublime.

Is there an individual highlights on Youtube yet? Can't seem to find one.

10035~~~
His best performance of the season by miles.

Hopefully he can kick on and build from this. Against Liverpools shite defence I hope we have him and Martial high up the pitch attacking them

10036~~~
Best performance from him in a long time. We can only hope his form continues for his sake and ours!
However seeing him just turn it on like that does piss me off as where the feck has he been for so long?!

10037~~~

Ace. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10045~~~
Has he ever had a good game in merseyside? He was half decent against Everton in arguably our best performance this season but other than that I can't remember him doing anything in that side of the country.

10046~~~
he scored a winner at anfield in a 1-0 win... like 10 years ago. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10047~~~
Fair point, but if managers are not using Rooney correctly (not starting him automatically, using as a sub more, making him earn his place etc.) then the blame can not be put to Rooney. Its Moyes and LVG's fault (if it is). No one blamed Nick Powel when he was selected recently for important games (and did nothing but sleep walk). Rooney is not going to say no if the manager wants him to play (almost) every game.

10048~~~
I tried a few websites but couldn't easily find anything that will help calculate goals per minute. So may be someone else can help there. I doubt there will be anything different there. Surely Falcao played more minutes in last full season than Rooney played in half of current season.

10049~~~
He has not been meeting expectations for quite some time. I think its hard to argue against that.

10050~~~
You can not be serious! Its the managers fault if he decides to make Rooney actually earn his place in the team? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Been crap

10053~~~
This is prior to the Swansea game. Call it lazy if you want but these are the statistics

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/0cysLiM.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/0cysLiM.png"/>

10054~~~
(<i>Guardian</i>)

10055~~~
An absolutely woeful opening 45 away to Liverpool and the standout worst performer of a bad bunch so far.

10056~~~
Back to his usual self unfortunately. It's very worrying when a player can't even outrun Kolo Toure.

10057~~~
Not too sure what else he could have done

Absolutely no service at all

10058~~~
This. He's all alone up there, longs balls really isn't his main strength either.

10059~~~
He does nothing.  And he may not be getting service but the times he has gained possession he just gives it back.

But he'll play every game and be with us for much longer, we've just got to suck it up unfortunately.

10060~~~
And when he eventually got the ball? He's been as awful as others, no excuse!

10061~~~
He's had the occasional glimpse and looks okay but he's not offered much. Certainly had worse games though.

10062~~~
6 passes. 4 successful. 2 failed.

If RVP or Falcao put that half in, they'd have been abused on here for it.

Wake up a bit lads. He's getting no service because he's offering none. He's 40 yards from any of his nearest team mates. He hasn't defended, he hasn't passed, he hasn't run, he hasn't shot. He has pointed a lot and shoved Kolo Toure when he over hit a knock on to win a corner.

10063~~~
Absurd. He's done his job reasonably well. He just hasn't been given the ball much. Defensively he does far more than you seem to realise, IMO, and he's been much more energetic recently. It's nothing like his early season lethargic performances.

10064~~~
Martial makes things happen even with no service.

10065~~~
In fairness to Rooney, he's been as shite as any other player today.

10066~~~
Dont agree. He made good movements and runs to get himself in scoring position but Martial twice didnt see him. He hasnt been getting any service.

10067~~~
Because he is playing as a winger. He should try and find Rooney to pass to him now and then instead trying to do everything by himself

10068~~~
In fairness, he has been better so far in the second half.

10069~~~
All is forgiven.

10070~~~
Rooney deserves every penny of that 300k!

10071~~~
Very happy for him and us. Let him score in every match

10072~~~
He's been looking better and better the past 4-5 games. If he's able to shift in another gear we're in a really nice position for the run in.

10073~~~
He's been quite poor today but his job is to score goals and he's done that.

10074~~~
Fair play to him, that and the Newcastle goal were very nicely taken.

10075~~~
Twatted that in. No way any keeper was keeping that out

10076~~~
Scored at anfield at last <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

10077~~~
Criticizing him for his performance today is ridiculous. It's not his fault that all we tried to do was find him with long balls.

I thought he's done his job well today, even before the goal.

10078~~~
7 more goals, thats all he needs. Hope he does, he deserves it. He also broke Henry's record today as the greatest goalscorer with a single Premier League club. 176 goals.

10079~~~
The roonaissance continues. Sorta.

10080~~~
Poor today I thought. Good finish but other than that kept loosing possession a lot and his first touch was awful again.

10081~~~
5 goals in the last 4 matches. Can't really complain at that.

10082~~~
Roo you sexy bitch!
apart from the goal, he did alright I thought.

10083~~~
Even i've been doubting him this season, but he's definitely stepped it up over the last few games.

And he's shown he's still capable of scoring top class goals.

10084~~~
There's definitely been an improvement in general, and it was good for him to get another goal. There are still plenty of problems there: he's still slow, struggles to take it past players and looks isolated as the main man up front, but he does actually resemble a footballer again, which is handy.

10085~~~
Suddenly scores goals that get us points, which is great news!

10086~~~
The service was absolutely shambolic beyond belief today. Yes Martial can do things on his own but Rooney isn't that sort of players and he'll do well if there are half chances/attacking football and he showed again how good a finisher he is. Just 7 goals to go <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

10087~~~
Our captain has delivered today again. Keep them coming Wayne.

10088~~~
Geoff asked him twice about that record and it was obvious he knew nothing about it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10089~~~
Still can't control a football but as long as he keeps scoring, I couldn't care much

10090~~~
7 out 10 performance at best but he took the goal well, composed finish and where he needed to be.

10091~~~
He was shit but scored a vital goal, if only he was an impact sub as opposed to a starter that can't control a football and can't run.

10092~~~
Hope it will give him some confidence and start getting us some well needed goals.

10093~~~
Excellent. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

10094~~~
Right place right time. Other than that, a game to forget.

10095~~~
My issue with him earlier in the season wasn't his general performance, it was goals. He hasn't put in brilliant performances in years, but he was always meant to be a natural goalscorer.

He wasn't even popping up in goalscoring positions for a lot of games. Recently, he has and I like that.

10096~~~

10097~~~
Please let this run continue!

10098~~~
Still pretty invisible most of the game but worked hard chasing lost balls and got worked back well in the 2nd half. 

His luck definitely seems to have changed with the ball falling to him like that, but he confidently took it which was nice to see.

Glad to see he's scored a few in a row
Now, let's hope it keeps going.

10099~~~
Tbf, he had long balls fired in his general direction while up against two big CBs for 99% of the game. Took his chance well thankfully. Am sure some would've spannered that over the bar.

10100~~~
His all round game is still a concern.

10101~~~

10102~~~

10103~~~
Yep frustrated me today with some of his decision making. In such a tight game like today he needs to use his team mates better.

10104~~~
This is what we need from Rooney, goals when it matters. Thats 3 winners in 4 games (should be 4 if we didnt defend like idiots against Newcastle).
Took the chance like a confident striker should.

10105~~~
Good to see him bouncing back and winning us points once more.

10106~~~
I have been critical of him in the past but fair play to him for stepping up. Not sure where he features in the team in the coming seasons but he putting his stamp down anyway.

10107~~~
12 goals and 3 assists in 27 performances is actually quite decent for a guy who's been woeful all season.

10108~~~
With better quality around him, I don't think he'll be going to China just yet. Hopefully he can keep this run of goals going.

10109~~~
People actually criticing his "overall play"? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He was feeding off scraps (i.e. F all). Gobbled up his one proper chance. This place has become so miserable.

10110~~~
Undoubtedly an improvement this year but this is not saying much. I still think we should offload him in the summer. Bar the goal, he was as bad as the others. The goal came from the sheer persistence of the team rather than the brilliance of Wayne Rooney. I'm of the opinion that Rooney is a big problem for United moving forward, especially if LvG remains beyond this season. He's had a few ok games but that will not deter from the fact that he is on a massive decline and he will not get any better to be considered a very good player let alone a top player. My main problem is that as long as LvG is in charge, his captain shall always be core to his plans and this will only be to the detriment of young players behind him (they will not get a chance as long as he remains or they will be shifted about to accommodate Rooney) and the acquisition of a WC striker. I just struggle to see how LvG would bring in a Lewandowski to be in direct competition, as the best player and main attack head with Rooney in the starting XI. I really hope I am wrong here.

Unfortunately, Rooney is here for the long haul and we are stuck with him it seems. But for the sake of United, I hope that this purple patch of his continues.

10111~~~
Happy with him since Stoke at HT. He has that 'eye of the tiger' back.

10112~~~
Record is there for the taking this season now, when it looked impossible not long ago on his form.

Need to put Southampton and Stoke away in the next 2 league games at home now.

10113~~~
If we start stringing some real attacking football together in the final third (not holding my breath) he could seriously improve his numbers. I mean how many shots did he have today? Was the goal actually his only attempt?

10114~~~
Think he had a long shot that went miles over. But your general point is correct. He's fed off scraps all season, tbh.

10115~~~
How many more does he need for charltons record?

10116~~~
He'll probably now score 20-25 goals (all comps, Europa League to come as well!) and make it one of his best scoring seasons of his career, while being awful for a good part of the campaign <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10117~~~
7 iirc

10118~~~
Can't really blame him much for today's game in terms of overall play, he couldn't have done much more with everyone playing terrible game. He's scored, and that's the most important thing today.

10119~~~
Well done. I see the run continuing. Has that confidence that saw him even take that needless 40 yard attempt after the goal.

10120~~~
Was a great finish.

10121~~~
Fair fecks to him. Had bugger all to feed off all day, but never stopped working hard... and got his rewards with the goal. Not great the few times he had the ball, but nobody was.

10122~~~
Ever since coming on against Stoke he seems to have got that hunger back into his game. I really hope he carries on this good form in front of goal and I'm sure we'll see his caf average rating move up with it.

10123~~~
Got in a lot of important headers and clearances in our box as well after our goal. You can't fault the effort.

10124~~~
His touch is still atrocious, he's physical gifts a thing of the past but he's shown he at least still has a wonderful technique in certain circumstances.

10125~~~
Decent finish, given the height of the ball and the way he had to twist to connect with it. He had a similar one against Chelsea which he skied. I expected the same to happen again. Good goal.

10126~~~
A winner against Liverpool is always a great thing. He's finished though. Watch his touches today. A good number of them were atrocious. He can't beat a man. His renaissance won't last longer than 7-8 weeks. United won't win anything of notice with him in the starting 11.

10127~~~
Had one chance and scored, can't ask for much more than that

10128~~~
looking at the first responses to his performances i must really say i disagree. he had some aweful service today. hes not benteke, punting a hopeful ball up to him is not his game. he was alone up there and did the best he could. definitely wasnt the worst player on the pitch. Took his goal well fair play to him. Has looked much better in 2016 so far, long may it continue

10129~~~
I didn't think he was great, but the service to him was awful.

Great goal. Hopefully keeps on scoring.

10130~~~
Was pleased for him today. Hopefully he keeps going. Surely got to have that extra bit of confidence now..

10131~~~
Didn't understand the criticism in the first half. We were in capable of passing to him even when he was unmarked. All our 'passes' were clearances. Great goal and happy for him that he's finally managed to score away at Liverpool and Everton again.

10132~~~
Credit where credit is due.

Thank you Rooney for that one. 11 years in the making , and it was the wait.

10133~~~
Well bloody done, Wayne. I think he's wank most of the time in most games, but if he keeps popping up with important goals from now till the end of the season and actually justifies being started up front then it's all fine by me.

10134~~~
Wayne-field?

10135~~~
You could say that last sentence about just about all of the team. We only have 4 or 5 players good enough to be in a title winning team. DDG, Shaw (from what we saw). Martial could be if he continues to play well and possibly Smalling. Thats it really.

Has he ever really been able to "beat a man"? No, not really. Hes definitely improved and is currently one of our better performers.

10136~~~
This reads like you are hoping this will happen?

10137~~~
Probably expecting.

10138~~~
This reads like a prediction about what is going to happen on the basis of what has happened over the last 3 years. Do you think that he is is going to be productive till the end of the season?

10139~~~
Very strange....I'm enjoying the fact that we are back to winning games and our captain is scoring again..match winning goals btw...why is this thread so negative!  If someones shit  then say they are shit no problem, if someones playing good yet this guy's like, but i'm expecting him to be shit or he's shit anyway....I read the last 10 pages of this thread and it is quite easily the most horrible thread on this forum.

10140~~~
I'm hoping he will be and that's enough that needs to be said.

10141~~~
I'm hoping that he will score enough goals and we will finish in top 4 this season but I'm hoping also that we are going to buy a far better forward than him and compete for the title and the CL next season. However, I still doubt that we'll make top 4 this season with Rooney as our main man in attack. Maybe I'm in for a big nice surprise though and we are going to compete even for the title. It's impossible for me but maybe I know feck all after all <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

10142~~~
Fair do's man!!  But lets all celebrate beating the scum it always rounds the week off nicely!

10143~~~
Glad to see him scoring again, but did not exactly cause Liverpool a lot of problems today. I know Van Gaal sees two strikers as heresy, but i would like to see Rooney behind Martial (no, not as a no 10, but as a supporting striker) since he obviously isn't going to be dropped any time soon

10144~~~
I think he's finished as a dynamic player; he's no longer got the ability to take it past players, and I'm not sure he's someone you want leading the line on his own. His technique is still there though, or at least it's partly still there, and has improved massively to where it was. I do think that we need to upgrade long-term though, or at least play Martial beside/behind him.

10145~~~
Are people still hating on him?

So glad he's finally finding form, never believed he was finished myself.

10146~~~
What are you on about? From what I can see pretty much everyone is praising him for today and saying he's done well in last few games. There are people who criticise his general play, but they are not wrong since it's far from great, but no one is really criticiseing him that much, majority of the posts are positive.

10147~~~
Thankfully he's risen his level to a decent premier league striker for now, rather than league 2 plodder.

10148~~~
What are you on about?  Read above

10149~~~
Cometh the moment, cometh the man <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10150~~~
Honestly I thought Rooney will send that over when he went fort he shot <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

10151~~~
Good to see him perform at a decent level again.
My worry is this though: throughout his career Rooney has been prone to up and down patches of form, getting the vast majority of his goals in spurts. If he is currently experiencing one of these purple patches, how long will it last before he reverts to the norm?

Not saying he is anywhere near his peak levels at the moment, just saying that for this over the hill version of Rooney, this is as good as its likely to get for him

10152~~~
Really enjoyed his last few goals, the Madjer against Swansea, the smash against Newcastle, the half volley against Liverpool... All difficult goals that required good technique to be scored. Hope there are more to come! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

10153~~~
He got very little service so I can excuse his performance to a degree. However when he did get the ball his touch and passing often still failed him. He's scoring though and that is the main thing.

10154~~~
Not really related to current form but just watched a compilation of all his utd goals and from 2005 to about 2011 he was utterly world class what a player.

Glad to see him doing well again, he thrives on loose balls in the box and low crosses, the more we tear forward and get the ball pinging about in the box he will get goals as he has the anticipation and striking ability to bag goals still.

10155~~~
And the award for most inconsistent performances this season goes to... Looks completely switched off today

10156~~~
Bubble seems to have burst

10157~~~
He has been poor but then so has everyone so far

10158~~~
It's no different than the past games. He might still tap in a goal 30-40 minutes into the 2nd half.

10159~~~
another disgraceful performance, how this piece of shit is still in the club is beyond me and the twat doesn't give a fcuk like if he was out last night, absolute shambles of a captain and footballer

10160~~~
Came in here and knew there would be OTT criticism again but he's been no worse than anyone else on the pitch.

10161~~~
Rooney's been a winger today, and more often than not, he's snuffed out by two/three So'ton players when he's got the ball like Martial. Don't know why Van Gaal has decided to go to a 352.

10162~~~
He's shite.

He was out partying last night??

10163~~~
Typical really. He's actually linked up well in the middle with Herrera, at times. That's where he needs to be, not out wide running at players. That's not his game.

10164~~~
This 'piece of shit' deserves a lot more credit for what he has done on the pitch for the club. The criticism is just above beyond with that one and he definitely deserves more respect.

10165~~~
Someone who's playing poorly shouldn't be exempt from criticism because others are too. Unless there's a certain point at which if enough players are playing poorly they all get a free pass.

10166~~~
Exactly. It's like a lot of people just wait for him not to score so the have something to criticize him over.

10167~~~
Everyone agrees that he has been a great player, but not sure that he deserves much respect. He has wrecked that legacy all by his own.

10168~~~
It's OTT and disrespectful criticism. He's hardly been the worst out there but yet because he earns 300k he's the one gets a lot of shit on here. What exactly do people expect Rooney to do when our team is lumping balls up to their keeper?

10169~~~
No, I wait for him to be able to control a ball with a defender at his back. He is so, so poor at receiving the ball these days. He does combine fairly well at times, but he is too sloppy overall. Looked sprightly for a couple of matches, but today he looks sluggish again. Weird player.

10170~~~
He needs to get in the box, still a very good finisher. But we don't like getting in the box do we.

10171~~~
Not in my eyes. I don't think there's a player currently at the club that has done more for United than him. And no one has deserved more respect than him. I'm not interested in an argument here, just wanted to let you know that at least one person disagrees with you.

10172~~~
What would Rooney even get in the box for? The box goes there directly from the back.

10173~~~
Disagree that he has been a great player? Because he has. Disagree that he has wrecked his legacy? Personal opinion, and I think fans are divided on that one.

10174~~~
He's wrecked it by being shit ( i agree) but yet our top scorer this season. Or is it because he asked for 300k and still plays for this club unlike some other "legend" this club has had?

10175~~~
The latter. I edited it a bit to make it clear.

10176~~~
Many ways to leave a club. I don't think there's anything wrong seeking new hunting grounds, but the way he conducted himself was disgraceful. Also, he's been crap lately, but he will be remembered as a great player - Gerrard is.

10177~~~
Looks a lot better when Van Gaal actually decides to play the best team. Who would have thought... The "fans" posting in this thread are probably the biggest retards I have ever encountered on the caf.

10178~~~
Lol good joke.

10179~~~
That pass was something else.

10180~~~
I also agree with you.

10181~~~
no player deserves respect when put in 50% thats what Ive seen today and many times before this season, his absolute lack of any sort of skill skill and actual basic ability is another matter. What he's done for the club is one thing and playing every week for the biggest club in the world and dont give a feck is another, pretty sure he would have been stabbed for a display like this somewhere in Turkey. He's absolute joke of a captain, he's complete opposite what it should be. Shambles to the club and right now the biggest reason we are in this shit also with Van Gaal of course who should be long gone..

10182~~~
I'm one of his biggest critics, but you really can't look good under van Gaal, so I'll lay off him until we have some plan of attack.

10183~~~
defo, and if not he's in totally terrible state and should quit his professional career tomorrow

10184~~~
Back to being useless. Complete shit from him. Disgraceful performance

10185~~~
how can you defend that a player cant make 5 yard pass and control football.. how could he finish another game is beyond me, he must really cocksuck Vangaal or I am not sure how he deserves to start games.. Van Gaaldidnt make him favour with the system today, everyone who is sane wouldnt play him like this if he had to start whatsoever..

10186~~~
Typical United. Always sipping the wine of past glory while basking in the sunlight of history. Yes, he has done well in the past but we have also paid a ton of money for the services. People on here are talking like Rooney did all of this for free. Past is past, now he is an embarrassing shambles of a Captain. His record did not get us over the line today, did it?

10187~~~
Im proud to support Manchester United, they took care of the elderly.  They pay him 300k per week

With demands comes expectations, we paid our due,  rooney gets his due

10188~~~
Have you ever heard of Ryan Giggs?

10189~~~
No goals to cover up his awful touch, passing and lack of drive today.

He shat himself anytime Virgil Van Dijk came near him...

No one should shit themselves over anyone named Virgil

10192~~~
Finished and should be benched or sold. Scored a couple of goals but the performance was average. And that's what he is today, average. ...
Get a real striker in.

10193~~~
He's awfully slow. Like watching the charity games with 50 year old players making an appearance. 

That's all I have to offer. I know it's not acceptable to criticise anything else.

10194~~~
I watched Bayern's match last night and they played a similar style to us in truth, it was pretty pedestrian for long spells, the big difference was their pace on the flanks and a proper #9 that can hold the ball up, something which requires a good first touch and body strength, Rooney has neither of these attributes and it's exposed in games like this where teams set up defensively against us.

10195~~~
Tell that to Ted DiBiase.

10196~~~
I've said it before but our best attacking performances are when he has played well. Those who defend him insist his poor performances are down to how to the team plays but it goes both ways, a good performance from Rooney and our attacking game flows much better. Problem is you can count on one hand the number of actual good performances he's put in this season and have fingers to spare.

10197~~~
Any striker would have to be a magician to do anything remotely like scoring a goal playing with that load of rubbish behind them.

10198~~~
He was the worst player on the pitch today after Blind. He's probably good enough for what we are though, an average shit stain of a team.

10199~~~
Poor performance but shouldn't have been shunted on the wing, the guys scored 5 in his last 4 games so what was the motivation to move him outwide? Was it the fact that he's scoring?

10200~~~
And any magician who didn't show even the tiniest spell of magic, in any situation, needs to do a vanishing act.

10201~~~
Yes. He's not a player now though, is he?

10202~~~
I don't think he was awful mainly the ball did not get played into the right places for the forwards to make things happen...but you sure about the winger thing? Was it not his responsibility in a front 2 to stretch the back 3?

10203~~~
The set up might be the root cause but the better performances have all come with him having a good game. So, I'd choose to blame the responsibility of being tasked with leading the team. 
Don't think he had an awful game, just think he didn't lead in the way he should have.

10204~~~
Frankly I'm tired of hearing excuses being made for Rooney that any striker would suffer because of tactics. His general abilities have nothing to do with tactics. It's high time we realised that is not Rooney of 04-08. He is done and finished as a top striker. It's not just goals but overall game play. Granted that Henrik Larsson played in a better team, he was 34 at the time he joined and he put in some quality performances that Rooney would dream of right now! As much as many want LvG gone, Rooney should follow him out too!

10205~~~
Did people expect some sort of renaissance? He's finished. And that isn't knee jerk. If you give him a clear chance he might well score it. However, he can't create anything for himself. He's got no pace. He can't beat a man. He won't run in behind. He couldn't even take on Kolo Toure last weekend, ffs. He's past it at the top level.

That said, he's at a shit team so he fits right in currently. However, if we ever get any sort of ambition back, we'll never win anything with him in the starting XI.

10206~~~
It was, you're right, but this isn't really Rooney's game. Rooney thrives from pace and width around him. Playing a 352, with Borthwick-Jackson and Lingard, especially as they didn't really get forward that much, meant that Rooney and Martial, when they got the ball in wide areas, were crowded out. For example, Martial's run when he had three So'ton players around him. It was literally just him. 

I think it was no surprise that we saw a bit of form from Rooney with Lingard and Martial on the wings. Neither have been pulling up any trees of late, but the pace and running behind allowed Rooney to play his natural game. Again, Lingard's goal vs Newcastle is an example of that. 

Think Van Gaal needs to go back to a 4231, with Martial/Depay on the left and Januzaj/Lingard on the right for the next game.

10207~~~
Seemed to regress. Gave the ball away with some sloppy touches and passes. Just pointless really.

10208~~~
Remember that thread about him being an impact player. Thats really what he should be.

For some reason, were treating him like hes a Ronaldo or Messi when he wasnt even that in his prime. For all the people saying "yeah well others werent great either" or similar, remember, the reason hes captain and on this high wages is because hes meant to be the leader and is meant to carry us in games like today. If he only has good games when others do, then whats the point?

Its so frustrating, but were in a position where he to play every game because of stubbornness and foolishness.

10209~~~
horrid

10210~~~
Id expect the lads to be tactically adaptable after year and half of doing the same thing.. Either way he should have stuck with the formation that works and let the opposition counter it, not the other way round.

10211~~~
Exactly. Rooney's supposed to be our star player. At his best, he was someone whose combination of effort and ability could often bring a bit of spark to the team. Even when he didn't have a brilliant game, there was usually still a lot of positives about his performance because he was always trying to bring us to a higher level. A bit like Martial sometimes now, actually.

10212~~~
Still at the club & you'd hope the assistant manager has as much, preferably more when its Giggs, influence as the current captain.

10213~~~
I said player. Why do you insist on getting in an argument that doesn't exist?

10214~~~
Pretty much the same from him today as we saw before his little good patch of form, such a shame.

10215~~~
He conned people into thinking he had a renaissance in 2016.

10216~~~
Did he? Anyone with any sort of knowledge about Rooney or who had watched him a lot this season would not have been sucked in by a few 'decent' performances.

10217~~~
He did, there were some posts of people who actually thought he was going to play well again for the remainder of the season. He still might actually, not saying he won't, but chances are slim...

10218~~~
The issue is that he simply isn't good enough to be our main man. No matter what his commercial value and how much the club wants to put his face everywhere, he's not got it anymore. At best, he could be a squad player, but I don't see it happening. So we've got a very important decision this summer that we can either take, or hide from. I fail to see how, if we pick the latter, a team with him as the main man upfront, can ever hope to win the league.

10219~~~
Wasn't their best performance either, but the difference is they work their way up the pitch and then give it to people like Muller, Lewandowski, Coman and Costa. We give it to people like Lingard, Fellaini, Rooney <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Did you see how quick Coman was? he's absolutely lightning and scares defenders to death. We've got nobody apart from Martial to do that, and even he is suffering recently.

10220~~~
Yeah, Coman is rapid and was their best outlet, constantly forcing the Hamburg defense to turn back toward their goal, you need that in a team that plays possession football, wide players that have lightning acceleration and can pull a team apart to make space for your strikers.

10221~~~
Is Rooney even worth discussing anymore? I assume that its been established among our supporters that he's overpaid and well over the hill that the distance between the peak and his current location could give Everest a serious challenge.

He only going to get worse and the occasional good bits shouldn't be perceived as a revival. The pace is gone, touch is poor, isn't creative enough, can't hold up play. His good passes are mostly diagonal passes and until recently he was messing up easier chances to score.

10222~~~
But it's the system/his team mates/the weather/ley lines/his time of the month/or whatever this months excuse is.

10223~~~

10224~~~
Can we stick him on paternity leave for a couple of years.

10225~~~
Kai Klay and Kit - KKK?

10226~~~
The name Kai has grown on me. Klay and Kit however are just hilariously stupid.

10227~~~
Would've been great if they had twins. Kit-Kat

10228~~~
The Rooney clan

10229~~~
What kind of name is kit? And what's with the kkk's Wayne. Fecking famous people and the names they give their kids

10230~~~
I reckon Waz is a big Jon Snow fan.

10231~~~
Bit of a tongue twister ending up with something that needs a twisting tongue.. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

10232~~~
He's got himself a Klan now. Congrats Wayne and Coleen, but seriously with these K names?

10233~~~
Apparently Jon Snow is a fan of United, so that'd explain a few things... odd name, still.

10234~~~
Knight Rider joke in here somewhere.

10235~~~
Kai is a nice name.

10236~~~
Congratulations, Kwayne.

10237~~~
Maybe he'll become our future kitman.

10238~~~
Hopefully he has a girl called Kat next to complete the ThunderCats twins

10239~~~
Who names his son Kit? Really weird name.

10240~~~
Someone who names their first sons Kai and Klay...

10241~~~
A footballer calling his child 'Kit' is like a boxer calling his child 'Glove' ...<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

10242~~~
Wait... KKK... Oh Wayne <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

10243~~~
That's a hideous name to give to a human being. Klay isn't much better, but this one takes the cake.

10244~~~
Maybe his next two children will be named 'Boots' and 'Armband'.

10245~~~
What the feck is on your mind when you name your child Kit?

10246~~~
May as well have called him vag

10247~~~
Seriously...is Kit an actual name?

10248~~~
The question is, who will shed more fat quicker? Coleen's baby fat or Wayne's beer fat? I know who my money is on.

10249~~~
GoT fan

10250~~~
Nah, he's clearly named his son after a sentient Trans Am.

10251~~~
Oh yeah, thought it was very weird to begin with, but Kit Harington pulls it off.

10252~~~
Actually we're both wrong, he's clearly in love with that bloke from American Horror Story.

10253~~~
Calling it now: If he gets a daughter, he'll name her Kunt. Or Klit.

10254~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10255~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Kit! He named his son Kit! Brilliant!

10256~~~
Can't wait for Wayne to dress him in a full kit.

<span style="color: #ffffff">FKW</span>

10257~~~
Breaking on Sky - Wayne Rooney embarrassed as kit is found full of piss.

10258~~~
I'm Rooney's biggest critic - I don't particularly like the guy, given his previous attempts to leave the club, so having him as captain doesn't sit well with me, however, his performances this season have been woeful but in part to the way the team is set up and his role in it.  I'd love to blame Rooney for much of the performance issues but you have to say, playing as a forward in this side you need to put away the half chance you get every game - find me a player that will.
Rooney is one of the biggest reasons why we must change our playing style.  He will never be the player of 5/6 years ago, but he is a damn sight better player than the one we have seen this season.  
I suppose, I could read this across for most of the players at the moment.  Mata, Herrera, Carrick and Sweinsteiger (Sp!) have all been well below what we expect and know they are capable off and it's the god awful tactics that have them shackled like slaves.
Harry Rednapp's comments about the squad being average is true to an extent but this team is very capable of getting top 4, but change needs to happen quickly.  If LvG is staying (I don't see him leaving), then the style needs to change.

10259~~~
Wayne: Darling, can you get my kit?
Coleen: Thank God you asked. He was creating a mess in the bedroom. Here, take him.

10260~~~
Kit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10261~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10262~~~
It's a slip of the tongue waiting to happen; "Kai, Klay & Kli..... Kit!" 

Still, the lad's got nothing to worry about when he goes to school. Nothing crude rhymes with Kit... right? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

10263~~~
KKK, he's going for his weekly wages, isn't he?

10264~~~
<i>Keeping Up with the KRooneys</i>

10265~~~
Kai is somewhat passable 

Klay and kit are fecking awful names.

10266~~~
Typical chav names for all his kids.

10267~~~
Wayne is just really passionate about kit-kats.

10268~~~
Some of these comments. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10269~~~
I am sure he named it out of respect for Albert the kit-man. And with name like that at least he'll get a job at any club, Wayne's been thinking about his future fair feck to him.

10270~~~
They probably got the idea from Kit Harrington of Game of Thrones fame.

10271~~~
Knightrider?

10272~~~
kai, klay, and kit... where is he getting those names from?

10273~~~
It's all building up to Kunt Rooney, the 4th.

10274~~~
14th goal of the season so far, by far our leading scorer. He was shite in the first half of the season but he's quite simply still our best goalscorer. Simple as

10275~~~
If Martial could finish like that we'd be 2 up already.

10276~~~
He's been by far our best player for the last month, still there are posters on here who thinks he shouldn't be starting for us.

10277~~~
That happens when you take penalties and the manager insists on playing you as our only forward.

In a decent run of form in goal though, let's hope that helps him sort out the rest of his game.

10278~~~

10279~~~
Perhaps it's time to accept that he might not actually be shite for good? Though I know it will be hard to take for many on here.

10280~~~
He's showing great technique with his finishing so far in 2016! I think most PL keepers probably would have saved that one tonight but great effort

10281~~~
Only on Redcafe would shit like this happen

10282~~~
Rooney started taking our penalties this month, it was mata and herrera before him. So no not really. Martial played up top a decent amount, and as much as I love Martial, he's not as good of a goalscorer or have those instincts like ROoney does yet

10283~~~
Something must have happened during his New Years Eve party that reminded him he's a good footballer! He's still nowhere near his best, but he's scored some cracking goals throughout January.

10284~~~
And in that time period he's for two pens. Martial was up front for about 5 games.

10285~~~
He is pretty much our only striker, even when he was our worst player he still stayed on the pitch and scored goals, it would be tragic if he wasn't our top scorer.

10286~~~
It's Derby, who are trash, but he's looked good tonight.

10287~~~
Just saw Rooneys goal wow!!! Amazing goal

10288~~~
We can only be encouraged.

We haven't got a cats chance in hell of doing anything this season without him scoring.

10289~~~
First touch looked good too.

10290~~~
He's looking leaner than he has been in a long time.

Hopefully his poor form in the first half of the season was down to a fitness/lifestyle issue that has now been addressed.

10291~~~
Like Newcastle who were 2nd bottom when we played them

10292~~~
Danny Murphy entered the Guinness book of records tonight by being the first person to commentate on a match from Rooney's Colon. 

I wish we could use him like a kicker in the NFL and just bring him on when we have the ball in a shooting position, as the rest of his play is still woeful for a line leading striker at a top club.

10293~~~
Is it just me or did he look more lean ? Could be me probably having a drink or two.

10294~~~
The thing this, he was absolutely god awful against all opposition during the first few months. He couldn't get the simple things right. However, he seems to have rectified that and is fast becoming an actual threat. For the first time in ages, I have a good feeling when he gets on the ball. Very good performance.

10295~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Fecking brilliant.

Thank God someone else saw this. Goal aside (and what a goal tbf), I thought he was pretty poor to be honest.

10296~~~
Anyone that says Rooney was poor tonight is simply fuelling an agenda, he was shocking up till Christmas but since the turn of the new year hes been excellent and scored some fantastic goals. If he played like this for the rest of the year I don't think you'd see many people complaining.... oh wait you probably would! Anyway long may it continue as he will be vital for any revival we need. Its just a shame that our midfield of Schneiderlin and Fellaini is about as mobile as a granny on stilts with the passing range of me (SHITE)

10297~~~
Great overall game and a wonder goal.

10298~~~
His all round game was class today, don't know what the feck some are you are watching. Games like this is where you can see who is just biased against him and criticizes just because they can't bring themselves to give praise where it's due.

10299~~~
Rooney is back, hope he keeps this up and we might just get top 4

10300~~~
Apparently it's just an agenda to not think what he did tonight was top #9 play, despite doing nothing but laying one ball off and hitting a good goal, the rest of his passing was poor and he still can't turn around or run.,

I'm not biased, I just watch enough football to know what a top #9 is supposed to play like, and one lay off and a goal does not make a top #9. We will never get this club back on track while he keeps starting every week.

10301~~~
If that's all that you saw him do then I seriously can't help you. His touch for once was consistently very good, he picked out good passes out to the wing first time plenty of times, and he started plenty of chances along with holding up the ball pretty well. He did basically as much as anyone could ask from your striker today. Is he a world class player still? Of course not, but today he had a really good game in every department. It's basically a bit above the normal type of performance that the likes of Lewandowski put in, so I'm not sure how someone could criticize him for that today.

10302~~~
Easy fella. Easy!!!

10303~~~
What? Above the normal Lewandwoski performance? I guess we really can't go anywhere with this mate, it's like we are watching different games so I'll just leave it.

10304~~~
Slightly above an average game for a top striker. Yeah. It's the best Rooney has played all season in terms of his overall game and it was against 2nd league opposition that people have to remember, so I'm not saying he's anywhere close to Lewa, but just the performance today was one players like Lewandowski would be happy with. Which is entirely accurate.

10305~~~
Personally I don't think so, Rooney had a simple chance to play Martial in, in the first half and over hit the ball, and more than once when it came to him he couldn't fend off the defender and turn so he just prodded at the ball back where it came from, sometimes it went to one of our players and sometimes it didn't. I can't say I've seen Lewandowksi struggle one on one against any CB in recent times or have a performance as ordinary as the one Rooney had tonight.

10306~~~
I was thinking that too, he does look leaner although I suppose that is how he's been for a long while now, looking sharper when the season is in full swing.

(I'm on the beer also though so its either that or we both secretly fancy Rooney)

10307~~~
I've never seen Rooney score so many great goals in such quick succession.  When he's playing like this I wouldn't mind keeping him around as a backup next year.

10308~~~
Respect for turning his season around.

10309~~~
Here ya go
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b4/a3/08/b4a308d6b824b1c8f8111cb7163e22ff.jpg" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b4/a3/08/b4a308d6b824b1c8f8111cb7163e22ff.jpg"/> 

Have a quick rub and come back more level-headed.

10310~~~
Credit where its due, I've been one of Rooney's biggest critics since LVG's arrival but he's done really well lately and doesnt look past it at all. It's good to know that the ability is still there, hope he keeps his form as we'll need it.

10311~~~
This is more for next season, but I think he should be more of an impact player / sub than a starter.

10312~~~
He had a good game today, passing was fairly accurate and held the ball better.

The difference today was though he played against 2 fairly average cbs who weren't athletic at all. They stood off him when he dropped off and allowed him to turn - doing this and giving him time lets him effect the game. 

He did certainly look to have more energy today though, against Southampton he looked knackered before he even started. Maybe Coleen being heavily pregnant was effecting him more than we thought.

10313~~~
Really good goal. I still thought his touch was quite poor at times though. I like to think I don't have an agenda against Rooney and can view it pretty fairly so maybe I will need to watch it again. He's definitely been better in 2016 though.

10314~~~
I'm perfectly level headed, anyone saying that performance tonight was good just shows how far the standards have dropped.

10315~~~
Nonsense.

10316~~~
No, the truth.

10317~~~
Tonight's performance was better, but standards HAVE dropped. Just listen to the posts around here. "Turned the season around" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10318~~~
Wayne Rooney is probably the only footballer in the world to have a tenured job, or a starting position i should say.

10319~~~
It's crazy, like a thirsty man in a desert.

10320~~~
fecking finish

10321~~~
Wow! Talk about fallen standards. It makes me think if supporters on this forum only just started watching United in the last 3 years or they have forgotten what a world class United forward looks like. I'm seeing words like perfect, great, awesome and I'm thinking this is stuff Ruud did on an average day. I can't keep blasting Rooney but I feel the need to counter the overrating by fans, media and pundits alike. Tonight's performance was nothing more than an OK performance. It's the least you should expect from a PL forward against an underperforming championship side. It's an improvement from the nonsense we've been served for months but that's just it. Not world class, not very good but just a good performance.

10322~~~
Average performance, brilliant goal. He'd be a good backup striker if he'd be willing.

10323~~~
Also, this was Derby.

10324~~~
Can't argue with 6 goals in 6 game since the Xmas period. And he's scored in 5 of his last 6 games to. Hopefully he can maintain that consistency.

And actually, if you made a highlights reel of his season to date, he'd look class.

10325~~~
What a goal that was last night, he's looked very sharp recently except for the Southampton game but everyone was bad in that game.

10326~~~
If he keeps up his average rate of scoring for the season to date (0.44 per game) he'll just break it, if he plays all of our remaining games. But if he goes on a run between now and May, he should break it easily.

10327~~~
That goal reminded me so much of the Bilbao(?) game a few years ago.

10328~~~
This one?

10329~~~
That's the one.. I thought he was out wider though, my mistake. Cracking goal all the same.

10330~~~
there was one lay off Rooney did, and you actually could hear Murphy's cum gasp

10331~~~
Great finish by Wayne yesterday. Nice to see him continuing his goalscoring form. 13 goals this season when we look at how he's played and how the team has played is a good return, in my opinion. Long may it continue.

10332~~~
This will be the dream scenario if he doesn't move on. I'm not convinced we can bring a WC class striker with Rooney being the main guy.

10333~~~
I'm not convinced we're willing to demote him from the "privileges" position.

10334~~~
Ok, he has picked this season but he is on a decline no doubt and next season would be more unbearable to witness. We need to knock down this privileges and face facts and move on. I can imagine what the season would have looked like if we have dropped him and gave Memphis and Young on wings, Mata at #10 and Martial up front, it may have been better.

10335~~~
You're not, you keep comparing current Rooney to current Lewandowski and completely negate the positive form Rooney has shown from his worst spell in his career. Rooney was very positive, was aggressive in his attack and defense and defenders backed away from him when he turned with the ball. They see Rooney in goal scoring form and they get scared.

10336~~~
If he goes on a run til end of season well make top 4.  If he doesn't we won't.  It's that simple!  

LVG, the other players and all the fans have to get fully behind Rooney til end of this season as our prestige for next year is largely on his shoulders.

I think he can do it, as long as Martial, Mata and Herrera can also find similar form to create enough chances for him to convert.

10337~~~
I doubt it.  Mata and Memphis form has been worse than Rooney this season and Martial, though undoubtedly talented has been inconsistent.

rooney has not had a good season and seems to be in decline, but he still remains one of our best players.  Likewise, the service provided to him has been woeful. 

 How can a striker be supposed to succeed with a meagre 2 or 3 Chances per game?  In years gone by, strikers like Cole or Saha would miss 4 chances per game only to score with their 5th! Those days seems so long ago!!!!

10338~~~
This, Mata has been woeful all season and Memphis while I personally think he will come good has hardly set the world a light, some people have an agenda against Rooney, he had a bad spell, sometime over the next two years we are going to have to fade him out but he's clearly still one of our better players. This thing with Martial up top I actually think for his development he's better where he is, he is the one person in our team who can beat people and how the team is set up currently he would be wasted at 9.

10339~~~
No, I simply see an average performance and say so, I expect Manchester United to have top quality up front, not this kind of mediocrity that is being passed off as acceptable because his prior performance was utter shit. Just because it was a bit better than he's been playing it doesn't make it good.

10340~~~
He's had only one really class performance this season against a relatively good team (Newcastle, they gave him acres of space though). The rest have been moslty poor to average performances with several class goals.

6 goals in 20 PL games and 1 goal in 4 CL group games is very average, if not poor for a main striker at United. Goals against teams like Brugge, Ipswich, Sheffield Un., Sunderland, Derby County distort the statistical picture of his season so far.

It is not by coincidence that we are already out of the CL and 5th in the EPL. Rooney was pathetic in the first half of the season. 2 goals and 1 assist in 16 PL games is beyond atrocious.

Hopefully he continues with his goal-scoring form from January till the end of the season, orherwise we won't finish in top 5. Unfortunately, I can't see it happen. Even during this statistically great month for Rooney his all-round game was poor in half of the games - against SU, Liverpool and Soton - and great only in one of them. LVG said recently that he put all his money on Rooney. Very bad choice, IMO, and it will cost him the managerial position at United. Soon rather than late.

If we fail to sign a top forward in the summer, next season won't be much different from this.

I wish Rooney to prove LVG right and his critics wrong.

10341~~~
Newcastle were 2nd from bottom when we played them

10342~~~
True, this is why i said "relatively good" <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> 

However, Newcastle are still better than Brugge, SU, Derby, Ipswich, etc. It was a class performance fom him.

10343~~~
By what standards are comparing how bad Mata and Depay has been worse than Rooney. The thing with forum is the double standards that we use to judge player expectations and performances. It seems that Memphis has not been judged considering all reasonable circumstances. To be fair is to judge him as a 20 year old player coming into a new and more difficult league AND compare him with other 20 year old players around the world. To be fair is to consider that it is unreasonable to expect such a player to set the league alight. To be fair is to consider his age and experience. Any fan that thinks Memphis is coming to a new league as a superstar is just in dreamland, actually inconsistency is actually part of progress for such a player. Putting that into perspective, he isn't a failure or as bad as people are making out.

Should Rooney not be compare  to other players around the world with similar circumstances and experience? You will be find out that he has had an absolutely poor season. I would say that he and Fellaini have been the worst players is we honestly consider what is expected of them. Using the same ruler to measure Rooney and Memphis is like using the same ruler to measure Messi and Townsend. 

We should be expecting more from the likes of these players and not comparing them with inexperienced players in our squad. Memphis putting in a 6/10 performance should be the same as Rooney putting in an 8.5/10 performance.

10344~~~
This is what worries me. It's almost like fans don't watch matches but look forward to highlights. A player can put in a 2/10 performance and yet score the winner in the last minute and he gets bumped to a 7/10 performance. I'm happy that we have a player that is scoring goals, regardless of who it is. I don't care if it Rooney or not at this stage. Rooney has had a free ride in squad all season and without any competition whatsoever it was only a matter of time before he became the sole provider of goals, its common sense.The same thing happened to Borini at Sunderland, he didn't become a better player, they persisted with his muck until he eventually found some form. 
Same with Fellaini last season, after a series of 3/10 performances he put a string of 6-7/10 performances and he was given a god like status. Why? There was a 3-4 point increase that blew everyone away. At United a 6/10 should not have us drooling, this should be regular. Rooney is doing exactly the same and we are drooling.

10345~~~
The most concerning aspect is that the board at the club might be thinking this way, and we'll go into next season with him still starting every week.

10346~~~
Slow-moooooooooooo.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/iyn5" width="560"></iframe>

10347~~~
Classic Rooney finish though, isn't it? 

And if he does end up breaking the scoring record, as least it's a record full of absolute pearlers. Rather that than a tap-in man having it.

Need a bit of that old magic against City / Arsenal / Chelsea / Spurs as well i'd say.

10348~~~
Couldn't have put it better myself. People are losing their shit over a decent performance against a Championship side that wasn't fresh and not on form.

10349~~~
Can see the Bilbao fans looking shocked and then applauding the goal.

Rooneys going to have a hell of a 'best goals' compilation when his career is over.

10350~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

10351~~~
So I ran into this guy over the weekend and he was exceedingly happy about being 'proved right'. I told him it was a coincidence but he just said wait and see, he is 100% convinced that Rooney's current decent form will decline as the weather warms and that he will be 'absolute shite' in the Euros because of the French summer. He said he knows it's true because he used to play football in a compression top due to a back injury and the same thing happened to him.

10352~~~
This is a new low IMO. Really? He can't perform as well out of compression tops?

10353~~~
Definitely. Some absolute screamers (the Newcastle volley, the bicycle kick...) and a very large amount of great goals. You could most probably make a top 50 of his goals that would be very watchable.

10354~~~
To think he had a program of 'top 20 premier league goals' on him at the age of 23, he's scored a lot of screamers since. And that was league goals only.

10355~~~
Rooney's goal stats this season is skewed and should not be a valid defense. Addressing his position and captain-ship should be a priority in the summer.

The fact is our attack is toothless and all of Rooney, Mata, Memphis, Lingard, Young etc are equally responsible, with greater share of blame falling on Rooney due to seniority. None have produced the standard of performance required at this level, consistently or at all. 

His current goal scoring form is a welcomed surprise although it cannot be ignored that he is finished at the highest level. I would argue even as a back-up, given his past tendency of having to be played into form.

Since he's our one established and the only striker (Martial pushed to the left due to Memphis poor form) we vitally need his goals to continue. We'll not only have a chance to finish top 4 but also market him to potential buyers.

For now, he's been a great servant to the club, a legend, and I hope he sets the goal record.

10356~~~
City get Pep and they've already identified top talent as their next targets and nobody can deny they're moving in the right direction while we're still stuck here entertaining captain (I'm on nearly 300k a week and yet I play like a barely arsed pub player) Wayne flipping Rooney's tantrums.

10357~~~
From someone on F365:

I agree with it.

10358~~~
He's had a fantastic club career.

10359~~~
Not remotely as good as expected though. White Pele etc...

10360~~~
He has - thanks to SAF and the team.

10361~~~
If he wasn't good enough he wouldn't last so long at United.

10362~~~
United itself isn't as good as it used to be. Our level has dropped massively, as far as our playing team is concerned.

10363~~~
Not talking about him now, he's clearly past it.

But while Fergie was here he was always one of his key players (up until Fergies last season when he saw what everyone else failed to see, Rooneys decline).

To say he's had disappointing career is just plain stupid. Man scored more winners for United than any other player, probably will end his career as Uniteds top scorer and has fair share of trophies to show, yet somehow that's not good enough <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10364~~~
He's had a fantastic career, but he did fail to live up to his own hype, no denying that. He never became the player everyone thought he'd be, when he initially burst onto the scene.

10365~~~
His own hype, or hype created by press? Since I don't think I've ever seen him calling himself white pele or whatever. He could've been better player that's true, but for someone who's won so much and tops scoring charts for both club and country (still waiting club part) is just stupid to expect even more.

10366~~~
He did hold the club hostage over two separate occasions and undermined our authority by threatening to leave, because we weren't ambitious enough for him. The fact that he thought he was bigger than the club leads me to believe he does think of himself as a far better player than he actually is now.

10367~~~
Blackadder fan?

10368~~~
"deeply disappointing career". Now, that's just silly.

So, carry on, fitting the thread.

10369~~~
United could've sell him straight away yet SAF gave him new contract, why? Don't think he though being bigger than the club, but going from playing with Tevez and Cristiano to playing with Owen and Valencia could've made him question direction of the club. And in hindsight he was right since not dealing with losing star players got us where we are now.

10370~~~
Yep, why?

10371~~~
It was one of my 'to do list' of great British comedies. I'll take your name as a sign.

10372~~~
Do it, you won't regret, brilliant comedy!

10373~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

I've slagged him off as much as anyone but he's hit some fecking form. Even his first touch isn't donkeybrained, very good passing of late too. Great to see.

10374~~~
Pretty good half. Made a few great key passes and almost no mistakes.

10375~~~
He'll have the record by the end of Feb at this rate.

10376~~~
Fair play to him. Should have had 2 in this half already.

10377~~~
He has to adapt himself to a role of fox in the box type of player, has all the tools to make himself great poacher!

10378~~~
Now matched his goal tally for last season. And aiming for 20 for this season no longer seems far fetched. 

I was more pleased by the assist than the goal, though. Great pass.

10379~~~
Looked relatively sharp, can he keep it up till the end of the season? I think not, prove me wrong, Wayne.

10380~~~
Playing well recently, let's hope he keeps up this form until the end of the season.

10381~~~
Always said that we needed Rooney to play well if we were ever going to do anything this season. Simply cos he plays all the time.

10382~~~

10383~~~
Must give him credit for coming back after a disastrous first half of the season. He won't be the same angry boy never again but he's currently scoring goals and helping others scoring them. Can't ask for much more. I hope he can keep this form.

10384~~~
Thought he was excellent in the build up, much better than in last game against shit opponent where he got praise for being average.

10385~~~
I always thought van Gaal's style of play had caused him to become ineffective.

He has come good again. Looks lethal. Will break the record this season...and I hope he drives England on to the Euro trophy.

10386~~~
Let's hope his purple patch lasts as long as his rough one.

10387~~~
Long may it continue.

10388~~~
His best game of the season IMO, I do think that come next season he has to become a squad player rather than automatic #9 starter if we are to actually move forward as a team, but this was better tonight.

10389~~~
His problem is that the gap between his best and worst is just fecking massive. From very, very good player, to Sunday league stuff. Let's just hope this current version of Rooney can last for a few more months.

10390~~~
Safe to say he's back? Been class since the new year. 7 goals in his last 7. All around game been excellent as well. Hopefully we just keep him up top now instead of moving him and martial around constantly, which hurts their form inevitably.

10391~~~
Credit where credit is due. Thought he was finished. We need him to continue this scoring form.

10392~~~
His best game of the season.  He even looked like he was faster than a few weeks back.

Has developed a great footballing relationship with Martial and simply because he has regained self confidence, his finishing is much more reliable.  

Red hot scoring form right now.  Put simply, if Rooney can score 10 goals in remaining 14 PL matches, we will finish in the top 4 and he will have well earned his hefty salary.

Genuinely happy he seems to have some mojo again.

10393~~~
Rooney really is the best at bouncing back at his critics. Let's be honest, most of us on here said he was finished.

10394~~~
It's not just his goals, he's been technically excellent since the new year.

10395~~~
As a regular starter I still think he is, if he could see his way to being a back-up though then it might be different.

10396~~~
Where would be be without him as a regular starter right now though? he's banging in much needed goals and looking creative again too.

10397~~~
I wonder if there was a problem with him, as the rumours said at Christmas. Ever since those rumours that he was either drinking or suffering with depression, he's really stepped up. Its not rare to see players get back on form. Its quite rare to see someone play as badly as he did in the first half of the season, with the quality he had. He looked finished up until the start of the year.

10398~~~
Where would we be if we'd had a top #9 all season? He can still finish as we see but many games when under pressure his touch and passing is poor, and we have zero alternative to play up there. He'll be a year older next season with another International summer on his body, he's at the point where less games and impact role is the natural transition given how much football he has already played, we need a striker with more pace and strength up top for the week to week.

10399~~~
Best game he's played in a while. Looks sharp, great assist, and very good runs.

More importantly, he looks to have clicked with martial, and looks like hes enjoying his football again.

10400~~~
Aside from his general good performance, I've been really impressed with his off the ball movement recently. He's been brilliant at creating space for team mates and disorganising opposition defences.

10401~~~
I wonder if his form had anything with his missus being pregnant with their third child? Since he has had the kid his form has seen an upsurge! Either way it is good he is coming into form!

10402~~~
This is what weve needed him to do since the beginning of the season tbh. But if he continues doing this (well goals mostly) until the end of the season, it will be great for us. Nothing we shouldnt be expecting but he looked sharp, got a goal, an assist and a disallowed goal too. Good movement as well.

As long as it doesnt take him 6 months to warm up next season <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

10403~~~
Really happy for him. We all know he is physically declining and was awful for alot of 2015 but he is such a clever footballer. He isn't he same player as he was up until his mid 20s but you trust him to make the right decision on the pitch.

10404~~~
Very happy he's kept up this run of from. Long may it continue, it actually give us some hope of salvaging something from the season. Fair play to him for turning it around and shutting a few of us up. (Myself included).

10405~~~
Was really good tonight. Despite scoring since the turn of the year, his touch and general play was still off. Seems to me as if that's coming back as well recently. Happy for him to silence the critics, including me.

10406~~~
What a difference compared to earlier in the season. Imagine if he'd played like this from the start of the season, we wouldn't be questioning a position in the top four. It would probably be almost guaranteed.

10407~~~
Solid touch, making runs into space, and isn't drifting deep like always. The confidence looks to finally be back

10408~~~
Tell you what, he might just be saving his season.

10409~~~
Take away his goal tonight, and he still would get a 7/8 out of 10 for me. His overall play in the last few games has really improved. His touch, his link up play, his movement, etc. It's obvious that with his goals, he's also starting to gain a lot of confidence, and I guess it's starting to show in his and the teams performances.

10410~~~
Looks like his New Years resolutions going well. His form difference from 2015 to now is remarkable.

10411~~~
He's been very good of late and I think he's not just been playing for the record but his career/s with England and United. He's at a very good level now but we've a better pace/tempo at the minute. Hopefully that'll continue against Chelsea.

10412~~~
Long may this form continue. Strange how getting a consistent amount of goals just gives you so much confidence... His disallowed goal I thought was exquisite. Still can't believe the ref disallowed that <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

10413~~~
Annoying that it took 4 months of dire performances to get to this level.

Purple patch aside, we still need to replace him in the summer with Harry Kane. £50 million should do it.

10414~~~
Proving some people wrong (including myself), I didn't think he had this type of form left in him. It's still extremely frustrating that it took 4 months to reach this point though and I still think he needs replaced in the summer, or at least bring someone in to challenge him if he goes through poor form again.

10415~~~
Much better from him. His best game this season I think.
Was involved a lot

10416~~~
If we want to be punctilious we'd say that that isn't saying a lot. However, I know you didn't mean it that way, and I do agree. Long may it continue.

10417~~~
Confidence is there - he's even having a go from a distance even if they are speculative. With him in form, it opens up the game for others because now he has to be marked better. Hope he tears Chelsea new one on Sunday.

10418~~~
He's not Jamie Vardy. He's not allowed to barge defenders over willy-nilly.

10419~~~
I don't know what has happened to him, but he is really turning up these days.

Everything he has been criticised for, he is now answering in full and looking like the real deal again! First touch, passing, scoring, and his speed is back too.

10420~~~
Looks like he had the right drink this New Year!!!

10421~~~
More like 6-7 months, if you include the last months of last season. Basically, he was shit for almost the whole calendar year with scoring only 6 PL goals.

Now he looks sharper but I'm afraid that it won't last long and that his form may have something to do with the quality of the opposition. Some not so good teams like Swansea, Newcastle, Burnley, Stoke (yesterday) played quite open football and left our forwards acres of space. Liverpool and Soton weren't great either but were pressing us well and we were crap. Let's see how well we'll do against Chelsea who haven't been great in defence either. Once we play a team that is very well organised and closes down the spaces well, Rooney will struggle again.

Basically, one or even 2-3 months of good/excellent form do not erase about 3 years of decline. Therefore, I agree that we have to replace both LVG and Rooney in the summer. Otherwise, we'll find ourselves fighting for 4th next season again with Rooney losing form for months again.

10422~~~
I thought he was quite excellent. His goal aside, the all round play was there, and he was bringing the ball down and bringing people into play. I thought his disallowed goal was the correct decision to be honest. The movement of his arms as he pushed the defender aside was obvious.

However, this is nothing new from Rooney. A few weeks of him in a purple patch, in between months of him being dire. Just like how I'm not getting carried away with Van Gaal's management and this win, I'm not sure we've seen the last of pub player Rooney.

10423~~~
Very happy for Rooney.  Looking sharp and dangerous.  Just wish Spurs would stop picking up points.  At this rate maybe only Arsenal looking like dropping out of the top four.

10424~~~
Good to see him finally back and doing well, but that took him too long! We cant play him for half a season and hope that he eventually finds form

10425~~~
starting to resemble a top end footballer. looks like he's finally converted his goalscoring run to confidence on the pitch. hope he continues his form.

10426~~~
Quite surprised by the amount of headers he won!

10427~~~
It should but it won't. Won't even get Lukaku for that price.

10428~~~
Just one of them will do nicely..  50m or more just get these feckers here in the summer.

10429~~~
Red hot. I don't know how he caught up and bullied Johnson for his disallowed goal. In the past few months he has been custard.

10430~~~
Usually I just laugh at jokes like these but you're so right, Vardy could full on punch someone and probably still get away with it.

On another note, whatever Rooney had for his Christmas dinner he needs to keep taking it! He and Martial have developed such a good understanding recently, it's genuinely exciting to watch.

10431~~~
Awesome recent turnaround given the dire season.

Shame it's taken him so damn long to get going. I don't think anyone (myself included) would have ever suggested he couldn't be a squad player next season (capable of contributing more goals) but I still don't think it's wise to rely on such an inconsistent player.

10432~~~
Just shows how much better off we would be if we had another competent striker (or winger, with Martial up top) to play when Rooney is off form. 

Another striker is a priority in the summer.

10433~~~
Credit to the guy, he's been really good in 2016. Doesn't change the fact that he's fecked us all 2015, but it's a start. I'm relieved to see him back he should probably be our player of the month for January.

10434~~~
More needs to be made about how ridiculous that shoulder-barge decisionw was... the ref obviously didn't think it was a foul, otherwise he'd have blown up straight away... instead he ended up shitting himself and second guessing his decision.

Really though, that's the other way round and Johnson barges Rooney like that, there is no feckin' chance on earth that it would be a penalty.

10435~~~
Indeed, provided that the other striker would have played when Rooney wasn't in form.

But, in reality, the other striker would have sit on the bench. Because the philosophy is to play Rooney into form even if the process takes 5-6 months and we are already 5th in the league and out of the CL when Rooney is finally ready to deliver what is expected from the main United striker.

10436~~~
The shoulder barge was a foul. You can't win the ball like that. Remember when we were outraged when Vardy did it to Rafael last season (which was a foul, but wasn't given) and then Rafael did it back in the area (which was given but was less of a foul iirc)? The Rooney one is a foul.

10437~~~
Anyone notice how much better he has been since that one game LvG dared to drop him?

I'm not saying complacency is the whole issue with Rooney, but i'd say it's a pretty big one.

10438~~~
Yep. Needed to happen earlier, but LVG kept harping on about 'my captain shall always play'.

10439~~~
I think his good form has more to do with the fact that he was out for several weeks in December and could improve on his fitness. He's returned in a much better phyiscal shape than he was before that. How long he will be able to sustain this physical form is another question and I'm not optimistic about that.

10440~~~
60million then. We need the best English attackers in our team so we should break the bank to get him. Landing Kane would mean our forward line sorted for the next 10 years.

First time i've actually seen that word worked into a sentence, and on a football forum no less.

Well done <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

10442~~~
I'd love for us to by Kane, but I just can't see how that could happen this summer. Levy is notoriously difficult to deal with and not only that, if Spurs finish above us and they get CL and we don't, why would Kane want to move from his boyhood club? It's not happening.

Lukaku is much more realistic.

Gods knows Woody loves a no-goer though.

10443~~~
Its been a recurring theme throughout his time here where he comes back from the summer out of shape, its never taken this long to sort before though.

10444~~~
Needs to continue impregnating Coleen.

10445~~~
I don't know he had a similar bad period of form over the second half of 2010, funnily enough he only started playing well again in january just like this year.

10446~~~
I wonder if there's an element of him having had to rediscover how to play effectively as a No.9? He hasn't done it regularly since 2011/12, after all, and it's never been his 'main' position.

10447~~~
I have been very critical of Rooney for a couple of years tbh, but he is in a great spell right now, and we so desperately needed it. If he can go on a run from now until the end of the season, then along with the likes of Rojo, Shaw and Bastian returning, hopefully can get us over the line into the CL. 

Our attack obviously needs more still, but having Rooney firing alongside Martial is a great help to us, and a relief to Martial.

10448~~~
I volunteer.

10449~~~
Being dropped in the reverse fixture seems to have done him a world of good. 7 goals in 7 games (I think) is brilliant.

10450~~~
Credit where it's due, having a very good start to this year. Didn't really expect him to turn it around

10451~~~
14 in 30 is moving into quite respectable territory. In his worst seasons here he hits around 16, with Sir Bobby's record to chase i see no reason he can't break 20.

10452~~~
Should be getting that record in no time at the rate he's going at. 

Really happy for him that he's turned it around since the New Year.

10453~~~
The important thing is that this kind of form continues as long as possible. This can happen only if Rooney is fresh enough and does not run himself in the ground. LVG has to give him a rest in some less important games, he will get the record even if he doesn't play against some minnows in the cups, especially if we have an important game in the league after that.

10454~~~
I'm glad he's scoring. I think y'day was his best performance so far. But it doesn't excuse the shite served up for the majority of the rest of the season. Also, to my recollection, the only goals he's scored against a 'good' side have been v Stoke and Liverpool. The majority of his goals have come across pretty poor teams (x4 v Brugge, Ipswich, Derby, Swansea, x2 Newc). Hopefully with him performing against better sides it'll help us move further up the league, too.

10455~~~
I have had serious doubts about him being able to turn it around, so I'm surprised but pleased by some good performances over the last few weeks, and this was the best one. Hopefully he'll maintain this level for the remainder of the season, we sure need him to.

10456~~~
Anyone know how many league goals from open play?

Or, can tell me where one finds these things out?

10457~~~
6, I think (I'm 90% sure I'm right).

10458~~~
Ta.

Still work to do, then, to 'save his season', I reckon. If he can double that, before the end, then I'll be a reasonably happy bunny. Doable, if he stays fit.

10459~~~
One thing I've noticed is that he's got runners around him during the New Year, with space between him and the goal, so there's a threat in behind with runners. Martial has been a threat and dare I say Martial's game has improved the since the New Year as well. There's also an urgency and spark about Wazza that was dormant for too much of the season.

10460~~~
So he needs 6 more goals to beat the record. Do you reckon he's been told he's off at the end of the season and he's decided to pull his finger out a bit?

10461~~~
Dont get my hopes up.

10462~~~

10463~~~
A part of me wishes to quote all those people who said he'd "done a falcao" and was completely finished at the top level. I said it then as well, Rooney may not be the young wayne Rooney but he still is a class player. He has one of the best visions and finishing in the league. 

When our players are having a bad run this forum (and well any forum tbh) absolutely tears them apart. Some went as far as saying he never was special. People are doing the same with Fellaini. He's had a bad run and to some that proves he is the worst PL player ever

10464~~~
WTF <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10465~~~
The incredible thing is that Rooney's goals/assists to played minutes ratio in the league is still worse than Falcao's.

Rooney has contributed a league goal every 172 min whereas Falcao did it every 166 min. WTF?

Imagine how bad Rooney was before January.

He has a lot to prove before we can say that he's back or something. First, he has to get us out of the shit and make us top 4. Because we are 5th largely because he was atrocious in the first half of the season and contributed the sum total of ZERO league points. Do the math if the latter sounds too harsh.

10466~~~
apparantely it was just a bad run of form. Everyone knows he needs till xmas to get going

10467~~~
He was dreadful most of the season, and we're all happy to see him playing well again. Fellaini is a steaming pile of poo though, and he is one of our least exciting players ever.

10468~~~
He was crap since April, if not earlier. The bad run of form lasted almost a year. But it was just a blip. Now normal service is resumed.

10469~~~
As bad as he may be according to some, saying he has been as bad as Falcao is just wrong no matter what the statistics will suggest. 


These opinions change in weeks so I'm not too surprised.

10470~~~
For the first half of this season that is exactly how bad he was.

10471~~~
Why? Because he is Wayne Rooney of Manchester United? If he was from Lithuania (no disrespect) and played for Liverpool, would he still be rated as high as you think. Football fans need to get real and not overly biased. This was the same board that refused to agree that Vardy was putting in top class performances because we don't like him and he doesn't play for United but Rooney is better because he plays for us. From a neutral point of view, Rooney has been terrible for 18 months to 2 years as far as top quality is concerned. As far as avergae performances are concerned he has done OK. So which one is it? Should he be judged like the best of his peers or just his current level, which is bang avergae IMO?

10472~~~
No, there is no bias here. He was terrible for the first half of the season but he wasn't as bad as Falcao. He still contributed to the team and wasn't slipping/flopping around like Falcao. At least he defended at times.

10473~~~
he was never as bad as Falcao. He was just not playing the proper way as a number 9. He stopped playing to his strengths.

10474~~~
One would think Falcao did not contribute anything with your comment. You have failed to consider that Falcao was not afforded the game time and starts that Rooney had, surely that would count for something. How about the fact that Falcao just came off the back off a long term injury to his knee?  And that he was playing in a new league whereas as Rooney is already a PL veteran? I don't know how "he defended" of any consequence. It's like saying Fellaini has defended a few corners, and? He is a PL footballer. It's nothing to write home about.

10475~~~
I understand this. What is the proper way? One moment they say Rooney should play as a #9, the next as a #10. Then is the issue of the formation, and the tactics. One would think he was Messi that everything should be centred around him. Sorry, he is not! A lot of shuffling has been made to accommodate Rooney, yet he didn't perform as he should. How about we focus on the individual himself and stop using the team's inadequacies to hide him behind. What are these strengths exactly?

10476~~~
18 months is a hell of a long time to be "Off form" IMO. I stand by the view that I think he's past it as far as being a week in, week out starting striker for a team with PL winning aspirations. To me next season is the right time to transition him into a back-up striker.

10477~~~
Falcao never put in as dire performances the likes of Rooney has done several times this season up to new year. He was an actual hinderance to the side. Of course he seems to have recovered to a decent striker again

10478~~~
For some, it looks like the standard of a Manchester United striker has dropped to 'not as bad as Falcao'.

10479~~~
Ermm nice twisting of words here. I'm just saying those fans that said that were/are exaggerating.

10480~~~
I don't know why this is so difficult to get. Yes, we celebrate Rooney's past but the fact of the matter is that he is no longer that guy. And we need to move on, its part of a cycle. All good things as they say comes to an end. This is a serious problem plaguing United as a whole, living off past glories and refusing to move on with the times. United are still living off the glory years and boasting in the "World's biggest club" tag while other clubs are moving ahead. Only a couple of years ago, we were in the CL final 3 out of 4 years, Barca had Villa, Messi, Henry, Etoo in that period, compare that to now and guess who has moved on? We are talking about a Manchester United striker that is not even in the top 7 in the league. Reality check guys!

10481~~~
Definitely past it, but as long as he keeps his rate of scoring up for the rest of the season (even 1 in 2) I don't give a feck. Wholesale changes in the summer regardless.

10482~~~
Pretty unlucky not to get the Premier League award.

10483~~~
7 in 7, hope he can continue it tomorrow.

10484~~~
He'll be back to being shit after the Euros once he doesn't have to perform to get in Roy's good books for the tournament.

10485~~~
If Mourinho is in charge, he will drop Rooney.

10486~~~
Not when he's in this form, tbf.

10487~~~
Yeah I meant if he plays like he did for most of this season.

10488~~~
Oh yeah, he'll get dropped in that scenario.

You'd think Mourinho would buy a big bullying striker anyway.

10489~~~
Invisible, but even when he is dropping deeper and wants to be involved he is slowing down our play it's painful to watch. Pass the fecking ball earlier without turning around in circle first.

10490~~~
He's got such little presence as a centre forward. We really need someone to give us hold up play and runs down the channels. Zouma and Terry can just toy with Rooney in that regard.

10491~~~
This. Also, he feels the need to make things much more complicated than what they really are, always looking for the long pass to the right instead of playing a quick easy pass.

10492~~~
And Zouma would destroy him for pace. I don't see Rooney having any attributes to upset that defense.

10493~~~
This x1000

10494~~~
he's been shit in the first half, we need him to step up in the second to get a result.

10495~~~
He doesn't seem capable of getting the ball where he wants it in one touch, so his second, third and fourth touches are trying to get the ball out of his feet. This is nothing new, but once again he's slowing the attacks down.

10496~~~
Still shit apparently.

10497~~~
Yeah, it's more annoying when everyone else on the pitch realise he will make that long pass before him.

Btw, let's hope he scores and at least continues his goalscoring form, but his all around game is poor and it's not helping us at all.

10498~~~
It's so obvious as you say. People compare his long crosses to Scholes, but Rooney's are so lofty and slow in comparison, and Scholes' neck worked both ways. 

His overall play is poor, but as you say, let's hope he scores.

10499~~~
Ah, that 70 yard diagonal pass to the right, never down the middle or left, just the right. He reminds me of that kid that only knows how to do that one move on Street Fighter!

10500~~~
And the commentator would wank on it as if it's a piece of genious.

10501~~~
what do you expect mate, he's the English Pele!

10502~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlz_P-tZj_w?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

10503~~~
Ah, the good old 3 season ago moment, how refreshing!

10504~~~
What's with the criticism? He was good today with a lot of neat touches. Had a better game than our other attackers.

10505~~~
Rooney was average in the first half but the second half was very good, played with confidence and enthusiasm.

10506~~~
I have said a kot of stuff about him this season but he was good today. Cant fault him for too much.

That chip he tried at the end was a really bad idea though.

10507~~~
Of the many many times he was isolated vs 1 CB and with acres to run into, he didn't manage to win or hold on to a single clearance. Imagine how much Benzema, Lewa, or RvP from a season or 2 ago  (or even Berba) would have annoyed them. Costa did it a few times when isolated too, in this very match.

Holding the ball up is essential for a lone striker. With his bad touch and unwillingness to contest headers, he invites pressure on our defence because the opposition get the ball back immediately.

10508~~~
He couldn't lead the line to save his life.

10509~~~
Did really well again today. Has been back to a very good level since the new year. Shame he didn't get any big chance come his way as he surely would've taken it.

10510~~~
That chip attempt at the end really pissed me off. More than it should have, maybe as we had just equalised. But a delicate chip attempt agaisnt Courtois who wasnt even that far off his line with a minute or two to go (and better options). aghhh

10511~~~
I didn't think he was too bad today but we have virtually no one running in behind the defence and it costs us at times. A dynamic striker could of got a handful today IMO.

10512~~~
He should have pulled back to Mata when he tried to chip Courtois.

10513~~~
Did okay but doesn't offer much as a striker on his own.

10514~~~
Clearly we need someone better leading the line. Aguero would be nice.

10515~~~
Very good today.

10516~~~
The usual suspects bumping this to criticise. He was a bit quiet in the first half but much more involved in the second. The main thing is he looks sharp and isn't a concern right now.

10517~~~
If he was supposed to play as a striker today, he was gash! As another midfielder, he was ok. We need a proper player to start leading the line. He did not cause the aged John Terry any problems whatsoever.

10518~~~
After Zouma got injured. Before that he was a bit of a shadow, didn't offer any hold up play. Compare him to Costa who was very active throughout the game. After Zouma was substituted Rooney was very good though, agree about that.

10519~~~
Shite in the first half, did well in the second.

10520~~~
Legs are gone we need someone up top with pace (Martial)

10521~~~
In the first half Chelsea sat so deep and compact that he never got into the game, but I thought he played well in the 2nd half, his one touch lay-offs were keeping our attacks moving and he was moving sharply from stand still to look for returns, the problem in games like this is that he doesn't offer much threat or pressure against the CB's when we are probing.

10522~~~
I guess he's been much worse this season

10523~~~
Another easy 250k+ for him with hardly breaking a sweat.

10524~~~
Pace, or power, or at least great movement.

You can't be the main striker without at least one of those attributes. Should have two if you're looking to take that role at a top team, and preferably all three. Rooney doesn't have any.

I still rate Rooney higher than most on this forum and think he could do a good job in one of the three attacking roles behind the main striker, or in a two striker system, but it's blatantly obvious he shouldn't be playing up front on his own.

10525~~~
Only caught the second half and for the first 25 minutes where we tried play football he looked good.

10526~~~
Another decent game from him overall but I am surprised there is not more criticism for the ridiculous chip he tried. Memphis is getting brutalised for poor decision making and yet most seem to be overlooking Wayne's misjudgement which spurned a decent chance to snatch the game.

10527~~~
He was good today. What match were you weirdos watching?

10528~~~
He lost his explosiveness which used to be a massive part of his game. Sure he can still finish or play a fantastic cross-field pass but he can't burst past a defender anymore which is limiting his chances.

10529~~~
He wasn't great, but better than he was before Christmas. Imagine how much better we'd be with a really top class striker up top.

10530~~~
It's going top be tricky in the summer, if he was still playing like he was for the first 4 months he might well be sold, but his mini burst of form and goals will see his grip on that ludicrous contract tighten.

In an ideal world we'd get a new #9 and Rooney would accept a reduced role, but it's not an ideal world and there's no use trying to play him as a #10, he just hasn't got the skill or vision for the role, to get anything from him he has to be in getting on the end of things around the box and focused on that. 

Which all means we might need to pad around him for yet another season with a couple of additions at RW and #10..

10531~~~
which is applauded now

10532~~~
It's the annual Rooney chip shot, which he needs to attempt at least once every season to keep up the appearance of him having some attacking "flair" so we've kind of tuned that part of the game out.

I thought he was decent enough. Not 250k undroppable captain kind of decent but let's face it, he needs to be performing like Messi to really earn his undroppable face-of-the-club, captain role so this will have to do.

10533~~~
Invisible in the first half. Improved in the second.

10534~~~
He is definitely playing better than he did at the start of the season. He isn't anything extraordinary anymore though. Just some decent and average performances. We need a better #9 than him.

10535~~~
No other striker playing for the top 4-5 have a worse first touch than this guy, it's ridiculous. The ball just takes him a few feet backwards every time.

10536~~~
He's a better player than Costa, yet it's Costa who made the difference.

10537~~~
Yes, 3-4 years ago.

As a centre-forward Costa is much better now due to his far superior hold up play. Rooney's hold up play is incredibly average.

10538~~~
You guys need to stop bringing up his salary. For the last time, he gets his money not only for his football but for the "Wayne Rooney" brand involved at Manchester United. It's a business decision.

10539~~~
Costa has had a rough time this season as has been the case with most Chelsea players due to an unusually miserable season for the entire football club, but over the last few years Costa has been one of the very best CF's in the game, and miles better than Rooney.

10540~~~
And if he reverts to his Pre-Christmas form for any length of time how much will that brand be worth, it is a valid part of the conversation.

10541~~~
I know, amol; I was suggesting, really, that Rooney is arguably a better all-round player.

10542~~~
Not for a long time, though. 3 years back, yes.

Whenever I watch the discussions on TV about Costa from the English media, it's always surrounding his brute-nature and antics, which is fair given he brings all that attention upon himself via his cuntishness, but many forget just how brilliant he was in 13-14. Absolutely phenomenal, in a one of the great league title wins I've ever seen (Atletico).

10543~~~
I wasn't that impressed with him last night tbh. Costa has been as crap as him for most of the season, but it's clear who is more involved, and has that deadly killer instinct in front of goal.

Hint: It ain't Wayne.

10544~~~
Agree. There's no way he would be first choice for any of the top 4.

10545~~~
It's a bit like that episode of <i>Steptoe and Son</i>, in which Harold and Albert have to get rid of the knackered old carthorse that had served them well for years. Ok, so it's nothing like that but at least the horse won them some Champions League titles.

10546~~~
True but people are complaining that his performances are not worth 250 k or whatever he is on. That salary can hardly be justified by the likes of Ronaldo and Messi let alone Rooney, so why do we talk about it? It's purely business. We should only be concerned about how he performs on the pitch.

10547~~~
Rooney had good touches on the ball outside the box but never presented much of a scoring threat.  I gave him a 7 but if 6.5 were an option I'd have gone with that.

10548~~~
Salary should be based on performance. If his performances aren't up to scratch then of c people will bring in his salary.

10549~~~
The reason the money comes into play is because for that money you are supposed to get a Ferrari not a souped up Focus, we are paying Rooney as an elite player when he is nowhere near that level, hence it annoys fans.

10550~~~
Salary is not and cannot be based on just performance. Football is a business and there are tonnes of other factors involved. 

Again, you may be getting a focus but that focus is making you a ton of money though its brand name. Ironically, if fans are so worried about the clubs finances they should be supporting Rooney in the club despite his inflated wage as it in turn helps with club finances (which would be ridiculous if they did that)

10551~~~
Name some of the tonnes of other factors.

10552~~~
I don't care if Rooney was paying us £300k. He shouldn't be on the pitch/and/or has that much influence on the team.

From a pure footballing decision how he continues to get games and the full 90mins is a travesty.

10553~~~
In general terms: Nationality of player, status as captain etc

but more concrete terms: Branding such as shirt sales, Rooney brand on merchandise etc.

10554~~~
Rooney is the only tangible, iconic link to success under Fergie in our current team. I suspect that's the main reason. The only way to replace that image is by a new talisman, in a new title winning team.

10555~~~
It's got nothing to do with finances, it's the fact we are getting nowhere near the product we are paying for and for that money we could replace him with someone better.

10556~~~
Hey I'm not arguing we don't need a new fresh striker to set us on fire. I'm just trying to explain his salary and why we shouldn't be too concerned with it.

10557~~~
That is all that needs to be said about Wayne Rooney. 

If he was put on the transfer market right now, would any of Arsenal, City, Chelsea, or Spurs go for him? No. 

Would we for Aguero, Kane, Sanchez, Eriksen? Yes.

10558~~~
I'm fairly sure they would.

10559~~~
Only Chelsea were interested almost three years ago when he was in his best years, what makes you think others would be interested now that he is much older and worse?

10560~~~
Only Chelsea tried to sign him then. If he was on the transfer market, we'd get a lot more offers.

And yeah, he wouldn't attract record fees, but certainly a lot of clubs would be interested, even now. And especially now, as he's in pretty good form.

10561~~~
He wanted to go, pretty sure clubs see it as "being available".

And no one would be interested to pay his wages now even if they got him for free, probably not even City.

10562~~~
There's no reason to assume he'd demand same salary as what he gets now.

10563~~~
Yeah, Wayne Rooney terminating long term contract for one with lower wages is clearly something that seems believable.

10564~~~
It's just a hypothetical about him attracting other clubs.

IF he was put on transfer list, and IF he was ok with the move. He would attract a lot of clubs, and he would adjust his salary demands.

He wont go, of course. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

10565~~~
Some team in China would. No other team in the premier league would because there is zero chance he'd lower his salary demands.

10566~~~
He's like a bad virus that won't go away.

He's done well so far this calendar year. But in the long term, his current form is more damaging than the potential points it brings. He's likely going to earn another season here after his recent displays, which once again means that club won't be able to truly rebuild while he remains an ever present.

I think Mourinho will use him, especially because of his experience. I'm hoping he won't take any bullshit though. He's the type of manager who will drop him if he plays like he has for the majority of the season. There won't be any privileges with him, I'm hoping.

Rooney would benefit the most out of everyone if we brought in a world class striker for him to play second fiddle to. It would take a lot of pressure off him. There wouldn't be as many eyes fixed on him with another high profile player around.

10567~~~
When is his contract up? 

I'm glad that he is playing better, but he is on the decline. Unless there is a club out there willing to accept his massive wages right now, all we can do is wait until his contract is up. If he accepts a smaller salary and role going forward, I don't mind him staying, but otherwise, it's thanks a bunch for the years of service, and see you later. No hard feelings.

10568~~~
Zero chance...I mean, how would you know something like that?

Then again, I say the opposite, and know not that for sure, so carry on.

Hyptotheticals are boring. :x

10569~~~
Not a chance any of the top clubs would be interested. He should go to China whilst he still has the name to cash out for a year and them go play MLS. 

I find it funny people downplay the likes of Vardy etc as not good enough for a top club and then defend Rooney because he scores a few goals recently. Just shows people will go on name over anything else.

10570~~~
No they would not. They have better players in every position that he can play in and then some. Right now Vardy is a far more valuable commodity than Rooney.

10571~~~
This would be utterly bizarre, if that happened.

10572~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> yeah the player that threw his teammates under the bus to get a wage hike would take a pay cut.

10573~~~
As it'll happen at the end of his current contract, it's almost a certainty.

Who he threw under the bus btw? What are you referencing there?

10574~~~
The problem that a lot of people have with Vardy on here, apart from his age, is when he took us apart last season.
He got a lot of vitriol from our fans that day, even though Vardy was merely doing his job (ie. beat us).
This season he is going from strength to strength and due to the way he plays (his movement, power, pace, accuracy, determination, grit) - I've not seen this quality in an English striker, since Rooney was in his prime.

The issue with Rooney is that how long can he keep scoring goals? Is this his final purple patch or will he continue scoring goals. 
To compare:
Rooney: 7 league goals this season
Vardy: 18 league goals this season

10575~~~
At the end of his contract would not be giving up the millions it would by taking a pay cut and moving before it runs out, thats what he wont do. And I think it was John o'shea said in his book that after Rooney wanted to leave "because of a lack of ambition by the club", IE, my teammates are shit so get me some better ones or Im off, he strolled into training and said it was purely an exercise to get a wage hike. Thats who he threw under the bus.

10576~~~
This would be quite lame. If you ever get across the quotes about that, would appreciate it!

10577~~~
Ive been looking since I posted it but cant find any, Im certain Ive read it but then my memory isnt my best feature, hopefully anyone else who remembers it can find it

10578~~~
Yeah, don't make us read John O'Shea's biography!







I kid, I kid, Sheazzy.

Still can't believe we allowed this new deal to happen under Moyes

10583~~~
Thank god the dressing room couldn't or didn't read the pinings of some of the United faithful on here at the time that Rooney and his shit agent decided to call into question the wisdom of us replacing Cristiano Ronaldo with Antonio Valencia.

10586~~~
It wasn't as bad as the five year £120k a week deal he gave to Nani and then never played him.

10587~~~
The way we've run things so far as been so messy

10588~~~
Could very easily have been sent off for the raking challenge on Cattermole's Achilles tendon. Let alone the clear penalty he should have given away too for a second yellow. 

Thankfully the ref is being extremely kind to him (& us).

10589~~~
He really needs to go.  We need a proper striker who can hold the ball up.

10590~~~
the day he fecks off from this football club will be one of the best days in my life, back to his worst. Give Will a chance!

10591~~~
Rubbish today.

10592~~~
Offered nothing all game.

10593~~~
Captain.

10594~~~
Shit

10595~~~
Terrible post. Just my opinion.

10596~~~
Didn't take that long to revert back to type. fecking dire

10597~~~
I've defended him for a while, but today's the day it's finally snapped for me.

fecking hell this is a terrible performance. Can't even control the ball ffs.

10598~~~
Not leading the line and offering no goal threat yet he plays the full 90 again.

10599~~~
The luck on this fella. Can't think of anyone else who is more lucky than him in the entire league.

10600~~~
He's back!

10601~~~
I thought he showed a lot of effort and determination. Unfortunately barely any quality.

10602~~~
Love giving him a telling to, was the highlight of the match for me.

The purple patch has ended.

10603~~~
His link up play is shocking.

10604~~~
When you are looking on enviously at Jermain Defoe's hold up play...

10605~~~
I missed the game, was he at Lewandowski level once again?

10606~~~
His movement is a world apart from Rooney's. It's saddening really.

10607~~~
Poor today, but there were others that were worse.

10608~~~
Come on China, take this donkey away from us.

10609~~~
The really important thing is that Rooney will break Charlton's record. Who the feck cares about tropheys or playing in the CL? Feck off, you Rooney haters.

10610~~~
And Defoe was carrying an injury.

10611~~~
Then he got you fooled. He does that every match. He walks around the pitch for 80 minutes, then starts sprinting around "trying to make things" happen in the last ten minutes. He did nothing the entire match, except give the ball away. Just re-watch the match and notice it, or simply notice it next match because it happens every bleeding match.

10612~~~
If Lewandowski had the flu and suffering from Tourettes, then yes.

10613~~~
He's awful. It just boggles the mind. I can't fathom how he's afforded chance after chance.

10614~~~
Back to his usual level this season..

This may sound unfair, and there are other culprits aswell, but keeping Rooney is a lone striker is a huge reason for our problems imo. Any striker worth his salt, has either hold up play, pace or good technical ability, the current Rooney has none of those and it really hurts us in attack. He can't hold of defenders, he never makes any clever moves and we all know his dribbling is just abysmal

Then we have Lingaard on the left who is hit and miss to put it lightly and Mata who i would consider a fair weather player, which leaves poor Martial to do all the work

10615~~~
Spot on

10616~~~
Why Tourette's? Lol

10617~~~
Best thing he did all day was track back faster than Memphis to prove just how lazy the latter is. Still not really the point of your centre forward mind.

10618~~~
It's not at all unfair. Having a striker with no hold up play, poor link up play, doesn't run in behind, can't beat a defender and is woeful in the air is always going to hinder your attack. That's what he is, a hindrance.

10619~~~
inspiring words after the game from the captain

10620~~~
I said this some months ago. We need to drop Rooney and start thinking ahead. Today again, it felt like playing a 4-6-0 formation. We are really wasting Martial out wide just to accommodate Rooney who wouldn't play as a striker. I can only imagine if we had played with a front 3 of Lingard, Mata and Memphis with Martial ahead of them, there are chances that despite them being relatively young, the game time would have done a world of good and they surely couldn't have been as bad as the senior players. Also the the amount of pace they would have provided would have seen us over the line a few times too.

10621~~~
If we're to truly evolve into a good team, he needs to be sold. Enough is enough. It gets to a point when it's good for both player and club for them to part ways. That period had arrived a long time ago.

10622~~~
Any game where a team packs the defense tightly and he needs to operate as an attacking fulcrum will see this type of performance from him, the touch, strength and skill are not there for it and he doesn't have the pace to get on the last shoulder and pressure CB's to offer a threat that way. As the second half went on he seemed to abandon his role and started to drop deeper which also crowded out Mata.

10623~~~
Mourinho will ultimately fail if he sticks with him.

10624~~~
That's a shame, I was almost convinced that he is back after those Lewandowski comparisions here.

10625~~~
Who made them? Is that for real?

10626~~~
Cheers steve

10627~~~
Have you seen him receive the ball or try to make a simple pass?

10628~~~
Not sure if serious, but he has never been a similar player to Lewandowski, and the gulf between them in class at present is that of the Grand Canyon.

10629~~~
What did it say?

10630~~~
If Lewandowski were fat, slow, unable to control a ball, measure passes then yes.

10631~~~
There was lot of praise lately even though his all around play was still crap and someone actually said something like that he was playing at equal level to Lewandowski in one or two games, or that his all around play was equally good, can't remember the best, but it was definitely one of those two, and both are ridiculous claims.

10632~~~
There's always an excuse for Rooney - he wasn't the only one who was rubbish, but when was he the only player who stood  out positively and really carried the team? Smelling did that, as does DDG and Martial, but I can't recall the last time Rooney did.

10633~~~
It was a conversation between me and Snow, he said Rooney's level in those games was on par with an average level Lewandowski performance, not his best level.

10634~~~
They're back

10635~~~
If he has an ounce of respect for us, he'll voluntarily choose to leave in the summer. Expecting him to accept a huge fee from China as an apology to the club and fans for the past few seasons may be far fetched though.

He's not going to break the record this season. He may well want to stay on till he does.

10636~~~
Good post.

But what annoys me is his lack of discipline. Hes our centre forward, but how much time does he spend leading the line? How much does he drop back? Even his booking, it was because he dropped close to half way line, mis controlled a ball thrown to him and he has to foul the player on the half way line.

Hes basically a big reason for our decline. Its not unfair to say, with the way were paying him and treating him like Ronaldo and Messi, he really should be performing like them. And not just three or four games a season, he should be carrying us, not only to top for but carrying us to the title.

10637~~~
Hold up play and runs down the channels - non existent.  Kudos to him for his recent goalscoring form, but if he is an automatic starter next season, we're achieving nothing.

Might explain why he still plays - he wakes up the next day thinking - hey, I was pretty great yesterday, and LVG has simply told him not to watch the match on the TV. Makes sense

10643~~~
Sack Wayne play Will.

10644~~~
We're not, but Sunderland might, so there's always a silver lining, for those who enjoy the awful football Sunderland plays, that is.

10645~~~
Nah, you were right about Snow too.

10646~~~
This guy is as much to blame for our disappointing season as van gaal is IMHO 

Maybe you could argue that lvg is more culpable given he keeps picking Wayne but the second moyes delivered that fat contract we were left with little choice but to build around him for the next few years. 

If saf had stayed on he'd be stealing a living in the championship by now

10647~~~
Rooney being the White Pele has to be one of the most inaccurate nicknames in football.

10648~~~
Lewandowski aspires to be at Rooney's level.



Only his financial level tbf.

10649~~~
I'm not following

10650~~~
Much better than he was earlier in the season, he actually plays like a footballer these days. With his form coming in I can't begrudge him his largely underwhelming performance today. He wasn't alert, wasn't making runs and when he came deep wasn't doing much. I think I remember his touch letting him down on a cross and that early chance he wasted.

10651~~~
Yes but not getting the link?

10652~~~
Sudden, involuntary movements - its not just about swearing, although he does seem to do that quite randomly.

10653~~~
My heart sinks as soon as he looks to receive the ball in the build up of a promising move. Just stay in the fecking box.

10654~~~
that top 4 is very difficult and likely best route via Europa

10655~~~
Way to motivate there captain pugwash

10656~~~
its actually pissed me off more than the result. its mid feb and the captain says yeah we cant compete with Spurs and Leicester City

10657~~~
Yet I'm sure ha doesn't believe any of it is down to him being one of the worst players in the league for half the season. He should be ashamed to take his pay.

10658~~~
Shackles back on, I presume.

10659~~~
They should be and then thrown off a bridge

10660~~~
Let's look at it objectively. How do expect a team that has him as its captain, playing every game for 90mins to actually perform and be in the top 4?

10661~~~
He didn't even have a shot on goal today did he? I appreciate him coming out at the end and giving a fairly honest assessment but he was one of the worst players out there for us.

10662~~~
He should go to China

10663~~~
1 shot. 25+ yards. Missed.

Another easy 300k for Wayne.

10667~~~
Purple patch over, and since the rest of the team decided being crap again no wonder there's no impact whatsoever from him. 

Must sell him in the summer and find proper number 9, or just give Martial chance up-front!

10668~~~
Make a change from the Chinese I suppose

10669~~~
Highest paid player in the league. Fourth highest in world football. And nobody should give me the crap about selling shirts.

Wayne Rooney was critical of Manchester United and fears for their top-four chances after losing to Sunderland.

Rooney played the full 90 minutes at the Stadium of Light, registering just one shot as United struggled to break down the worst defence in the Premier League.

Sunderland were the better side, with Wahbi Khazri and Lamine Kone cancelling out Anthony Martial’s equaliser to earn a crucial three points in their battle against relegation.

“We didn’t create enough chances, we weren’t aggressive enough and it has cost us not defending set pieces so it’s a disappointing result,” Rooney told MUTV after the game.

“We didn’t play well today, we know that, we didn’t win enough second balls and all that coming together has cost us and it is not good enough.”

United remain six points behind fourth-placed Manchester City in the race for Champions League qualification, and captain Rooney admits that making the top four is now “difficult”.

“It will be difficult to qualify for the Champions League and the top four now, we know that, so it’s a sad day in terms of losing three points and we have to somehow move on,” Rooney told BT Sport.

“You don’t know how this Premier League works right now, but we know it will be difficult to finish in the top four and [winning] the Europa League might be the best chance [of qualifying for the Champions League], but that is a long way away.

“It’s a competition we didn’t necessarily want to be in, but we are and we want to win it. Every game is a big game for us and we have to start again on Thursday.”

10671~~~
Its difficult to create chances when our alleged no. 9 is constantly arsing about on the halfway line offering no focal point for the team you spud faced waste of space.

10672~~~
What exactly does he mean by "You don't know how this Premier League works right now..."? Has he genuinely forgotten how football works? It could explain the shit sandwich he's been serving up for a long time now.

10673~~~
If only was that simple. 

Truth is that this team generally lack confidence and direction, Rooney plays his part by being really ineffective, but since there's no movement around him what do you expect of him, to stay up front and wait for the long ball galore like we've seen in some matches?

Neither is he good enough anymore to lead the line, neither are the rest of the players (apart from Martial) good enough in creating anything positive in final third.

Imagine Martial up-front by himself waiting for something to happen while Depay, Lingard and Mata dick around the centre of the pitch, and when he finally gets the ball there's no one in support and he's being crowded.

Our problems are much deeper than just Wayne Rooney, no matter how hard you must think it's everything his fault, really isn't.

10674~~~
Can't blame Rooney today

He was feeding off scraps.  He has not been great this year but a striker needs chances to score goals and as the tip of our arrow, he's getting no service whatsoever.

10675~~~
A team that reflects its captain. It's not at hard to understand. The club is just shite and until we do what is necessary, nothing will change. If the club thinks Rooney will turn back the clock just because Mourinho is here,Nathan they have another thing coming.

10676~~~
As the lone striker he needs to hold the ball up and act as a fulcrum for the attack, he failed miserably at that today and in the end gave up and drifted too deep, there's more to the striker role than just scoring goals.

10677~~~
Not in our current formation and strategy.  I just remember a mindless mid table midfield scrap today.  And as Rooney said, we lost way too many 2nd balls in that scrap to assert any kind of threat.  There were very few break always where Rooney had the chance to do as you suggest.

10678~~~
The ball was played into him numerous times where his touch took him away from goal and stalled any potential forward momentum or the CM/CB simply brushed him off it.

10679~~~
Maybe I was in a mid match snooze which is a regular occurrence these days!

10680~~~
I don't blame him for defeat, that would be stupid, not his fault we can't mark players on set pieces. But blame him for playing without passion and intent.

Here's what I think: he's not good enough anymore to lead the line and serve as focal point of our attack and at the same time our attacking play in final third in almost non-existent (take Martial out of the team and there's no penetration at all). He can't create anything on his own anymore, and the rest of the team don't create chances from which he could score (as seen recently). Our team is a complete mess, not just Rooney, but somehow he's only one getting the blame (captain, wages, name calling etc.) while for others there are always some kind of excuses.

10681~~~
He just doesn't have any answers when there is little space except to drift around looking for space which only compounds the problem.

10682~~~
Sometimes it really is that 'simple' though.

We're not expecting Rooney to dribble deep from 40 yards and take 2-3 players with him but you should expect good hold up play and ability to keep ball/hold position. Look at Defoe being older and half the size of Smalling yet giving him a hard time with his back to the goal.

It's those intangible things that gives more confidence to yourself and your teammates to play more progressive football. Intangible things like:

1) 'oh there's Wazza, I'll play this one-two with him and 7 out of 10 times I will get a decent ball back', or

2) 'oh there's Wazza, I'll zip this ball to his feet, maybe he can turn and play a pass or make a shot, then I can run past him and create space (for him or myself)', or

3) 'oh look Wazza is in midfield, I'll dash pass him and expect a ball through the middle (the most direct way to goal)', or

4) 'oh look Wazza is dashing from up front to the channel (therefore dragging a defender with him/creating space) so it frees space for me or others to run into'

etc etc.

Yet we all know those things don't happen, he doesn't play effective direct football himself and as the focal point of our attack he effectively blunts our entire line because he also chooses to get involved in everything too.

He is trash right now and there's no denying that. He needs to go regardless and absolutely deserves the criticism regardless of how he compares to his current team mates (at least they can say they have potential/haven't had 2 solid years of turd performances).

If he could do those things I've mentioned I'd guarantee the performances of all our other players would improve. Look at Mata's decent but ineffective performance (in the 2nd half) today. If we had 11 performances like that we wouldn't be much better but we would definitely be better and that would be progress.

Rooney is a streaky player and he doesn't have a consistent set of tangibles or the mental strength/discipline to be able to give his team mates confidence or something to build from.

His top level is world class but unfortunately his bottom level is Sunday league and thus his average is not Utd worthy.

10683~~~
36 points left to play for. 

How can he/team be done for the season?

WTF.

10684~~~
Very strange to give up on top 4 so soon. Guess the players have lost faith just like we have which makes it even more baffling that LVG still has the job.

10685~~~
You're not wrong, it would be brilliant if he had a world class player up-front who's capable of bringing others in the play.

But how can you expect from one player to lift whole team performances when other players in our team play with fear from making mistakes and with zero confidence?

It works both ways, you need proper world class player up-front who's able to bring others into the play, but you also need from other players to stretch the play not just pass ball around without proper movement.

IMO Rooney is passed it, but you could put anyone else up-front atm and it still wouldn't make a difference since our whole team set-up is wrong (hello LVG).

He deserves criticism for his play, but so do others, and mostly our "brilliant" manager since there are too many players in this team that don't play even close to their true potential (Depay, Herrera, Mata, Morgan, Bastian, etc.) who aren't all on decline like Rooney is.

10686~~~
Rooney starts criticising when his form improves, these modern footballers all they think about is themselves

10687~~~
He had chance early on and it was a good chance to score, he just waited for the ball to come down and it was a mistake, most of the strikers would hit it midair, as for the overall performance you'd expect he can make a single successful pass to his teammates, can control a football and hold the ball up front a bit, the game missed him which is also partially his mistake, he cant make runs what other players do however he cant be excused for his lack of very basic skills footballer should have. Once again by far the worst player on the pitch. Should be out of the club post Fergie. He declined to championship level at best, let alone his doing captain for the biggest club in the world.. If he didnt have such big name on the back of his jersey he would be sold many  years ago... 

the most annoying thingto me is how indulgent media and commentators are to him, horrible performance after horrible one and he's praised for very basic things I mentioned should be granted and they never talk about how he screwed this and that rather give attention to other players like yesterday when Love made a good run and rooney simply fecked the pass to him and they were debating how Love was slowed down by a defender... FFS! Really sick of this shit, sick of him and like some others here mentioned, players might still believe he's capable of things and automatically see him on the pitch but the fact is he's just unable to make anything happen he's done and unless they figure out this and we finally kick his arse out of this club we will not win anything. Dont wanna use words like cancer but he's like that, unless he's gone we will depend on him on an off the pitch. If Van Gaal realized he's shit and bought a decent striker instead of relying on him we would have been much better this season.

Hopefully China/MLS clubs will come for him asap because I am sick everytime I see this done player wearing the red jersey with the armband..

10688~~~
I actually think he's been unfairly pilloried after yesterday's game. Looked quite sharp.

I haven't heard of a sharp centre forward who can't beat defenders, offers no hold-up play and no pace up front. Besides, he messed up the chance he had immediately after Sunderland's first goal. He was rubbish for a star forward. Nowadays he struggles to outperform Defoe.

10693~~~
this is the state it has reached, not fecking up is lauded. SUNDERLAND

10694~~~
People often underestimate the importance of being secure at both ends of the pitch; the forward position and GK position. Even Fergie knew the importance which is why he always looked for the best available GK and best strike force. Before we start talking about Rooney feeding off scraps,  the question is whether he is a good enough striker for United. We look at City,  Leicester,  Arsenal,  Spurs,  Everton etc these teams have a solid enough GK and have a solid CF to look too when things aren't going great. Guess the difference between them and us?  The CF position. Having solid options at both ends almost means the middle will pick up their game. 
As much as most want LvG out,  things are unlikely to change with Rooney.

10695~~~
Good luck England fans

10696~~~
Somebody with some video editing ability should really make a video of just how many times Rooney miss-controls easy passes into him, fumbles over the ball, plays 5 yard passes 2 feet behind the intended player, doesn't make any attempt to get on the end of the glut of excellent balls we've been playing in-between keeper and defence in the last few weeks, etc etc etc.

He is a shambles. This myth of his recent "form" annoys me no end, hearing how he's back in form and scoring goals. He's been scoring penalties (that by rights Mata should have been taking if he was on the pitch like he should have been), a tap in and granted one good finish. Problem is everything else he touches in those games turns to shite.

All these ex-players doing commentating and punditry dont help either. Think it was Danny Murphy commentating a game a few weeks ago. He was describing Rooney's control with superlatives like exceptional, phenomenal and sensational while im watching him miss-control a perfect 5 yard pass into his feet while he's under no pressure.

And still, still, this morning i watched a clip on the BBC Sport website about who Chris Sutton and Trevor Sinclair in the United team you would keep, Martial first name, Rooney second, and they had to be prompted to remember who De Gea was. What hallucinogenic drugs are all these pundits and ex-players on??

10697~~~
How else would they get on Colleen's xmas list? Rooney is a wealthy guy, you know?

10698~~~
Quoted for truth.

10699~~~
The one yesterday cracked me up when he ended one of our more promising moves by playing the ball a good yard at least behind Love and the commentators described it as "Rooney almost squeezes it through." No, there was no squeezing, there was a simple pass fecked up.

My favourite piece of Rooney media bias remains Herrera's goal, I think it was in the FA Cup last season. The one he bent it into the bottom corner from the edge of the box, Rooney was offside and moved out of the way of the shot. The analysis of this? Not one mention of Herrera but praising Rooney as a genius for simply not getting hit with the ball. It was Phil Neville doing the analysis.

10700~~~
There was one lay off Rooney did, and Murphy did actually gasp a cum noise

10701~~~
It's sad to see how far Rooney has declined over the last 4-5 seasons.  Sure, he's had 3, perhaps 4, decent -- but hardly fantastic -- matches this season, but that's nowhere near good enough for a player of his supposed caliber.

10702~~~
With the wages he is on he really should be moved on in the summer, you can't be on that kind of Money and play like he does.
It doesn't matter what position he plays either, he can still score goals but his allround game is very poor these days.

10703~~~
Aguero had a poor game last night, but if Rooney performed like that the praise he would be given would be astronomical.

10704~~~
No one would argue that our current woes are his fault alone, that would be insane, but he has to take a big part of the blame here. 

Rooney plays as our only CF, which is hard to believe unless you watch the line up, because he seems to spend 90% of the match out of position. Then when you add in that his movement up front is also non existent, we become incredibly easy to defend against. Martial and Lingaard moves a lot, the problem is that they are usually hugging the touchline, so when they get the ball their only targets are usually Rooney and Mata in a box crowded with defenders. Again, very easy to defend against

Rooney is our captain and one of the highest earners in world football, which would imply hes the one who should carry the team through the rough patches. The reality though, is that he has done none of the like, and has been a complete passenger in a side that has struggled all season. When you then add in Van Gaal's shit on a stick "philosophy" which suffocates any creativity and attacking incentive, this is what you get: A supposed "top club" being bottom in chances created and shots on target in the whole league

10705~~~
Against the likes of Newcastle and Derby County

10706~~~
I've said numerous times he clearly passed and should be replaced, there's no denying that, being only striker in the team yet coming with such poor displays and scoring record is pathetic really.

But what's the worst, you can put anyone else there instead of him and it wouldn't make a difference, not in a long run since other players apart from Martial aren't good enough and LVG philosophy which you've said kills creativity in the start.

Maybe I'm harsh, spolied or whatever but only De Gea, Martial, Shaw before injurie and Smalling at times are players worth of United shirt, the rest of them are lucky for being here or just good enough to play at the highest level which is not something you expect from United player!

10707~~~
Sadly, nothing is going to change as long as the media, fans, pundits, former players keep heralding him as the next best thing.

10708~~~
As a Welshman I'm delighted to hear that rooneys place is secure for the summer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10709~~~
Just in time for the release of the <i>Dad's Army</i> film too. Fitting.

10710~~~
But Aguero is not the face of Manchester City as much as Wayne is the face of United. Everyone knows that's the important thing these days.

10711~~~
Oh Wayne <b>IS </b>the face of United alright, no mistake; slow, ponderous, shit, inconsistent, piss poor scoring record, and uncreative.

10712~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10713~~~
Sorry if this has been mentioned elsewhere: ESPN claim that Rooney isn't travelling to Midtjylland.

10714~~~
More than a claim.

10715~~~
Yeah sky and talksport too.

10716~~~
Typical Rooney loving. Rooney misses an away Europa League game to some team in Denmark and it's grand news on every outlet. What would we do without him?

10717~~~
Well he's one of 2 senior strikers we have available, plus he's our captain, and the most experienced player in the team (appearances for United) 
So understandably if he's missing, or worse, injured it's going to create some news. 

The only reason its on every outlet is because United are the team that opposition fans care about also, so for journalists it makes sense to centre most articles about us.

10718~~~
Red zone?

10719~~~
It usually takes him about 10 games to pick up form after an injury so we've probably seen the best of him this season.

10720~~~
Step up Martial.

10721~~~
Dont know about the best, but hopefully the last.

10722~~~
He's only not travelling because even he can't afford the ticket prices for travelling fans at FC Midgitland!

10723~~~
Well now Rooney is out injured. Great news. I hope it's not more than a week or two because we have only got 1 first team striker. Well now it gives Will Keane a chance. I would probably be more annoyed if I felt we had something to play for but, our season is pretty much over already.

10724~~~
Why are people saying he's feeding on scraps?

KFC, kebabs, cakes, beer and tobacco more like.

10725~~~
He'll need 10 games to get back into form <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10726~~~
Thats wildly optimistic

10727~~~
I don't even think China can save us from him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10728~~~
Martial 

Memphis
Mata
Januzaj / Pereira would be my 1st choice.

10729~~~

10730~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

But in all seriousness, I think we're cursed

10731~~~
Just play Martial and Memphis up top and counterattack like we did against Arsenal away last year and like Leicester have been doing this year.

I'm willing to bet anything that we will win more games. It is not like the current approach is working out brilliantly.

10732~~~
Oh shit.

He was starting to play well again. Now we're left with.... Will Keane as our 9?

Or will he move Martial there and give Memphis another try.

10733~~~
Reported to be out 1-2 months with a knee injury.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/clubs/manchesterunited/article4692719.ece" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/clubs/manchesterunited/article4692719.ece</a>

10734~~~
He's done well in January, but he was back to his usual shit performances in the last couple of games. Couldn't care less that he's injured.

10735~~~
Definitely not sold on Martial as a true CF in the premier league. Not yet at least. 

Such poor squad planning.

10736~~~
Times saying he's out for 1-2 months. Time for Memphis to step up.

10737~~~
Don't you mean Fellaini? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

10738~~~
Yeah the rest of the media going with this too. Out for a couple of months. That in itself isn't a problem for us, his lack of a replacement is. How can we leave ourselves in a position where Rooney gets injured and we have no one who can replace him? Ridiculous.

10739~~~
Martial's his replacement. With Depay or Lindgard coming in for Martial.

10740~~~
Hopefully Januzaj and Pereira are given some minutes now.

10741~~~
Final nail in the top 4 coffin

10742~~~
Wouldn't want to move Martial central as he's been doing brilliantly coming in from the left, we would also lose our only creative outlet, he won't have as much room to dribble playing upfront.

10743~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

10744~~~
Van Gail was a big failure already but this might be a golden get out of jail excuse for him "I didn't have my main striker for two months"

Woodward might actually buy it and renew his contract. This is beyond jokes now. Don't even know what's worse a chairman who's clueless or a deluded failure of a manager.

10745~~~
He actually did plenty of dribbling when he was playing through the middle anyway

10746~~~
But yeah it's madness that we only have 2 established strikers in the squad, it's really poor management.

10747~~~
He'd be assassinated

10748~~~
no. they give the ball away too much. ashley young and valencia can and will do the job.

10749~~~
He won't be getting the same amount of space he's been getting out wide against teams that pack their midfields.

10750~~~

10751~~~
You just know it'll take like another 3 months for him to get back on form once he comes back from injury.

10752~~~
I agree, but if you cast your mind back, he tended to drift out wide to create space for himself, which tended to create space for others. Plus his hold up play is also quite good.

10753~~~
Not for me. Martial is a left forward, not convinced by him up front at all. We don't have an out and out forward to come in unless we are looking to the young lads,  it's ridiculous.

10754~~~
Throw the dice and let Keane play centrally flanked by Martial and whoever wastes the least amount of space on the right with Mata behind. Memphis should stay away from starting matches until next year. He's a complete liability.

10755~~~
Can we recall James Wilson from his loan?

10756~~~
It's possible we won't see the best of Rooney again this season knowing how long it takes him to regain form.

...Imagine if he is to be sold in the summer as well. Could come back in April, score the 5 or 6 goals needed to break Bobby's record and then that'll be that. No more Wayne Rooney. Off to China for crazy money.

10757~~~
I think it's a blessing.

We can see how the team fares without him for a run of games, and what influence it will have on our style of play.

The season is almost over and it presents others with a chance to step up. Either Keane comes in as a target man and grabs his chance, or Martial plays through the middle and Memphis takes up his preferred position as an inside forward.

10758~~~
We'll probably see more of Depay on the wing and Martial up top with no Rooney. Watch us start playing real football and it saves LVG's job.

10759~~~
This season is pretty much a write-off and it's a good opportunity for other players: Memphis, Keane, Januzaj

10760~~~
Didn't have a hope with him anyway. Let's blood Martial at CF.  Depay needs to seize his chance, but doubt it.  Adnan maybe?

10761~~~
Can't believe we never played Depay as the striker again after the Watford game, maybe he'll get the chance now, although Martial on the left, and Depay up front won't go down well with a lot of fans, might work though.

10762~~~
Can't see him taking Sir Bobby's record this season now, and who knows what will happen with him in the summer? This purple patch he's just gone through may well have been his chance. Shame.

10763~~~
Has to be a chance he'll be sold in the summer.

My hope that he'll not break Sir Bobby's record might come true just yet.

10764~~~
We had this bout of optimism the last time he was injured. We played fecking shite. Martial is still better on the left as far as I'm concerned.

10765~~~

10766~~~
Another ready made excuse for Wayne to use for when he inevitably stinks up the Euro's. Cannot wait to see the back of him.

10767~~~
Depay

10768~~~
Its a blessing,  but wanted him to break the record this season so he can be moved on in the summer, no chance of him leaving without breaking it.

Anyway now we get to see the team play which is not solely focused on Rooney

10769~~~
Januzaj & Memphis on the left.
Martial up top.

I'd like to see Herrera back in the team as part of a midfield 3 too.

10770~~~
Out for 2 months

10771~~~
What form? He's been pretty consistently shit for like a year now.

10772~~~
By getting back on form I mean playing less shit than usual. You have to admit he's got a decent record in 2016.

10773~~~
-----------------Martial---------------
Memphis--------Mata--------Januzaj

Might be interesting. Obviously there's zero chance of this though. It'll be Mata and Lingard or something on the flanks....

10774~~~
It was a purple patch He was back to his normal self right after that. We were probably going to have to wait another 12 months for that anyways.

His last run of form was actually around the same time last season - for about 6 weeks through the end of November and December 2014.

10775~~~
Knee ligament injuries usually feck up a player's mobility. Imagine a more immobile Rooney leading our line next season?

10776~~~
i cant imagine any clubs taking a risk on a nearly 31 year old, and already slowing, Rooney coming back from a serious knee injury on £250k a week. 

Best we can hope is that we sign his replacement and he's phased out. 


Or China. Come on China.

10777~~~
United won't miss Rooney a lot, we were sinking already with him in the team. He wasn't really back anyway (he had only 2 really good games vs Newcastle and Stoke, the rest were average/poor performances). Before he regained some form, we were 9 points off Leicester and 5 points off Spurs. Now, we are 12 points off Leicester and 10 points off Spurs. In other words, his recent form didn't make any real difference in the league. We won't be better without him because LVG, as he himself admitted, put all his money on Rooney and didn't buy any experienced striker. I'm not sure that Martial can play well so many games without being rested. Smalling must be in the red zone, too. Won't be pretty. It was incredibly stupid to think that we can compete only with one experienced striker all season (all the more considering his shit form from the last months of last season) and with such a small squad. LVG is crazy.

10778~~~
No, it's just a decent record in January. A broken clock is correct twice a day.

10779~~~
It's really difficult to be less mobile and play as a forward in premierleague.

10780~~~
That is a major ass, as ideally he'd whip through that, and it would free him up to make a move elsewhere if agreed with any new manager wanting to go in a different direction.

You don't leave Man Utd 5/6 goals short of an all time record however much dough is being offered elsewhere

10781~~~
A shame he's injured. Such a crucial time too. Guess we'll Martial up top now, with Pereira, Januzaj or Depay on the left. Although I'd like to see Martial continue on the left, with Will Keane up top.

10782~~~
That should be the end of him as the main man at United. A top class striker is a priority in the summer, with Martial/Rooney being second choice. 

I'd love someone like Cavani. He's a perfect Mourinho type striker as well.

10783~~~
nobody at the club has the balls to call time on him.

10784~~~
LvG would still give him a game if he had to use a mobility scooter.

10785~~~
Brave Wayne sacrificed himself so that we might live.

10786~~~
Ah! Let's give a stand to Sir Wayne Rooney The Brave!

10787~~~
Because he's the hero MUFC deserves, but not the one it needs right now, so we'll hate him. 

Because he can take it, because he's not a hero. He's a <b>silent guardian</b>, 

a watchful protector, 

a <b>Dark Knight,</b>
<b>
a White Pele.</b>

10794~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

How long will the media push this narrative

10795~~~
Martial working well outwide, its the only part of the attack that is, let's keep him there.

Let's try a few different set ups

-----------------Memphis------------------
Martial---------Mata---------Januzaj

-----------------Memphis------------------
Martial--------Pereira-------Januzaj

-------------------Januzaj------------------
Martial----------Mata---------Wilson*

-------------------Januzaj------------------
Martial--------Pereira--------Wilson*

* obviously would need to bring him back

Lingard and Keane as back up (+ Pereira and Memphis depending on set up)

10796~~~
Bravely bold Sir Wayne
Rode forth from Old Trafford
He was not afraid to lose
Oh, brave Sir Wayne
He was not at all afraid
To be beaten by Sunderland
Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Wayne

10797~~~
I was half asleep but when MOTD did their bit at the end about the morning papers there was something about Rooney maybe needing an operation on his knee.

10798~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CcTZrA9XIAAiKqR.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CcTZrA9XIAAiKqR.jpg"/>

10799~~~
He rushes back after a month, he'll do the same injury again but possibly worse. His ligaments have got to be 110% before he starts any physical training.

10800~~~
He's not really injured - he's so depressed by his alcoholism that he started drinking again due to depression over his drinking.

10801~~~
Funny you mention that, Carl Frampton said he was "half juiced" in his post-fight press conference from last night too...

(11 mins 5 seconds)

<span style="color: #ffffff">He's allowed to have a drink, of course. It's not like he had a game to play the next day given his condition.</span>

10802~~~
It's sad how much bitterness and anger there is towards a United legend on here. Guess if he'd just left like our Portugese legend, he'd still be adored on here.

10803~~~
Well, people would be happy to see him feck off, to be honest. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10810~~~
Piers' response to this will be quite funny I imagine.

Edit: It wasn't <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> He's just on full Wenger bashing mode

10811~~~
Up his wage to 500k with the stipulation that he needs to be permanently 'injured'.

10812~~~
First I thought it was Piers who sent him that tweet 'cause of Rashford <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

10813~~~
Or you know, just sell him to China. Cut him loose.

10814~~~
Typical Arsenal fan, only knows one song.

10815~~~
Agreed, its a worry. Hes not our best number 10, and hes not our best at leading the line. Hes been a problem for us bar a little spell in Jan rather than him being a leader bar a few games (where the latter would be more acceptable).

It is time to move him on, but I have a feeling we wont (and its probably cos of the Adidas deal where hes still seen as a superstar and shirt shifter, hence our obsession with purchasing a superstar (which will probably replace him)).

10816~~~
We're stuck with Rooney for another season but that doesn't mean we can't use him as a squad player.

10817~~~
People said Martial made Rooney look like a right dick given his age and adjusting to a new club, league etc.

Along comes Rashford to do the same. An 18 year old no one had heard of prior to last Thursday.

Defend him all you like - it's truly embarrassing and I can only hope this has been a clear indication to our club of what needs to happen with our captain.

Yeah, time to go Wayne. Your times up.

10818~~~
I'm not having a go at I'm. Think there's enough criticism of him already. But I think it's time the club thinks about moving forward without him.

10819~~~
Thought this was an interesting read:

Piers Morgan, <i>Mail Online</i>, 20th February:

10820~~~
I can see him considering the China move, he knows he's coming near the end of his playing career soon and this could be a big windfall to tie him over.
Hopefully Piers Morgan isn't going to play in the testimonial.

10821~~~
If we could get rid of Rooney and also score a big fee in the process it would be a great start to the summer.

10822~~~
If we got a decent offer from China for Rooney we'd be fecking mental not to at least consider it. I know he's our biggest star in a commercial sense but he's clearly past his best and for most of this season he was disgracefully bad.

10823~~~
We would be daft to reject any fee for Rooney, never mind some huge Chinese one.

10824~~~
Aye we can help him decide, a repeat of the first half of the season under Mourinho could see him dropped and getting 'angry and confused' real quick and instructing his agent to book him on the first flight out to Shanghai.

10825~~~
We would be SERIOUSLY DELUDED not to consider any offer!

10826~~~
that's probably the first time someone has dared tell him he is past it. nice one Piers, seeing as our whole club are shit scared to

10827~~~
I'm slightly confused as to why he'd talk to Piers Morgan about his testimonial. I'm even more confused as to why anyone would talk to Piers Morgan about anything.

10828~~~
Too good to be true.

10829~~~
We should bite their hand off on anything over £5.

10830~~~
I can't see him wanting to go to China, even for that ridiculous salary. He's got a young family and is settled in the north west.

10831~~~
Would be delighted if he's off to China. I am not even bothered keeping myself updated on his injury or comeback date, not noticing negative effects without him in the side. Time to improve ourselves and buy some real quality.

10832~~~
I'd quite like to see Phil Jones 'tackle' Piers Morgan.

10833~~~
he would get injured though

10834~~~
I am very happy he's out we dont miss him, hopefully he's fit once the summer transfer window opens

10835~~~
The irony is if he were fit, we might not have beaten Arsenal since "The Captain shall always play" meaning Rashford probably wouldn't have been given his chance to shine.

I'm desperate for Shaw to come back into the side, but Rooney should take all the time he needs, or preferably buy a one-way ticket to the far east <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

10836~~~
wonder if he will have to go through the 40 days and 40 nights of match rhythm all the other players have to get back in

10837~~~
Not sure what the club can do If the player doesn't want to move abroad. Kidnap him and put him on a plane? Wayne wakes up in guangzhou

10838~~~
He'd never go there, with a young family. Even if it is a mental offer I can't see him over there. He'll go to the MLS or try and get a move back to Everton I think.

10839~~~
He's back in the country and off to see Adele with Mata, Carrick and Schneiderlin.

10840~~~
Yet another reason I call him LVB, because he's full of sh1t!

10841~~~
Come'on Steve. You're funny enough as it is, without having to resort to this sort of cheap attention seeking.

10842~~~
China is not Siberia or the Sahara plus 100m pounds sets him up for life.

10843~~~
Van Gaal is working on a new prototype for his third season.

10844~~~
Yeah I find it a bit odd that everyone thinks China is some shithole noone wants to go to. It's been the fastest developing country for a long time (until last year).

10845~~~
He's earning 100m here, why would he leave?

10846~~~
We can rebuild him. We have the technology.

10847~~~
Satire.

10848~~~
What? Even if he was to earn the 300k, which is not guaranteed iirc, he would be getting 78m before tax and given the last three seasons the club and he have had I doubt if he's earned the full amount.

10849~~~
<a class="username" data-user="61068, @itso 7" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61068/">@itso 7</a>  is so shocked that he said it twice.

10850~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10851~~~
"(Without giving too much away, let's just say it included eight noughts) I literally gasped in horror, prompting him to add a final killer blow: 'After tax!'

"'There's another advantage I can see,' I said. 'What's that?' 'The Chinese fans won't realise how slow you've got.' '**** off!' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

"My guess is Rooney won't leave United for another year or two. 

"But one thing's for sure, the Chinese are coming for world football and as with everything they do in business, they seem to have almost limitless sums of cash with which to dominate it."

10852~~~
My dad used to do a lot of business out there, he lived out there for a bit and travelled right around the country before the credit crunch hit. He still thinks it's a shithole outside of the obvious modernity of certain parts of Beijing and Shanghai. Anywhere with pollution like they do is a shithole, and much of the (admittedly massive) country is still undeveloped and very, very poor.

Unless you've been and gone around the country then you can only go off the media which is understandable. Obviously that's just one mans opinion (He didn't think much of India either, sorry) but at least he had experience of it so he can form an opinion. For right or for wrong.

I can't imagine a dyed in the wool scouser with a certain reputation for being thick as feck appreciating China for all it's wonderful culture and the progress they've made when the economy was absolutely booming.

(And yes, this is all sweeping speculation and stereotyping, but that's what we do. China, despite all the money still won't be an attractive proposition for dear Wayne. Though I can still imagine him taking the payday for a bit and then coming back a bit like Drogba/Anelka, albeit their situation was a little bit different with not actually getting paid).

10856~~~
Good news! Harsh. We have hardly been better without him. Martial and Rooney is the best attacking partnership we have IMO.

10857~~~
Football365 finally in the Sun tier.

Such cnuts.

10858~~~
I imagine he'll just be focused on getting back for the Euros to steal a starting spot from Kane or Vardy.

10859~~~
People still think he's at fault for everything?

10860~~~
No, he's just one of several big problems we have.

10861~~~
Think the biggest one is LVG, too many players don't play nowhere neat their ability.

Rooney is past it but our attack is non-existent with or without him up-front.

I am not sure many said that tbf(some have though), but I think it's quite obvious for long now that no matter which players we are playing there won't be much difference in our play. I mean, we played some youth players who are nowhere near ready and they played better than senior players who cost around 30-40m on average. There are also different stats that show we have better record when we don't play Martial, despite him being pretty much our best player. I am not sure you can use anything for granted during van Gaal's time here, even if Rooney was one of our worst player in first half of the season we were still hardly any better when he didn't play. Even during his best form when he was scoring a lot we were still shit, there just isn't any consistency in the team, no matter who plays.

10863~~~
God I really can't stand LVG <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10864~~~
Heart skipped a beat here. Each time I see the Rooney thread bumped I fear he is back!

10865~~~
Actually our record is significantly better with Schweinsteiger in the team than without. Yet he is still pretty much disliked.

We average 1.9 pts in the league with him in the team and 1.2 without him. 1.9 pts a game would give us 55pts, joint second with Spuds. Obviously not a sure and fast way to measure things but it suggests he makes a difference.

10866~~~
I hope he's not too injured....









....don't want him failing his medical in China.

10867~~~
What? Who dislikes BFS? I want names.

Anyone who doesn't like Basti is cordially invited to come and headbutt my fist.

10868~~~
Venture into the BFS performance thread!

10869~~~
Scumbag headline. I would imagine he'll be taking it easy with the rehab to get back to the Euros, don't want him to really rush it and go in underdone but he'll probably be gash after this injury layoff. Feel sorry for him to be honest, he always gets these injuries right before major tournaments.

10870~~~
This one actually could be very helpful to him regarding the tournament if he returns on time. If he was fit all the time van Gaal would play him in every game without any rest and he would be exhausted when the summer comes.

10871~~~
Just had a glance at the last two pages or so.

URGH.

10872~~~
Yeah true, he needs a run of about 5 or 6 games before he's on. Still have a theory that he's been taking it easy this season to avoid any serious injuries. With his track record of being knifed before major tournaments I don't really blame him if that is true.

10873~~~
I do. We pay his wages not England and as such should be his number one priority

10874~~~
You pay his wages?

10875~~~
I can see it now, a Man United star being rushed back quickly for England duty. Sounds pretty familiar

10876~~~
Where do you live? I dont like Schweinsteiger but I dont dislike him as well. I find the Bastian Fecking Schweinsteiger thing and all quite cringey as he has done feck all for our club so far, but there's no reason to dislike him either. He's just meh as United player.

10877~~~
Don't be pedantic. Utd, the club I love and support pay his wages and if he is holding anything back because he is saving it for England he fecking well shouldn't be

10878~~~
Well you said "we" as if it effected you? The guy has given 10+ years of service to the club, I'd be fine with the gaff and even anyone in the background saying not to do anything stupid like get drawn into bone crushing tackles or go in hard on other players, chase down and fight for lost causes. 

I mean, it is probably that nobody knows how to play as a #9 for Van Gaal, but it might be that he wasn't doing anything stupid to jeopardize his Euro place.

10879~~~
I really doubt that he's holding anything back for the Euros. He worked harder than most under Moyes in the 13/14 season before the World Cup which was a more important tournament for him.

10880~~~
you might be fine with him half arsing it for the sake of England but I suspect you are in a very VERY small minority. 
You could well be right and it is the system making him struggle, (personally I think he is finished) but I would expect the same from any player that I would from my colleagues, to do their job to the absolute best of their ability, not to hold something back. How would you feel if you were carrying people who were coasting your job?

10881~~~
And look how that turned out

10882~~~
Well I don't really mean "half arsing" in the way you might think, where he literally plays as soft as he can or takes it easy to get by. I just mean more along the lines of not doing anything overly silly when it comes to fighting for the ball. But it is nothing more than a half baked theory. The Rooney of old would run around like a bull in a china shop and it is obvious we're playing a much more refined "style" now. 

I know the whole "he's definitely finished" argument has been done to death in here so I will be brief, look at Anthony Martial who is similarly trying to play the same role. He's way better physically, sharper on the ball and already much much better than Rooney probably ever was in tight spaces with the ball at his feet. What I've seen from Martial this season at number 9 has been the same kind of ordinary. Isolated, lack of service, literally no support to try and do something out of nothing type of stuff that must be frustrating the b'jesus out of him.

If your young, vibrant and talented young player can rarely look good playing as a striker for Van Gaal, then how can our crap, old, finished veteran striker manage to do the same thing? That is kind of where my "half arsing" theory comes from. Giving it the old "sure Louis (loueeee), stand still and do sod all and wait for the ball no worries mate" type of thing. Not buying fully into the philosophy. But it is a half baked theory, I'm at a point now where I am more in the mindset of "hang on a minute.. There is something not right here....." rather than believing that Rooney is the big problem that needs removal. If he has a good Euro, then comes back and has a belter of a season under a new manager next year? What do we do? Just go "oh well we were wrong then..?" or something? I am not sure to be honest. People love to proclaim the end on here, fair do's to them when they are right but not before.

Yeah I hate people who coast. But I hate little gobshites that are overpaid and under-experienced that coast more than veterans who actually have notable achievements under their belts. Maybe I am just wired differently, no?

10883~~~
Fair points. To be fair I've been waiting to get rid of Rooney since the day he signed so I'm sure you will excuse me being a little ahead of myself in proclaiming him finished <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10884~~~
Haha I think you've mellowed a lot. The fans can proclaim but they can't cash it in until it happens!

10885~~~
I don't blame Wayne for avoiding full-on tackling, so his career might be prolonged; however, that's no good for <i>us</i> (United).

10886~~~
Apparently will return vs Everton.

10887~~~
Yeah so terrible our top scorer would be returning. Should stay injured for the duration of his contract here.

10888~~~
Yeah let's pretend like it wasn't a purple patch in the space of 3/4 weeks in January as the only recognised striker. Why don't tie him down to another 5 year contract

10889~~~
Forget it mate. He supports Wayne Rooney 8 United. Would probably delete his account here when Rooney either fecks off or retires.

10890~~~
Excellent. Still a month and a half of season, and if we pass Liverpool and West Ham, lots to play for.

10891~~~
Remember when him playing was our biggest problem? Ah, I miss those simpler times.

10892~~~
The BT team kept saying we missed him, we really didn't, the last thing we needed was another lumberer with erratic technique.

10893~~~
Gandalf got in the way for the former... but we all know what happened next.

10894~~~
as bad as we are, I  don't find myself waiting on his return

10895~~~
I don't think he'd make a lick of difference, all his return would mean is Rashford to the bench despite being a breath of fresh air to our sluggish, labored attack.

10896~~~
I hope that more and more people can see though now how much LVG has exposed Rooney and left him out to dry.

It's obvious he's lost his turn of pace, he needs good support and lots of good creativity to score his goals.  He is still very good at scoring goals, but he can't create them himself. 

The LVG system has exposed Rooney completely.  Giving him between 0-1 chances per game from 30 yards out is not how Rooney scores goals in his declining years.  Hes a confidence player, give him 5 chances a game and he'll score for 10 games running.

10897~~~
It's not like he's going to be running into space etc, that's arguably what we're missing most.

10898~~~

Gill not too happy about Rooney leaning on him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10900~~~
David Gill <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10901~~~
if Rooney does walk straight back in as expected, It can surely be only one of him and Mata. We look so much better with the pace and running in the team.

10902~~~
Yep agree with you there. Mata did well in the build up for the goal today but he's obviously to light weight for some games so Rooney would be better suited.

10903~~~
I dont think Rooney makes that pass that Mata did for the winner. I think Rooney turns on the ball and looks to spray it out to the wing (on the right) like he normally does.

10904~~~
When Rooney got injured, we were 6 points off 4th. Now, with Rooney being out of the team for 6-7 weeks, we are 1 point off 4th. He ruined the first half of the season with his pathetic record of 2 goals and 1 assist in the league.

10905~~~
agreed. Mata is hot and cold but when he is on it, the triangles start happening. having pace up top stretches the defence, Rooney just plays infront of the defenders now, its easy for them

10906~~~
Will be good to have him back after the break. Obviously he shouldn't play non-stop and regardless of the others. Only one of Mata or Rooney should start as their lack of pace would be exposed a bit. Either have him up top and Rashford right, or Rooney in behind Rashford with Martial on the left. Fellaini of course should just never play. With that, we'll actually have a chance for top 4 and in that fa cup replay I think.

That wasn't Rooney's fault that we were shite (and still are against any shit team). It's van Gaal's style of play. He ditched it late december and early january, and Rooney went on a scoring run.

10907~~~
It'll be Mata who's dropped for him most likely.

10908~~~
It takes him months to find any remote semblance of form, I'm in no hurry to see him back in the team, I really hope we work something out in the summer for him to leave after his testimonial, or at the very least pass on the Captaincy and become a squad player.

10909~~~
To be fair he's better than Mata.

10910~~~
I don't agree with that, especially not as a #10 where close control is so important.

Doesn't matter anyway because it'll be what happens.

10911~~~
It's not that I rate Rooney highly I just think Mata is turgid.

10912~~~
Think Rooney's presence is what gave us the win today.

#leader

10913~~~
Naah, he was terrible. He scored more in January mainly because he improved his form and we played some crap teams (SU, Newcastle, Derby, Stoke were pretty bad on the day, etc.) He was very poor against Liverpool as well but scored the winner and it masked an underwhelming performance. He was crap against Soton too. Rooney has been declining for years. He was crap in the the last months of last season as well. It's not only about the tactics. Rooney was average already during SAF's last season. He had very good 2-3 months under Moyes and then was crap almost for the eintire second half of the season. He has to go.

10914~~~
I agree that he individually was poor, but there wasn't anyone that was good, that's the thing. It's not like when he's poor, everyone else is shining and he's sticking out. Everyone is shite most of the time. And while he is on the decline of course, it doesn't mean that he can't have a positive impact. Just needs more or a squad role here instead of starting constantly.

Also it's blatantly obvious after seeing us without Rooney that he wasn't exactly holding us back. We just aren't good overall with Van Gaal. Rooney in or out of the team hardly makes a difference.

10915~~~
The main thing that works against Mata is his physicality. Rooney is struggling physically and technically. We play much better without him. We have to accept that he is done. We can't afford to sacrifice anyone for him anymore.

10916~~~
Finally found a position for Wayne in terms of fitness levels.

10917~~~
Really should go in the Summer.

10918~~~
Enh, think we should give him his 5 goals first. Man's a legend and I would love to see him get the record.

10919~~~
Long term I agree short term I still think he is better than Mata.

10920~~~
Well, Martial and Smalling were very good in the first half of the season, Schweini was solid too and generally we play better with him in the team. Rooney was pretty bad, arguably our worst player till January. He has scored 0 goals against the current top 4 teams, Rashford scored 3 in 2 games. Could be a coincidence but I think there is more to it, given that Rooney was abject as a striker for the whole 2015 year. 5 league goals from open play, ffs.It's not only about the lack of goals and assists though. Martial's record hasn't been great either but his all-round game has been several notches above Rooney's.

How have you come to the conclusion that Rooney doesn't hold us back? First, we are doing better without him in terms of points per game in the league (we won three big games without him: Liverpool at home, Arsenal at home /scored 3 goals in each game/, City away) and he is supposed to be our talisman! Second, it's a big problem for us that we didn't buy an experienced top striker because of Rooney and had to rely on youngsters, some of them with no experience in the EPL whatsoever. His presence is supposed to make a difference for us and it doesn't (if we discount the negative difference). We'd have been probably better off in terms of points if we had played with Rashford form the start, an younster who was barely known some months ago.

10921~~~
We should bring Dennis Law out of retirement and give him the rest of the goals he needs to overtake Sir Bobby too. What kind of attitude is this? He's had his chances to score the goals he needs, he hasn't done it. We can't keep the dead weight because he'd like a record, if he wanted it that badly he'd have maybe tried to be less shit in recent seasons. His time is clearly up and the club needs to get rid of him as soon as possible. He's had long enough to break the record and hasn't done it.

10922~~~
Totally agree with this.

And the idea that we owe Rooney anything after his behaviour and form in the last few years is silly in my opinion.

10923~~~
Made me laugh but this is spot on.

10924~~~
All the excitement of the past few weeks from the kids playing well has just been killed by the thought of Rooney walking straight back into the team, on zero merit <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10925~~~
Absolutely. Haven't people learned?

10926~~~
Rooney CAN be used in a way to help the team, but don't have much faith in van Gaal changing his ways. Rooney straight back in and I can bet we'll still get the strange subs, rather than making proper use of more attacking options.

10927~~~
This dumbass was supposed to score 20 goals according to LvG. Bullshit. He has transformed in to the worst striker for United. It's his fault he hasn't managed to break the record this season. He has been given all the chances and once he returns he will make Rashford sit on the bench. Not fair.

10928~~~
On a more serious note, the reason Rooney gets such a harsh reaction from caftards is because of his status in the team. If he was treated on merit as everyone else is, and not turned into this demi-God figure that the whole club must bow down to, he'd be seen far more favorably. In fact, he might just add something to the team when he comes back provided he's not in donkey-form again. He could do a job at number 10 at least for what is left of the season, along with Mata, or as a number 9 as Rashford will struggle at times. But it's the idea that this is his team and he walks into it at his leisurely pace whenever he wants to, that grates people.

10929~~~
I mentioned in the other thread that I'd like to think that as a player inside the walls that he can see what Marcus Rashford doing well represents in the grand scope of our season. I know it is naive to think he'll lovingly part with a first team spot just to let the lad run out the season but part of me thinks that with the Euro coming up it would be a pretty good strategy. Rooney the impact sub and to come on for Mata, or start for Mata.

It is blindingly obvious that no player has nailed down the #9 spot this season, Rooney nor Martial. I think what we are seeing is Rashford with a bit of fire pre-vangalization. Literally the lowest specimen in the food chain so he can just play how he feels like playing. The style all season has made a lot of players much much worse and Martial at #9 included. Even with Martials wizardry on the ball he's isolated, rarely gets any chances or service. He's left to feed off scraps and dribble at two and three people down the middle. Something you can't really expect Rooney to do at a high level. It has been an omnishambles from start to finish really.

I think it is best not to try and dissect why people here don't like him. I've not really encountered such bitterness or anything else be it on the internet or in real life and I can only really conclude it is the product of being tied to the Caf raving emotionally driven rubbish about him all day and night.

10930~~~
Yes yes Rooney feeds off scraps blah blah blah. The fact is no way in hall does Rooney score that Rashford goal. He's absolutely no threat in behind. You can also accuse him of not giving the midfielders behind him options because he's so deep all the time. Rooney couldn't get away from Wes Morgan ffs.

10931~~~
There is absolutely no way in hell Rooney accepts being an impact sub. There is more chance of the next Rooney Chavey not having a ridiculous name.

10932~~~
You're probably right. He's not a logical bloke by any stretch of the imagination but looking at the nuts and bolts of it... Euro's coming up, young Manc doing well in the lineup... surely a... "go on lad erm".. Probably a bridge to far I think.

10933~~~
If Rooney was playing upfront then Demichelis would probably have had a fine game. All his horror show moments came from our young quick players sprinting at him, either taking him on like Rashford on putting him under pressure before he expected it like Martial.

10934~~~
If Rooney stays and he is going to start most of the games next season.

 What would you prefer, Rooney as 10 and buy a striker, or sign 10 and play Rooney as our main striker?

10935~~~
#10 regardless of who the manager is. You know if Mourinho comes in he is going to come in with a huge stiffy over getting him scoring goals again. It is basically the enigma machine that needed solving this season. Need to get him arriving late and playing free in the space in the center. This season has showed that playing with no service as a #9 is almost pointless for him. Especially in this league with the physicality. Getting him to drop off the front striker and in the space will do wonders for his all-round game next season in my opinion.

10936~~~
He will still be here next season, especially if Jose is around as he's openly spoke about his admiration for Rooney. Can see him playing him in the number 10

10937~~~
Jose dont want him. That's 3 years ago.  He's pragmatist,  not a romantic, and definitely not blind and dumb

10938~~~
Pretty sure wes Morgan was rated as one of the quickest defenders in the league so you probably should have mentioned Jagielka instead

10939~~~
True. That burst of acceleration while on the ball is something that Rooney isn't capable of. If you look strikers that on the top 5 goalscorer PL chart: Kane, Vardy, Lukaku, Aguero, Mahrez. All have something in common: speed and acceleration.

10940~~~
Rooney can also score goals like the ones against Newcastle that no one else in this squad is capable of.

10941~~~
When was the last time he scored a goal like that though beside that Newcastle one? Once he was capable of hitting 4-5 long distance goals per season but as he got worse in the last 2 years that ability has gone as well.

10942~~~
I hope you're right, Rooney has become our Gerrard but at least Rodgers had the balls to bench him when he became detrimental to the team.

10943~~~

10944~~~
if we ask him nicely do you think he might do it again for us, against a team not getting relegated?

10945~~~
Rooney may not be as influential on the pitch as he used to be, but he's still a very important member to have in the squad. He's a leader on and off the pitch, and always seems to get good feedback from the players within the squad. Players like him and will play for him. 

Apparently, he gave a team talk before the City game to rally the troops, and i looked liked it worked. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/wayne-rooney-motivated-manchester-united-7601111" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/wayne-rooney-motivated-manchester-united-7601111</a>

Not sure what will happen next season. Guess it depends who takes over. I personally think he'll be moved into the 10 position. I think providing he has pace and width around him, he'll do well.

10946~~~
Oh for fecks sake, his PR machine is the best in the game, he's finished as a top player, he shouldn't be anywhere near our starting line-up.

10947~~~
I can't say what will happen, but I can offer my opinion on what should happen.  Wayne has had a great run but he's collapsed as a top level footballer and it's time he be shifted down to a Chinese or MLS league club where he can eek out another season or two as an icon of the game.  

This summer it's time for the board and, apparently, Jose to sell Rooney and be done with it.

10948~~~
Exactly, to borrow that above layout, what we need is this.

<b>New Winger - New 10/AM - Martial
<span style="color: #ffffff">...................- .</span>New Striker</b>

10949~~~
on and off the pitch Wayne? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

10950~~~
The paper he's talking about suing doing fluff pieces for his PR department. Shocking stuff. He is "believed" to have given a speech. What a leader.

10951~~~
Well actually it was confirmed that he did a similar thing last year before the Spurs game after our FA Cup exit against Arsenal. It was said by some players, by manager, so it's kind of stupid to discard it. And that played out rather well.
And of course it's not a big stretch to think he could have done it again this year.

10952~~~
Why don't we hear about Wes Morgan's speech to the Leicester City players who have defied all the odds to be on course to win the EPL title? Just some PR rubbish for a finished player. A Manchester United captain giving a speech before an important match, whoopty doo! I was wondering why there was an influx of comments like "He's so great off the pitch, and the players play for him". Maybe he should just be part of the coaching team and be a mental coach!

10953~~~
Well that's not true, Memphis, Martial, Lingard, and Mata all scored at least one equally impressive goal this season. That's pretty much any of our forwards.

10954~~~
We should give him player/manager role.

10955~~~
It's true that Rooney's wage is too big if we compare to what he has done this season which is not worth it. It's true that Rooney isn't the same Wayne Rooney what we know. But get rid of him this summer will be a big mistake. What we lack right now is an example of experience players, winning mentality and a leader who's been in our club as a good example for our young players especially in our attackers and I think Rooney can offer them to our club at the moment. If we still have the likes of 2012/2013 RVP, Giggs, Rio, Vidic and Evra or may be Evans who had won trophies with us then I wouldn't mind selling Rooney right now for his wage reason. But we don't! and if we ignore his wage, he actually can still do a good job for us, he can still be useful and I personally think he is much better choice to have rather than keeping Mata or Fellaini. People have been saying if we have a great players to support Mata, Mata will be looked much better and effective to be fair so does Rooney. He is not the same player as during his best but if there is a good support behind him he can still score goals. Selling Rooney right now in our current condition is not the right time. IMO the right time is when our young players can finally step up to be a champion.

10956~~~
How disgusting would it be to see Rashford dropped for Rooney. I'd be livid

10957~~~
It's confirmed as news when he actually does lead? Should we not be expecting it off the captain on a regular basis and it not to be news at all as it's part of his job as captain to inspire? It shouldn't be seen as out of the ordinary and something to make a story about. It's a PR fluff piece designed to make it look like he's somehow leading us when we got a big result without him.

10958~~~
"Rashers, score some goals la"

10959~~~
Rashford is already better and more capable striker than Rooney, but we will need someone for rotation role so rooney could help Rashford to have a rest in a busy schedule otherwise start rasher whenever possible, I wouldnt also mind play memphis instead of rooney... if the manager wants to play rooney as no10 instead of better players like Mata/Lingard then I will go mad. Rooney is one of the biggest reasons we are on such a downfall, should be out of the club seasons ago..

10960~~~
I don't like Rooney and hope he won't play for the club for much longer as he is completely past it but there is no way Rashford is currently better than him. Rashford gives us pace and definitely more options in terms of attacking but Rooney is still the better player.

10961~~~
I agree with this. I really want Rooney to leave as well but we still need him and Rooney is still a better player than Rashford. Rashford is still raw but quality.

10962~~~
Rooney may be the better player attribute wise, but I honestly think Rashford serves as the bigger threat upfront, and not to mention plays better alongside Martial.

10963~~~
Don't you find it fascinating that the same paper was a few days earlier firing shots at him with a potentially libelous, daming accusation about theft is now here telling everyone how great his influence is? Talk about the papers being all over the place flinging dung in all directions. No doubt there will be a few chancers getting in the usual digs about his "PR working overtime" etc.

These idiot journalists vomit up a bunch of garbage and fling it in all directions hoping for a bite.

edit; Yep, like flies to a cow pat.

10964~~~
so what makes him a better player, his atrocious first touch, or his amazing speed? total lack of agility? his fantastic dribbling ability, how he goes past players? or just the fact how he argues with referee everytime he fecks up, workrate? Hold up play? Counterattacking ability? He is fecking useless in all of this, he might have a better vision and shot from distance but all his abilities mentioned let him down so doesnt have time to execute it, experience is so overrated, he fecked up so many times this season it's unbelievable... What makes him more useful player than Rashford for us? 

He is still extremely overrated here, his reputation just give some of you hope that he is capable of what he used to be but he's absolutely done and unusable for top football. Rashford on the other hand even very raw player never looked out of place and scored some nice goals against top opponents and created other chances. Ask how many people would start Rooney over Rashford.

Would rather play Depay/Januzaj up front than that dross

10965~~~
What makes him better is his goalscoring instinct and his experience. Rooney is completely past it and will be on an ugly downward slope but Rashford hasn't proven anything on a long term consistency to even be compared with him at the moment. Rashford is a better fit for the club IMHO at the moment because he's so full of energy and fresh but Rooney is currently better. I can understand hatred towards a player but not when hatred makes you lose all perspective.
You described Rooney at his worst in your post and he is often but if you look at him at his current (as in this season) best, he has been more impressive than Rashford.

10966~~~
Wow 3-4 good games and Rashford is better than Rooney now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I'm sure people like this probably would think Macheda is better than Rooney as well if he went on a similar 2-3 goal streak again

10967~~~
Start Rooney and sub on Rashford to punish tired defenders. Too bad Rooney is unsubable

10968~~~
The grip on that handshake looked firm, glad he's back to proper fitness.

10969~~~
Rashford is better for the team right now than Rooney and an absolute breath of fresh air not only for the fans, but for another amazing talent in our team, Martial. I'd bet my right arm he wouldn't want Rashford to be pushed out of the team for an experienced, but slow and unskillful striker that is Rooney of today. Yes he went on a run of form, but he also spent months offering us dross. He's a legend, but if we want to actually move forward, he can either accept a squad player role or we sell him.

10970~~~
Goalscoring instinct and experience are vague qualities. What do they actually mean come game time?

If I'm a centre half I'd much rather play against Rooney than Rashford.

10971~~~
No one is arguing about Rashford being better than Rooney. That is ridiculous. 
However, the sad truth is that Rashford is more of a threat to defenses than Rooney is at the moment.

10972~~~
And this is supposed to be less vague ?

10973~~~
Nope no one is suggesting that as that would be absurd, however its not absurd to suggest that Rashford is the bigger threat since he actually has pace and isn't afraid to take defenders on, something  Rooney has seemingly forgotten to do.

10974~~~
What's not vague is actual stats and while Rooney did not have a good season at all, somehow he is still our joint top scorer in PL, but that can be expected given he was starting a lot of games as a CF and extremely low base, he and Martial have only 7 goals each, but what comes as a surprise is that he is our most creative player. He is joint top assister with Mata (4) in PL and he also creates 1.5 chances a game (Mata is next with 1.4).
So even in a bad year if we consider both goals and assists Rooney still comes out on top.

10975~~~
The problem is that we've seen it only against the teams that were controlling the game, when we conceded possession and managed to be a force in the counter. You look at other games, Liverpool away in Europa, West Ham, West Brom and Rashford has not exactly been shining then. It's a bi ask of a 18-19 years old of course, but the main thing is that his pace can be usefully utilized against team that want to dominate and control the ball themselves. How he can break through stacked defenses of decent teams, danish ones don't count, remains to be seen.

10976~~~
If you polish a turd for long enough it might gain a little shine. That's how I see Rooney's season. Any other player would have been dropped for a few games but he was still a constant in the team, and eventually hit a short purple patch and then got injured.

10977~~~
In which case let's go by finishing since that's ultimately going to be the most pivotal thing we get right in those games you've described. Rooney's conversion rate has been poor scuppering chance after chance, compared to Rashford who's been pretty stellar in dealing with chances.

10978~~~
Th real question of course is why could not anybody else muster anything better?

10979~~~
I honestly can't see much improvement from him at this stage in his career. 

Intrigued as to what is happening with him, particularly if another manager comes in.

10980~~~
Finishing is important, but it's not the only thing. How his finishing gave Rashford any edge in a game against Watford, he looked completely out of place and useless until LVG moved him on the wing when he could have shown his pace.
Finishing did not exactly helped him.

10981~~~
It is less vague. 

When a player is finished we no longer talk about pace, dribbling ability, workrate and movement. We start talking about these intangibles such as "experience." Always happens.

When 18 and 19 year olds are scoring at the same rate as a 30 year old any talk of goalscoring instinct and experience is pretty much invalid.

10982~~~
Ah come on now, in order to make a proper and fair comparison you would need to look at a similar or close number of games.  This is a narrow minded way of looking at things. Rashford's goals will calm down just like they naturally did with Martial when he was a on a good scoring run at the start of his Utd career.
I cannot believe I'm actually defending Rooney right now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10983~~~
Found myself in a similar situation the other day with Fellaini.

I know what you mean with Rashford but we can judge Martial and Rooney on a similar number of games. Scored the same haven't they in the league?

10984~~~
Maybe, I don't know stats specifically but there is no debate anyway, I'll go with Martial everyday as would most fans. Hopefully Martial/Rashford develop a great partnership for a few seasons.

10985~~~
Who exactly was required/expected to muster any better? Martial is probably his closest competitor in an attacking sense and he's 20. My question is why didn't LVG bring in anybody that could challenge Rooney in terms of status. Even SAF realized years ago that he couldn't be relied on to win you a title, so he bought RVP. LVG put all of his eggs in one basket regarding Rooney and it was downright daft.

10986~~~
Mata for example. In terms of creativity.
As for squad imbalance i do agree, i think our last season squad had too many CFs and not enough CMs, yet this year LVG managed to turn situation on it's head which is rather stupid achievement from him and Woody.
Yet under Fergie Rooney was always in the starting line-up bar that home Real game which we lost anyway. If Fergie really thought that Rooney was past it he would not play him in the most games, it's not like we had not had cover in Kagawa for nub 10, Chicha as a second forward, yet Fergie played Rooney literally until the title was secured.

10987~~~
Fergie was clearly gearing up to get rid of Rooney in 2013. He dropped him from the biggest game of the season, stuck him in central midfield when the title was virtually won and then for his last game at OT dropped him completely from the squad and then revealed he'd asked to leave.

He left it on a plate for Moyes to come in and get rid. But of course Davey had other ideas, terrible ideas. Like giving Rooney that contract.

10988~~~
Doesn't mean he didn't think he was done. Fergie probably did not want to upset the team's rhythm. As far as he was concerned it was team over players, now it's Rooney over team.

10989~~~
If that was true he would have dropped him for more that just one game, which we lost and in which Fergie still relied on him by subbing him on when his initial plan to 0-0 was done.
It kinda does, if you think the player is done, you don't play him. Rooney was featuring in almost all the games.

It's tough to know of course what would have happened but Fergie's attacking reinforcements in Kagawa and Persie were, well Kagawa was a flop, he just did not do anything apart a hat trick against a relegated side, Van Persie only managed one good season and that was it. So i don;t think the situation would have been as clear cut as some people try to make it look.

10990~~~
We were competing for trophies and Rooney getting dropped leads the stories being leaked to the media and a whole disruptive clamour to get him back in the team. You just have to look at the one match LVG dropped him for this season when the narrative started immediately that we need the captain and best player on the pitch, how dare LVG bench him. The aftermath of Moyes saying RVP was the best striker and the leaked stories was another example. Sir Alex waited until the end of the season and then threw him under the bus for Moyes to finish the job, which he bottled.

We're talking about someone that announced he wanted to leave before a Champions League match.

10991~~~
Its evident that SAF wanted to get rid of Rooney.

10992~~~
That's rather strange and unrealistic scenario. Fegie never cared much for media pressure, and players in who he did not believe in or had genuine conflict with simply did not play. Look at Roy Keane, he was out during mid-season, so all these "Fergie wanted to keep the rhythm of the team", "Fergie did not want press attention" is just nonsense theories. The only possible real reason for Rooney playing as much as he did since that Real game is that Fergie thought that at the time <b>United with Rooney</b> had more chances to win games than without him. Which points out that Fergie rated him as a player and relied on him to get us the title. Now what to do next is another story of course.

10993~~~
Just to post my opinion about the current and future of Rooney's situation, not the past one.

I think there are two points. The first point is replacement and <b>can we get the player</b>. I am not against us getting rid of Rooney, he is clearly not in his prime, that's not in debate, but the main thing is who is going to replace him. If it's Ibra, he is even older, does okay in CL bu playing in Prem and French league is very different, will he be better alternative i don't know. Higuain would be an absolute flop i am sure of it. Cavani, well if Ibra's gone i don't see PSG letting him go as well. Aubameyang would be a terribly overpriced buy and i am not convinced he would be able to replicate this year's form, esp in United. And there is little guarantee we can get any of them. Some people i'm told, i was not on the forum at the time, were happy with Falcao transfer last year. I thought it would be a disastrous flop straight away, which he has proven to be. And the fact that we were forced to risk and take such a player with his big wages and even pay a hefty 6m loan fee, probably like one of the highest loan fees in football history, tells me we had a genuine problem of attracting quality players upfront. We know they are the most costly, coveted and hard to get. Martial transfer tells me the same, while i am happy with the player, we basically gave Monaco a fortune, that is the kind of money that almost buy you a Suarez, Bale type of player, not a very promising youngster. Again, because we could not get any attacking reinforcements the whole summer and were forced into action, so forced to overpay twice, three times much his value. Just to get the transfer done. So not really a good tracking record, right? Add to that Di Maria and Mata that look more and more like a panic buys and what do we have? Players that were <b>not needed</b> by their clubs and still we had to overpay for both, a very expensive youngster, a injury hit CF who was way past it from French league. So the reality is that for three years now, it's clearly not a coincidence, we never bought an established attacking player that was not for sale and that the club would prefer to keep. That's sadly a fact.
Will it be any different this summer, without possibly CL? I am not sure. People who are saying "Rooney off, Griezmann and Aubameyang on" are not thinking straight. It's just wishful, nothing more.

But there is a second point which i feel even is more pertinent one. In my opinion, if we daft Rooney out, we need a top CF. But we also need top attacking player, like an AM, whether he will be a central AM like a number 10 or a right winger i don't know, but we do need someone who can create chances. So the question is can we get <b>both</b>? My opinion is that it is highly unlikely. So if we want to get any really proven and top player in attack we need to choose, are we going after a striker and then rely on Martial on the wing, Lingard and others to provide the chances for him or are we going after a creative player. My preference is to get a creative player and then keep Rooney, than get rid of Rooney and sign a new CF while being stuck with our current creative players.

10994~~~
Answer just get Ibra on a free then focus on RW. Keeping Rooney doesnt really serve any purpose

10995~~~
heh, Rooney supporters were all "let's see now how we do without him" giddying themselves up for an i-told-you-so-ing and watching us welcome him back with open arms hoping he would rescue us from 10th place.

Looks like we've done ok since, certainly no worse and gained the confirmation of a future prospect. Rooney back in the line up is looking to the past yet again

Let's hope we get rid in the summer or bench at most for him.

10996~~~
And Ibra at 34-35 is better? I doubt it. And can we get him? It will take a massive salary and signing-on fee for him to even consider United and still i would not rate our chances of doing the deal above 50%.
As for Rooney, i would like to see how he will do in a properly structured team. The sole fact that Rooney is leading in terms of creativity and scroring in league is telling me, that in a more direct, attacking side he could do much better.

But <b>if</b> we get Ibra and then a good AM/RW i am not against letting Rooney go. However given how our transfers went in the last years i think that would not happen.

10997~~~
He'll be here next season... Sir Bobby's record and all that.

10998~~~
The other questions are harder to answer but this one is easy, Ibra is a much better player than Rooney, and is still in top form, Rooney has been declining for 4 seasons now.A change in team set up wont alter the fact Rooney's legs have gone, he has no pace, can't turn properly and can't run with the ball.

10999~~~
I know many people say that stats don't tell the whole story but IMO, they don't really lie either. Your second point is almost stating that Rooney doubles up as a top striker and a top AM which is just  far out. Rooney's ability as an AM is just exaggerated. Despite Mata's lack of physicality he outshines in that department. Rooney is of no use to us sadly and it's time to move on.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2015/2016/wayne_rooney/165/165/73/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/juan_mata/165/165/313/38/p#total_forward_passes/total_passes/pass_completion/key_passes/assists/chances_created#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...pletion/key_passes/assists/chances_created#90</a>

11000~~~
The whoscored provide a different calculation of key passes, on per game basis Rooney is just in front. But even if we take this squawka data, Mata played in a position that allows to create more, an yet he is losing in the assists, while actually taking more set pieces than Rooney i believe. But not only that, his advantage in key passes and chances created is virtually non-existent and given his position it should be more substantial. So based on this data Rooney looks like a more creative player.

11001~~~
That is if Rooney has stayed up top as you suggest. Rooney has spent the last year gardening between the centre circle and the 18 yard box!

11002~~~
Based on his career? I doubt it. If he was a better player he would not play in second-rate leagues. He was shining in Italy when it was hardly a competitive league. Inter was much stronger actually without him, even won the CL. Ibra was shipped out of Barca, cause he could not play at that level, the last 3-4 years he pays in France that is objectively a much worse league than PL or La Liga or Bundesliga. At international level he hardly done anything apart from flashy stuff, i am not telling him to carry Sweden to WC win, that's almost impossible thing to do. But then could not qualify for the last two WCs and their Euros campaign ended up before knock-out stages. So to present him as <b>much</b> better player on his career data is strange. He really is not. This year, last couple of year? Maybe, but again Ibra is playing in French league.
It's same for Ibra.

That is this year's stats. A kind of low base, low point ones.

11003~~~
Ibra has won 12 league titles in the last 14 seasons, and the sense of playing the PL being superior is not really justified when you look at how terrible our teams have been in Europe over the last five years. Rooney has also never been the main man in any United team bar the ones that finished second, Ibra has been the main man wherever he has played. He didn't fail at Barca, they bought him and Pep had no idea how to use him properly, you don't buy Ibra without playing to him. Ibra has always been better but it's by a much wider margin over the last 4 years.

I can only assume that you haven't seen Ibra this season, he still has the power and agility to turn defenders and he can still dribble past them, Rooney is finished at the top level, a slow, technically poor lumberer who can't hold the ball up and who is only still around due to politics.

11004~~~
And French clubs were any better? Look at UEFA coefficient. England's one is 75 and France one is 53, last 5 years if you don't know. PSG is a good club, but everyone else is hardly competitive. So winning french league with PSG is hardly an achievement at all. And how many of those Ibra's titles were in corrupted Serie A, when Inter collected titles when other top clubs were hit with sanctions and restrictions? And how did italian clubs did then in Europe? What you should do is actually look at reletive league strength when Ibra played in them. If you'll do that, you will find that the only time when Ibra played in a league that was superior to PL is when he was at Barca and when he failed miserable. Gone after a year.
And has Ibra ever delivered in CL? No. His Inter was a flop in europe, he could not make it in Baca team either. So much for the "better player" and a main man.
He did. He could not deliver and when he left Barca retained CL. And Inter won CL without Ibra. Hardly a coincidence.
Yes, he does it quite well in France. In CL it's pretty much obvious that he relies on his technique, power and his agility is lacking. Especially compared even with just averagely fast players like Cavani.
And he is much older.

But all that aside, because he is different type of player, different type of CF to Rooney, i think he may do better here. He may, but i think it's not likely he will go here in the first place, and then if he will go here, i would not count him as the best option. I think if we fo for top CF, we need to go for somebody like Benzema, Cavani or even a bit younger options. I don't if we can get them, but swapping Rooney for Ibra who will be 35 next season and never played in PL is hardly inspiring and low-risk. Even on a free transfer.

11005~~~
I can't see how this argument works at all man, you are basically discounting everything he has achieved based on your personal judgment regarding the leagues, how about actually looking at the players and their qualities and performances, that shows you who has the superior set of skills, who has the greater impact and who is the better player. If Barca had made Ibra the center of the team he'd have delivered just fine, but Pep brought him into the land of Hobbit's and didn't play to his strengths, it would be like buying a prime Michael Owen and then playing a long ball style, it made no sense and showed Pep had no idea how to execute an alternative gameplan to his pass it into oblivion tactic. 

I don't think that is true at all, he took Chelsea apart quite easily in the CL just a couple of weeks ago, and that was without even being at his very best.

Benzema is a scumbag, I doubt the club would look at him now, especially given all our sponsorship deals. Cavani is very average, and ironically his success has been in leagues that you discredited Ibra's achievements in and he was never as good as Ibra in either Serie A or Ligue 1. The reason replacing Rooney with Ibra makes sense is Ibra is comfortably better than Rooney and he's at an age where we can get a couple of seasons out of him and not hamper the long term progress of Martial and Rashford.

11006~~~
I have to disagree with you about him being a flop at Barca. It was well documented that he fell out with Pep from the get go and despite that he has a decent goal scoring record.

Yes, he relies on his technique, power and agility; something that Rooney can only currently dream of. Even at 35, he is still s superior player to this 30 year old Rooney that plays like a 36 year old. You really underestimating Ibra's ability, regardless of whether he played in France or not. There is a reason why his fellow professional and coaches regard him as one of the best in the FIFA XI polls.

11007~~~
We might go for Ibra just for the commercial benefits. I'm not so much worried about fielding Zlatan himself; rather, our lack of chance-creation by others for him.

11008~~~
Why the hell is Rooney's career being compared to Iba's? There's been a huge gap between for a while now and  that's what matters. Only a fool would prefer Rooney now.

11009~~~
Seriously, where have you been the last 4 years. Yes Ibra is clearly better.

Also his salary won't be much more than what Rooney is on now, and we can get a fee for Rooney also so the cost will be not much. That could buy us a season to find another long term striker whilst we also wait on the development of Martial Rashford and Wilson.

You only have to watch Rooney the last 3 years to see his decline, yes the team doesn't help but how many chances has Martial put on a plate for him this season when that he has fluffed..... we seriously need to move on IMO and the sooner the better.

11010~~~
I think this particular myth that Fergie was getting ready to get rid of Rooney has been born out of the embellishment of the word "dropped" in this scenario. When reality it was after a credible performance marking Alonso in the first leg that led SAF to put Rooney <i>on the bench </i>(much different to being <i>dropped</i> I think we can all agree) in place of two players who could play off the shoulder in front of Welbeck dropping deep in Van Persie and Nani. At the Santiago Bernabéu Fergie opted for your typical away set up where Welbeck dropped onto Alonso to pressure him and Rooney was drifting right to help out the fullbacks. (Swung in a great corner for Danny to nod home in style I believe). The lineup with Van Persie who missed a couple of really good chances in that tie was a much more attacking lineup at home and the fact that he went for Giggs in a midfield three says a lot. For tactical reasons I believe Rooney couldn't quite make that team due to Welbeck's role on Alonso. He came off the bench after Nani was sent off with not really much room to influence.

I also remember that contract negotiations were ongoing around that time as he was approaching the end of his deal. The negotiations carried over into the Moyes season and there was no way in hell he was going to get rid of Rooney and not tie him to a contract. Trying to dump that on Moyes quite simply is a reach to far and revision of hindsight to suit that agenda. (Not that I am defending Moyes, take pot shots at him by all means I don't mind.)

It did appear that Rooney was pulling that carbon copy strop in his contract negotiations which is why SAF made it public very early in the piece. A savvy move by the gaff at the time, he knew the score. Moyes came in, Rooney signed the deal and the rest is history. He has a genuine shot at breaking the EPL top scorer's and United top scorers record in the next three years at United. Even if he leaves to another EPL club and breaks the all time scorers record to go above Shearer will be an incredible feat.

I am not sure either, Rooney has never played outside England and Ibra has never played in England. It would be like cashing out a bet when up a couple of hundred quid or taking the "mystery prize" who knows how well Ibra would do in England.

11011~~~
Guess who's back?  Back again
Rooney's back. Tell a friend.



Thanks to Marcus Rashford for his efforts.

Captain Fantastic.

11015~~~
He should Captain the U21's for the rest of the season.

11016~~~
He might release a public statement with concerns about the u21s team hours before kick off

11017~~~
Does anyone recall a few seasons back when we laughed at the Dippers for playing on Gerrard even though it was clear he wasn't good enough anymore?

They debated on RAWK while we laughed and said we would have dropped him without fear. 

Well...

11018~~~
yay..... not.

11019~~~
Oh good.

11020~~~
Glad he's warming up in the 21's, he takes a bit of time to get his fitness up.

11021~~~
Going to be very interesting to see how he does at U21 level. Given his status, wage, reputation should be miles ahead of everyone else on the pitch.

11022~~~
Should be. Funny how he was slated to play against Chelsea but for some reason wasn't ready... probably didn't fancy those strong quick Chelsea defenders. Instead though he's now got bottom of the table middlesborough <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

All jokes aside I hope he smashes 5 against them and proves he is raring to go, but I feel it'll just be like Falcao - not looking out of place against very average players.

11023~~~
It's all about fitness level and match rhythm, not him trying to prove someone he's better than U21 players.

11024~~~
It's irrelevant. 

Jones played last Monday, he looked out of breath after 5 mins, off the pace by miles, uncomfortable (as ever) on the ball, lost when off the ball, ran ragged by some Chelsea kids, nutmegged TWICE for fun like a drunk in the park joining in with the kids taking the pi55, hauled off after 76mins to ironic cheers from the predominantly young crowd. Yet after all that, Luis says he might feature against Spurs!?

It doesn't matter what sorted shift pie-face puts in on Monday. His coach, adopted Dutch father & blindsided lover LVG, will move heaven and earth (I.e. Rashford) to get Waynetta back in the team, slowing down play & being ineffective. Still... £300+K a week...

11025~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I was kind of expecting Jones to put performance like that, he's been out so long, and even when healthy didn't look like proper defender, don't think he'll ever make it as elite footballer. Shame really, was hoping for him to become great defender, but seems like he'll make it as professional patient instead.

As for Rooney, people were expecting him to be dropped when LVG first arrived, now seems like he's manager favorite player, that's why I don't think he'll give his 150%, he'll do just about enough so that LVG has excuse to put him back in the team.

11026~~~
The way the u21's have been playing (style wise I mean, not form) will suit Rooney. Fast and sharp decisive movement is beneficial. It still is a run out, Jones looked incredibly unfit and I would think Rooney would be the same.

edit: Oh right, that is mentioned above.

11027~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11028~~~
Do people still believe Rooney was/is the reason our play is so slow and labored? Have you not watched the games since he's been out? We've not been anything special, and have still struggled to score goals, scoring only 5 in our last 6 games.

11029~~~
Anyone who quotes 300k as though it's truth is never going to let the truth get in the way of their argument!
It's down to VG how we play. All our attackers would look better for another manager. How much so, is another debate, but in the majority the style this season has been cautious.

A win tomorrow, and top 4 is a big chance again. And we'll back it until the last day.
But next season we need different.

11030~~~
It's not that Rooney slows down our play it's that he's so sluggish and poor at protecting the ball these days that he stops any kind of transition into attack most of the time, he either miss-controls it or simply pushes it back where it came from, he can't turn and put us on the front foot as the touch and agility isn't there.

11031~~~
Two quick points. First, we tend to win more points in the EPL without Rooney, he makes no difference nowadays. When Rooney got injured we were 6 points off 4th, now we are only 1 point off 4th. His absence was a blessing in disguise, surely? Second, Rooney fans struggle to grasp a fairly simple concept: we don't play much better without Rooney partly because we didn't buy enough quality because of Rooney: he is a guaranteed starter for us. Now we rely on Rashford who was barely known just 2 months ago and who did more in 6-7 games (winners against Arsenal and City away) than Rooney in 25 games. Rooney is easily the most overrated star out there.

11032~~~
We've not been any worse without him and we've been better after Rashford started playing. We've been better in attack with Rashford than we were with Rooney.

It really is a moment for Rooney to step up. United need to get 4th, he needs to show he's still got it for the Euros because Kane and Vardy have both been very good the whole season. He just gotta be hungry now. If he doesn't show that then I will think that he's finished.

11033~~~
Nonsense. Rashford is better than Rooney and we've been playing like Barcelona since Wayne has been out. It was obviously all his fault.

11034~~~
Even besides the goals, Rooney was playing well ever since the Stoke game till he got injured. Yes there was the odd game where he was absolutely woeful (Anfield) and yet he got the match winner there. He struggles after injury so I'm not very sure we'll see a very good Rooney and our attack is pretty rubbish as well so that doesn't help but hopefully we'll get to see Martial and Rashford both play close to Rooney and not the labored, slow nonsense we play with Fellaini, Mata etc.

11035~~~
City going on a woeful run of form has nothing to do with this obviously.

11036~~~
Our best attacking performance, which I personally feel was against Stoke, came with Rooney uptop. Also, we can't just look at the fact Rashford come into the team. Martial has gone back onto the wing, where he's a lot more effective, in my opinion, and Lingard has gone in behind the forward, which has created variation our our play.

11037~~~
Lingard has played 2 games behind the forward and in neither of those games was our attacking game above average.

One game against Stoke doesn't bring up the average much. Fact is that he hasn't been good this season, he hasn't even outplayed 3 players in their first season who are all much younger. That's a concern.

11038~~~
You thought he played well against Chelsea and Sunderland? Those are our only games "since the Stoke game".

19 of our league games before new years, he played 6 winners. He provided 1 assist and scored 2 goals in those 15 games he played in. He's got less than 5 good games this season which is why people have been on his back this season. Some people were actually glad when he got injured because his performances this season have been so weak and that it was the only way to get him out of the starting lineup.

11039~~~
If City had won their home game against us, the difference would have been 7 points! Rashford's winner made a huge difference. So, yeah, we are doing fine without Rooney. I'm not sure the positive trend will continue when he returns in the starting XI.

11040~~~
What games have we looked above average going forward?

One game or not, it was amongst our best performance this season and Rooney was in it, meaning he can and has produced the goods.

11041~~~
You admit that he struggles after injury yet go on to claim that other players should be moved around to accommodate him, why shouldn't he find form and fitness playing with the reserves like others have had to do? This cuddling and too much reverence is what has brought on the complacency that prevented him from reaching his full potential and now sees his roles at both club and country being questioned as if he is thirty-five instead of thirty, its all too comfortable.

11042~~~
Fergie would have. Moyes was never strong enough to drop a big name player, and LVG made Rooney captain presumably based on reputation, which in effect made him undroppable.

11043~~~
1. Like others have stated, thats primarily because of City's form!
2. We had 34 points from 21 games where Rooney Started, 19 from the other 10. True. But 27 goals from 21 games and 12 from remaining 10 points that we score more with him than without him. ANd as far as points per game argument is concerned, without Rooney, we have faced comparatively weaker opposition- barring Arsenal(h), City(a), West Ham(h) and Pool(h). With him, Pool, City, Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea twice, Leicester, Southampton.

11044~~~
Why would Moyes have dropped him? He was our best player that season. It was an awful season, but it would have been even worse if not for Rooney.

11045~~~
Your stats are confused. Rooney was a sub against Stoke. He played the whole 2nd half. It is ridiculous to include that match in the "without Rooney" category when it suits you (goals scored, points won) but not when it doesn't (opposition faced - Stoke currently 8th in the table).

Rooney starts 34 points from 21 games. No Rooney 19 points from 9 games. Rooney plays 45 mins 0 points. Rooney starts 27 goals scored. No Rooney 12 in 9 games. Strength of opposition in the 9 non-Rooney matches is pretty much the average you would expect from 9 games. We faced 2 sides in the top 4. Two more top 10 sides. None of the sides currently in the bottom 3 or for that matter the relegation battle, but plenty of lower middle tables opposition.

The idea that we have faced comparatively weaker opposition without Rooney is nonsense. There are 21 games with Rooney so of course there will be more games against top 10 opponents, just as there are far more games against relegation candidates Villa, Newcastle (2), Norwich, Sunderland (2). Average league position of opponents on the day we faced them is 9.5 without Rooney, compared to 10.9 with Rooney. No value attached to Spurs on the opening day of the season as no league table after 0 games. If we give them a 2nd place (their current position), it would make the with Rooney figure 10.5

In fact, as things stand, we don't score more with Rooney on the pitch. With Rooney on the pitch we have scored 26 goals in slightly more than 21 full games, and without him we have 13 in just under 10 full games. Rooney had been substituted when we scored a late pen against West Brom in the 2-0 home win. Rooney substituted -30 mins total. Rooney on as sub +45 mins.

11046~~~
We know that Rooneys not been at his best BUT the teams changed a lot. He's got a 5.4 rating...He's played 32 games and got 14 goals and 5 assists.....So he's not played great but he's produced and with more pace and power in the team, we might see a strong end to the season. We probably won't but at the same time, there's a lot to fight for regarding United and England. I think if we get him help...it will help him. The fact that he's the leader and everyone looks to him - to me shows how short we've been for much of the season. Having said that, if United had have played like men and not fannies then we'd be challenging for the title this season. I'm not ignoring the injuries and the kids..i'm referring to the large period of the season where we refused to pass forwards. Disgraceful. Rooneys not done too bad considering. He just needs more help from those around him. He's the obvious focal point when he players because everyone else is young.

11047~~~
Of course he can, that isn't the issue with him. It's that he rarely does so anymore.

11048~~~
Fair enough, but again, introduction of Rooney in the Stoke game couldn't have won the points. In the part he played, it was a 0-0. We attacked more and were more positive. 
People were asking for him to be benched. Well he got injured. We have scored 6 in 5. thats slighly lower than our average, although these games , I agree, were against tougher opposition.
You need to consider the no. of chances that were being created pre Stoke and Post Stoke game. I don't get the calls asking him to be sold. (I agree his wages are far too high, but for a club that has basically become a business now, I'm sure they must have thought about the pros as well like the image and branding etc. ). We are seriously lacking senior players with PL experience.  Once Carrick and Rooney can be said as guys with PL experience and maybe DDG now. Smalling, although with us for 5 seasons now, wasn't a regular till last season. Carrick is pretty much set to leave, DDG's future is far from known. We have 1 senior player and we want to sell him- it's bonkers!

11049~~~
No I don't think he should get a spot automatically but I'd honestly rather have him in the team than Mata.

11050~~~
But but but he put in a transfer request!

11051~~~
Until we bring in better players, Rooney isn't any worse than what we already have. He's been rubbish most of the season and injured for 2-3 months and he's still our top scorer. He was on course for 20 if not for the injury. I agree that his performances have been generally very poor till the Stoke game but the fact is our attack has been awful (with or without Rooney) and that makes it a lot harder for any of our attacking players to do well and despite that, Rooney was on target (till injury struck) for his 20 goals season target that would have been a decent return.

11052~~~
It's time to move on from Rooney

11053~~~
Guys why do you keep pretending this argument exists? Nobody says that our slow, laborious play is ALL Rooney's fault.

I'm genuinely interested as to why you keep arguing against this opinion when nobody holds it.

11054~~~
I think it is pretty obvious that people who say things like that care very little beyond foamy rants about Rooney. He's not the problem, the median line has stayed even the entire two seasons regardless of which of the 13 players who have played up front of us is playing.

11055~~~
LVG has once again said he will be picked once fit cause he has privileges. 
Not going to get myself worked up over this.

11056~~~
It really does make it seem like there is a "must play" type clause in his deal. Fascinating.

11057~~~
He is more a part of the problem, than part of a solution to our slow, laboured play.

£300k minimum after add-ons & image rights fees. 
Attackers would look different under another manager? Possibly.... But we'll see how pacy, technically gifted, inspirational and ruthless a striker Waynetta is when he's leading the line for England at the Euros under a different manager.

11058~~~
Maybe a bit premature given the choice of Mata or Rooney then Rooney all day for me. Big problem for us is our supply out wide is shambolic both from our wide forwards and full backs. Currently we have the worst two full backs I've seen at united for a long time in Darmain and Rojo. They both are so poor going forward it's worrying.

11059~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

11060~~~
Any chance PSG might fork out big for both Ronaldo and Rooney?

11061~~~
Ok let me go further given the choice of Mata or Lingard I'd go Lingard. Mata is a complete phoney of a player. Great for a season highlights on YouTube anonymous for 89 mins per game. Yes great blog hugs and kisses. With his square and backward passes and his full speed closing down, he serves no purpose in an united team. An imposter of a player (quicker he moves on for me the better). Yes I support him during games but personally the quicker he is sold the better.

11062~~~
I think thats a bit extreme. We can do better and he doesnt impose himself enough... 
And I'd still take him over Rooney.
Rooney outside the box used to be great.. He is a hindrance now. Can still finish. If he is playing, stick him up top and hope we create something for him to finish..

11063~~~
Mata and Rooney need to go when we really get serious about building an actual football team designed to compete for trophies, playing great football. They are the most experienced but the weakest links of any attack we build if it incudes them. I would rather we get rid of both and invest in a top class No.10 that doesn't come with their combined buggage of being too slow, can't protect the ball or move with it to create something unexpected.
With this 'special privileges' bollocks we are as far away from success as one ca possibly be.

11064~~~
Unfortunately, you are right. Our attacking talismans go into hiding far too often. I really like Mata, but he doesn't suit our team. Rooney is simply over the hill and his inability to look to the left is just a little more than annoying (does he have neck issues?). If only one has to go, I'd let go of Rooney, but I still think we need new players in both positions.

11065~~~
Granted that Mata is really suited for the PL due the lack of his physicality but that doesn't make him a bad player. It's so easy these days for fans to remember Rooney of donkey years ago and use it as a reason to keep him in the team but forget that Mata was POTY for a strong Chelsea 2 years in row in a more recent history. Mata lacks the body while Rooney just lacks. Mata without the special privileges and being shifted here and there still manages to be involved in more goals that any player in our squad. He is easily a better player than Rooney. Rooney has to go before Mata. No time for sentiments

11066~~~
When the team plays well, and at a quick tempo, Rooney plays well.

11067~~~
Yet we put in equally as slow and laboured play performances without Rooney in the team.

11068~~~

11069~~~
Saying Rooney slows the team down isn't the same as saying he's the ONLY reason we play dull football. Honestly I think you've been misinterpreting posts like that for quite some time.

If you asked <a class="username" data-user="94348, @iKeano" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94348/">@iKeano</a> I'm sure he'd say Fellaini, Rojo, Darmian etc also slow the team down.

11070~~~
The key is that you can't imagine Rooney being a rotation player. He's been too big a player for us, and is on way too much money.
Mata, you could imagine slipping into that role easier.

Rooney is bar far the biggest issue for the new manager to deal with.
If he stays, he plays, meaning everything has to be shaped round him, and he's not worth that these days.

Scoring 5 before the end of the season, and offing to China would be perfect for everyone.

11071~~~
Totally agree.... But Rooney is supposed to be our talismanic leader, our Roy of the Rovers, our go-to-guy... But he's been underperforming for years & is now nothing more than an albatross around Utds neck. 
He's more of a hindrance than a help, breaks up attacks with a poor touches and bad passing. His petulant screaming at the ref when things go wrong instead of grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck like Keane, McClair, Robson... He spits his dummy out like he did three times when he wanted to leave. 
Fergie saw the writing on the wall.

11072~~~
Him and Fellaini has been out. We need some more scapegoats. That's all we can do until LVG can be sacked.

and for the record, I do think Rooney has been shit this season but wanting him sold is just stupid given our lack of senior attacking options.

11073~~~
Well, if we don't sell him he will be a perpetual pain in the rear until his contract expires. He needs to be replaced not rotated.

11074~~~

I just want to hear what the Rooney fan club has to say about this. Sadly Rashford is slowly getting LvG'd like Varela, CBJ, Pereira, Januzaj etc

11077~~~
Remember the time when LVG was appointed and how everyone and their Dog felt Rooney would be amongst the first one to struggle and be kicked out under him ? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11078~~~
If that is the case then first get in another striker. I don't want a Di Maria situation where we sell a player but not get in another one.

11079~~~
Remember his 09/10 season....

I want that Rooney back...

11080~~~
I want that United back.

11081~~~
It will an unending cycle if we don't sell him first. His departure will almost guarantee that the club will be obliged to replace such a "big name". Until then it would be all about how to bring in players to support Rooney which would make sense if he was Messi. RvP, CH14 and Welbeck were not given fair chances because of the presence of Rooney. Rashford, Wilson and Keane will also suffer the same fate because of Rooney's presence. 

His presence is bigger than his ability!

11082~~~
Straight back into the side on Wednesday is a joke, anyone else wouldn't play twice in 3 days.

11083~~~
My captain shall always.... Ah forget it!

11084~~~
West Ham will be pleased, their CB's will have a lot less work to do.

11085~~~
All they have to do is put a man on Rooney, and he'll probably get sent off because of frustration.

11086~~~
He will be left completely alone to do as he pleases by West Ham and use the spare player to double up on Martial.

11087~~~
Rooney can play RB on Wednesday

11088~~~
Murder she wrote on here when Rashford is fecked off for Rooney and not seen again for the rest of the season

11089~~~
Saw some of the u21's game and he looked much more comfortable playing free in Warren Joyce's faster system that he uses.

11090~~~
Let's keep him there shall we? Maybe he'll be more comfortable playing against U-21 players.

11091~~~
His father liked what he saw last night.

11092~~~
Gimme strength...

11093~~~
Imagine a player with his first touch getting pressed by faster and younger players. I would consider him doing well as a midfielder if he would have the technical ability and positional awareness needed to compensate for declining physical attributes but I just don't think he has that.

11094~~~
fecking hell, he's still our top scorer...

How bad can a team be where the top scorer has played 75% of the games and has been woeful in 90% of them?

11095~~~
Who has played more games as the no9?

11096~~~
Probably Rooney. Not the point, though.

I'm surprised that he's still our top scorer.

11097~~~
It is the point if he has been playing the most in the scoring position. If Martial had been playing there I'd bet he would be our top scorer.

11098~~~
Because Messi says so and they have mutual respect for each other. If Messi says he is a top player then both in a logical and emotional sense it must be true, and recent performances and seasons gone count for nothing
There, I said it!

11099~~~
Rooney won't feature tomorrow night, but is nailed on for a start on Saturday. 

In his 60 minutes lastnite, he settled further into his Gerrard-role. The role of a has-been that we laughed at in the autumn of Gerrard's career. Trying speculative, outlandish crossfield balls until one eventually comes off. He done this lastnite for the U21's, time after time. It came off once, at the expense of Borthwick-Jackson bursting a lung to keep the ball in play. His free-kick that allegedly just missed the crossbar, was well over and well wide. 

Our talismanic leader and captain looked off-pace against a bunch of kids. Yes he's just back from injury, but his first touch is still brutal & his lack of running was as evident as ever. He'll never change now, ship him out to anyone that will take him off our hands. Work on the future, the youth. Get rid of the rot... Rooney, LVG & his backroom cronies all need to go sooner rather than later.

11100~~~
He's worth place in the team just for the CAF meltdown alone, long may it continue I say! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11101~~~
He looked at his level <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11102~~~
best argument ever, I bet he has seen like 5 United games past 5 years

11103~~~
We need the thuggish Rooney back - this tame, friend-to-all Rooney is shite.

11104~~~
You guys just don't get it do you? Whatever the hell attitude Rooney doesn't change the fact that he's so far in decline he will never go back to where he was. All these "i want that Rooney back" bullshit really grinds on me because it's so ignorant. The Rooney of 09/10 is where he is. <b>In bloody 09/10.</b> Stop living in the past.

11105~~~
Yeesh, chill.

11106~~~
You know full well who is is looking at. jeesh, he isn't that happy when we win 3 points

11107~~~
Contrast iKeano's report with the <i>Guardian</i>'s fawning account:

11108~~~
What I came to post but worded better than I would have done. He was as shite as ever, he's done.

11109~~~
Same with his constant attempts at chipped goals. Is he that bored of playing for us that he has to amuse himself with these efforts instead of doing something truly proactive?

11110~~~

11111~~~
He almost punched him! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

11112~~~
The age-old question, where does he fit?

11113~~~
#10

Mature head surrounded by youth.

11114~~~
His best match this season. Didnt make any mistakes.

11115~~~
He didn't take the armband when he came on so that's an improvement.

11116~~~
Be interesting to see if Rooney starts on Saturday. After tonight, I can't see who he'd come in for.

11117~~~
After this length of time off and only a few mins on tonight, I can't see him starting this weekend. Probably get a good 30min run out as a sub though.

11118~~~
Herrera maybe?

11119~~~
We didn't play with a 10 today. We played with a 433/4141, and there was a big difference to our play. Our best bit of form last season come with us playing that system. I don't know why we don't play it more often.

11120~~~
Hmm. When we play a 433, Herrera is normally deeper out of the two centre mids above the defensive midfielder. If Rooney does come into the team, it'll probably be for Fellaini, as the more advanced 8.


Be a shame for Fellaini, though. I felt he was really good today, and gives us something to the rest of our players.

11121~~~
I think this would be a nice compromise and if Rooney were to up his work rate it work. He has it in him to do well there because in a 4-3-3 the technique requirements are reduced because the two 8s can share the creative burden.

11122~~~
Ye. Plus he can be the one who does the running off the ball more and get into the box, whilst Herrera glues everything together.

11123~~~
TBH he doesnt deserve to start the next match. And he shouldnt be playing in midfield either.

As an impact sub, that would be fine.

11124~~~
Don't know if this is more shocking than the result

11125~~~
I'm glad to see (as I said a while back) him have the maturity to (speculatively, tactically discussed with Van Gaal) let Rashford continue and to come off the bench. I do think he's not risking a big injury before the Euro and I think that suits all parties concerned that he not burn it to hard returning from injury.

11126~~~
Looks like Rooney could possibly start tomorrow after reading Van Gaal's comments. 

<i>“Changing a winning team is not difficult, you just have to follow your philosophy,” Van Gaal said. “The only difficult part is communicating your decision to the players and making sure they understand the reasoning.”

</i>

11127~~~
What part from that comment makes you think Rooney could possibly start tomorrow?

11128~~~
<i>Changing a winning team is not difficult</i>
<i>
</i>

11129~~~
I doubt he will start. He should follow his philosophy because Rooney hasn't play for so long. But Rashford needs rest. It's been too much for the 18 years old to play twice every week. So I won't deny the fact that Rooney will start. But for both Rooney's condition himself and our club we shouldn't change it. I will stick with the same starting eleven as long as they are fit and this includes Fellaini.

11130~~~
"Yes, I think he shall receive more minutes, but it's always dependent on the game. You cannot say in advance that I give you 20 minutes or something like that. When it's possible, I shall do that because we need Wayne in the team."

11131~~~
That sounds to me like he had a chat with Wayne and said Marcus is playing well lets not disturb that...?

11132~~~
Welcome back, guy!

11133~~~
Where did you pick this up?

Now he's mature because he doesn't pick himself in the starting XI immediately after the big layoff.

11134~~~
He will start behind rashford with Martial and Lingard on either flank.

11135~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Couldn't put it better myself.

11136~~~
From his press conference comments. I made the comment in the "where will Rooney return to" thread and said that it would show maturity on Rooney's behalf to return back into the fold and not treat his position as a knight to the rescue type scenario. From Van Gaal's comments in the press conference it sounds like they may have had a little discussion and agreed that Rashford is on a good run at the moment and letting him continue that. If so then I think it shows maturity.

He's mature if he puts other players form ahead of his own personal ambition. I am not sure what else that would be considered as.

11137~~~
Not being a massive selfish prick? Why is he getting a say on whether or not he's back in the team anyway?

11138~~~
He's the captain and the senior experienced striker.. That doesn't really need spelling out. Van Gaal more than likely picks the team, hence why his comments seemed to indicate that the groupthink was to keep Rashford up front for now.

11139~~~
What a load of bollocks. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

First of all, he is just a player, he shouldn't pick who will play ahead of him and when he'll be back in the team. And second, you meant he is showing maturity from these comments maybe:



This is the new low in this thread, Wayne Rooney being praised for his maturity for not picking himself in the first XI ahead of in form striker.

11140~~~
I've not said he picks the team. Nor did I imply that any comments from Van Gaal meant Rooney has shown maturity. You're arguing a point you've entirely made up by misunderstanding what I meant. I made it perfectly clear I was speculating on Rooney coming off the bench would show that as a captain and someone who has some input into the direction of the team on match day, Van Gaal says it right there "it is dependable on the game". Sounds to me like he's quite happy for Rooney (speculating Rooney in agreement) that he is happy to come off the bench for the good of the team (or Rashford).

11141~~~
Oh, right. I didn't seem that bit. Guess he won't start then.

11142~~~
"he always wants to play".

That's an advantage isn't it!

Imagine if "Wayne doesn't fancy playing for a bit, so will just hang around in the background for a bit"

11143~~~
Knew he would start. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

11144~~~
Will need six months to get back into form. So the earlier the better.

11145~~~
were lucky to have him

11146~~~
Very sharp today I think

11147~~~
He's been good today, keep him in that position.

11148~~~
Running the show to be fair (albeit against shite).

The number 10 role is probably his only viable position now (rotating).

11149~~~
I know it's only against Villa, but he's been really good in the first half, in my opinion. Controlled the game. People talk about their hate for him switching play, but against teams that play so narrow and compact, it is needed to create 1v1s. That's exactly how we scored our goal. Great ball to Valencia, which created a 1v1 one, cross and goal. Great play.

11150~~~
He was pretty invisible at the beginning but got involved later on and did really well. Absolutely no connection between him and Rashford though. He still turns to the right at every opportunity.

11151~~~
Yeah, good so far.

11152~~~
More creativity in midfield than we've had in months. Doing the job we kind of wish Herrera would do I think. And not slowing us down by being up top.

11153~~~
Captain playing well. Good to see.

11154~~~
Where Herrera struggles is with his switch of play. He can do all the one touch, link up play, but at times, you need to switch play and move teams that are narrow from side to side. Rooney has done that today (normally does in the 10 role). I don't see why Herrera and Rooney can't play together, though. Be a nice blend.

11155~~~
Doesn't look like he's playing #10. Seems to be playing in midfield, thus allowing Mata to come in centrally, where he's looked good, and freeing space up for Valencia.

11156~~~
This is Villa, calm down.

11157~~~
Good to have him back the way he's playing today.

11158~~~
That's a good point actually - Herrera would offer more than Mata is today.

11159~~~
Doesn't mean you can't give praise to a player returning from injury does it?

11160~~~
Played really well in the first half I thought, sharp touch and passing. Looks tired now though.

11161~~~
My comment wasn't about the praise but about the remark that we haven't had so much creativity in midfield in months. Given the quality of the opposition today, such a claim is OTT, obviously.

11162~~~
Decent first half. Crap 2nd half. Touch deserted him.

11163~~~
Was our best player from the 15th to the 45th minute. Much better than I expected.

11164~~~
Been saying it all season.

He's been crap throughout 2015. He is not the same Rooney but he is <b>not finished. </b>

11165~~~
Good game from the lad.

11166~~~
Good game? Wow. He was utterly shit in the second half.

11167~~~
He has just come back from injury and tired, obviously.

I thought he was excellent in the first half and exposed the limitations of Lingard as a 10. Lingard just doesn't drop deep to link the midfield and attack after he came on we lost control of the game and created only two more chances IIRC.

11168~~~
Only saw the second half, wasn't impressed but fair enough if the first half was better.

11169~~~
£900million k per week for that poop.

11170~~~
Still has the worst 1st touch in football but great passing and vision, Villa gave him space and he dominated in the 1st half. Not surprised that he wasn't as good in the 2nd half considering he's just coming back from injury

11171~~~
It was like having Scholes back. Pinging 30 yard balls to Val on the wing. That is how we scored too.

11172~~~
He's not finished per se, only at the top level.

Can you see United winning the title with Rooney as the main man in attack, ot the CL? Maybe I'm wrong but it seems to me impossible.

We are making the life of Liverpool and City easier by insisting on Rooney.

11173~~~
Fluctuated from decent to good in the first half but was poor in the second.

11174~~~
Below average, which makes this one of his best performances this season.

11175~~~
But he was still mediocre overall yet again. And it doesnt take much effort to expose Lingard's limitations. He had a couple of good crosses but he was far from excellent.

11176~~~
OK, excellent was a stretch but I thought he was our key player in the first half.

11177~~~
He was decent in the first half, played some nice passes, never got into it in the second half.

11178~~~
wow, aston villa this year has been possibly the shittest premier league team in new era, on par with all those wigan sides.. he had some moments but our U18 team would beat them... chinese clubs may consider to make a move based on this game though

11179~~~
Okay in the first half. Lead in his boots in the 2nd half.

Hes got that invaluable match rhythm now though, so it'll be full 90s 'til the seasons end.

11180~~~
He's still crap, his upgrade can't come soon enough next summer.

11181~~~
I can't stand him but he ran the game for about 30 mins, and was involved in the goal.

11182~~~
He's chaotic and this thing cannot be tolerated next season or even this in perspective of the cup.

Hopefully he'll get better in upcoming weeks.

11183~~~
He doesn't offer anything. Well, except the odd cross field diagonal pass that has all the pundits spooging over how "he's back".

11184~~~
I don't have the answer to that as I am unsure myself. My point is he has not been falcao'd as many suggested on here.

11185~~~
Team went to pot when he went off. That said if he's still starting games next season, it means we aren't good enough.

11186~~~
Statistically, he's still worse in the league this season than Falcao last season. May sound increidble but you can do the math (I mean the ratio of goals/assists to played minutes).

11187~~~
How he generated more power with his first touch than the pass from Memphis is incredible.

11188~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11189~~~
He has. He's not good enough for a top half club. Atleast Falcao was left out of the team after his shit performances. Rooney has been on the decline for years and done at top level for the last two.

11190~~~
For a player who was such an instinctive, raw footballer, nowadays everything he does are a few go-to moves that he's picked up through the years. 
His vision only seems to extend to the right wing. When Rooney had an influence in the game in the first half, our left winger Memphis was anonymous. Early second half Rooney struggled to pull the strings and we could see Memphis getting a lot more of the ball.
Credit for the pass that led up the goal, usually when he makes those passes the right winger has to wait and pull it down from a stationery position, but this time he managed to pass it in his stride which made all the difference.
We got worse after he went off, doesn't surprise me as I don't rate Lingard at all. It doesn't really say much about Rooney's quality, the lack of quality in our creative positions is damning.

11191~~~
So you're telling me Rooney isn't good enough for Southampton/Stoke or West Ham?

11192~~~
There was a drop in performance as soon as he went of. Played well.

11193~~~
Very good first half, very poor second, looked very tired. Good game to bring him back in though, should probably start again against Palace.

11194~~~
Good first half, 2nd half he may as well not bothered to come out (just like most of the other players too). But he's back from injury so can't fault him too much.

11195~~~
Everyone going on about how well he played in the first half. Wow! Against one of the worst teams to play at old trafford in recent years, acres of space to hit a ball across the pitch unchallenged. Yeah he's just back from injury fair enough but that second half is what Rooney has become. Slow, horrific touch, zero urgency and most of all a waste of place. He should be nowhere near the starting 11 but unfortunately will be.

11196~~~
This. Pretty much sums him up nicely.

11197~~~
Bad news he's back. Finished but will probably play all games. It's such a shame.

11198~~~
Not a sign of moving forward!

11199~~~
60 minutes under his belt is a good sign <a class="username" data-user="54956, @Amar__" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/54956/">@Amar__</a> so much for my theorem regarding his spot in the team. I concede that little speculation wholeheartedly.

11200~~~
So strangely enough I only just realised Wazza really is still our top scorer. Of course I knew it in the back of my mind, but I hadn't really thought about it fully before. Since he's now back from injury he might just end up as our top scorer, for the third season in a row.

That's pretty bizarre considering he had a whole fecking calender year where he only managed 5 league goals or something. I am not quite sure what to make of this. I will let this information digest for a night and I'm thinking it might just be for the best if I've forgotten about it tomorrow.

At the moment it feels like one of those existential scam questions - like <i>what is your greater purpose in the world </i>or <i>what is the meaning of life?</i> <i>What does it mean that Wayne Rooney has been Manchester United's top scorer for the last three fecking years? </i>Yo no comprendo.

11201~~~
Could say the same about....

Herrwra
Rojo
Jones

And so many more.

11202~~~
My worry is that we go into next season and hes still seen as a first choice when fit. Hes basically how Gerrard was for Liverpool in his last season there.

He was decent first half, but he really shouldnt be a starter for us. He plays like a 35 year old (not Giggs or Scholes 35 either).

11203~~~
I'm surprised by some of the posts that suggest Wayne played well v Villa.  On this day I'll give him slack for making his first appearance in two months, but he looked sluggish and uninterested.

11204~~~
Villa are bottom of the league, if you cant look half decent against them you may just give up altogether.

Interesting to see the effort he was putting in in the first half.  He must be concerned about his euro spot.

11205~~~
Very sluggish. Atrocious first touch. The only thing he can actually do well is the cross field pass to his favorite, Valencia.

11206~~~
Good first half, some nice passes and he seemed all over the pitch.

Tired in the second half and fecked up 2 opportunities with poor touches. Then he went off and we got worse as a whole.

He gets a lot of stick for his passes to the right, but feck me he has pretty much mastered that skill. Scholes was still better though.

I like the position he was in. I think he will be a solid option for Jose to play the Lampard role behind a big, mobile striker.

11207~~~
Very good in the first half, returned to normal self in the second half.

11208~~~
Was decent against the worst team in the league. The pass out wide leading to the 1st was good. But that moment where Memphis played him a nice pass in space and he managed to take a donkey touch, he has to do better.

11209~~~
And?

They are not supposed to be key figures in our team,  are not 30 +, and are not on 300 k a week. Do you spot the differences?

11210~~~
I think people now talk him up whenever he has a non-awful game. The guys on the radio were practically creaming themselves and Sky gave him MOTM yesterday.

11211~~~
He's never won the FA cup. Complete the set in May then dance into a Chinese sunset.

Please.

11212~~~
Yeah of course. Had a few neers last night and started talking nonsense it seems.

11213~~~
Sky even had an article on its site straight after the game highlighting his impressive return. Clearly his agent or vested interests are working hard to get him to the euros. 

He had a decent first half and was awful in the second. I'm sure we'll continue to see his awful post injury touches for the rest of the season but hey as long as he can do a long ball to the wing eh

11214~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3543815/Manchester-United-captain-Wayne-Rooney-furious-boss-Louis-van-Gaal-taking-start-injury-return.html#ixzz464PE0Nqq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a>

At Villa you train with the U-21's. at United you waltz back into the first team. I find it depressing how much our standards have dropped, and the worst thing is that it started under Ferguson.

11215~~~
Why are they not getting paid 300k a week though?... That is a difference that is often overlooked.

11216~~~
If only we could have Villa's standards.

11217~~~
Because they were not big stars. In the past. 

Let us resign Scholes and pay him 150k a week because 5-6 years ago he was a far better player than Herrera?

11218~~~
To be fair, we've looked more like a relegation threatened team than one vying for top four.

11219~~~
Scholes retired ages ago, why would we sign Scholes?.. 

They aren't getting paid that because they signed for the club for their market value. They weren't (Jones will no doubt progress in a similar fashion wage wise if the club deem it so) signed as young players and collected many years of service to club and country including a prominent position in its hall of fame pending and increased contracted pay through negotiating new deals via longevity of service.

11220~~~
I know why they aren't getting paid that. The question is whether Rooney contributes anywhere near to what a 300k a week forward normally contributes. He's beein terrible in the league for over a year now with the exception of 5-6 weeks. His goals to played minutes ratio is far worse than Benteke's and Benteke has been terrible for Liverpool, can't make the bench there.

Imagine that Rooney were now at Liverpool. Would he start there? At least 4 attacking players would be ahead in the pecking order, he would compete with Benteke and Sturridge to make the bench. But he is supposed to be a guaranteed starter at United. That's a receipt for a disaster.

11221~~~
It doesn't matter how much he's getting paid because of his longevity of service. Pay isn't negotiated on a week to week form basis, he's getting paid what he was worth to the club as a re-signing at the time of his last contract and the discussion shortens even further considering that it was his second negotiation and is already a prominent figure at the club through that longevity of service and his goal scoring stature and general status for club and country.

Yes, of course Rooney would start at Liverpool if he was being paid a massive amount of money. These hypothetical scenarios are also pointless, moaning about his wage is equally pointless. When the time comes the club will review his position on it's tenability if they decide that he's not being paid in accordance with his form and stature within the first team (oops another top scorer for the season honor incoming if Martial doesn't get his finger out) then the club will deem it fit to move him along.

Yelling "he is getting paid 300k a week guys!" all the time doesn't really mean anything. He isn't an import and his contract wasn't negotiated this season.

11222~~~
He's a waste of money and space. We sold all competition he had and didn't buy top strikers because he has to start (because of his big wages and long contract). That's not a problem at all?

Anyhow, the Liverpool scenario was invoked to demonstrate that he's not what we need in order to compete for the league, the financial aspect is irrelevant within the scenario. The problem is not what he gets from United but what he gives United. It hasn't been enough over the last few years, to put it mildly. 12 goals from open play this season, most of which against some pathetic teams, is precious little. He's the top scorer because the best United forward plays on the wing and because we tried to play him into form for the entire first half of the season in which he scored 2 league goals and contributed to ZERO points in the league.

11223~~~
He signed the contract off the back of a very average/poor season. So that argument doesn't carry much weight.

11224~~~
Rashford has played 547 min and scored 4 PL goals, contributing direcly to 7 points in the league (3 pts vs Arsenal, 2 pts vs City, and 2 pts vs Villa).

Rooney has played 1972 min, scored 7 goals and contributed directly to 5 points (including the assists, 2 pts vs Swansea, 1 vs Newcastle, 2 vs Liverpool).

So, Rashford played about 1400 min. less than Rooney and still contributed to more league points!

Great stat for the lad but quite damning for Rooney.

11225~~~
Actually find any hype around rooneys performance hilarious. He was maybe slightly industrious with his work rate and got a few tackles in, but besides that we could be a much better team buying someone for that position in the summer. His constant cross field long balls out wide and the time in which he was gifted would not be afforded against most other teams in all honesty. We hardly looked a better team with him fast tracked back in to the squad, and he was alot worse against Middlesboro U21s. I predict we will be pretty much in the same position we are this season with him allocated a place under any circumstance in the squad.

"Rooney takes a lot more time to get back to his best gaining match fitness etc etc" have been talked about for the past few seasons now. Wearing thin is an understatement. Watching him more and more you soon realise what this team could be without him there. Your looking at a handful (his spell after christmas)of games a season where you can say he warranted his place. But is that enough for a club of our stature? Im not sure.

11226~~~
Another instructive stat:

Rooney's best period was from the start of the year to his injury vs Sunderland in mid February. We won only 8 points in 6 games during this period, roughly 1.33 ppg.

After he got injured, we won 12 points from 6 games, i.e. we averaged 2 ppg. 

That's a big difference. 

Had we won 2 ppg over the course of the season, we would be on 66 points now.

11227~~~
Still baffled why we bother trying to pin down what's wrong with him.

He's just way past it now, simple as :\.

11228~~~
Our entire team managed to not look half decent.

11229~~~
Just one game against a relegated Villa and you'd think he put on a masterclass. Woke up this morning to "Wayne is back" "Wayne impresses on return" articles. First half was OK, second have was poor. England and United deserve what they get as continue to over hype Rooney.

11230~~~
Unless injured, Rooney is certain to be selected for Euro 2016 despite performances. So my question is would you rather sacrifice a midfielder, winger or striker for Rooney?

I think it will probably end up being a midfielder, with Rooney playing 10 to allow Kane, Vardy and Sturrdige (not at the same time) to play up front

11231~~~
Now I'm going to have to watch the game again tonight. 

I thought Rooney was poor, maybe a 5 at best, but I always give a player who's just returned from a long layoff some slack to get back into competitive form. I saw his classic (and pointless) cross-pitch passes go straight into touch, horror positioning (next to Smalling at the center circle when we had the ball) and no ability to beat a defender 1v1.  He just looked completely out of synch and uninvolved.

There was a 10 minute period in the second half where I was distracted so perhaps I missed some outstanding play that made up for his otherwise sluggish performance.

11232~~~
It was silent domination mate.

11233~~~
This.

11234~~~
I sometimes wonder if I know anything about football, considering how much people still rate Rooney these days. He's past it, and so is our manager.

11235~~~
You mean, the kind of domination that no one can even detect?  I understand now.

11236~~~
Unfortunately most sensible discussion regarding Rooney always somehow devolves into blurting out silly stinging one liners like "he is a waste of money and space" when it lends absolutely nothing to the discussion. The answer really begins and ends with a player offering over a decade of service and negotiating contracts. He's worth what the club offered on his last signed deal. The club can pretty clearly afford double and triple his wages so to me, it will become a problem when the club decide to get him off the books regardless of form, merit and service. (Not to mention just last season having two-three earners on the same wages and the club were quite happy to jettison those quick smart after a single season of failure. Hence my comment on imports and bought-in players on high wages opposed to long service negotiating a stepped set of contracts).

Van Gaal quite openly admitted he doesn't want competition for his strikers and it was Rooney's versatility that came to the fore last season and this season was hardly an indication of some grand plot to get rid of everyone for the sake of having Rooney as first choice. Any man and his dog can see the guy is not a very good hold up striker and having played that style endlessly this season it was only ever a hiding to nothing.

No he didn't (assuming you mean Ferguson's last season), the argument over his contract renewal also carries a lot of weight. The timing was crucial to the bargaining position of his negotiation as Ferguson had just retired, Chelsea/Jose were in hot pursuit of him and logically speaking there would have been a massive uproar if one of the first things Moyes did was let Rooney leave to a title rival. Considering he had two years left it was a no-brainer to retain him, even if Moyes was generally a bit daft.

11237~~~
If any of those teams were to buy Rooney this summer then that would be suicide for their ambitions. He might be good enough for Stoke but not WH and Southampton if those teams want to build on their current progress. 

I've said countless times that he's a United legend but the constant clutching at straws from those defending him is hurting our team enourmously. He's not the only one that need to be let go this summer, but he's the most important one. Fellaini won't receive as much gametime under a sane manager, and the likes of Rojo, Jones and, to some extent, Herrera, are now just fringe players.

11238~~~
Agreed, and people casually say he can go back to Everton. Why would they want him

11239~~~
Did anyone see Sky Sports piece saying he was brilliant on his return against Villa? I like Rooney and he has been a good servant for United but he is in decline and I can't stand how the English media think he's still the best thing since sliced bread.

11240~~~
There is a clear understanding on that among all English media. Be it Scholes, Rio or Neville commenting, it is never about Rooney.

11241~~~
Its the same for Joe Hart and plenty of others.

11242~~~
A shite midfielder, nowhere near the best striker at the club. The ridiculous attempts to get in him into the team are just mental.

11243~~~
Hes played well i just cant understand the ridiculous hate for the guy, hes a Utd legend ffs. Mata has been the only problem player in that midfield and honestly Rooney has shown enough for me that he should be granted an opportunity to make that position his own.

11244~~~
I keep saying this, he's had a terrible 2015 but if you think this half from Rooney was "shite" or "average" then you obviously have an agenda against him. He's been really good so far. whether or not he should be a part of the team is a separate debate.

11245~~~
He isn't that bad, but if that's some good midfield performance then we might as well play Fellaini all the time. I am not trying to be smart, but I seriously think many people have no idea what playing in midfield is all about.

11246~~~
Needs to just leave this club. Enough of his nonsense.

11247~~~
Correct. It's all simple, energy-saving passes with the odd flourish...like a guy who practises with a sand wedge in a field, paying shots to amuse himself.

11248~~~
I do get the hate for him when he was going months without a goal and playing shite, but if it boils over to being unable to give the guy praise when he starts scoring and plays well, then there's my issue. He's looking more effective in a central position than Mata, who is a Caf darling. Herrera too.

11249~~~
He's been thoroughly average, which automatically puts it into his top performances of the season.

11250~~~
He's done nothing to put him over other midfielders to play there. He's kept it tidy but let people run off him numerous times because he doesn't have the defensive awareness in midfield. I honestly don't see the point in playing him out of position or ahead of better players just because of his name or his captaincy.

<a class="username" data-user="64385, @Shark" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64385/">@Shark</a> more effective in what way?

11251~~~
yeh I agree hes a big money player so its right that we expect big things from him, but its a joke that while most of our player are playing crap under LVG people are saying lets give them the benefit of the doubt while Rooney gets thrown under the bus. Honestly, in 2016 hes looked like a far better player and we have certainly missed him at times. I think lots of people are jumping on the bandwagon mainly because they never really liked him.

11252~~~
Yet <i>again</i>: he's world-famous, a household name in Britain, our captain & our highest-paid player. As such, him being 'not bad' just doesn't cut it. If he weren't English, and if our club didn't make him its commercial figurehead (a self-fulfilling prophecy of guaranteed revenue, stemming from exposure), he'd be at a midtable club just to get regular games.

11253~~~
Midfield needs a revamp as a whole. Our midfield options are shite. He'll have to do till the end of the season.

Shame Pereira can't get an opportunity.

11254~~~
Fellaini or Schneiderlin play like that and they'll be criticised. Why would being okay be good enough?

11255~~~
Who are these better players in the squad you are referring to?

11256~~~
It's quite amazing how people can't notice this. He is absolutely terrible defensively in midfield, his reading of the game is really poor, I swear Mata is Carrick in comparision with him when it comes to reading of the game.

11257~~~
True but the bigger off the ball issue is that his legs have completely gone. Players just breeze past him. Not his fault but the springs have bust.

11258~~~
He's our Gerrard. I doubt anyone at United has the balls to move him in though. 

Now is the time to do Rooney what Fergie did to Keane.

11259~~~
Thats just absolute bollocks im sorry. Theres no way either Fellaini or scheiderlin could put a performance in like Rooneys tonight. He has spread the ball around the park brilliantly, showing all of passing range. People watch the game with blinkers on just to fit an agenda.

11260~~~
Total nonsense as per usual in this thread.

Good performance tonight, thought he had the most moments of quality alongside mata and Rashford, totally dominant in posession  and stayed very central in the middle.

Very easy game for us though.

11261~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Just have to disagree but that is laughable.

11262~~~
We all know Rooney takes a while to get back up to speed after ah injury lay off. Good performance considering. I don't think he's a center mid myself, but he did a job there when needed.

11263~~~
I don't think he'll ever recieve any praise here unless he scores 4 and assists 6 and saves a goal or two on the line. And even then people will say he's not worth 300k. A good performance today and it was far better than having Carrick/Fellaini play instead.

11264~~~
I'm a huge critic, but he was impressive today.

11265~~~
yeh you would disagree as people refuse to accept whats in front of their eyes. Yes Rooney overhit a couple of long balls but in general he switched the play excellently most of the game both right and left. I also havent seen one mention of his goal threat today, he was much better than any of our other midfield options have been this season at arriving late at the right time to the box having 3-4 chances, ala Lampard and could have easily scored a goal on another day with a couple of well hit strikes. Its just beyond ridiculous that its got to the point that even when he plays well people say he plays shite.

11266~~~
Good game from Rooney, hope it continues.

11267~~~
And yet you people accuse Rooney's critics of going to similar extremes. Are you going to roll out the old 'have some respect for such a great servant!' one next?

11268~~~
Only saw the second half and he didn't misplace one pass so he must of been awful first half based on these comments?

11269~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Whacking passes out to the fullbacks at every single fecking opportunity he gets isn't good football, it amounts to absolutely nothing whatsoever. The idea of spreading play is to change the angle of attack and make the opposition out of positon, he doesn't have the capability of pinging it out wide like Scholes with enough pace to actually do it.

He was afforded a lifetime in possession today and all he wanted to do is shift it to the fullbacks, please explain it to me, what on Earth does that achieve?

11270~~~
It was so easy that you can't praise any of the players tonight. Training would be more competitive than what we've just seen.

11271~~~
Tbf, he showed a range. The quality of the Hollywood's was below par though.

EDIT - Image failed to render. Go to stats zone for his passes.

11272~~~
That will be his epitaph for this season.

11273~~~
Nah, then they'll be " He's earnng 300k/w, He's expected to do atleast this much"

11274~~~
Tiresome thread.

11275~~~
Thought he was just fine. Where have people got the idea that he was shit today?

11276~~~
Strolled around a bit, knocked some passes around neatly.
Training ground exercise really.

11277~~~
its all well and good but if scholes put in that performance tonight then people would be eating it up and giving nothing but praise. He certainly spread the play today and thats a big reason why Darmian and Valencia looked way better in attack than normal because Rooney found them in space higher up the pitch. I just dont understand the attitude of fans that want to undermine and criticize positive displays just to fit in with an agenda that hes 'past it'. Maybe he is past it but that performance was very good none the less so dont pretend it wasnt. I have to say im genuinely intrigued what people would want Rooney to do in that game, apart from score theres not alot hes done wrong.

11278~~~
<i>Any</i> player getting 4 goals and 6 assists would get their due credit, and laughable comments like 'but it's only Villa/Palace/Atletico Domestos' would rightly be called-out for bitterness. This kind of hypothetical defence for Rooney doesn't cut it anymore.

11279~~~
No he was just a good first half but hey ho

11280~~~
Whose said he was terrible tonight?

11281~~~
Just read some of the posts on last page and its not hard to find...

11282~~~
I've read them. Quote the posts that said he was terrible *tonight*

11283~~~
Suspected as much.

11284~~~
They played well because we were up against CP reserves with a grand total of nothing to play for. That's the easiest game we will have this season, by some distance. 

I have no problem with Rooney, he's been a superb player for us and will be a genuine legend, that doesn't mean I'll pretend he's still at the required standard, you people are literally dribbling at any chance to praise the bloke.

He was afforded endless amount of time on the ball today and he did the same thing as he does every single fecking time he picks up the ball deep, he looks to play it high and wide to the fullback, he's almost become a parody of himself. A good footballer, an intelligent footballer picks the pass that's most likely to lead to a goal, Rooney is hooked on the cross field pass like Kerry Katona is to heroine. He doesn't even consider what to do with it, Rashford could be standing on his own through on goal and Rooney wouldn't notice him. The funniest thing is you're taken in by it! I'll say it again, if he switches it to get it out of a crowded area, far enough, if he plays it beyond the opposition fullback, fair enough, if he drills it as to force the opposition to scramble thier defense across, fair enough. But he doesn't any of those things, it's mindless regurgitation of something he's seen Scholesy do. All it shows is a complete lack of understanding as to how to play the position.

11285~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I bet Pirlo was jealous.

11286~~~
If that tonight was considered good then it's another testament to how standards have slipped, he strolled around and hit a few passes to the wings, his lack of mobility and the fact he can't dribble past anyone made him and Mata a one paced combination in front of the water carrier.

11287~~~
How did United line up today? 

I only saw the starting XI and assumed he was our striker

11288~~~
I mean they dont literally use the words terrible but then nor do i in any of my posts so i dont get your point... My point however, was that he was very good tonight while others are saying he was average or played like fellaini or schniderlin when thats simply not true. Many more posters have completely written him off and refuse to praise positive displays and thats frustrating when he plays well.

11289~~~
De Gea upfront; Bobby Charlton in goals, until LVG subbed him for Angus Deayton.

11290~~~
Usual set up except Rooney span around in a circle in midfield holding downing square.

11291~~~
Should had scored in the 1st half but otherwise was good tonight(Crystal Palace H)..  Still ways behind the level I expect of him to be, but at least he's healthy and roaring to play.

11292~~~
Right because i said that, this thread is a joke, praise a good performance get bombarded with people telling you why hes actually shit and everything youve just watched didnt happen.

11293~~~
He was good today, but given he's our captain and best paid player I would like to see much more from him in a game where the opposition could barely bother to play.

11294~~~
There were complaints he was getting loads of stick tonight. I've asked you to quote it and you can't. Nobody has said tonight he was terrible, shit, dreadful. I think "average" was the strongest description. Not exactly the hate you referred to is it?

Some of you guys have developed a victim complex on his behalf.

11295~~~
He was OK today. Seemed lighter on his feet and picked the right the passes.

But I've got a nagging feeling that we've changed shape to accommodate him and played him in a position that is his best shot at getting into the England 11.

11296~~~
It was an acceptable performance tonight, not particularly good or bad on the whole. A few nice diagonals with the odd messy moment.

11297~~~
Hey, don't blame me, if Rooney had any hair on him I would've definitely thought I watched Pirlo tonight. But with hair like that, he looked more like Shelvey.

11298~~~
Haha where? Nobody has said he was shit.

11299~~~
The guy has a good passing range i have no idea why that should be used as a weakness! His interplay the rest of the game was decent anyway, we areant exactly playing fast tempo football so not sure what hes meant to do in that regard. And i agree that CP team was shocking but at the end of the day you can only play whats infront of you. I really dont see whats wrong with giving a player praise after a good display

11300~~~
Good game, prefer him a bit higher up the park though.

11301~~~
you know people dont have to say the literal words to imply something right?

11302~~~
That's exactly what I was thinking, he's got more chance of pushing Dele Alli out of the starting 11 than Kane, so we are now seeing Rooney the AM in a 4-3-3.

11303~~~
This is what is annoying. Shoehorning him into the team. We have better midfielders. We have better strikers. Keep him on the bench and when Rashford comes off put him on then.

11304~~~
You guys, you guys.... what the hell is this place that we now have a divide between Rooney haters and fanbois, grow up. How can you not see the bias when after a GOOD display people say 'thats why he should be sold' or words to that meaning.

11305~~~
You're seeing criticism that doesn't exist pal. He's been described as average, ok, mediocre. Which he was.

11306~~~
He shouldn't get in ahead of Dele Alli but I can see Hodgeson shoe horning the two of them in as a pair of 8's with a DM behind.

11307~~~
How have you interpreted me into saying he has a good passing range? Actually Whacking a pass out to an unmarked fullback when you have all the time in the world isn't impressive. Being a good passer would ensure he occasionally plays something of a difficult pass, something difficult and creativem he's played the same pass, again and again and again without getting us anywhere. He's in midfield playing the creative role! He should be dictating our passing game.

11308~~~
I don't think he played at AM today. He seemed to be just ahead of Schniderlin to my eyes anyways. This is the formation we have all been asking for all season and now when he plays it we blame it on shuffling for Rooney to fit in.

11309~~~
Thats criticism when its leveled at a good display that was above many performances we've seen from our CMs this year

11310~~~
He was more involved than Mata thats for sure yet his thread isnt like this.

11311~~~
With Henderson injured I guess that other #8 spot has opened up and he'd get the seniority spot over Drinkwater.

11312~~~
Good game from him. Added some composure and creativity to our midfield and kept things ticking with his passing. Much better than seeing the snails Fellaini and Carrick in midfield.

11313~~~
Check the edited post and no, because he doesnt have posters pretending what he did was impressive.

11314~~~
I see lots of other posters saying good game yet they seem to be going under the radar... strange that.

11315~~~
I think Carrick should be let go and playing Fellaini in a midfield two is just stupid. 

That isn't much of a defense. I am not saying Rooney is totally finished and wouldn't even cut in the championship like some have suggested. 

But consistently over the last few years his perfomances haven't been good enough ,especially for a talisman. he is an embodiment of what we are as our club. Highly decorated ,record-breaking but slow,living of past glories and hoping that things will get better again,like they were years ago,based on very little evidence but hope.

11316~~~
I do agree with what youve said and no question he hasnt been good enough however, does he also not deserve a chance to play under a better system than the one LVG introduces that has quite frankly regressed half the team.

11317~~~
Ignore the post then mate, keep beleiving Rooney had displayed a 'good passing range'. Laughable.

11318~~~
Some funny comments, thought he played his role well the past 2 games.

11319~~~
feck me sideways, I thought people were taking piss again making him MOTM but then those stans are real.

11320~~~
Bang on

11321~~~
Thought he was mediocre tbh. I also have a slightly better haircut

11322~~~
I think fans have the right to be sceptical about Wayne Rooney. It's what he represents more than his ability that really annoys me and possibly other fans. 

Wayne is quickly becoming the most overrated player in terms of media hype and if the fans don't speak up no one would. He earns more than what the top performers earn and  every fan has the right to demand a performance that matches with it, regardless of past history. If Memphis puts in a 4, we should expect a 6 from Rooney if he is truly to carry that "top player" tag. But unfortunately he is not a top player anymore and he is on a decline and has been for years. 

This is an issue that can't be easily dealt with because of his new found status and privileges which are unwarranted. Sentiments is what is killing this club and we are too loved up to see it. We are hiding behind past glories and history is meanwhile clubs that don't have either are catching up in football terms; the only way that currently matters.

Wayne Rooney epitomises this silly culture. He is the only player in the league without any competition. Only player in the squad that can walk into the team easily regardless of how long he's been out or how long he's been out of form. And we wonder why the likes of Januzaj and Pereira are faffing about when they know their captain can be sipping pina colada in a bikini at carrington and yet make the starting XI ahead of them, regardless. 

The other reason is that for every minute he plays under LvG it further reinforces Wayne Rooney's place in squad next season even though he has been on the decline. What's worse is that the team shall always be built around him. I often wonder what would have become of Liverpool if they decided to give Gerrad the same treatment and build future teams around him cos Rooney is our Gerard. Teams get rid of captains and big players all the time even while at a decent level, Neville, Raul (a bigger legend for Madrid), Ronaldinho, van Bommel all come to mind. 

It's time to move on. Out with the old, in with the new. This season is a write off anyway. The future is ahead and should be brighter.

11323~~~
It was ok / decent / acceptable. 

Its a bit worrying if thats considered good though. Unless we are saying, thats good for Rooney nowadays, which then, ill agree with.

11324~~~
Respectable performance.

11325~~~
ok I'm no 'current' Rooney lover but he wasn't shit tonight by any means, however I wouldn't expect anything less against the dross he was playing against tonight. One point in the first half he was able to run from his own 18 yard line with the ball about 60 yards down the middle of old Trafford, nobody near him. He seemed surprised himself.  Yes he had some nice passes along with the obligatory wing passes sailing out of play. last 2 games have been a confidence booster against dire teams, when the level of opposition goes up it might be another story

11326~~~
In a possession based team, he kept the ball well, and tried to create openings when he had the chance. Didn't always come off, but at least he tried to pick runners out and get them in behind. Sometimes I feel we're guilty of overpassing it and constantly going sidewards.

11327~~~
Played well. People criticize him for it for some strange reason but the past couple of games, the Rooney -> Valencia pass has been our best route to goal and I wish we did that a lot more often this season as it advances the play for us more effectively then any other thing we do.

Also, I like us using a 4-3-3 and having him as the more advanced midfielder. Okay his touch and all that isn't that consistent, but days like today when it's normal it works perfectly fine and he has a much better impact then any other midfielder we play, considering he can play those long diagonals actually and is one of the only players willing to make a run in the box to add in the numbers. By no means should this be a long term thing, but it's probably the best option for the remainder of the season, having him in midfield in a midfield 3.

11328~~~
I just don't want to see us going into next season with him in that AM role.

Man City - De Bruyne/Gundogan
Spurs - Dele Alli
Arsenal - Ozil
Liverpool - Coutinho

We need to be aiming to match that quality in the position IMO.

11329~~~
mate he does it every game, the only reason it doesn't come off is most of the time playing against respectable defences, unlike last 2 games

11330~~~
To be honest, Friar Tuck has a better hairstyle than Rooney.

11331~~~
He really doesn't. Valencia has been injured most of the season so he didn't have the chance. Rooney also played up top most of the time so didn't get on the ball deeper to play those passes. He used to do it all the time, and while it was annoying before, it's far more effective then the other shit we see.

11332~~~
it doesn't depend if Valencia's on the pitch <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11333~~~
It being effective does... Valencia is great at reading that pass, getting on to it, bringing it down, and running with the ball to an advanced position. Sure if Rooney does it to Darmian nothing really happens, same with mata or Lingard. But the Rooney-Valencia combo is what is effective, even if many on here don't like it.

11334~~~
He actually does,  regardless of how high up the pitch he is deployed. In the name of being "bored " he'll randomly drop deep,  launch a 69.7 yard diagonal pass down the right and try to get back in the box @ 7km/hr. That's our Rooney!

11335~~~
So the effectiveness of the pass is dependent upon Valencia? 
That somewhat diminishes the impressiveness of the pass does it not? (if it can't be adapted to suit any of the other recipients of it)

It's a good ball when it hits it's mark, I can't deny that, but it is a 'go to move'/'canned response' that ultimately highlights Rooney's lack of invention. You could see tonight there were occasions when he was desperately looking for it but when it turned out it wasn't on he just played a bog standard 5 yard pass sideways. He spent so long trying to make it happen that he completely ignored any other movement ahead of him, he only had eyes for that pass and there is something deeply uncreative and frankly troubling about that.

11336~~~
I'm saying the whole move is generally effective, not specifically praising Rooney for being able to do it or always looking for it. Just saying it's more effective for us as a team to advance up the pitch compared to everything else we do. Never said it was some great or creative move though. But anyway, my point was that people always criticize Rooney for playing that pass even if it works pretty well when he does it with Valencia. I understood it before, when that's all he did despite us having other ways to attack and had a more functioning team with Fergie, but now? No point in criticizing him playing that pass when our only other method of attacking is Martial dribbling past half the team and hoping he picks out the 1 person we have in the box at a time. Rooney playing a diagonal to Valencia to then cross in beats that easily.

11337~~~
I understand and do agree that if it works then he needs to keep doing it for now at least. It does paint a rather grim portrait of where the team is at when we have so little viable variation in our build up.

11338~~~
Well we all basically know this though, so I'm okay with making do with our best option. Just like playing more direct through fellaini at the end of last season was seen as acceptable because it was our most profitable route to goal basically. Not in a million years do I want to see us play like that as a planned, long term style, but to get the best out of Van Gaal and what we have, why not.

11339~~~
So the one time this Rooney-to-Valencia move actually pays off (versus Villa) & Toni doesn't just, as usual, smash the ball against his opponent's shins or is desperately looking to lay the ball off without crossing...is now justification for the continuance of this crappy, failed tactic? Jesus...

11340~~~
It was an annoying tactic when Fergie was here but we have become so shit that it is far better then anything we do now. So yeah, it is more then justification as whenever Rooney plays Valencia like that he tends to be 1 v 1 with his fullback with a bit of space to be able to cross it, even if it's a bad cross. Also gives us time to get a few players in the box. 

What tactic do you see us use that is so much better? The only other attacking tactics that we have played since Van Gaal has come in is long balls into Fellaini to bring down, relentless crossing from wherever by Di maria (into nobody), or giving it to Martial to dribble past everyone and do something. So yes, give me the Rooney to Valencia to try and cross it over those options every single time.

11341~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
For starters, Rooney actually has to get that pass right too. Seems to have about 50% success rate with it. And <i>then</i> there's the 1% success rate of a good Valencia cross<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

11342~~~
We'd be mad not to sell him this summer. His value will only go down and whatever we get, clearing his wages would be helpful.

11343~~~
It's an utterly failed tactic, mate - it's self-indulgent of Rooney and, besides, Valencia's lost the attacking verve that once made him dangerous; so it's a waste of time. I've no idea of an alternative.

11344~~~
Valencia thrived when Scholes was here. His productivity fell off a cliff after Scholes left.

The reason is simple.

Valencia isn't a tricky winger who can beat his man with a bit of skill. He needs to receive the ball early in order to get a run on his marker. If he's afforded a bit of space he's still deadly.

Scholes' early cross-field passes were crucial to that tactic. Although Carrick is capable of it, he doesn't actually try it that often. Rooney does, and that's what brings the best out of Valencia.

If we want to persist with Valencia as a RB and Mata as a narrow winger - and I think we should -  Rooney in midfield has to continue. It's the only way we can get any width on that side of the pitch.

11345~~~
If this is 'the best' of Valencia then it's nowhere near good enough. He's lost so much since his (major) injury.

11346~~~
this for the life of me I cannot understand how he constantly gets away with it, playing for a possession obsessed manager. The mind boggles, he will find one that reaches then everyone gasps, the next 3 failed passes go un noticed. Any other top club in Europe he would be pillored for it.

Can you imagine if he was doing this with Keane still in the side?

11347~~~
Keep Rooney in midfield until the end of the season and Valencia will get there.

He's not lost that much, imo. He just never had it in the first place.

Managers needed to utilise him correctly if they expect consistently dangerous crosses.

Not that he wastes the ball much even now. He wins a hell of a lot of corners from his so called 'poor crosses that hit the first man'. Those corners are pretty valuable in their own right, given that they're the only times we actually manage to get bodies into the box.

I reckon if Rooney can start finding him early like Scholes used to do, we'll see a whole new dimension to attacking play down the right.

11348~~~
I thought Rooney was good today tbf

And I've been very harsh on him this season.

11349~~~
Nah, I've long given up on posters on Redcafe having any sort of respect for Rooney. Judging him purely by the game, he was good today.

11350~~~
Self indulgent?

That a player with usually 8 opposition players and a handful of teammates in front of him, in a compressed and tight space, with little movement(a whole other problem) decides to play it to one player in space and potentially in behind the opposition

Also ironic that united fans, I'm sure some of this Rooney diagonal pass hate group, bemoan our slow and static sideways passing will as quickly chastise a player trying a more difficult pass in behind the opposition or into an area of space.

So come off it, not only is it not self indulgent, it's braver than most. Fair enough Rooney might think it's a good looking pass or one he is confident of playing but really only he and Blind are confident enough and quality enough to attempt and succeed, with at least some regularity, these kinds of passes.

All this totally misses the point, he does it a handful of times each game and it's usually always on but he also regularly turned on the ball, drove with it and played it forward a good deal yesterday, provided through balls, kept it ticking over and was always offering himself, less so as the game went on and he dropped deeper but I think that was more a tiredness/comfortableness than anything else.

What else do you really expect or want, and do you hold everyone else to the same standards? I think not.

I thought he was good, probably one of the better performers, but not great yesterday... Certainly though anyone trying to criticise is blatantly looking for faults hyper critically and not being objective.

11351~~~
Also in what circumstance should Valencia be passed to? We don't want him having it in behind their RB near the byline, you're right. Maybe we should switch him and martial? The opposition will double mark Valencia and martial can collect Rooneys self indulgent balls to devastating effect!!! 

Are there any other players Rooney should know not to pass to in a professional game at the highest standard?

I'm sorry but that's laughable from you Steve.

11352~~~
His versatility came to the fore yet again, just watched the replay. He is still a very high quality all-round player. His touch, vision and ability to drive the team forward are important aspects of his game that we've missed this season due to the poor utilization of the 4-2-3-1. I think I would much prefer another proper midfielder in there instead of him but happy that he made a fine contribution overall.

I will re-open my "maturity" speculation due to the fact that he's moved to keep Rashford up front, if the gaff has wanted Rooney up front but he's left it for Rashers then I commend him. Would not be surprised if that was the case.

11353~~~
I think he did ok. Maybe the 4-1-4-1 is the best formation to use him in. Problem is that he's our highest paid player, and supposedly one of the creative players we're dependent on, so ok performances aren't really good enough.

11354~~~
Strongly disagree with the former.... And regarding the latter; 'if my aunty had balls, she'd be my uncle'. Even Van Gaal - in his infinite delusion - couldn't have justified moving Rashford out of the number 9 slot given his form.

Rooney is a club legend, but a has-been. He has his supporters & his critics, but I'd say the neutral fan would agree that his touch is bad, his passing (including short passing) is not what it used to be, his pace is gone, his stamina is a ghost, his tracking back is as gone as Jaap Stam & his hail-Mary cross-field passes have become as predictable and common-place as Gerrards in his final few seasons. His transformation is almost complete in a Gerrard-esque way.... I can only hope it continues, as Gerrards has, in another country, at another team.

11355~~~
Nobody is reading your bitter garbage.

11356~~~
I know you're a big Rooney fan but with hyperboles like this I would have thought you were talking about Xavi or Pirlo. Chill with the hype. Not the worst performance but nothing like your description!

11357~~~
Was an ok performance. A bit like O'Shea when he played there, but with less defensive acumen. 
It was against dire opposition as well.
Should that be what we expect of our highest earner, captain, first name on the team sheet?
For that I want a Pogba, not an O'Shea.

11358~~~
I am not that big of a fan of Rooney, I think we can be getting more out of him. I don't think you know what hyperbole means either.

11359~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> seriously, his touch?

11360~~~
Yes, seriously, his touch.

11361~~~
His touch was good in that game, I can distinctly remember him taking it in afew tight situations and dealing with it well.

11362~~~
I wasn't referring to this game tbh, I meant in general. One thing I wound't expect Rooney to be praised for would be his touch.

11363~~~
Yeh in general that is one of the areas where Rooney is either good or shocking for me there's no in between, but the last two games I would say have leaned more towards the good.

11364~~~
We are where we are because for three years we expect people like Valencia to create our goals. Valencia has 8 assists in last three seasons and yet some here are happy with our tactics to hoof it to Valencia. Amazing! On par with people who were for Valencia Young combo on wings just few months ago. 

Valencia is good outlet to carry the ball to oppossition half and keep the possession but passing it to him anywhere near the final third and expecting him to create something gotta be one of the most ineffective tactics ever. We have Martial on the left, Rooney, Mata and Rashford through the middle but yet somehow the better way to create something is to play it to Valencia, player who refused to score a goal in both last two games.

Btw this is slightly offtopic, so my bad.

11365~~~
If he is posting bitter garbage, then you praising Rooney for hypothetical situations where he wields the power to choose his own place in the team, where he plays and who else plays as maturity on his part is what exactly?

11366~~~
We're obviously not going to agree very much on these matters, mate. I'm often wrong about football topics anyway - for example, I would've sold Carrick years ago.

11367~~~
We've won thanks to an own goal and defender scoring screamer. Not Martial, Rashford, Lingard or Mata did anything better than Rooney tonight, yet it's Rooney who's getting most criticism. CP played like they've on training pitch but neither of our attackers managed to score a single goal, let's blame Rooney for that as well.

While only through ball to Rashford came from Rooney after his unmarked run through the middle of the pitch in second half which he missed, how's that?

11368~~~
I know everyone loves to mention that Rooney can only ping it to Valencia but he also played a really good ball into Rashford's path which, unsurprisingly, has been forgotten. If blogger boy did that, everyone would be praising him.

11369~~~
You're comparing Rooney to a 18 year old who was playing for the U18's at the start of the season? Well done.

11370~~~
To be fair, he's the only one that did try and force the issue with his passing. Sometimes we can be guilty of playing it too safe, which is why we create very few chances.

11371~~~
Mata, Martial and Lingard are all 18y old also?

And what about through ball to Rashford (who I don't blame for missing in case you though I was), you'll ignore that since it proves you wrong?

11372~~~
Rooney has higher avg ratings than all 3.

11373~~~
Good to know Ivaldo is an exception to the rule.

11374~~~
FWIW I thought he played poor-average too. And he deserves to be judged harsher than Lingard and Martial for sure. 
I thought the few spells of decent (not necessarily effective) football we had were made by Rashford, Mata and Lingard playing short smart passes/backheels. 
Rooney had a few good and few bad balls to the wight wing, and 1 good ball for Rashford. My stream wasn't the best but I can't remember anything else noteworthy.

11375~~~
Blogger boy did that twice vs Villa and was slaughtered for his performance.

11376~~~
Not one of them did anything of note, that's the point, they were all average or just above average yet it's Rooney who gets most critisicm while for the rest of them there's always some kind of excuse.

11377~~~
No, I also didn't mention Rashford's superb backheel or Martial run and cutback (which inexplicably resulted in a goalkick) either, nor several passes from Daley Blind or Valencia pass from the outside of his boot that put Rashford in. The fact Rooney could jog, not run, jog 40 yards without coming under any pressure tells you a lot, it was a decent pass, but I'd expect every United player bar Smalling to be able to make that pass from our starting XI. You're bigging it up as some kind of wonder pass, you're clutching at straws, go back and actually watch it, it really isn't anything special. This was the minium we expect from Martial and Rashford (I don't rate Lingard), that was one of Rooneys best performances this season and it's on bar with the minimum we expect from two players who will still be eligible for the U21's for at least another year.

As much as you want it to be true I hadn't said any of the players had a brilliant game, it was an average game for them, hence why I'm not praising them? How low has your criteria of a 'good game' fallen for Rooney?

11378~~~
Did I say it was special or that it was wonder pass? You've mentioned Rooney wouldn't notice him, but that pass proves you wrong whether you like it or not. Stop making things up just to fit your agenda.

Martial and Rashford are eligible for U21 for at least another year, what's the point of that? When are we allowed to compare them with other players? They play for the first team and are considered as our most promising attackers, so why not compare them with others, it's not like we're talking about some fringe players who play sporadically.

Rooney is finished as top player, it's clear as day, but he had good game yesterday. Not great, not brilliant, not something you'll rembemer in years time, but good, meaning he did his job. Don't be so negative and bitter, relax man, you'll get yourself heart attack because of Rooney and whether he's had good or bad game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11379~~~
The bolded part made me chuckle, did you not read what you wrote!!?

The fact you've taken that first paragraph literally is a little ridiculous, but if you want to get pedantic he was the only person ahead of him so he had no other choice but to play the blindingly obvious pass. You've mentioned the pass on several occasions, you clearly think it's something special or you wouldn't put such emphasis on it, sad your standards have stopped so low really.

Because these two players haven't fully developed yet, infact there's plenty here arguing quite credibly that they shouldn't realistically be starting regulars in a United side, yet our £300k a week striker is being compared to them to state he had a good game, again, where are your standards at with him man? That wasn't a 'good game', it was stupendously average.

11380~~~
Would you compare Ronaldo and Jese even if they share the same pitch?  NO!  Why?  Expectations are higher and rightly so. Over in La Liga, there is commotion when either one of the big players go on a run of 5 games without a goal but at United, our so called talisman can go 3 months with no goals but it's kinda cool. This is why we are where we are. Fans don't have the bottle to criticise or question our so called big names / talisman. 

If we can't be expecting Rooney to be putting on superior performances on a very regular basis let alone when compared with the likes of Lingard,  Memphis,  Martial et al, then why are we complaining about LvG?

If those lads put in a 5/10 on a weekly basis,  I want to see at least a 6.5/10 from captain sir knight admiral Rooney. Standard.

11381~~~
Again, I've mentioned that pass just to prove your agenda wrong since you've tried to make Rooney as someone who can't see Rashford even if he stands infront of him which isn't true. He played him in nice chance, it wasn't anything special or glamorous and no matter how obvious it was it did happen, so your 'Rooney wouldn't notice Rashford' theme just won't stand. Stop making things up, that's why you sound bitter.

Martial, Rashford, Lingard and Mata are players who, alongside Rooney, play attacking positions at United. Who should we compare Rooney with, defensive midfielders perhaps? If you take into consideration that no one from attacking players did anything of note, besides fancy flicks, then all had pretty average game, but it's Rooney who gets singled out.

11382~~~
That is to be expected in the Rooney thread.

11383~~~
True <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yet it happend even when he had really good games this season (not too many I know).

11384~~~
I'm not a fan, but he's done well in these last 2 games.

11385~~~
He gets singled out because he earns similar money to messi and ronaldo but produces nothing like what they do to say the least, he is championed among the English media as some kind of marquee player when he is anything but, his position at the club benefited from circumstance, changes in manager, moyes gave him a ridiculous contract, then LVG made him captain, said it before, SAF had him gone, had SAF not retired Rooney was leaving, simple as that, there was no better judge than SAF to notice when to move on a big player.

11386~~~
I'm happy to see him in midfield. I know it's far from Rooney at his peak but I think we're better off with him there as we've got other players that offer more behind the striker or as a striker and he is our best option right now in midfield with Schweinsteiger injured. Much better player than Fellaini and a better partner to Schneiderlin than Carrick.

His long balls to the flanks is probably his biggest asset in the role because it allows us to transition to attack more quickly than before. A Scholes-lite.

11387~~~
Not sure he offers more than Carrick in midfield at all. And that's coming from someone who thinks we should be letting Carrick go after this season. What I would say is that he has less of a potential to slow down our attacks or be the focal point of everything in the final third when he's in a two man midfield. It won't do against better teams though. And Scholes, well, let's call it how it is: Scholes wasn't fast, but you could not harass him off the ball, he could pass both feet, he had vision, and was never uncomfortable in possession. I feel Rooney plays it safe and looks like the one player in our team opposition players could actually win the ball from. I actually think he's shown too much respect by opposition players. It won't last long.

11388~~~
I disagree with a lot of it. Rooney isn't a holding midfielder like Carrick and therefor there's better balance with him partnering Schneiderlin. I just don't like the Carrick-Schneiderlin at all and I think it's only been used as a necessity this season.
Rooney isn't easily bullied off the ball and he's got a better head than most of our players. He's a lot better than any of our midfielders inside the box and he's more dangerous with the ball outside the box. Our goal against Villa is something we haven't seen this season but it wasn't uncommon when Scholes was playing.

I don't like him up top and I think he's better than what we currently have available to us in midfield so I think we should continue to play him there.

11389~~~
the only role i can think of for rooney right now is as an advanced midfielder in a 3 man midfield (more of a no.10 role then i supposed).

we got rashford now, maybe and should bring in a top striker that can get us 20 league goals next season. no way rooney is going to be our CF. he doesn't have the pace to be a wing forward, and we got martial, lingard, memphis and hopefully a new signing there as well.

11390~~~
Tbf apart from DDG, Smalling, Shaw and Martial (with Rashford as youngster) no one in this squad contributes enough if judging by previous United high standards or nowdays Cristiano/Messi performances. The rest of the squad plays well beneath what is expected from United player, and it's not like they've been playing for free out of love for United while Rooney is only one on high wages. Also I agree with what you said, and he should be moved this summer, but we should ship almost whole first team with him as well except for above mentioned players.

11391~~~
The bolded part made me chuckle, did you not read what you wrote!!?

The fact you've taken that first paragraph literally is a little ridiculous, but if you want to get pedantic he was the only person ahead of him so he had no other choice but to play the blindingly obvious pass. You've mentioned the pass on several occasions, you clearly think it's something special or you wouldn't put such emphasis on it, sad your standards have stopped so low really.

Because these two players haven't fully developed yet, infact there's plenty here arguing quite credibly that they shouldn't realistically be starting regulars in a United side, yet our £300k a week striker is being compared to them to state he had a good game, again, where are your standards at with him man? That wasn't a 'good game', it was stupendously average.
Well done on ignoring my second paragraph entirely, kudos. To repeat myself, don't take everything you read other Internet literally, it's not good for your health.

Using the words 'bitter' and 'agenda', could've added 'haterz gonna hate' while you were at it. being a United fan, what would I be bitter about exactly, I'd like specifics please. And agenda? What's my agenda against Rooney? Id be over the moon if he was scoring 40 goals a season and putting in regularly man of the match performances, but he's not. You seem to be getting very upset that someone else has a differing opinion to you over a player.

Who do you compare Rooney to when he's playing in midfield, how about, I don't know, midfielders? Crazy I know. He is getting singled out, by the likes of you for having an average game for passing the ball sideways for 90 minutes.

11392~~~
He is posting bitter garbage. Also so what if I want to praise Rooney? There was a thread on here asking who would be dropped and a lot of people were saying Rashford and that probably would have been the right move in terms of stature. Rooney is still the captain and Van Gaal has also said they discussed the team selection and how Rooney would return to the team and get enough minutes. So far it has been at the expense of Lingard and then at the expense of rotating Fellaini/Herrera. Not Rashford, I don't really think it is out of this world to make a connection between the gaff and Rooney sorting out to keep Rashford up front. It also goes with Rooney's versatility and persona. I've also made no secret that it is purely speculative.

11393~~~
Ignoring, like you've done several times about being wrong with his pass to Rashford?

So what about Mata or Morgan, both played even safer choice of passes, for what is worth Rooney at least tried to switch play or do something other then only passing to the first player besides him.

I don't mind others having different opinion from mine, but making things up or overlooking positive things just to fit in your opinion, well that just doesn't suit me.

11394~~~
People in the media said he was like Scholes in midfield the other night <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Laughable.....Maybe Scholes when he was 38 or whatever

11395~~~
Most PL midfielders would be chuffed to be compared to a 38yo Scholes! Let alone Wayne Rooney!

11396~~~
You really aren't reading are you? I 'ignored' your point about Rooneys pass yet you've already agreed with me it wasn't that special?

[QUOTE="Black Adder] He played him in nice chance, it wasn't anything special or glamorous [/QUOTE]How very odd you were able to respond to something I apparently didn't say/ignored.

No, Mata or Schneiderlin didn't have particularly great games either, that's why they aren't be praised? Have you been over to their threads lately? They get more than their fair share of criticism mate. But no sorry, it's just poor old Rooney who gets unfairly treated. Unbelievable.

11397~~~
think i'd look like Scholes playing against Palace considering the space they gave us

11398~~~
It takes one good(or above average) match for Rooney in the midfield position for Scholes comparisons to comeback.

11399~~~
You're posting the praise and then trying to shut down someone that sees it another way by calling it bitter garbage. You're so desperate to praise him that you're using speculation to praise him for doing something that he should have no say in. No player should have a say in team selection or whether or not another player is given enough minutes, especially when said player has proven to be self absorbed in the past and his form has been for the most part completely woeful.

"Eeeehhhh boss drop this guy for me instead. Eeeehhhh."
"Eesh very mature of you Wayne to choose Lingard inshtead of Rashford. You are brave like me, yesh?"
"Eeeehhhh. Yeah?"
"Yesh"

11400~~~
He is the captain. Every captain in the history of football has had a voice where team selection is concerned. Van Gaal himself even confirmed that they spoke about it in his press conference.

I also have no idea what those quotes mean. So okay then.

11401~~~
You're speculating again in order to defend one player being given too much sway.

11402~~~
No, I am not. Although I did set you up with a <i>delicious </i>opportunity to throw the boot into Rooney with this quote.

11403~~~
I've seen that quote and it was as ridiculous then as it is now. It's just evidence that LVG is far too enamoured with someone that doesn't deserve it.

Every captain having a say in team selection is speculation. I doubt Terry was having much say when he was dropped or when he tried to Mutiny under Cappello.

11404~~~
I mean, if the gaff literally telling you how it happens isn't enough, then I have no idea what would be.

11405~~~
Rooney the dietician.... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11406~~~
This

11407~~~
He probably discusses team selections around the lazy Susan at Wings!

11408~~~
Isn't enough what? My points are:

<ul>
<li>It's not maturity to choose to keep Rashford in the team and he doesn't deserve praise for it. It's common sense and he shouldn't have walked straight back in anyway.
</li>
<li>He shouldn't be picking the team or any of the kitchen staff. Imagine your job depending on some millionaire that struggles with the basics of his own job.</li>
<li>Every other captain in the history of football getting that kind of voice in team selection is pure speculation. Apparently Raul could choose the team by going above the managers head but that's not the norm.
</li>
<li>My main point though was you can't shut someone down as posting "bitter garbage" because they have the opposite opinion while praising Rooney for hypothetically being mature doing something he shouldn't even be doing. He's a player with a vested interest in taking another players place, he shouldn't have a say in team selection. I don't doubt LVG let's him do it, but that's part of our problem. It's not praiseworthy.</li>
<li>This wasn't one of my points but I enjoy bullet points so I'm going to put it here anyway. You could argue that if it was Rooney himself who agreed to keep Rashford in then he did it for selfish reasons as it will be easier for him to compete for a midfield slot with Henderson injured than it would be to compete with Kane and Vardy for a place. Pure speculation too, obviously.</li>
</ul>

11409~~~
This is mostly just you speculating verses me speculating (or providing a pretty solid answer to one of your bullet points) so in the end we can agree to disagree it matters not a jot to me. I usually try to be as impartial as possible because any kind of positive patterns of thought and light praise is descended upon with ghoulish petty nit picking similar to this here.

That poster regularly posts bitter garbage. He was in one of the other threads yesterday saying how disgraceful Woodward was because he had to leave to do urgent transfer business at the start of pre-season in the Moyes season to hand Rooney a new deal. Unbeknownst in the bitter haze that he signed the deal in FEB of 2014. Maybe that is why we were so crap that season as we were in pre-season in February.

Calling a bitter garbage post a bitter garbage post is all I have done, I don't see how my opinion on Rooney is related to that.

11410~~~
Rooney has input on what players eat? mind blown

11411~~~
Shame he doesn't have an input on what he eats <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11412~~~
"My captain shall always eat"

11413~~~
.
World class strikers are judged harshly on their own high standard,  and wayne rooney gots the praise by only a "if only that pass clicks" 

There's people calling ronaldo a one trick pony and there's people calling rooney silent terminators... 

Internet...  Serious business

11414~~~
There's this one game where he pings the high cross to right wing and the crowd gasp (because there's nobody there) 

Shows he never really think much,  he just do that one thing he does best and looks good without even looking whethere valencia is there or not.

11415~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11416~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11417~~~
I said weeks ago during the debate about Rooney's role for England this summer that I suspect he will start in midfield alongside Dier. LVG is certainly making it easier.

11418~~~
Well done captain.

11419~~~
That was bloody brilliant tracking back.

11420~~~
Excellent work from Wayne.

11421~~~
He's never won the FA Cup, he'll want this more than anybody else on the pitch.

11422~~~
Well done Wayne, awesome.

11423~~~
Again great play, that's what we need to see from him in there, not mindless crossfield passes.

11424~~~
He's actually looking forward instead of to the right, which is a big improvement for a start.

11425~~~
He's been really good throughout 2016.

11426~~~
Credit where it's due, he's been excellent tonight. At a standard where he should be fairly regularly.

11427~~~
Fair play to our captain, has really stepped up in 2016 and it's great to see.

11428~~~
First 40 minutes has been fantastic. Probably the best he's played for a long time.

11429~~~
I have to say he isn't giving me any reason to complain in that central midfield role next to Fellaini. His control looks good and his passing isn't too one dimensional. Maybe LvG can make a good central mid out of hi after all.

11430~~~
Great first half. If we had a midfielder performing like this all season we'd be in the top 4.

11431~~~
Was struggling towards the end of the half, naturally. Can't see him lasting beyond 70 mins.

Cracking first half though. If ever a game was made for him to do well in, this was it and so far he's done it all but score.

11432~~~
Excellent so far.

11433~~~
Absolutely brilliant so far. Hopefully he'll consistently show those kind of performances.

11434~~~
God sent. That was a certain Cleverly goal.

11435~~~
Continuing where he left off against Palace. Got on the ball, spreaded play brillaintly. His ball to Lingard was terrific. Don't normally see that from our midfielders.

11436~~~
Great half. From one of his detractors.

11437~~~
Has started this second half poorly though.

11438~~~
I don't agree, he's been driving us forward.

11439~~~
Not so good this half. Needs to exert far more control on the game from here he's playing tonight

11440~~~
He's absolutely disappeared, him and Carrick have no control in the centre whatsoever.

11441~~~
Looks like he wants me to criticise him. I've tuned in around 60th minute and have barely noticed he is playing. I should rewatch the first half.

11442~~~
I thought he did okay today.

11443~~~
Brilliant 1st half, not so good 2nd half.

11444~~~
In the second half he, Carrick and Fellaini just didn't have the legs for the battle.

However, that's for the manager to get right.

This time I'm going to raise Rooney because he was very good. Unlike the other two peformances where people were praising him for being acceptable or decent, he was genuinely good today.

11445~~~
Probably the only few on here who doesn't want to see him gone. I just hope he stays for the next season.

11446~~~
Brilliant tracking back, he still had that diligence to not give up despite not having the legs in the second half to do too much.

11447~~~
Good start but then faded out in the 2nd half

11448~~~
Great 1st half. Tired out in the 2nd.

11449~~~
He was good but he still had moments where he took so long on the ball where we kind of needed urgency.

11450~~~
Mature performance.

11451~~~
I thought he had a very good game but not sure what happened to our midfield in those 25 mins in the 2nd half when we got over-run.

11452~~~
He played really well today in a more withdrawn role. His touch and passing was spot on.

11453~~~
He could have done with having Morgan alongside him at the end. Understandably tired in the second but very good performance.

11454~~~
Completely disappeared when we were under the cosh. And that is exactly why he should never be played in midfield. Doesn't have the all round nous for it, like a proper midfielder should absolutely have

11455~~~
His touch was good, and he mostly chose the correct option. Can be a little easy to get past, but that's ok.

11456~~~
He's only back from injury.

11457~~~
He's been injured.....but showed more than Basti can offer in that match.

11458~~~
He was very good I thought. He tired in the second half because he isn't fully fit. If he can play like that constantly in midfield then he will be excellent for us. He is a leader on the pitch too and we need that.

11459~~~
This.

This is the 3rd game where he has excelled in the first half and completely tailed off in the second. Still needs to be moved on.

11460~~~
I agree he was tired and you will also see that I praised him after the first half. However, it's not the first time that he's disappeared in midfield when the team is under pressure. He should still be played in attack.

11461~~~
Good first half when Everton weren't playing. Once they stepped up I thought he wasn't looking that good. Had it been anyone other than Rooney, I reckon they'd have been substituted.

11462~~~
A typical captain's performance. 

Faded a bit in the second but was still running his ass off and bringing the ball forward.

11463~~~
I thought he started off lively and then for some reason was switched to the deeper of the two #8's and had less impact on the game. He did make 2 or 3 very good tracking runs back there though.

11464~~~
nah....bring him into the midfield role...there is no way Rooney would have scored that Martial goal at his age...honestly.

11465~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/99r5" width="560"></iframe>

11466~~~
Very pleasing first half, not good enough in the second.  A club of our stature starting a midfield of a 500 year old carrack, fellaini and Rooney is ridiculous.

11467~~~
Give him a fecking break, Jesus. Some posters on here need to get a grip.

11468~~~
Almost like any player coming back from injury....

Thought he was one of our better players today. Him, Fellaini and Martial were our 3 best, after de gea.

11469~~~
What, I said he was very good in the first half, but he wasn't in the second. He was still better than the other two.

11470~~~
Very good first half, but was given all the time in the world like against Palace, second half Everton came at us and he was lost. We might as well not have had a midfield in thst second half. He and Carrick were anonymous.

11471~~~
Was excellent

And has been good since he returned. Was also good before his injury

I don't think the next manager will be as stupid as most of you lot and will still value him as an important player

His experience alongside the young lads will be vital as they progress

11472~~~
Surely we can give praise to the guy without running him down in the same post though. He's only back from injury so he was always going to fade away as the game went on.

11473~~~
Good game from Rooney. Not only on the ball, but made some pretty impressive block and tackles, especially the one in the first half.

11474~~~
Good game, a mature performance.

11475~~~
Good game, some nice balls behind the Everton defence in the first half.

11476~~~
All I want is for him to be stripped of his special privelidges. No player should be able to serve up that disgraceful trash he did in the first half of the season and still start by default. If he's playing well, I see no reason why he shouldn't play.

Also, I don't think we'll be going in with the kids next season. Unless our ambitions are low.

11477~~~
He faded badly in the second half. His stamina levels showed.

11478~~~
That's the key thing, he needs to be like everyone else and only play on merit, and we shouldn't be buying with an eye on it not effecting his starting spot.

11479~~~
BBC gave him MOTM <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> He was anonymous in the second half.

11480~~~
Are you surprised? This is Wayne Rooney we are talking about. It's things like this that poisons any little good he does. Would they have given Mata or Herrera that rating with the same performance? I think not!

11481~~~
Was our 4th best player IMO. Even our twitter account nominated him ahead of Fellaini, who I believe should have been MOTM

11482~~~
Thought he was very good in the 1st half.  2nd half, not as good but we were largely shit as a team.

11483~~~
Danny Murphy named Martial MOTM

11484~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36060627" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36060627</a>

11485~~~
Rash, fosu, CBJ, Lingard and Martial should all feature heavily next season 

If that new manager is Jose and he doesn't look to progress them, many of our fears will have come true

11486~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Man of the match - Wayne Rooney</b>

Wayne Rooney had one shot on target and created two chances but it was his control from a deep-lying role that allowed United to dictate the tempo of the match, especially in the first half

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36060627" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36060627</a></span>

11487~~~
How can anybody seriously watch that game of football and not think that Martial was the best player on the field? Stunning.

Rooney was good, to be fair. A midfielder he'll never be, however.

11488~~~
Write to BBC please! They may want to hire you, who knows? They are paid good money!

11489~~~
It's bizarre how he wins that.

He did fine, fizzled out of the game a bit but was very good in the first half, I thought. But overall, I think Martial, De Gea, Fellaini and Rashford were all ahead of him, in that order.

11490~~~
I never get that comment. He played in midfield today, didn't he, and did a damn good job at it. Actually, he has done since he's been playing there in the last few games.

11491~~~
Well, it's all relative. He's just about good enough to play well in midfield for a fifth place United team that have managed to scramble together a (somewhat fortunate) cup run. I mean, he isn't completely terrible.

But he isn't good enough to play in a United midfield that aspires to be one of the very best.

11492~~~
Couldn't have said it better.

His leadership still worries me. During the 5-3 collapse to Leicester he was stood at the edge of our box screaming at a clearly very nervous Smalling and Blackett, which didn't appear to help matters. Screaming at people under stress rarely seems to help actually. Then tonight I noticed Danny Murphy was praising him for prolonged screaming at TFS after he had looked nervy in possession. It doesn't seem like it's going to help matters. I know it's only two incidents, but aggressive shouting at nervous kids seems like a bad idea to me.

11493~~~
Did you watch the match today? He was top class. Passes like Scholes.

11494~~~
I think it was definitely overstated just how "bad" and how "finished" he was at the start of the season. The jury is still out because nobody has nailed down LVG's 9 properly and a whole season of it not working will probably indicate that adjustments will have to be made at a structural level, rather than a personnel level.

Glad to see him finding form at the right end of the season. Big game player and I still find it completely mental that people are deluding themselves into thinking he should be sold. I hope he carries this form through to the Euro's it will mean a much better finish in the league and possibly even an FA CUP!

11495~~~
He was good, but tailed off in the second half. He plays <i>one </i>pass like Scholes, but then so can Jonjo Shelvey.

11496~~~
One of his best performances of the season (not difficult, I know), even if he did fade in the second half. He's still got it when he fancies it.

11497~~~
He was good today but I do think he was helped by Everton deciding to give every United player about 10 yards of space on the ball. I think we've all seen enough of Rooney in midfield before to know he's just not good enough to do anything there long-term for us. His touch and short-passing are nowhere near good enough and he gets a pass just for his ability to switch it out wide and his desire to play.

11498~~~
One? He missed 2 passes today. Our entire team tailed off in the second half, is that related to Rooney not being 100% fully fit after this layoff ? Dont forget his vital interception on our goal line in the first half either. He was everywhere. Contrast this with our other midfield options.

Unfortunately, people still hold a barbaric view on leadership on the pitch; by shouting and screaming at players and ref, red mists, hot tempers and what not. All you need is to look at the likes of Lahm, Pirlo, Xavi and hear what the younger players under them have said. The common denominator is not the shouting and barking but sensibly reiterating the match tactics and calming nerves of players when they stray out of line. I was miffed at him shouting at TFM myself, when the lad was nervous.

11500~~~
I don't have a strong opinion on this but you've basically invited half the posters to blast you with a Roy Keane nostalgia/worship/circlejerk,

11501~~~
A very good thing that you don't have to be the recipient of one of his verbal on field roastings. You might just turn to cinders and float away on the breeze.

11502~~~
I didn't think he was that good. 

He was pretty decent when Everton were sitting there letting him do whatever he wanted, but the number of times he ignored an effective pass to try one of his silly Scholes balls was annoying. If there's a simple pass on to someone in the middle in a good position, play the fecking pass, dont ignore it to try and be a flash prick...especially if you cock up your flash prick passes over 50% of the time.

Then in the second half he joined in the meltdown panic party with Blind and co. 

Every time Rooney plays in midfield the commentators act like he's Pirlo or something just because he's not ejtirely awful at passing the ball. As if this is some massive shock.

11503~~~
I think it was related to his lack of legs, yes. Carrick and Fellaini had the same problem, in fairness The game was crying out for one of Herrera or Schneiderlin in the second half to help combat that.

Rooney doesn't pass like Scholes, really. He's not even close. He drills that ball out to the right but that's where it ends. Look, Rooney has had a couple of good games in this attacking midfield role, that's undeniable. But surely we've all seen enough in the past to know that he isn't the long term answer in this role? He's far too erratic.

11504~~~
Was before, but now seems to have a bit maturity about him. For me, he is better than anything else we have in the middle.

11505~~~
TBH Fergie saw this three years ago that he should be playing in midfield. Hes not a striker especially since he likes to drop deep soo many times meaning we have nobody up front (if he starts there). 
His first half was his best performance ive seen in a long long time.

The problem for him is that he cant do it for 90 minutes if were going to be playing 2 or 3 times a week. We need to put him in a position where we use him sparingly, and if we use him as part of a three in midfield (which is the only place we should play him) it needs to be with more mobile players. I actually wouldnt mind him playing the deepest role of a midfield three, if our aim is to control matches or play on counter. That way he can do what he knows, playing the ball out wide, or the long ping that means others can break at pace.

11506~~~
It's been two games. Palace were woeful and Everton are in dire straits. I prefer all of our other midfielders on the whole.

11507~~~
Was impressive today, first half he was brilliant and made loads of good interceptions and tackles. Quite happy with him in midfield tbh he's a talented player just had no pace now.

11508~~~
This will be his new role and for England as well. 

You have to get on him when he is in that left pocket and this gives the speedy forwards more space to run into.

11509~~~
Ha, yeah I figured that when I posted it. Keane taking that tactic too far when no longer being able to reach those standards himself was his eventual downfall. I loved Keane and there's obviously a place for screaming at people. I think Rooney actually needs someone to bollock him and a few other players could do with it too, my issue is with screaming at kids when they are already looking nervy. Maybe that's why he himself seems to lack the fire and drive these days, he just needs someone else to lead him.

 Exactly. It's all a bit basic like the view that running around more makes you a better player and shows you care more even though you've ended up way out of position. There's going to be players that react well to being screamed at, but it's rarely going to be a teenager that's looking like he is struggling to cope with the pressure. Maybe he tried the calm words first, but I'm just going off what I saw/heard.

11510~~~
Very good performance, he's made a difference in our midfield and there hasn't been a sign of the usual "I need 2-3 months to remind myself how to kick a ball" after his recovery.

11511~~~
we all tought he would end up in midfield at one time.

He will finish off his contract there and I have no complaints if he plays like this.

11512~~~
A decent game from him. 7/10 for me. All our midfield looked OK today. Has to be said that Everton's midfield contained two absolute passanger midfielders in Gibson and Cleverley, but Rooney looked quite sharp.

11513~~~
Rooney was good today. That said, when Everton had their tails up and were taking it to us in the second half, I thought that he (and Carrick) needed to do more to get things back under control. I can certainly see Rooney playing in this position moving forward. Van Gaal, Mourinho, Giggs...whoever is in charge next season...must surely see that he can't lead the line anymore. I wonder, though, how well he'd do against a team with a quality midfield. Everton wasn't the toughest test in that regard. 

Rooney isn't going anywhere, I don't think, so the team will need to figure out how best to use him. This may well be it.

11514~~~
McNulty is an unrestrained moron.

11515~~~
Typical

11516~~~
I thought Gibson was terrible but Cleverley was much better - as well as any of our mids.

11517~~~
Indeed

11518~~~
yeah Cleverly did well. had an airshot which could well have ended in the net.

11519~~~
Had a brilliant first half but the lose of control coincided with him looking knackered and trying to slow the game down, when better option was releasing the ball quickly into the opposition half. It could helped evade the high press and rough challenges.
I like him with possession in this role but defensively he is lacking.. His posture when defending doesn't block the space, instead opens it up for the opposition. Not sure it'll be a hindrance going forward as long as he has an able partner.

11520~~~
Haven't read the above comments but I thought Rooney did well today. Played some gorgeous passes in the first half. To come back from injury to that is a pretty decent, especially against a team he is usually shit against.

11521~~~
It was interesting that today he ended up being deeper than Fellaini in the midfield 3, and even against Palace Mata was the AM and Rooney was the slightly deeper of the 2. If this is going to be the way he squeezes another season or two out of his career then I hope we get some legs in there with him in the summer and a proper AM to play the slightly advanced role.

11522~~~
Comms said he missed 12 games, he's come back at a very high level in my opinion. Which bodes well for us and for England at the Euro's.

11523~~~
goal.com headlines like "Rooney Thrives In Deeper Midfield Role" enough to make me ill these days...

11524~~~
Don't read goal.com and you won't be subjecting your brain to rot.

11525~~~
Not as good as Fellaini... and doesn't that really say it all

11526~~~
We've seen this all before. Rooney drops into the midfield role, has a couple of good games, everyone says it's the reincarnation of Rooney. His form goes to pot and everyone clamour said for him to be moved higher up. 
For our sakes hope his decent form continues.

11527~~~
Rooney's been very good since Christmas and hadn't he been injured we'd be in a much better position in the league.

11528~~~
He was brilliant for the first 20 minutes. Slowly tapered off after that though.

11529~~~
Had a few good moments but I thought he became a passenger for most of the game.

I can see him starting in midfield for England, might not be the worse option considering the other options.

11530~~~
His first half was like going back a number of years. He works so hard for the team and never shirks effort even when it's not going quite right for him. He tired in the second half and that is understandable since he's been out injured for quite some time. He's older and will not be able to sustain his energy levels throughout a match when coming back from injury like he did when he was younger - especially on that Wembley pitch.

I get tired of Rooney knocking, he's given his whole footballing career to this club. No one has to like him as a person, but people surely can't argue with his eventual loyalty and influence he's had on this club.

11531~~~
I thought he had an acceptable game, really summed up by his desire to get back on the line and save the goal, we really do have to thank him for that.

Didn't effect the game too much apart from that, just kept the ball moving without ever really doing much. 

Think it helped that he was against a slow and rubbish midfield in Gibson and McCarthy, they couldn't overpower or run passed him so he held his own.

Would be more worried against a proper midfield, but hey if it keeps the 3 of rashford lingard and martial upfront I'm happy with that.

11532~~~
Debatable. If Rooney was fit throughout that period then it's unlikely we would have seen any of Rashford. We'd be in a much worse position if it weren't for the latter.

11533~~~
That could very well be true also, but if we had the same starting line up vs West Brom as we had yesterday I think that game could have been won, and that is the game that I feel will come back and haunt us.

11534~~~
"given his whole football career to this club", give me a break! Like its been for free when its quite clear that we have had to pay through the nose for his 'loyalty'.

11535~~~
Rooney playing in midfield with no real pace/movement in front of him is usually a disaster and all we really saw from him was a ping out wide last time he was there but with Rashford/Martial/Lingard interchanging and making runs in-behind I think/hope that this could actually work out well..

11536~~~
I thought he had a really good game. 

First half was brilliant, as has already been pointed out. He was tracking back deep, covering the field, getting the ball forward and generally dictating the tempo very well. His passing looked good, and he was responsible for the ball easily getting into the final third quite a few times. That headed clearance when he saved a definite goal while clattering into the post himself highlighted his desire.

Second half, I felt he needed more support from Carrick when being put under pressure by the entire Everton midfield and attack. He was still doing well, but having another MF next to him who would offer the option and the energy would have helped him a lot. Instead he was closed down too often and kept out of the game. Last half an hour - he obviously looked knackered, and restricted himself to the deep playmaking role, just like Carrick. We needed Herrera much earlier, and in place of Carrick, IMO. 

I think the rest of his contract might be in the midfield box-to-box role, and I wouldn't mind it. Just don't drop Rashford or Martial or Herrera to accomodate him in the 9 or 10.

11537~~~
A good first half when Everton weren't really at the races. You can only beat what you have in front of you an Rooney picked some really nice passes and buzzed around to good effect.

Second half he had less impact and control of the game as Everton began exerting pressure on the ball, when they finally realised they were in F.A. Cup semi-final. We can put this down to tiredness and hopefully that's all it was but I'm sure we'll soon find out when we play Leicester next weekend (they will not extend the same first half welcome that Villa and Everton have).

If he could play regularly to the level he reached in the first half then I wouldn't be opposed to him being a regular in the role. I don't think he can but hopefully he can prove me wrong as that appears to be where he is going to play for the remainder of the season at least.

11538~~~
sorry to be a party pooper, but the main issue with him being in midfield is a: when he inevitably has his mid season Sunday league spell, like pretty much every season, where he can't control a football or find a teammate five yards away for 4-6 weeks that is going to be a huge issue in midfield, whereas doing it upfront is nowhere near as fatal, and b: as long as lvg is in charge there is no chance of him being dropped during that spell.

11539~~~

11540~~~
West Brom and Sunderland = 6 points dropped against pure trash.

11541~~~
I thought he was good yesterday. Created a magnificent chance for Lingard early on, who fluffed it. 

Carrick must be dropped though, makes it extremely difficult for his partners.

11542~~~
Didnt think he had one bad touch or pass the whole game. Always made the right passing selection too. I have been one of his biggest haters this year but I thought he was real good yesterday.

11543~~~
One look at this thread and you'd think that the last 2 seasons of an unimpressive Rooney or the second half yesterday didn't happen. It's been 3 good halves out of 6 and he's the best thing to happen to United.

11544~~~
One look at this post and you'd think that people were saying Rooney's the best thing to happen to United...

11545~~~
Rooney showing what he can do against sides that don't give him an age on the ball, very little.

11546~~~
Majestic, Awesome, Brilliant, Wonderful. Am I doing it right?

11547~~~
Barely noticed him. Sort of a compliment really after that shit show in the first part of the season. 

He sort of just floats about, dinks a pass here or there and presses a bit (but doesn't actually put his foot in). Not bad but clearly we could do with something better.

11548~~~
Uncanny Gerrard pastiche

11549~~~
Rooney can play the ball to a player but he doesn't have the ability 9/10 to play it in behind a defensive line. He's basically a passenger and any diagonal is rarely that effective. There are exceptions now and then but you need it every game. Scholes could do it every game. Rooney can't.

11550~~~
Yeah I guess<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously, I'm pissed off with this. Everyone and his dog knows his time is up and that he's way too inconsistent for this level. But no, LVG has shoe horn his ass into the team. Sick of it but nothing anyone can do about it. Fecking frustrating!

11551~~~
He's playing well like everyone else apart from Rojo so far... People will be people and criticize though

11552~~~
We have all these mid field options yet go for the grandpa and Rooney.

11553~~~
The club and LVG deserve every shit performance he serves up. Hope he cost LVG his job.

11554~~~
He's been ok. But he is too vanilla in this midfield role IMO. Although he is like that in every role I guess.

11555~~~
He had one decent ball to Valencia. Focus your overboard praise on that and you're on to a winner.

11556~~~
I think he has had a very good half

Not sure what you lads are watching

11557~~~
Delusions of granddad.

11558~~~
Terrible. He has no brain to play in midfield at all, instead of playing it short and quick at times he chooses the long ball for no reason and totally slows down the attack, if that ball finds it's target at all. But few diagonals against terrible Aston Villa side are enough to make people think he is our best midfielder, amazing.

11559~~~
Yep very solid game from Rooney, looks pretty sharp, passing in on point. It's obvious that against this midfield your gonna get the ball nicked off you abit but in general Rooney had been very good this game. It's honestly amazing how people can get pre conceived ideas about a player and let it cloud the reality of what actually happens on the pitch, the human brain ey.

11560~~~
Think he's been alright to be honest.

11561~~~
He's been fine.

11562~~~
There was a time when the top players set the benchmark and standard for the rest of the team not try to match them. Standards eh?

11563~~~
What's he actually done? Other than be robbed of the ball twice and given away a couple of square passes. He's not winning the ball, setting the tempo of the game, getting players in behind or making dangerous runs forward from midfield. Tell me what you're seeing that we aren't?

11564~~~
Yes but he's not a world class player though is he? So why judge him as one? He's playing pretty well and is deserving of his spot in the team considering our midfield has been collectively shite this season, and the past few games he has put in better performances then most of ours this season so why not? Classic people on redcafe though, shit on him at every opportunity

11565~~~
A solid game for a world class player is scoring goals, wreaking havoc, assisting goals, hitting the bar

A solid gamr for rooney is simply not giving the ball away

11566~~~
Has been very good so far.

11567~~~
He's doing everything well so far, what's he doing poorly?

11568~~~
I haven't said he's been bad just meh. I just think that our standards have dropped. Is it bad that my expectations haven't followed suit and dropped too?

11569~~~
What's he doing well? Thats the 3rd square pass we just witnessed Rooney give away there, as I said he's been caught in possession several times. He hasn't played a single telling pass, I don't think he's even won a tackle, he's a passenger.

11570~~~
He's misplaced and underhit a fair few passes. He's been alright as a whole, but there's this underlining feeling that he's just very ineffective.

11571~~~
Well yes it is wrong that your standards haven't changed, considering he is aging and has declined and is no longer a world class player? Did you expect Giggs and Scholes to consistently put in the same world class performances when they started aging as when they were in their prime?

11572~~~
What exactly? 7th worst passer, probably even worse since the start of 2nd half, hasn't won single ball defensively, every ahot was blocked, terrible free kick, his diagonal balls were poor, what exactly he's been good at? Escaping clear yellow card?

11573~~~
Did you expect Giggs and Scholes to play every minute of every match even when their performances dropped?

11574~~~
That chip is the worst though I'll admit

11575~~~
How can anyone think he's been good because he's been terrible. Think Mark Noble just a shitter version and that's what we should accept at this club?

The truth is he's not good enough for the club in any position or capacity.

11576~~~
So like 4th best outfield passer? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11577~~~
One day that  chip will come off

11578~~~
Sometimes with Rooney it is like watching an old fella at 5-a-side trying some tricks he could do years ago in his 20s, only to fall on his arse.

Just doesn't have it anymore. He's not the worst but he's fecking average as they come.

11579~~~
Okay then compare him to the performances of Schweinsteiger, Fellaini, Herrera, Schneiderlin or Carrick in midfield.. They've all been largely shite, and that's what Rooney has to contend with

11580~~~
Rooney has only been 'fine' when you take into account how poor his overall season has been. However anyone who thinks this level of performance will be good enough in the long term needs their head examining.

11581~~~
He's better with <i>chips </i>than with chips.

11582~~~
7th best, my bad. 4th worst, only Fellaini, de Gea, Martial and Rojo had worse passing accuracy.

11583~~~
Yet he's not been an improvement on them and that's damning enough.

11584~~~
And he's still out worst midfielder. I'm still waiting for you to tell me what Rooney has down well, specifically. Nice yellow.

11585~~~
Look at the shape of his arm when he swings it in frustration towards the linesman. Like a woman.

11586~~~
He's lucky not to be sent off, he could and probably should have been booked for the tackle on Ulloa in the first half too.

11587~~~
If only he gave opponents as hard a time as he gives referees.

11588~~~
Disagree that he's our worst midfielder.. He's a lot more attack minded then the others and looks forward at least, so he suits us more in there compared to the others who do nothing attacking wise apart from Herrera, and he has been way off form this season.

11589~~~
Being attack minded isn't worth much though when you're not capable of actually doing much in attack.

11590~~~
What's he contributing to our attack exactly? I'm still waiting on what he's doing well today, you told me he was doing everything well.

11591~~~
Still does far more then Schneiderlin, Carrick (this season) or Schweinsteiger in the attack. Even herrera for most of his games this season. 
Rooney's been shite this half though, was decent in the first half IMO.

11592~~~
He's doing the classic performance of 'I'm busting my balls here at least, give me a break'. Basically trying his best but feck all quality. 

Hard to criticise but baffling to praise.

11593~~~
He's back...

11594~~~
Because they aren't attack minded midfielders. Their job generally isn't to burst forward or attack. It's (generally speaking) to sit deeper, control the game, and pass it forward to more advanced players. Rooney being more attack minded than them doesn't mean much because he's really not doing much in that role.

11595~~~
He was playing pretty well in the first half? Picked out good positions, kept things ticking well and gave it to the wingers to take on their fullback... Standard midfield stuff, we did completely control that first half apart from Rojo's shite defending. Second half he hasn't been good though, but then again, nobody has been for us.

11596~~~
Yes but that's why he warrants a spot in the team, because he's the only one who does that. Playing Schneiderlin in there is just painful to watch because all he does is give it to Blind or smalling.

11597~~~
Herrera generally does a better job of it I'd say.

11598~~~
Hardly like I'm praising.. Just saying he's worth his spot in the team considering the alternatives and that he was fine in the first half along with the others

11599~~~
Well that's a wild exaggeration.

11600~~~
No, that's the absolute minium required of a midfielder, I'm pretty sure I'd be capable of picking out the easy pass most of the time, I expect every single midfielder in the league to be competent in the basics. And that's mixed in with shit shots, shit freekicks, no tackling whatsoever expect the one time he was booked. Carrick, a player who I beleive is finished has outshone Rooney in every aspect of the game.

You said he did 'everything well', how isn't that praising?

11601~~~
His passing has been abysmal.

11602~~~
Amazed he didn't get sent off. At least 3 incidents worthy of a yellow card yet managed to escape two of them. Generally crap performance from Rooney; only Rojo worse for us.

11603~~~
Played some good passes under pressure. I have hope for him in midfield.

11604~~~
Herrera was atrocious today. (Again)

11605~~~
I have nothing against Rooney, but he should be nowhere near the midfield. We've spent nearly £80m on midfield reinforcements and still insist on playing a striker there. Only Manchester United. Truly unique.

11606~~~
I kinda works when you play a midfielder in the midfield and so on and so forth. 

But no?

A washed up CF in CM
A washed RW at RB 
A Fellaini in everywhere and nowhere

11607~~~
When your captain performs at this level, what do you expect form the other players?

11608~~~
Good game again Rooney, looking forward to adding someone like Sanches in midfield alongside him next year that can drive past and open up more space.

11609~~~
Better in the second half than the first but I think one of the reasons we struggle to maintain tempo is the midfield 3 are all slow and not very athletic so they can't keep it up for 90 minutes. Basically Rooney is doing a job in there but no top team should have a has-been striker as their creative fulcrum in midfield.

11610~~~
I think he's been decent there, just a shite captain.

11611~~~
0 clearances, 0 interceptions, 1 tackle today. - "He's played well". 

Even de Gea managed 1 clearance today, Mata also had one in 30 minutes. 

In the last 4 games he's had just 1 interception - against Everton, 0 clearances, and 6 tackles(not neccesarily succesful ones). <b><span style="text-decoration: underline">In 4 games!!!!</span></b>
I would say this just sums up that he has no idea how to play as a midfielder. 

But aparently, by some, he's played really well in these past 4 games in midfield.

11612~~~
When he's not behaving like a child, he can be quite decent

11613~~~
Well those stats are bollocks for a start considering he cleared one off the line against Everton, he also made more than one tackle today

11614~~~
I think on the whole he was good today. Could have looked after the ball a bit better, at times, but I think he was good. He also looks a lot better on the ball in tight space. Can't remember the minute, but he riddled away from two players and played a nice pass. Some really good moments in the game. If whatever manager's here next season decides to play him in centre mid, then we need to look at who we play him with.

With Fellaini, he seems to be the more reserved 8, who will get on the ball and try and dictate, whilst Fellaini will be the to get forward more. 

What will suit him more, though? I would like to see how he get in the 'Fellaini role', where he has more license to get into the box. Doing this, will allow us to play someone next to him who can control the game, i.e. Modric, Verratti, Rakitic, etc. That said, Rooney seems to be doing a good enough job in that position since he's been there.

11615~~~
Now this is the truth! Rooney would still have the legs to get into the box ala lampard and I think could easily add 10 goals from the position which we haven't had in years

11616~~~
Anybody that says, "he did fine", "he did ok", or "good enough" as an argument to those saying hes not good enough... well is that really good enough for United?

I think this is the second games hes faded...again. I honestly think its not too much to want him to have a true influence on the game (and not just pinging a few balls to the right wing).

11617~~~
He worked very hard today and it was a generally good performance. I'd be interested to see how far he ran compared to everyone else on the pitch today. Also some good forward passes to get us out of pressure. I would like to see him play more risky forward passes in the final third though. His instinct seems to be to play it safe, which normally means backwards. I suppose that could be LVG's instructions though.

11618~~~
It's from whoscored - best you could find, but it's not hard to notice in the games that he is terrible defensively in the midfield. Today he should have at least 3 yellow cards without actually doing anything positive defensively.

11619~~~
Disagree I think he has a strong case that he shouldn't have a single yellow card, first one wasn't even a foul, of that's a pull on gray then then football is the most pathetic sport around (it already is), can't recall the third one.

11620~~~
If football was a game of 45 mins, he's been ok but the last 4 second 45mins he has been crap. But let's pretend like the second half of games don't happen!

11621~~~
But the team has also been crap in the second half, maybe it's Rooneys job to lift us but football is a team sport and if the whole team dips, it's not unusual that the individuals within that system do as well. The reason for dip is the biggest worry not the individuals themselves, we haven't played at high intensity for 90 minutes a single game this season and that's management...

11622~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

11623~~~
You can't recall one of them yet think it's still a strong case that he didn't deserved booked for it?

He's not good enough to be a striker or midfielder and trying to build our team around shoehorning him in is going to hamper any attempts at being competitive or getting back to the CL. Which will hit us in the pocket. Surely that mitigates his allegedly great marketing potential.

11624~~~
When was the last time he actually managed to lift the ball over the wall?

11625~~~
I remember the good old days when his shooting from outside the box was amazing. How could you lose something like that?

11626~~~
It was about the time when he decided start trying to chip the keeper on the diagonal every time he had the chance.

11627~~~
I thought he had a decent game. Gave us that extra quality in midfield.

11628~~~
I agree. With energy and someone around him who can dictate, I think he'll prove to be a success in the advanced 8 role.

The thing is, with us being heavily linked to Sanches, it looks as though he might be the player to come in and be our box to box midfielder, leaving us with a three man midfield of say Schneiderlin, Sanches and Rooney. Whilst it would add a lot more energy to our midfield, it would be more of a hard-working three, rather than a creative three, with onus on our front three creating chances, which wouldn't be too much of a bad idea, providing we have players who can create something out of nothing, i.e. Martial.

It would be similar to the Chelsea's midfield three under Mourinho in 2004-06, where he played a midfield three of Makelele, Essien and Lampard.

We do lack energy in midfield, and we often struggle when teams counter us. More energy would certainly help us to counteract this problem.

As I said, it wouldn't be the most creative, but if you look at Leicester for example, energy is massively important in the modern game.

11629~~~
Got his passing stats or a heat map?

11630~~~
I've seen this a few times. Rooney being casually compared to a prime Lampard. I'm not sure if Rooney is being overrated or Lampard underrated. The latter was consistently scoring over 20 a season around 2005. Rooney despite playing a more advanced role hasn't done that for about four years.

Look at his goal trend over the last few years, it's going downwards. He's not suddenly going to add 10 goals a year to his game whilst dropping further away from goal.

11631~~~
People can say this shoehorning thing all they want but since the turn of the years he's been one of the best in the team and fully deserves his place in the team, I get it every team has a scapegoat and Rooney is levelled with all it all with him being a senior player and being captain. But if people would actually open their eyes and watch from an objective standpoint they would see he's pretty much outperformed all our other "natural" midfielders in the last few games and the reason we didn't win today really wasn't on Rooney.

11632~~~
But yet again Rooneys critics fail to mention that the team as a whole has also taken a huge dip over the last 3-4 years and our overall goals are way down. The question is has Rooneys form been due to the team or just a decline, I think it's a bit of both, but while other players get the benefit of the doubt Rooney is thrown under the bus.

11633~~~
Could easily have been sent off. 

There's just not a lot of positives from him as a CM apart from his above-average but not great distribution. He's just a less defensively competitive and aware version of good but passers who've been a CM their whole career like Cabaye, Hamsik, Parejo or Castro, and you can find a guy (probably not Hamsik) like that in the summer for 10-15M, which is what Rooney makes in wages alone.

11634~~~
Try fourfourtwo, they should have it.

11635~~~
A bit dramatic. Most of the players from four years ago have been sold. Rooney has played more than ever.

11636~~~
When he plays in midfield the commentators just notice the (successful) sprayed passes out wide and apparantly that is all he needs to do to get praise and a blind eye turned to any mistake and overall lack of contribution. We can do much, much better for a central midfielder at Manchester United.

11637~~~
If the people at our club see Rooney as a long term first choice central midfielder, were in trouble.

11638~~~
I only managed to tune in for the second half but Rooney was our best player. Did well under pressure.

11639~~~
How Oliver didn't send him off is a bit of a mystery. He's completely past it and should consider retiring maybe.

11640~~~
I didn't see the 1st half, but thought he was solid in the 2nd. IMO, he's been good in 2016. 

But obviously people expect more. The 1 yellow he did get was incredibly soft though. Don't see how that's arguable.

11641~~~
From players like Robson, Ince, Keane, scholes to an aging and spineless carrick, fellaini and a knackered striker in midfield.

11642~~~
Too late

11643~~~
The worst thing is that you can apply that logic to almost every position except goalkeeper and LW. RW used to be Beckham, Cristiano nowdays Mata and Lingard. RB Neville now Valencia and Darmian. LB Irwin, Evra now Rojo, CB Stam, Rio, Vida now Smalling, Blind etc. 

We've settled for mediocre players, something I though I would never see at United.

11644~~~
but he scored one in training last week. there was a LVG interview on it and footage and everything

11645~~~
guess we'll spend half of next season finding out

11646~~~
In the last few games we've played one of the worst teams in PL history, a Palace team resting most of their players that didn't give a feck, an Everton midfield consisting of Gibson and Cleverly and Leicester who he wasn't very good against and could have been sent off. From an objective standpoint he's been given a very easy ride in the last few games and hasn't outperformed anyone.

He's not a scapegoat. He's a player that's neither paid nor treated like the rest of the team. No matter how bad he plays he gets neither subbed nor dropped, his position is repeatedly changed in order to get him into the team and he is either completely inept or average at best in each position he is moved to. Yet still he continues to start every single match. It's not people looking to blame him for everything, it's people demanding that if a player is paid £300k a week, is undroppable and can't be subbed then he at the very fecking least consistently performs at a level befitting such status. Repeated spells of months of awful form and his top form being average to good simply isn't acceptable under such circumstances. He's not a good midfielder and he's not been a good enough striker to get Rashford's place, which quite simply isn't good enough from him.

11647~~~
Second half performances have been consistently shit.

11648~~~
I am more and more convinced he has a clause in his contract that he can't be dropped. This would fit right in some of the ridiculous decisions we have made since Fergie retired. Fergie should have sold him before he retired as ppl now at the club don't seem to have the balls to do it.

11649~~~
Can't seriously be playing him in deep midfield regularly next season.

That sh!t will not stand

11650~~~
we get it mate, we get it!

11651~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11652~~~
When he was put under pressure he managed to evade the player and push the ball into space, I though he was top class doing thIs.

11653~~~
His dismal attempts at chipping the goalie is now becoming a trademark, and when was the last time he actually troubled the goalkeeper let alone scored from a direct free kick? If United buy sensibly this summer then hopefully he will be phased out over the course of next season because I cannot see United challenging for titles if Rooney is starting up top or worse in midfield.

11654~~~
His movement and linkup play was quality. Popping up everywhere and keeping the ball moving, I think the same licence should be given to Herrera and Schniederlin but for some reason it didn't really seem to be earlier in the season. Maybe they were just shit scared of being dropped.

Loves a chip lol.

11655~~~
Everyone ripping into Memphis, but Mata and Lingard are struggling and the main reason is Rooney. Absolutely pathetic performance. Hasn't pressed or made any movement to the channels or in behind. Standing up in line with the defence waiting for something to come for him. The players behind him are doing feck all but it would be helpful if they had someone to play off.

11656~~~
It actually looks as if he never played as a striker before.

11657~~~
by far the worst player in our team past season, yet commentators praise him for a good run instead of critisizing for a bad touch or zero effort throughout, having in the squad this piece of shit just drives me crazy, we would have another 7 better players with his wages, just crazy how deep we have fallen. Best captain in United history

11658~~~
100% spot on.

Lingard, Memphis and Mata have been poor but Rooney is the multiplier.

11659~~~
He doesn't have the confidence to show for the ball when playing up top any more. He's fine when acting busy and spraying passes thinking he's Scholes while in acres of space, but up top he is back to his silent domination ways.

11660~~~
Usual fecking rubbish from Rooney.

11661~~~
The commentators spend the whole time moaning about the lack of pace and movement upfront but they absolutely refuse to name Rooney as the culprit.

11662~~~
It says it all, that with Rashford and Martial out there was a real panic of, heck who is going up front.

Before that slow realisation that we do have a chap who is only 5 off our record all time goalscorer!

It's worrying though, as I'm pretty sure Rooney couldn't outrun/head/strength me, so against some of these pacy brutes no wonder he makes little impact

11663~~~
He cant play striker anymore. He has lost all the instinct needed up there.

11664~~~
He doesn't:

Work
Hold the ball up
Run
Have any ability whatsoever
Pass the ball well

Yet is still the first name on the team sheet. Crying shame that Fergie saw this coming but we still have to put up with his rubbish.

11665~~~

Why are we resting players with three games left? We haven't played in one week yet need to rest the only good striker we have...?

11667~~~
3 minutes into the game commentators started making excuses for him that he is too isolated up front. And people wonder why some here don't like him. There isn't one commentator that will criticise him one bit, but just blame others because he is shit.

11668~~~
What's the point of him? Seriously, is he not fecking embarrassed at this point?

11669~~~
He's in semi-retirement, and that's not even a dig.

11670~~~
Standard Rooney really. Playing deeper where he's not under pressure he can use the ball nicely, but higher up the pitch where players are on him quick, he struggles. Only people it's a surprise to is LVG and pundits who just repeat what they've been saying about him all his career regardless of his actual performances.

11671~~~
When will people fecking realise that he isn't good enough. We have a load of other busted flushes but they are dispensable. 
Not a single attempt to stretch play and give the midfielders behind him something to work with. Sick of this shit.

11672~~~
I will quickly lose interest in the next campaign if I still keep seeing him in our starting lineup regardless of who the manager is.

11673~~~
He made a run in behind! World class!

11674~~~
The dream Summer for me would be Rooney sold,Van Gaal fired(and replaced by a world class manager) and Woodward to hire a dof and reduce his involvement in making the football decisions.

11675~~~
Hes so fecking shit.

11676~~~
Hes so shit. Bailed out by Mata.

11677~~~
someone like Kane or Aguero would've scored that themselves.

11678~~~
He almost fecked it up <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11679~~~
World class hold up play. A lesser player would have given up on it, he more or less bounced the ball in off Mata's foot such is the genius of our Wayne the footb<span style="color: #000000">alling god.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #ffffff">Sarcasm obviously.</span></span>

11680~~~
He's been awful today, just awful. He did well for the goal though.

11681~~~
Getting abuse for an assist. The Caf sometimes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That being said, it was so obvious he was desperate to score it himself. He has nothing left of the skills that would buy him the necessary time and space in the box back in the day. He must be one of the easiest strikers to mark out of a game in the league. Good on him for managing to get the pass off and even better of Mata to be where he needed to be.

11682~~~
Rooney was one of our worst players today yet managed to assist the goal and put Morgan into great chance which latter really should've scored.

But overall he was really poor, Martial and Rashford MUST stay up-front!

11683~~~
His overall play wasn't good but he put in two great balls and could have easily had 2 assists.

11684~~~
THIS!

11685~~~
What a ball it was to Schneiderlin. Set it up beautifully only to see the chance wasted.

11686~~~
Collect ball.. pass to RW/RWB.. run forward.. repeat

£300k

11687~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11688~~~
Complete waste of space until the goal. Did well after that(not that it was much time left to play). Loved his pass to Schneiderlin.

11689~~~
Past it. Good ball to Schneiderlin though.

11690~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/rhXqiof.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/rhXqiof.jpg"/> 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11691~~~
Better in midfield.

11692~~~
In Rooney we have our attack sorted for life. Give him an extension, ED!

11693~~~
Apparently Tottenham are going to make Kane a bumper offer and double his wage to £100,000 a week, really puts things in perspective.

11694~~~
He just needs to score another 6 goals and he will be gone.

11695~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11696~~~
1 Rooney = 6 Kanes. I love it!!!

11697~~~
Hes not good enough to be a striker. He just drops so much that we have nobody there occupying the opposition defence.

I dont mind him playing as part of a three man midfield but then he would need runners. And even then, I think he can only do about 60 minutes there.

11698~~~
Besides those two passes, was so so bad

11699~~~
United offering totenham 50m + rooney for kane. 

Tottenham replied : 45m. Keep rooney

11700~~~
Midfield or sub for Rooney. He can't lead the line anymore - lacks the pace.

11701~~~
This. Almost fecked up that chance before Mata came to the rescue as well. Good spot by him though, thankfully.

11702~~~
Mata bailed him out as he didn't have the pace or strength to shake Bassong and score himself, Trevor Francis was the only pundit with the balls to acknowledge this. I don't think Rooney is much cop as a CM but he's certainly better there than lumbering around up top.

11703~~~
Did his absolute best to ruin the chance for our goal, was only saved by Mata's run.

11704~~~
Purple patch aside, he has been diabolical this season on the whole.

Really bamboozled people still believe he has anything to offer the club going forward. 

One of the first who should be ushered out of the door this summer. Been a great servant, would have liked for him to break Sir Bobby's record before leaving.

Lifting the FA cup and a good testimonial is a nice send of for the lad. The longer he stays the more my opinion of him sours.

11705~~~
He's here for the long term, that contract is like a noose around our necks. The only hope is China or the MLS, but if he's still getting games for England I can't see him fancying it.

11706~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11707~~~
Been saying for years he's basically like us playing a centre midfielder up front, albeit one that can finish if it falls for him. In the final third you need either strength, speed, trickery or something like this to be decisive. The average Championship centre half would have a comfortable afternoon against Rooney. He has no tools to hurt them with.

11708~~~
One great pass he was absolutely awful.

11709~~~
That goal was such a strange run of play.

Probably any other striker would have struck it having got such space and being in the penalty area.

Not many would have tried a dink inside on their weaker foot, but any who did would definitely have shot on their left foot.

I can't imagine any would then turn, and with a 6th sense play a perfect ball to a man for a tap in!

Strange goal.

I think there was similar away at Newcastle. The composure is so much higher, but all the other stuff well well on the wane

11710~~~
He's not under pressure in the mid not because he's good position wise.  The opponent knows he wont do anything but lose the ball,  they purposely left him open to receive balls

11711~~~
He wasn't great today, but I'd love to see how Martial or Rashford would fare with Mata and Memphis either side of them. Not to mention Herrera who is happy to play a 5 yard pass and move. No creativity whatsoever. 

That said, in the end he played an important part in the goal. Probably messed it up a bit, but had the composure to find Mata, which lead to the goal.

11712~~~
A 6th sense? Nah, fecked up the chance, he had absolutely no intention to pass to Mata until he ruined his opportunity, he got very fortunate.

11713~~~
Wasn't half as bad as he was made out to be today. When we constantly lump it up to him he's not going to be heavily involved in the match, he did well to get a good assist and should have had another. Decent performance, nothing more but certainly nothing less.

11714~~~
Isolated far too much with Mata / Herrera / Lingard being abysmal today. 
He was the least of our problems.

11715~~~
Thought he'd fecked up the chance and was screaming...

...I still can't tell if he was waiting for a teammate or genuinely messed it up.

11716~~~
I cringed a little when I saw the starting line up.

11717~~~
back up top after a while reveals how slow and lumbered he is becoming unfortunately, and this is pretty much a championship side. He will huff and puff wherever he is, but next year he cant be a guaranteed starter anymore

11718~~~
Lingard was poor, aay. But Mata and Herrera were two of our better players today. Rooney is one of our bigger problems, alongside LvG's insistence to play him when fit. 

They'd offer some pace? Mobility? Some actual threat against the opposition center backs? Its no surprise there's a lack of creativity when our striker is so static and can't shake a defender. Lingard and Memphis were also dire up top. 

He did well to capitalize on the mistake of the Norwich CB initially, but everything after was a mess. Was lucky Mata bust a gut to get in a good position, credit to Rooney for having the composure to find him as well. But overall, the guy was horrible today - reminiscent of his early season form when up top.

11719~~~
I'm absolutely perplexed that some of the top coaches in the country, at club and international level,  can have the opinion that he can still perform at the top level, when it's so blatently obvious that he's past it. Not only that, but we now have a manager who is trying to shoehorn him into a side in a position that he cant play, in desperate attempt just to get him into the team as if he's Leo Messi.
It's absolutely bizarre.

11720~~~
Rooney isn't a striker anymore and him being a makeshift striker isn't that bad.
Its striking to me how much we lost from midfield without Rooney playing there. It was just the same old same old for 90 mins. Rooney can play a forward pass without needing to attempt a bunch of 1-2s and end up running straight into traffic.

11721~~~
Well, to be fair to Rooney, he did run the channels quite well today. At least I thought so anyway. I just think when you've got just him doing it, it makes life so much harder. 

When Martial, and Lingard to an extent, are on the wings, they have the ability to travel with the ball - to get us up the pitch, thus allowing our team as a whole to get up the pitch. 

Depay and Mata, on the other hand, are completely different. For starters, Memphis couldn't even get hold of the ball today, and many attacks broke down when he got it. As for Mata, he's not going to travel with the ball when he gets it. We suffered because of that. 

Whether it's a coincidence or not, I felt Rooney's best game up top for us this season come against Stoke, where he was flanked by Martial and Lingard.

11722~~~
Super pass for Schneiderlin's big chance, otherwise shit. Even his assist for Mata's goal was underwhelming.

11723~~~
Yeah having pace upfront does help him out. But that's my issue with Rooney as a striker these days, theres so many variables that need to fall into place for him to have a good performance up top. He's no longer a top class striker worthy of a place starting upfront for Manchester United I'm afraid. He still does so composure when in vital areas, but he can't manage to find himself in them as much as he should.

He does better in midfield when given time and space, I worry of his ability to play against pressing midfielders however. Disappeared in the second half vs everton and was quiet against Leicester. I just don't see a role for the guy in a starting line up for any top side in the world these days, and thats a sad thing to say. No matter how badly the English press want to push the narrative, he is detrimental to our side and England given the talent they have now. Even his leadership qualities are overstated - so many times we've been crying out for a leader this season and he really should have shown a lot more for a long serving player at our club.

With regards to the stoke game, I felt the whole team were great. The Martial goal was my personal goal of the season - lovely counter attack.

11724~~~
Maybe, just maybe... those experts with years of coaching experience are right and see Rooney is still contributing to the team and you are wrong? Just a thought.

11725~~~
Ah yes the old 1-8-1.

11726~~~
Nah, he's finished as a top player but has a lot of political juice, he's hardly the first top player to hang around at club and International level well past their sell by date due to former glories.

11727~~~
Wayne supplied a lovely dink pass to Mata when we needed a goal, but overall was as anonymous as most of his teammates today.

The problem of what to do with him will plague us all next season.  Perhaps the plan can be to wheel him out against bottom half clubs and keep him on the bench against the top half clubs.

11728~~~
He's like a bitchy wife. You just give in to save yourself from the drama

We need a cnut of a manager to outcunt our old horses,  either retire them with glory or shoot them down with gory

11729~~~
Normally yes.  Absolutely. But when he's struggled to play a 5 yard pass for about 3 years, and when 75000 fans sat in the stadium are saying the same thing, as well as millions of others who watch him regularly...You've got to wonder...

11730~~~
I still want to know why he wears long sleeve compression tops no matter how hot it is. It was over 20°C today, he must have been absolutely roasting.

11731~~~
I think you're giving him too much credit. He basically did all he could to not score and got bailed out by Mata making a great run. We need more from our striker than what Rooney did there, he should have scored himself not fluffed around for a while until he had no chance himself.

11732~~~
Prefer him in the left number 10 position

11733~~~
Good composure for the goal after the initial chance got away from him so credit for that. You want your striker to just have the ability to run away and finish it himself though ideally

11734~~~
Yes in fairness.

I think any other striker would have just half volleyed it at the start, and back themselves to score outright.

11735~~~
Utter shit today.

On the one hand, to be fair to him, it's been blatantly obvious he can not play that role anymore for the last two seasons. He simply does not have it in him. He doesn't have the pace, power, hold-up ability, positioning or off-the-ball movement to play it. Not a single one of those aspects are even close to being good enough. So looking at it like that, it's hard to blame him for yet another bad game in that position and it comes back to the manager who put us in a position where we needed to play him in that role. Not so much talking about resting Rashford today, I'm actually ok with that. But it was LVG's decision to go into this season with Rooney obviously meant to be his main striker.

On the other hand, despite all that, I still expect him to be better than what he showed today. Was embarrassing at times. There were a couple of moments of good vision and passing, but that was it.

11736~~~
LvG, Ryan Giggs, Roy Hodgeson and Gary Neville... Nah.

I might actually take the opinion of a forum dweller calling it as it is over any of those four.

11737~~~
Can't we just sell him, rather than having to shoehorn him into the team forever more, yes he's been great, and yes he can still play pretty well at times, but I'm just sick of the sight of him in a United shirt.

11738~~~
He must have got pretty annoyed at martial's injury. Was likely setting himself for an afternoon stroll playing in midfield.

11739~~~
He should be on his way with Van Gaal in the summer....

Thanks for the service Wayne but the club needs to be as ruthless as he was when angling for a new deal

11740~~~
I feel like a lot of fans are selectively failing to connect the dots here and realize that a couple of weeks back, the manager had to <b>sub on a player because he wanted someone to run in behind</b>. I think it pretty much spelled out, the starting strikers role is to stand up front and hold up the ball, not make runs in behind and receive passes over the top. They occupy the CB's play with their back to goal and face the buildup at all times. Yet people still have gone on all season about how nobody runs in behind and nobody passes through the lines. It simply isn't in the game plan.

Not Rooney's forte, his assist was class and decided the game. Saw it, but did not see his performance.

New manager coming in next season will sort out his free role and it will probably get him scoring again.

11741~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11742~~~
That's because our Captain & best-paid player values his England place over Manchester United and its priorities, Louis.

11743~~~
Maybe, but I also am pretty convinced that Fergie who was better than any of them was preparing to drop/sell Rooney with RVP going to be partnered by Kagawa/Welbeck/Hernandez. I'd also say internationally until recently there was a lack of options and at United post Fergie it's a power thing not to mention he's not completely unable to contribute and if you drop him and don't do well then the press/some fans will be on your case.  A better test really though imo is if we put Rooney on the market how many top teams, teams we should be looking to be on the level of would take him as part of their first 11? Personally don't think many if any. 

Think with Rooney in fairness, and probably with other players is there's rarely a middle ground in these sorts of discussions. Rooney isn't finished and in the right system/team has something to offer but does he justify his earnings/untouchable part of the team? Not in comparison to our other players let alone other teams star players imo and for me with the players we have I'm not sure he naturally fits in as he's not our best striker, nor for me our best number 10 and I don't think he's a better central midfielder than Herrera. I still think he can play a part but we really shouldn't bank on him being a star player next season. 

I don't see the risk either really. If he wants to play every game but also earn the big bucks I think his main chance is leaving main stream football and going somewhere like China which I'm not sure he'd do. If he's wiling to sacrifice pay for playing time than so be it. Hopefully he stays to fight for a place/just play a part but really think we need to plan for him not being a key player. I don't see his cm role working out that well. Yes he can spread the ball nicely at times but there's more to it then that.

11744~~~
I thought he was supposed to be a striker, handful of goals away from the record. Now he doesn't like playing upfront?

11745~~~
Captain and best paid player not happy about playing in his actual position when no one else is available. Says it all really that he's even allowed to be unhappy about it, he should be glad he's getting on the pitch at all with the shower of shite he's been serving up. Instead he's dictating where he plays and apparently giving off when asked to cover somewhere else to help the team.

11746~~~
This is the sort of ridiculous things people say in the Rooney threads on here that make me not even want to discuss it (even though many here that want Rooney out of the club have fair points).

I can understand the opinion of Rooney not being right for the system or not offering enough but anyone saying he is finished is just joking themselves.

11747~~~
It's obviously an exaggeration. But it's not ridiculous in the slightest to suggest that his touch and his passing game over the last few years have deteriorated to pathetic levels. Anyone denying that obviously hasn't watched us that much.

11748~~~
He had a very bad 2015 year but since 2016 he has been quite good. In some matches, he had MOTM performances. Whether you think he should stay or not is another issue but just listen to yourself: "(Wayne Rooney's) passing game over the last few year have deteriorated to pathetic levels". You think anyone can take a comment like that seriously?

11749~~~
Rest of the quote says he would have played number 10 if Januzaj was match fit.

11750~~~
badly let down by Martial, Rashford and Januzaj then

11751~~~
Sir Alex thought he was done .

I'd trust that man's judgement of when a player needs to be moved on over any other. Evidence since 2013 provides just that.

If trust his judgement a lot more than Van Gaal,Moyes and Hodgson combined.

11752~~~
I don't think he thought he was finished but just not suited for the club anymore. That is different than a player being finished.

11753~~~
That's ridiculous.

So even in his thirties he changes his opinion over his favourite position every few months. Just couple of months ago he was saying he is a forward. 

What a problem this team has with this guy him and no one wants to do anything with it. He has definitely became bigger than a club long time ago.

11754~~~
We don't need a player to be on their last legs either to sell them. 

The form he had shown since then has been largely that,glimpses here and there of what he once was but largely disapointibg.

11755~~~
After the Euro's when he fails as a midfielder for England he will be calling himself a striker again. He's going to end up like the guy in Quantum Leap not knowing who he is from game to game.

11756~~~
I thought he couldn't have played it any better. Agree with the rest, though.

11757~~~
Come on Steve, this kind of attention seeking belongs in the "end of Rooney" thread. This could be interpreted in many ways, you could argue that he thought Januzaj was in line for minutes and deserved them, thus him to stay at left #10 where he has shown some very good form of late. He very well could have disagreed with Rashford being dropped in the first place.

11758~~~
His agent is brilliant and we are mugs. 250-300k or whatever a week for this technical marvel.

11759~~~
Has been a great servant of this club on the pitch, despite the contract antics off it. His goal scoring record reflects that, even though he has been moved all over the place.

But it is painfully obvious that he can no longer lead the line, and he is not a midfielder. No team trying to challenge at the top should have to shoehorn a player just to fit him in somewhere.

11760~~~
Far from attention-seeking, that's what I actually believe.

Wayne is hardly the epitome of selflessness.

11761~~~
That's a very strange quote.

11762~~~
Herrera on Mr. Manchester United

11763~~~
Should have probably ended with "So I hope Wayne gets more playing time at my expense"

11764~~~
Are we sure he wasn't being sarcastic?

11765~~~
1 goal contribution in every 2 appearances for Rooney in his worst season. Vintage Wayne.

11766~~~
I wouldn't pay too much attention to that. Fellow professionals will always say stuff like that. Didn't Yaya Toure call Rooney amongst his top 5 players in the world a few months ago?

11767~~~
Hes done at top level football.

11768~~~
Except, he isn't really.

11769~~~
He is

11770~~~
He very well should be, just at MUFC he isnt and thats purely for marketing purposes at this point.
But whatever, even Real let Raul play a season or two past his expired date.

11771~~~
If you put him up for sale and removed wages from equation I think in all honestly Wayne would be looking at Newcastle level clubs putting an offer in

Wouldn't surprise me if he ended up at Everton

Top level? He's done

11772~~~
The most important week of his captaincy. If ever we needed him to lead by example, this is it

11773~~~
Thinking the same. We Wayne to step up to the plate. C'mon Rooney!

11774~~~
Has to step up. Especially with Martial out.

11775~~~
Don't know where to put this, but watching Spurs vs So'ton this weekend, the co-commentator was going on about Harry Kane and how England are spoilt for choice up front, how Roy Hodgson will have difficulty picking a front line from the list of names - Kane, Vardy, Welbeck, Sturridge, even Carroll. It was only about a minute later that he remembered to add "and then he has his captain, Wayne Rooney, to consider". It was an afterthought and there was a sense that the commentator had forgotten about Rooney, and it's a feeling I think a lot of England fans might have this summer. He's got to be in the squad and then he's got to play as a consequence of his status (tbf he scored a lot of goals in qualifying), but Vardy and Kane would probably be a better pairing for the team. 

Rooney has invited the nation's top football writers to dinner this week at his own behest btw, something he feels is part of his "England captain duties" apparently, and no doubt there won't be too much focus on Rooney's place in the team as the tournament approaches.

11776~~~
While I agree that he should be on the plane as the captain, he should not be considered as a definite starter. England have a poor record on the international stage and this Euros might be their best chance to redeem themselves cos France, Germany, Belgium, Italy etc have their teams sorted for the future. Playing the best players and the form players will be the best for England now.

11777~~~
He tries to make every pass a Hollywood show piece, the way he tries to stroke the ball so it looks great. It's so fecking annoying. 

We spent 25 minutes under constant attack and the first time we have the ball for more than 5 seconds he tries a stupid shot from 30 yards and gives up possession for nothing. 

He's not a midfielder, stop trying to shoehorn him into the fecking team.

11778~~~
I thought he was finished as a top player a couple of years ago but Moyes gave him a golden parachute and he has now effectively become the albatross around our necks.

11779~~~
I swear if I see that stupid fecking long pass out the right one more time...

11780~~~
Ball to wing. Ball to wing. Ball to wing. Ball to wing. Ball to wing. Ball to wing. Ball to wing. Ball to wing. Don't mention £300k a week. Ball to wing. Ball to wing. Ball to wing. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

11781~~~
Fecking sick of him.

11782~~~
Another floated pass out wide results in an interception, ending the attack. Almost forgot - overpaid.

11783~~~
Apparently (according to the match thread) because he keeps dropping and asking for the ball, he's playing well.

11784~~~
but he's studied Scholes

11785~~~
He's making us tick according to Sky's commentary. They also praised him getting a foot in and failed to notice the following:
A) How his bad touch caused the need for a foot in
B) How he lost the challenge he put a foot in for
C) How West Ham then went up the other end to score

That all said and noted, he's had some decent passes in this half tbf.

11786~~~
pretty sick of his shit. 

He obviously watched scholes closely but not close enough to realise that he picked his moments. Same fecking pass time and time again.

11787~~~
Well he's got nothing ahead of him other than Rashford who has looked like an 18 year old.

11788~~~
He's an embarrassment

11789~~~
Yes that's the reason he's been shit. Other people's fault.

11790~~~
He should patent that right floated pass to Valencia.

11791~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yeah, I'll say it again, if him in CM is a long term plan, we're fecking doomed.

11792~~~
Yes that's what I said.

11793~~~
Thinks he's prime Iniests floating passes around the pitch. Absolute shite <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11794~~~
Not a midfielder. Not good enough to be a striker. Undroppable.

11795~~~
him anywhere near the first team, we're fecking doomed.

11796~~~
Shite, takes him 5x longer to hit cross field passes than Scholes. FB picks it out almost every time.

11797~~~
I love how lumping the ball out to the wing is considered pulling the strings and dictating the play, it's so obvious what he's going to do that West Ham are not even bothering to close him down now.

11798~~~
Sums up Manchester United really. Past it, over-rated and boring/predictable as hell to watch.

11799~~~
Just wtf?! How many passes floated out to the wide players has he fecking done? It's like it's all he can do. Does he think by doing it he'll be the next Scholes?

However, he did put in a great ball to Rashford who ducked ffs.

11800~~~
Everyone is sick of that pass wide he continually does. At the same time when he's mixed things up a bit he's been behind some of our better moments.

He's put in the two most dangerous balls of the game and hit 2 or 3 nice quick passes into the wingers. Nobody else has done as much to create something.

11801~~~
I guess if you put it that way, they are only £150,000 each, which doesn't sound quite as bad.

11802~~~
Been involved which makes him better than the other two in midfield. That pass out wide though, it's all he wants to do.

Don't think he's passed it to Rashford once all half.

11803~~~
Can hardly blame him today. He's basically playing all on his own when we have the ball thanks to Herrera and Morgan.

11804~~~
He really can't pass to the left can he? fecked up an easy pass for a counter to the left but can pass to the right to Valencia all day long

11805~~~
there was one to Rojo the commentator blamed the wet pitch

11806~~~
I am not his biggest fan but he's been our best player tonight.

Seems the only one dealing with the intensity. Rest just shirk away or are pushed aside.

11807~~~
It's ridiculous to watch. The whole stadium knows exactly what he's going to do.

11808~~~
I thought that pass looked very slow to arrive and put Rashford under pressure. I screamed at the television (again) at that point.

11809~~~
It's like that one kid that comes to your house, learns a new move on your Street Fighter game and wipes you out every time. So annoying!

11810~~~
He was outmuscled tbf.

11811~~~
I had countless arguments here weeks ago when many were trying to tell me Rooneys floaty passy to Valencia/Mata was 'vision'.

11812~~~
I HATE him. 

Just wish he'd feck off and never come back. If I never had to hear the name Wayne Rooney for the rest of my life i'd die a happy man.

11813~~~
Seriously, even as he pulls the trigger for his pass its like 'aww not this shit again' before he has even kicked it

11814~~~
I'm surprised people think he was good in this first half, I thought he was one of our worst players.

11815~~~
That's complete nonsense. It was a very good ball. Rashford just needed to stick his head on it and it would probably have been a goal

11816~~~
his movement looks better, arguably one of the better players today in overall dross level but he fails big time as a captain

11817~~~
Makes me want to weep watching this guy 'running' our midfield. He was shit in midfield when Fergie tried it and that was before his legs went. But he's great around the dressing room so he must start every game he's fit for us.

11818~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'll have to see it again, but it looked a nice ball in.

Again, I'll have to see it again. I'm sure Rashford weirdly ducked though.

11819~~~
He gave a team talk and we won a game once. Best captain ever.

11820~~~
Whereas the creative, forward thinking Mata and Herrera constantly have.

11821~~~
Not a positive because those long passes are putting his partners out of the game. Quicker passes will go a long way in getting the team going.

11822~~~
They have all been terrible. 

But  he has been least worst of the trio.

11823~~~
His passing is far too poor for him to ever become a midfielder long term.

11824~~~
I thought he was probably our best player tbf. Says a lot about the rest of them though.

11825~~~
Take a drink every time Rooney gets the ball and hits it out to the wing.

You'll be dead by the end of the game.

11826~~~
We might be talking about two different passes.

11827~~~
If you really believe that, it's just agenda and hatred talking. He's easily been the best of the trio. Yes his ball out wide might be as predictable as us being rubbish at football but he's been the only one of Rashford, Mata, Herrera and Morgan who looks like he's actually turned up.

11828~~~
he had one or nice moments with some howlers, but he is so limited and predictable. He is a physical presence in the middle of the park at least, compared to the lightweights

11829~~~
Both those statements are pretty accurate.

11830~~~
Don't think he's been bad.

11831~~~
Something that was apparently so out of the ordinary that it required a story about it.

11832~~~
The Hollywood ball out to the right is annoying enough in that it's clearly him just trying to look flash and it comes off nowhere near enough but even when it does we've got Valencia and either Lingard or an ineffectual Mata out there to receive the pass. Rooney's by no means our worst player, in fact he's probably worth a place in the starting 11 but that in itself is so bad. Every time he moves position you have people complaining that it's wasting his talents, the reason being he's just not very good anywhere anymore. It's pathetic that he's the figurehead and face of the club and it's a sign of our woeful transfer policy that the alternatives to him are so mediocre.

Like Liverpool with Gerrard and Toure at City, I'm not sure we can properly move on until he's out of the club and we have younger, hungrier and frankly better players in our midfield and attack.

11833~~~
Hoe does that excuse him?

11834~~~
Pass combinations:

Rooney to Valencia 7
Rooney to Rojo 7
Rooney to Blind 5

Rojo to Rooney 9
Blind to Rooney 8
Valencia to Rooney 5

Essentially our defence moves it forward and central to Rooney who then switches play or knocks it back and it falls apart. Rinse and repeat.

11835~~~
Hes been out best player so far tonight even though he isnt playing well which just goes to show how rubbish everybody else has been.

11836~~~
If we had those it would make sense but we don't really. Our squad is full of a lot of rubbish.

11837~~~
He's been one of our best players today. The problem is the players around him. No muscles AT ALL.

I love his straight Scholes-like passes.

11838~~~
Our best player today shows how poor we have become

11839~~~
It's over for him in my opinion, but that doesn't matter tonight, let's see if he can raise his game and drive us on to win.

11840~~~
Agreed, I did say he merits a place in the team currently but that's due to our woeful transfer policy and the alternatives being a bit crap. My issue is that's not because he's that good anymore (I think we've only seem him at his best in patches since the end of 2011), it's that the squad is so ordinary despite us spending £300m in the last 3 years. Even today he's not been anything like our best player but he's so ordinary for someone who the club put on such a pedestal.

11841~~~
least worst meaning of the three he has been the one that has less terrible than the other two.

call down.

11842~~~
I would love to see a "Wayne Rooney Skillz" youtube video, containing only floated passes to right wing, with 99 Red Balloons as the theme music. The passes should be in slow motion to emphasize their majestic trajectory.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wirRZsAvJGQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

11843~~~
Well I think that 3rd goal is his fault. What in all feck was he thinking trying to 'slow it down' when he lost the ball?

11844~~~
Captain Flabtastic.

11845~~~
What a fantastic captain

11846~~~
I'd happily never see him play for us again.

Thanks for the memories. Stop tarnishing your legacy.

11847~~~
Think we would have been tonked without Rooney tonight.

11848~~~
Worst United captain I've seen. So passive and pointless.

11849~~~
Pathetic some of you lot. He actually was really good tonight and yet the comments on this page. If our players had even the slightest amount of brains and didn't concede a free kick every 90 seconds, we'd have won this.

11850~~~
Your definition of really good is odd. He was shit just like every other spineless bitch in a red shirt.

11851~~~
He was the best of a bad bunch. Atleast he looked like he gave a damn unlike around 8 other players out there. He did well in the second half and it's not his fault no one in the back four knows how to defend.

11852~~~
Most of his passes to the left didn't find the target.

11853~~~
I'll give him credit for looking like he cared, performance was still unacceptable

11854~~~
He was really important tonight, kept a cool head and was composed on the ball despite the atmosphere. I think we'd of got smashed without his experience tonight. Look at Schneiderlin for comparison, completely bottled it.

11855~~~
I think he played well tonight. He's far from good enough to be an automatic pick here of course, but he wasn't amongst those who choked tonight.

11856~~~
Well, we won there when he didn't play. He's mediocre, our midfield was non-existent, Wham smashed us in terms of created chances.

11857~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> wum

yeah, that's probably the worse of it, not even that he's lost his legs but that he's literally the worse captain in the clubs history. I don't seem him doing anything that looks encouraging, never see him take control (well apart from taking control of the ball and smashing it wide to Valencia).

11858~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/rooneyrbqff.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/rooneyrbqff.gif"/>

11859~~~
Martial.

11860~~~
Yup that's true but the Rooney bashing is getting boring. When he deserves it, fair enough. He did really well when everyone around him was losing their composure today and also did really well for our second goal.

11861~~~
Showed a nice burst of pace for the first Martial goal, otherwise overhit every single pass from midfield. Sad state of a player.

11862~~~
He was awful, he's not a CM or #10 or whatever it is he is trying to be right now, he just doesn't have the brain or passing variety for the role. He didn't shit it? So what, neither did Martial and he's a 20 year old kid in his first season here. When your Captain and creative midfield fulcrum is as poor as he was with the same pass over and over to the point that West Ham stopped defending it, it tells you all you need to know.

11863~~~
Jeez, really good? It's people like you that make people say the wrong stuff. If that was really good we are bound for mid table. Good thing you are not manager. Then again LvG thinks Rooney is really good. 

The whole team was very poor, he was just slightly less!

11864~~~
Was a different game though mate, the atmosphere was crazy tonight and I don't think we have any players that could've done a better job tonight.

11865~~~
He utterly lacks the nuance and intelligence to play in midfield. He lacks the ball control at no.10. He lacks the pace and sharpness at no.9, and yet I thought he played fairly well tonight, he needs to go.

11866~~~
One of our better players today.

11867~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Leave Wayne Rooney alone!

11868~~~
Indeed, people hating because it's become the in thing to do

11869~~~
What an absolute joke of a performance from our captain.

I can't believe his average rating for the West Ham game is currently 4/10. 

Very generous if you ask me.

11870~~~
I can only really think of Martial as a United player today who was not worse than him and yet Rooney is the scapegoat on here.

11871~~~
Possibly our 2nd or 3rd best player. But I do agree he was poor. That just goes on to show how bad we were

11872~~~
He did well in the buildup to our second goal, and some of his hollywood passes actually came off. But his insistence on trying that long pass to the right wing is annoying as hell. It is as if it is the only thing he knows how to do these days, and he is still not very good at them. What's even worse was the commentator on my broadcast (NBCSN) gushing over Rooney's passes as if we were watching prime Pirlo or Scholes.

11873~~~
Tbf it's definitely not Rooney's fault that Rojo might as well put on the other team's jersey before the game starts and yet is always the only player in space to pass to. How that cnut lasted 90 mins and Valencia got hauled off I'll never know.

11874~~~
Really good? I think he did certain things decently and is getting some unfair abuse (for this game only) but he is clearly not the way forward. Centre midfield is not a retirement house.

11875~~~
To be fair he isn't, the whole lot of useless pricks are getting slated

11876~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

hypnotic

11877~~~
Why is he the scapegoat? Have you looked at the other threads?!!

Serious victim complex. On behalf of another person. It's all very strange.

11878~~~
he didn't go hiding to his credit, like half the team but has some howler moments for a ball player.

11879~~~
He was better than his midfielder partners but if I was the teams main creator I'd look to get our best players on the ball, Martial, Rashford and Mata. Rooney however seems determined to get Rojo and Valencia in the game as much as possible.

They're the last players we want on the ball in the attacking third.

11880~~~
I wasn't happy with Rooney's performance but I'm more concerned that Schneiderlin and Herrera (both 26) who are suppose to be at their physical peak and have played midfield for most of their careers were worse than him. Can't really say Rooney is keeping 'better midfielders' out of the team now - they're all underperforming.

11881~~~
He was decent, but it's simply not enough for a player on his salary. One thing you can say about him is he's at least trying to impose his will on the match, which is more than you can say for plenty of other players.

11882~~~
He was terrible tonight but there were much, much worse offenders.

11883~~~
He wasn't great today, but it was a lot better than others. I gave him a 5, which ended up being like equal 3rd.

11884~~~
Wow, this thread is shocking. If that was a bad game by Rooney, what in gods name were the other midfielders on the pitch doing?

11885~~~
One of our better players tonight

11886~~~
He was total and utter shit and yet still one of our better players which says it all.

He's finished as a striker and was never good enough to be a midfielder. If we want to ever win the title or do well in Europe we aren't going to do with a past it striker arsing about in midfield.

He should be sold in the Summer, but of course he won't be. We're stuck with him for years to come.

11887~~~
Was such a strange performance... It was like watching Zidane play. Unfortunately it was like watching Zidane play in a charity game... in 30 or 40 years time.

Every time he got the ball he looked for a Hollywood pass. His highlights reel would look like one of the performances of the season, whilst his lowlights reel would look like an 85 year old dementia ridden Paul Scholes after being wheeled onto the pitch following a 12 hour binge of forcing him to watch himself in his prime.

His passing map tonight must look like an American report of Laos after several years of consistent bombing.

11888~~~
He was average but still one of our better players today.

I'm all for Rooney bashing when it is deserved - like how on earth he's an automatic starter - but he doesn't deserve it for this game. Mediocre, yes, but there were others who were much worse.

11889~~~
One of our better performers but to describe it as anything more than decent would be wrong. Hit a few nice passes and his little burst was key in Martial's second. Don't know why he was kept as the deeper midfielder when Herrera was doing so poorly in front of him.

Seriously overplayed the 'switch of play' option which removes any advantage of surprise and we really could have done with seeing more of those surges/bursts forward (where in the world did that come from, it was like an acid flashback).

11890~~~
Agree, but he was abysmal.

11891~~~
As our senior player and captain, he had to do more than he did. Much more. He should be held to a higher standard and he failed. It was more of the same when we needed him to inspire the others. Happy to see him go ASAP.

11892~~~
Love how the commentators always go on about his vision.

11893~~~
Why do these 'pundits' and commentators think these 60 yard passes is examples of pulling the strings, great vision, dictating play. The best passer in the past 30 years is Xavi and how many times did he do these pointless passes? The switch of play is supposed to mix things up or stretch the opposition...not to be the pass every time. It was the same nonsense with Gerrard - playing quick and accurate 10 yard passes with one or two touch is much more effective then this fecking hoof he does every time.

To be fair at least he tried something tonight. The other midfielders were a joke as was Mata and the FB's. Says more about the state of the team, which is reflected by the captain. The worst United captain I can think of. Bring back Fletch!

11894~~~
This. 

Also, hHis mere presence is detrimental to the way the team plays. He needs to be transferred out this summer along with LvG.

11895~~~
I liked his attitude and efforts to put up a fight - we needed much more of that across the team. It's unfortunate that his ability no longer matches that attitude.

11896~~~
Agree with this a lot. But for some reason the opposite holds true. He gets over the top praise for doing the very basics right. 

Sick of his hollywood passes. You could tell the point in the game West Ham defenders sussed out what he was going to do with the ball.

11897~~~
I can't fault him for that today, there were many others who did let us down there. The decline shouldn't taint his United career. But yes, it's very real and cannot be ignored. If he can't do it anymore, the club should make it a priority to find his replacement. I worry we'll hold on for marketing reasons, just so he gets the scoring record, and hold ourselves in the process.

11898~~~
Others being bad should not excuse that from Rooney. Hes mean to be our talisman. People say stop bringing up pay, but its important cos we pay him like hes our captain, talisman, leader, etc. But hes none of that. Its not a case of him being a standout (like Martial) and the others letting him down. Hes just not good enough any more. He cant last 90 minutes. Hes too predictable in what hes going to do.

Hes not a striker. 
Hes not a #10.
Hes not a midfielder.

He has an armband so our manager is trying his hardest to get him into the team, but hes not a leader and cant motivate anybody around him when the going gets tough.

11899~~~
If he is going to stay and be a starter... which position would be the best for him?

11900~~~
Number 10, don't know why he's used as the number 8, just hits crossfield balls. At least at 10 he has some goal threat and can get in the box.

11901~~~
Why should anyone tell me to stop bringing up his wages? I pay to support the club and I'm allowed to question if he's worth what the club pay him. He's isnt, and hasn't been for a long time.

11902~~~
I still fail to see whatever it is that makes some people believe that Rooney can be a classy midfielder. He's been a great player for us, without doubt, but insisting on shoehorning him into the lineup moving forward will hurt the team. He's finished as an elite striker, and there's a significant number of better midfielders around. The Scholes analogy doesn't work for me. Rooney will never come close to being as good a midfielder as Scholes was, just as Scholes was never as good a striker as Rooney. Moreover, Scholes made the transition much earlier in his career. Rooney will always try to put in a shift, but for me he lacks many of the attributes I would want to see in a Manchester United midfielder. That he may be one our better options there speaks more to the poor state of our midfield than it does of Rooney's quality.

11903~~~
Bingo

He didn't have a bad game tonight... but he simply needs to be better

Tonight also highlighted that he really is not a team leader

11904~~~
Exactly, He is taking this fanboy thing too far.

Rooney wasn't good tonight. He is a non effective passenger of that midfield. From tonight I'd give him a 4/5 rating ....Herrera and Schneiderlin  were even worse. But they are  rightfully being blasted for it(I'd give them 1/2 ratings and I like them both)

Poor Wayne Rooney.

I swear some people come across as bigger fans of certain players than the club. The only one that should be walking out of Upton Park with his head held high is Martial.

11905~~~
His usual 1 or 2 miscontrolled touches per game, I thought he was decent at spreading and stretching the game.

His job couldn't get easier with ander and morgan playing next to him like the way I did when I was 5.

11906~~~
Hard to lead this lot into battle..... I thought Rooney was one that got pass marks last night along with Valencia, Dave, Smalling and Mata (although not his biggest fan). Rashford is a kid but he should not be starting games like this so he gets a pass on a technicality.

11907~~~
In a team with average rating 3/10 probably.

11908~~~
Rooney upfront or in midfield doesnt matter. He doesnt contribute enough and is not good enough in either position

11909~~~
#10. But I worry for our future if he's going to be a starter. It's just hard to see us building a champion team with so many passengers and has-beens.

11910~~~
He looks stiff as hell

11911~~~
Thought he did alright last night. You want more but it wasn't that bad. He drove from midfield for our 2nd goal and we need to see more of him doing that.

11912~~~
He's a shit Charlie Adam. 

Feel sorry for those fans who still see him as their idol. Must be difficult letting go.

Maybe we could bring Scholes bsck again? Couldn't be worse

11913~~~
You only need to look at the name of the poster who regularly defends "WR8" to see that.

A bad performance is blamed on the system and his team mates. An average performance is made out to be this excellent game changing performance. Remarks are made on how he "tries" and "looks like he cares." Various different positions and roles are suggested just to accommodate him in the team when he's already tried and failed in those positions a few weeks before.

It's ridiculous. The defence of and deference to Wayne Rooney grates me more than his shite performances and big paycheck.

11914~~~
Very true.

If you are stand up for one player that badly, then do it for the rest . Or have a go at everyone including him. The number of excuses that are constantly made for him are just ridiculous.

This fanboy phenomenon is one thing I hate about modern football. As long as your favorite keeps playing , whether its at the detriment of the team or not, you are happy. Makes no sense. 

I think the best thing one can do as a fan is to realize when our favorites are no longer the superheroes we once thought they were. Its human nature, people decline. Rooney has been declining for years.

11915~~~
Only real positive for me from yesterday match was the way he took the ball just before our second goal and moved with it forward before passing to Rashford. He showed more intent and composure in that one move than the rest of the match combine. Overall okeish match from him, but far from what we need.

11916~~~
Rooney's default mode of play. Receive ball, telegraph pass to either wing. He needs to realise we don't have a Crouch, Lukaku, or Carrol to aim for pointless crosses in the air.

11917~~~
This isn't a thread about the other players, this is a thread about the fraud we have as a captain. Herrera and Schneiderlin were absolute dogshit and are rightfully getting torn apart in their own threads and those players might even get dropped, he won't. Them being utter shite doesn't excuse him from yet again being shit too. He's paid at least triple what they are(sshhh don't mention the war!), he's completely undroppable and he's useless to any team looking to compete at the very top. It's an absolute joke. We are an absolute joke as long as the situation remains the same.

He's a disgrace of a captain, that the team can repeatedly get away with spineless performances under his leadership says it all about his tenure as captain. People going on about how well he did for Martial's second by driving forward, he only did it because there was no Hollywood ball to the wing on. The claims he has a footballing brain are a complete fallacy. Trying the same things over and over again regardless of the situation is not a footballing brain, it's a complete lack of creativity and is the opposite of having a good footballing brain.

11918~~~
The funny thing is he thinks he can play like Scholes and pull the strings from deep. There is delusion and there is the notion that Rooney can be an excellent deep lying playmaker. 

He's flopped at every position he's been tried this season and is one of the reasons why the team struggles to make the top 4. When your main striker contributes <b><i>zero</i></b> points over the entire first half of the season, you must be very lucky to achieve something of notice in the league.

11919~~~
Agreed, I laugh and joke about it. But it really is an awful outpouring of over-emotional fans scrambling around for things to point fingers at because they've thrown their rattle. Grown men typing out pages and pages of rubbish about one of our players who was pretty good today and one of the few who looked like he gave a shit and was giving everything for the cause. I just shake my head, it is truly bizarre.

11920~~~
It's club and manager fault to allow anyone below required quality having undroppable status. For me personally only 3 player should have that kind of treatment based on their performances, De Gea, Shaw pre-injury and Martial, the rest of the team are just as bad as Rooney, they run around, have some kind of impact here and there but overall it's pathetic beyond recogision!

11921~~~
Also if you come on here and say you think he played okay you're branded a fan boy etc. I'm impartial to Rooney but can see he did alright yesterday so don't see why you'd come on to this thread to bash him.

11922~~~
This. Cleverley-esque.

11923~~~
Yeah, true that. I just find it weird, the "end of Rooney" thread was great because all the pitchforks were in one thread yelling at each other about who could out Rooney-is-SHITE! each other. On match day it spills over into here and it is exhausting to think how some of these people can manifest the rubbish they have spouted about this game. Especially when he had a pretty good one. 

I do think, like I mentioned above that it is an extension of the poor football and having the footballing soul sucked out of us through Van Gaal's awful style. They fly around like a helicopter in a shit blizzard flinging shit at any old thing to have a bitch about. Rooney, Woodward, the board, Fred the red. It is tiresome.

11924~~~
For someone who claims to not be a particular Rooney fan you're often exasperated by any criticsm of him. Which you almost always defend him against. 

I think you might be a bigger fan than you let on.

11925~~~
Oh he sure is.

But I do think Rooney was one of the better of a piss-poor bunch yesterday. Martial and De Gea aside, he was probably 4/10 in a team which averaged 3/10. Doesn't say a lot but at least he was better than some others.

11926~~~
Yeah agree. He at least got involved. Most of the criticism is perfectly valid though. Some go over the top but that's the case in EVERY players thread.

11927~~~
Very few people are disagreeing with that. Its the ''he played well brigade'' that are trying to imply that him not being the worst one means he had a good game . He didn't  

Very few of our players deserve credit from last night ,Rooney included.

11928~~~
Is a punch in the face better than a kick in the balls? He still wasn't good enough and he's supposed to be our leader, so he should be getting less slack than the others anyway.

It's not even his fault any more. It's painfully obvious he's not good enough, yet he's constantly being thrown out there to do things he simply can't do any more or never could do. It's gross negligence by LVG and he is doing Rooney no favours with the special treatment. I feel sorry for him sometimes, but then I remember how he got himself into this position.

11929~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11930~~~
<span style="color: #ffffff">...</span>

11931~~~
You think he had a pretty good game last night? 

Genuinely?

11932~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Something about that seems very familiar...

11933~~~
Im worried about those who think he had a good game yesterday.
Im also worried that people say he had an "ok game" or "not bad, leave him alone" like its acceptable.

11934~~~
Yeah, all that sounds exactly like the 'stepping up to the plate' we asked for, doesn't it?

11935~~~
He's a rubbish captain, no leadership at all. He was average last night and that's the best thing I can say about him, we need to move him on

11936~~~
They haven't seen a proper midfielder in a United shirt in a long time, don't blame them

11937~~~
My biggest problem does go back to what we expect for him. We really should be expecting more from our so called:
-Talisman, captain, highest paid and longest serving player.

United pay him like hes Ronaldo and Messi so its not unreasonable to see him not only performing like that but as captain, dragging our team in big games like this when it matters. When youre 2-1 up, with 20 minutes to go, I expect him to go around telling everybody keep calm, theyve taken the crowd out of it, and just keep the ball. Given hes right bang in the middle its perfect time for him to dictate the play and its the perfect time to get the ball and ping it to the wings to stretch the play and move West ham from left to right.

Its frustrating that all these excuses are made for him. When hes played #10 the excuse was hes a striker. 
When hes played as a striker, he should be playing as 10 with legs around him or a deeper since he can dictate.
But once in midfield, he cant dictate a game.

Aghhhhh

11938~~~
True.

Also true. He was actually very average. One good pass in 10 doesn't constitute "great passing" as some would have you believe. Standards are extremely low for Rooney, though, these days. He can be a passenger all game and put one good pass on an attackers head and he'll be hailed as some midfield maestro.

Of course he's not good enough, and it's quite sad that he really has become Mr. Manchester United. He epitomes our problems pretty well even if he is just a part of them.

11939~~~
So after 'running' games against Villa, Palace and Everton he gets found out against a half decent team. I agree he was one of the better performances out of a lot of cowards, I just wonder how long this is actually going to last for.

11940~~~
He's a good fit for a club aiming for Europa League.

11941~~~
Imagine we don't properly strengthen midfield because we think he's a midfielder. 
I think I will kill someone's dog.

11942~~~
Has he officially changed his name to "The Captain?" The commentator last night sure seemed to think so.

What baffles me is how English pundits genuinely seem to think firing ball after ball out to the wings is controlling the game and pulling the strings, the comparisons to Pirlo after the Everton game were particularly hilarious. West Ham stopped pressing him after a bit and just waited to intercept the cross-field pass he tried nearly every time he got the ball. 

It was said a while ago that he was our Gerrard and that is exactly how it's playing out.

11943~~~
Yes, you might be right. I might just like and respect one of our better and more prestigious players more than the consensus of the Caf deems that I should. I better get that checked out.
He was one of the few who looked like they gave a shit about what was happening around them.

11944~~~
Even if we accept that as true, that doesn't constitute a good game.

11945~~~
Accept or not, he had a good game regardless.

11946~~~
For all his aggression and giving the ref an earful for the last decade, he rarely lights a fire underneath his troops. 


Play a bad pass to him or don't read his run and he'll screw his face up like he's bitten a wasp but you don't ever see him getting angry reading our performance as a whole. If a winger doesn't track back he should be giving them a bollock in, if someone loses their man at the corner he should be on top of them telling them to sort it out. If a poor decision is made on the counter he should be having a word. 

In reality he's just too passive and seems to have little awareness of the game as a whole which is crazy.

11947~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This happened? Not surprising, really. Every half-decent thing he does gets blown out of proportion to make it seem like it's something he does on a regular basis.

He absolutely did not have a good game. Decent, at best, even if it looked good compared to <i>some </i>of our players.

11948~~~
He really didn't.

11949~~~
This Dubouis guy is running away with May's prize after he won it for April too for Rooney's number one fan. He still has to prove he isn't Wayne Rooney himself though, othervise he'll have to return his award. Of course, <a class="username" data-user="56298, @SteveJ" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56298/">@SteveJ</a> is our regular host.

11950~~~
Hilarious shtick. Just calling it as I see it. I've done well to pip Shaman to the award.

11951~~~
he had some good moments and as many brainfart moments. I'm not sure that makes a good game or not, maybe for a midtable team which we currently are

11952~~~
I think amol above explained it well. He was decent, in the context the entire game being a 3-2 defeat - he at least showed some bottle and got stuck in. Not really much else you can do in this poor system.

11953~~~
He was barely adequate. Just because the ore mongs in the side were not addiquate it does not constitute a good game. He was just less crap than the rest. 
Granted he at least showed some fight and I'll give credit for that.

11954~~~
I would be complaining my guts out if I paid a hilton rate for a motorway holiday inn quality. 

I'd still complain my guts out even if its paid by the company and not my own pocket. 

I could be sleeping in a kingcoil with a nice view and a jacuzzi instead of a dodgy motel where they got granny cum stain on the pillow.

11955~~~
He was absolutely, 100% invisible for the the first 45 minutes. Then in a ten minute spell after half time, he gave the ball away 3 or 4 times in quick succession. Between minutes 55 and 70 he had a good spell, looked hungry and put 2 or 3 excellent long, crossfield passes in. Then he disappeared again for the last 15 minutes when the going got tough.

If you think that constitutes a good game, I'm not sure what you were watching.

11956~~~
I hate all this "found out" talk, just because someone hasn't had a particularly good game v someone.
Read all sorts of nonsense about Barcelona being "found out", because they took a whacking in...the European cup semi final!

If that's found out, what on earth have we been this year?

11957~~~
Youre right, everythings fine. As long as he turns it on against teams that give him space we are golden

11958~~~
More than anything I am surprised at Rooney's poor leadership skills. For someone who has rubbed shoulders with leaders like Keano,Vida,Neville,Evra etc he really doesn't show many signs of a great leader.

11959~~~
It's quite surprising be didn't develop into the kind of leader Keane and Vidic (I wouldn't say Evra and Gaz were great captains) was. If you'd watched him 8-9 years ago, you'd be sure he'd have developed into one.

Maybe it's the fact that he's in an attacking position and those kind of captains are usually the kind who influence games and inspire team mates through attacking play, making assists and scoring goals, instead of dictating play and organising the defence which he is struggling to do.

11960~~~
Like most politicians, <b>keeping his job</b> is more important than actually doing his job.

11961~~~
Pardon?

Just curious, how does one measure leadership? Not trying to be Amar__'s hilarious and not ever over-done caricature of "haha I bet it is Wayne himself guys!" But genuinely, how do you measure how good or bad his leadership skills are?

11962~~~
Poor first touch.
Cries at referee for 90minutes.
At risk of a red card every time he tackles.
Losses ball half the time.
When he does retain the ball after a first touch - knock it away from the body (ooooh what trick does he have up his sleeve?) - oh yea, it's the Stevie Gerrard speculative cross-field ball. Every. Single. Time.
If only we were competing for a title and he slipped to throw it away, then the transformation would be complete.

He got bossed by Noble... Bossed and bullied. 
In a game where Noble should have been introduced to an ethos where you can't carry an injured Utd player off the pitch like a petulant toddler (in fairness, he should have been sorted immediately after he did that to Herrera in the league game), Captain Pugwash slid evermore effortlessly into the Stevie G caricature we all enjoyed laughing heartily at when he too was long past his best and all he had left were outlandish diagonal passes and long range shots with no venom. 

Scapegoat for imminent failure at the Euros anyone? The prospect of that young, fast Englad team having Rooney in midfield is like having a kick about with Stephen Hawkins and being upset when he doesn't 'hit the space'.

Maybe Waynetta will hand in another transfer request in the off season and we can be done with him.... Third time lucky Wayne.

11963~~~
Putting in a top notch performance, setting an example for other teammates, bollocking the team when they are underperforming..the list goes on.

11964~~~
So nothing much that is credible in the end there really. Another fan assumption on performance metrics they are unable to gauge and fully understand but have come to a solid conclusion anyway. A bit strange, to say the least.

11965~~~
Huh. Roy Keane used to do that when he was our captain. So, did Vida when he found the back 4 disorganised.

11966~~~
Yeah, I know. Patty Evra used to do it as well. Giggsy sometimes gave the boys a real rev up during the match.

11967~~~
I don't doubt his huff and puff/desire to win but he gives the ball away too cheaply and predictably for our supposed talisman

11968~~~

11969~~~
That doesn't really have anything to do with leadership metrics and how to gauge them?...

11970~~~
So your angle for sheltering him from criticism is to claim his quality intangible. 

It's clear as day he's a very pale shadow of the leaders we have had in the past like Vidic, Neville and Keane. just because we can't bring up some opta statistics doesn't mean it's not a valid argument. He can't strung a sentence together without breaking it up with "eeeehm" how is he supposed to inspire anyone?

He does absolutely feck all marshalling on the field. When have you ever seen him directing the play like Keane does or like Basti did in his few games for us. 

He's not a leader it's as simple as that and the argument that it's unquantifiable is weak.

11971~~~
I'm not sheltering him for criticism. I don't really care what some people say on a forum, I doubt he does either. I was just curious as to how people gather a metric for gauging a players leadership skills and then are happy to draw a conclusion to it. I am neither here nor there on how good or bad a leader is because I have no idea how it is quantifiable. He looks like a bit of a crap leader but the manager is also crap and peddling a shite style that will never get the most out of his squad.

I've seen varying degrees of pointing, marshalling, bollocking, leading by example, spurring the team on with positive play. Last season, especially there were a few key moments in the middle of the season where he was driving us on from the 10 or even the midfield position. Does that make him a great leader? I don't know. Ultimately if the playing group respects him and gives him and the manager 100% on the field and he keeps that going.. Then I guess he is a good leader? Or is he? I don't know, I just wanted some clarification.

Ultimately if the season is in the shitter for all manner of reasons and you're saved by a log floating by do you worry about getting shit all over yourself? Or drowning in toilet water?

"He's not a leader" he might not be, I still have no idea how you can come to that conclusion. It is a matter of one opinion against another. Which is fine.

11972~~~
leaders are supposed to lead by example, no? Lets flip it round, tell us the qualities you see

11973~~~
Leaders can lead in all kinds of ways. I'm not the one questioning his leadership here, not would I to be honest. I don't think there is a reasonable fan metric that they can point to and claim it as great leadership. Except the main ones calculated at seasons end. Winning trophies as captain and setting an example of hard work or high standards on the training paddock. All noise out of the camp says mainly that he's a good leader. I'm happy to trust the gaff and the playing group on that one.

11974~~~
Honestly, I think his leadership qualities are massively overrated. If we are going to base on what "reports" say, that his fellows players think he is a solid captain, we might as well believe anything. Surely, all players are meant to speak positive about their captains to the media. What we need to see is a captain on the pitch. As much as United fans hate Liverpool, Chelsea and City, you only need to watch 15 mins of one of their matches and you can instantly point out who the captain is on the pitch, in Gerrard, Terry and Kompany, without spotting the arm band. With United, after 90 mins, It's hard to tell. Only Smalling edges it these days. In the first couple of weeks in the season, you would have thought that Schweinstiger was the captain on the pitch and that is how obvious it should be.

What we need is a captain on the pitch and honestly Rooney is not a captain on the pitch IMO. He might talk a good game in the dressing room but so does LvG too but on the pitch they are the most passive leaders I've ever seen, except when it comes to arguing with the refs on the pitch. We need a real captain, we need a new captain not a motivational speaker.

11975~~~
As much as he has declined he is still better than all but Martial. I'd rather have Rooney over Mata Lingard Depay Rashford Herrera Fellaini Young.

11976~~~
Terrible performance from our so called Captain. How dare he..

Oh wait.

11977~~~
About his supposed leadership qualities, United were not pulling up trees back in the 80s but Bryan Robson was still well regarded by the fans for his performances. You can't say the same about Rooney. If anything, Smalling (earlier in the season) and Martial have been the standout players <i>despite</i> the team's performances.

11978~~~
I try to refrain from criticising his performances..but can't help it.. Have to say against West Ham he did alright and made all the players around him look awful.. He kept bypassing players around him like Gerrard used. It might make him look good but to the detriment of the collective. He was the playmaker for goodness sake and you're tasked to make others look good.
That's not leading by example.. It's him trying to hug the spotlight. Any other leader would have kept the ball rolling on the floor and driving it into their 18 yards. Not floating the ball out wide and asking the rest to cover the miles.

11979~~~
yes, this is the annoying thing. Nobody else does these long balls, its like he has license to do them despite a manager who is obsessed with not giving the ball away, yet gets heaps of praise when one or 2 are successful

11980~~~
Rooney is one of the main reasons why United won't be in the CL next season.

First, he was incredibly poor in the first half of the season, arguably our worst player, and contributed <b><i>zero</i></b> points in that periiod. That must be the first time in United's history when the main striker fails to win a single point for the team over 4-5 months of football. Amaizing shitness. Apart from January, he has scored only 2 league goals all season. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> Iheanacho scored 8 goals in 7 starts and 750 min., Rooney managed 7 goals from 26 starts and 2320 min. Rashford's goals to min. ratio is far better than Rooney's too. Previously unknown youngsters have put him to shame.

Second, we didn't buy a top experienced forward because of Rooney, despite selling 3 experienced strikers in RVP, Chicha and Falcao and also ADM. Small wonder then that we scored only 46 goals in the league, despite signing a top talent in Martial. By comparison, we scored 62 league goals in the previous season.

United won't fare much better next season if Rooney starts in most games again. City, Chelsea and Liverpool will probably do way better than this season and we will struggle to make the top 4 again if we rely on captain fantastic to deliver the goods.

11981~~~
Leadership is not something you can apply "metrics" to.

There are natural leaders of men like Keane or Terry or Adams who enjoy being the alpha-male and organising troops however much they can do in a fast paced sport like football.

And then there are those who aren't so naturally inclined at all but garner respect through their footballing prowess. Like, say Messi at the world cup, Xavi for Barca (after Puyol) or Giggs sometimes for United. These are usually players who get the captaincy because there's no proper captain in the team but because of the standard they set for the club, it works.

The second category isn't ideal but a pre  requisite. No matter what, the captain should set the example for the team, squad and club in general. If it's by their footballing quality, then good, if it's by their footballing quality and ability to organise and lead, then even better.

Rooney is evidently not a leader (category 1) and has never been. He's always been a shy not very articulate bloke who plays on instinct and heart. He's always been more bulldozer than commander. So that part of his (lack of) leadership skills is evident from anyone watching our games. Or from the fact that, despite being at United and being very important to us, he's only got the captiancy once every respected, successful senior player was out the door. He's a "leader" by default if there is any such thing.

But the issue isn't that Rooney isnt a leader, you can't always have a great one, but rather that he fails on the pre-requisite (category 2), which is of setting the standard for everyone else. If he has been doing so, he's been setting a really really low one. When the captain with such a big status in the side (musht alwaysh play), stinks up the premier league for half a season, and is otherwise average to good at best, then what sort of example does that set for the club in general? Not a very good one.

11982~~~
LVG has often stated he likes the way Rooney switches the ball from side to side. That is part of his Philosophy.

11983~~~
<span style="color: #ffffff">...</span>

11984~~~
The forum rate our forwards as follows this season (MotM awards in backets):

Rashford - 6.4    (4)
Herrera - 5.8    (1)
Mata - 5.7    (4)
Young - 5.7    (1)
Lingard - 5.5    (1)
Depay - 5.4    (3)
Rooney - 5.4    (2)
Fellaini - 5.1    (1)

I'd go along with that in terms of performances. So unless we're banking on Rooney dramatically improving after 3 poor seasons (despite age being against him), or the players you mention getting worse (despite them all being younger, with the majority very young and still improving), then I'm not sure what you'd base that on, Fellaini aside.

Apart from Fellaini, I'd have every one of those instead of Rooney. That's before taking into account his salary, his age or his personality.

11985~~~
There is a huge bias against Rooney on this forum. He has had a poor season but I personally think he's a much better level than all but Martial. That there all on 5. Says a lot to me though.

11986~~~
Granted it looks nice when it comes off, many don't. Then LVG complains we don't keep the ball enough. The philosophy also calls for quicker passing to catch the opponent out, those lofty balls that take an age to come down and be controlled serve little against half decent sides

the club currently is full of contradictions on and off the pitch

11987~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I can imagine that.

Unfortunately it tends to work a bit better as an attacking philosophy when you switch the play faster than a wheelchair user. Rooney just plods around mostly and slows everything down - great if we were 3-0 up but when chasing the game it's just moronic and a rather blunt tool.

11988~~~
Haha I am not joking either, I remember he specifically stated he was pleased with "Rooney's ball switching" when asked how he did in midfield, saying his philosophy is to move the ball on 1 side, then quickly switch to the other and take advantage of the space. Obviously we never do it properly though.

11989~~~
Nah - there's an equally huge bias against Mata, Young and Lingard on this forum; all of whom have outperformed Rooney.

I have no idea why anyone would want a player who's clearly on their last legs, on a huge salary and who has been steadily faltering from an already mediocre level for the last 2-3 seasons.

Very few attacking players have played well this season (Martial & Rashford), but Rooney has still managed to be visibly worse than Lingard, Herrera & Mata.

I'd be selling Fellaini as the most urgent priority, then I'd be selling Rooney and then I'd be looking to loan out either Depay or Lingard (provided we could get a few attacking player's in). Mata and Herrera in my view have done just enough these last 2 seasons under awful circumstances to be given another year under a better manager; plus we can't and shouldn't get rid of 6-7 attacking players.

11990~~~
Rooney as captain shows what we are lacking. There is no fighting spirit. I love Smalling and DDG, but they are too kind - probably great chaps, but they don't rile up the others. For me, Evra was our last player who played with his heart on his sleeve, with that intensity, that never say never attitude, and that no matter we will always fight for a win. Even when he was just a little bit shit he had that fight in him. Rio had the same - nobody is yelling at one another anymore, nor are they giving praise to those who do well either. Rooney spends more time around the ref than he does in the opposing penalty box. It's like he is trying to carbon copy Scholes and Keane, but he missed the essentials and only caught the Youtube reels - Scholes' long range passing and Keane having a go at the ref.

11991~~~
I cannot for one moment beleive there's nobody at the club who thinks his time is up and he should be moved on. 
Imagine we fail to invest in midfield because of some delusion that he will be an excellent midfielder?

11992~~~
Imagine? No need for that. It's more than likely. We're probably planning our transfers to build the team around him.

11993~~~
I'd bring back Evra in a heartbeat and trade Rojo, Lingard and Depay in the process.

11994~~~
I would most certainly not.

11995~~~
Why?

11996~~~
I can see what you say but have to disagree. Rooney for me deserves a chance under a new manager more than Mata, Herrera or Lingard. He was our best outfield player under Moyes he's been poor under LVG but so has most attacking players. I don't see the sense in loaning Lingard as his age is not great for that I'd keep him as a squaddie or sell.

11997~~~
So now the season is all but over, we are at the find excuses for this season and a new position for next season stage of the cycle. Apparently the reason all those posters predicting a 25+ goal season were wrong is entirely down to lvg and not our prossie loving captain being utterly shit for two thirds of the season, and next season we will all see what a marvellous midfielder he will be. I'm sure we have been here before?

11998~~~
You think he hasn't been declining since 2011 but it's all managers fault?

Well, Rooney was a bit shit already in Fergie's last season. He had a very good first half of the season under Moyes (more like 2-3 months than an the entire first half of the season but never mind) and poor in the second half of the season. It was the same in LVG's first season: good first half of the season with 8 (!) league goals and then crap second half of the season.

When was the last time when Rooney was good over 5-6 months, let alone over a whole season? 4-5 years ago, I guess. It's not about the managers, it's about Rooney. He's been unable to play consistently well for years. If it was only about LVG, Rooney wouldn't have had such a productive month of football in January. This month alone busts the myth that the reason for his poor performances is the manager.

Besides, it's not exactly true that LVG makes our forwards look worse than they actually are: RVP and Falcao were finished. By contrast, Martial has had a great season, despite being only 20 y.o. and coming from a poorer league. He's scored as many goals as Rooney in the latter's debut season at United in a far less attacking side while playing mostly on the left. And he will probably add a goal or two in the next two games.

11999~~~
Wow.

12000~~~
Because it is just a collection of votes from fans who are biased to the club, it isn't built on analysis or curbed by a median line in which the data is collected in a controlled manner. I have no real problem with it as a metric to gauge the Caf's opinion on the players as long as certain caveats are attached to it and that it isn't being used to back up definitive arguments to do with the judgement of certain players. There are obvious bias flaws that run through the system.

12001~~~
If we're blaming LvG for Rooney's performances then all the players should be given another chance.

12002~~~
Which is exactly what we should do...

12003~~~
Depends whether that is - A) another chance next season, or B) another chance to impress under the new boss <i>before </i>next season.

Because A) makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. If anyone thinks our current predicament is solely down to LVG's performance during the season, then they're sadly mistaken. Our squad also has big problems (not as big as he made them appear) which is partly the reason for our 15/16 being such a dire league season.

The club has to keep the players the club/the new manager believes can up their game and be relevant next season.

12004~~~
I'm at a loss people can point fingers at LvG for Rooneys form this season.

The team has been bent over backwards to fit Rooney in this season, where ever possible. I'm sure LvG would play him CB if it mean having his captain on the pitch. No other manager in the world would make allowances for a player as LvG has for Rooney this season. Pointing fingers at LvG for Rooney's poor form is laughable.

The guy was sunday league level at the start of the season, LvG can not be blamed for that. Poor first touch, inability to finish (chances at Wolfsburg away and two away to swansea spring up in my mind straight away. Penalty against Middlesborough etc). There no nice way to put it, the guy was CRAP. Crap as he had been throughout all of 2015 where he was also being shoe horned in anywhere possible. Had a very poor run in central midfield which makes me bamboozled as to why people want him to stay there.

A purple patch, against poor oppositon, in January and some 'not-bad' performances in midfield against crap sides do not vindicate the guy. He has become our Gerrard and needs to be moved on so we can move forward as a club. This was the case in 2013, three years later it still is the case. 

It was similar in Moyes' season. Rooney had a good first few months to the season. Funnily enough his form plummeted as soon as he was awarded with his ridiculous contract.

Funnily enough Mata and Herrera are two players I believe would almost definitely do better in a different set up, under a better manager. As are players like Schneiderlin, Lingaard, Depay and a few others. I'd go as far as saying Martial and Rashford would both be much better under a different manager. 

LvG has been a joke, his refusal to drop Rooney this season, during the first half, definitely played a large part in why we will not get 4th place this season. I mean should we beat Bournemouth today we'd be equal on points with city - our talisman and captain did not contribute a single point in the first half of the season. For me that's can not be overlooked.

12005~~~
My Answer is A but with a new manager next season which makes the most sense. Of course if Mourinho judges some players not good enough over the summer then then its fine to get rid, but players like Memphis, Schniderlin etc deserve another season to show what they can really do. Its also very diffficult to judge players after only a couple of months of pre season which is all Mourinho will get. Our squad has some holes but its far stronger than people make out and 90% of the issues this year are down to LVGs tactics. 4 signings, Mourinho and we will be back to challenging next year of that im sure.

12006~~~
I'm convinced TrustInJanuzai is Wayne himself.

12007~~~
All fans are equally biased though, so the ratings should still be fair. If we assume everyone is harsh towards our player's because of the poor season we're having, Rooney, Mata, Herrera & Lingard would all suffer. If we assume our fans are generous because they have affection for the team, then they will all be artificially a few points too high.

Unless we are suggesting that a good portion of the forum randomly target and dislike a specific player, despite him contributing significantly. If this is the assertion I'd hugely disagree. If a good portion of fans "dislike" a player it probably stems from poor performances (exacerbated by a poor personality). As an example if De Gea had put in performances similar to Rooney this season he'd also be rated equally poorly, despite him currently being a fan favourite (we'd probably hear numerous comments of how much his head has been turned and how his head isn't with us etc). Likewise Di Maria went from being a forum favourite after his first 10 games to a pantomime villain because of his poor performances.

Rooney has been awful this year; he's been as poor as Lingard in term of technical ability but with the additional problem of a massive lack of pace and movement to boot. Lingard's decision making is shocking, but then so is Rooney's (for example he plays those cross-field passes regardless of whether our winger is man marked by someone a foot taller).

Also I think a lot of our player's have the excuse of LVG's system to blame. However Rooney has been given free range to play almost wherever he chooses, always playing down the middle and almost always playing as a number 9 or number 10. The likes of Mata, Depay, Herrera and Lingard have been moved around to suit Rooney.

12008~~~
Let's be honest, that he's been moved from 9 to 10, to the wing and now to midfield probably says more than any statistic about how poor he has been.

12009~~~
youve got me

12010~~~
Like someone in the thread said before. He's like the kid at football who brought the ball you all plan to play with. Can't exactly put him on the sidelines - got to shove him in somewhere.

12011~~~
haha except hes not the worst player in our team by a longshot

12012~~~
Perhaps but for the first half of this season he was comfortably the worst performing player in our team and arguably (and rather embarassing for United's reputation) one of the worst performing players in the entire league. 

He's been better since Xmas or so but that wasn't really difficult for him to improve. As I've said before, I don't mind him staying as a squad player until his contract runs out but the idea of him continuing to line up in the first XI is just disastrous to United's future. The horse has bolted - he's done.

12013~~~
silent domination. Still makes me chuckle

12014~~~
It can't be all about managers for Mata Depay and Herrera and not for Rooney. I'm not saying it is or not but all players must get judged with the same rules. Imo Rooney has declined but even with that he's still a better level than Mata Herrera Lingard and Depay.

12015~~~
Explain?

12016~~~
Rooney has been poor since before LVG arrived, he's being judged on that. He's also older than the rest of them, expecting him to suddenly stop declining and raise his game in his 30's is asking a bit much of anyone.

12017~~~
He's the only player who got every single precedence he could under every manager and he still hardly outperformed those players. If any of them played as he did in first half of the season they would be sold in January.

12018~~~
Mata Herrera have been equally bad at best and Depay has been even worse.

12019~~~
Even if they are they have been(but they haven't been) they are far more promising and younger than him and could be more important than him in the future, where Rooney is obviously past it and worse by every year.

12020~~~
Fingers crossed, this will be Rooney's last ever game for United at OT.

12021~~~
And have all been dropped because of it, the spud faced chancer plays like crap in the position he insisted pre season he could do so gets shoehorned into someone else's position, THATS why people are pissed off with him and want him gone

12022~~~
Rooney has become a rather pointless player

12023~~~
Gets the ball and cross field pass to the right.

12024~~~
Those lofty diagonal passes to Valencia though <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

12025~~~
He is taking the piss tonight, he probably wants to set the record for number of crossfield passes to fullback, if there is one.

12026~~~
To be fair he has twice looked to the right and rolled the ball to Smalling instead of floating it to Tony V. Mixing it up and now we dunno what's coming. He's an unpredictable genius.

12027~~~
Nice team goal.

12028~~~
I actually think he's a robot and we just haven't programmed any other passes into his hard drive yet.

12029~~~
65years old scholes could do what Rooney did today, maybe even better, the game lacks any signs of tempo with Carrick and Rooney, none of them should ever start again for us, the game couldn't be more boring

12030~~~
100 PL OT goals. A great achievement.

12031~~~
FM PPM: Loves pinging it down the right.

12032~~~
You forgot dwells on ball.

12033~~~
well in Rooney

12034~~~
MOTM for me. Was excellent today

12035~~~
Much better performance. THATS MOUR LIKE IT!

12036~~~
He's been absolutely stunning tonight! The first time I've said that all season

12037~~~
Looked very good today. Maybe there's hope for him yet as a cm

12038~~~
Shown his footballing brain, passing ability and touch on the ball today. I wish I could dream for such performances regularly, but a dead rubber match like this doesn't tell us too much.

12039~~~
Hopefully at another club.

12040~~~
Hope he brings this form into the Palace game. Wonder what Mourinho will think of him in that role

12041~~~
He was really quite good tonight, hope he an keep that up for Wembley and then England.

12042~~~
Definitely.
If we can find teams that are on their summer holidays to play every week.

12043~~~
Showed a better understanding of what he can do as a midfielder I felt. Usually just tries to be Scholes and sprays pointless hollywood passes around. Today he was choosing the right pass, constantly showing for the ball and doing his defensive work. Great performance. By far our most creative option for midfield if he can play to that level consistently

12044~~~
Superb tonight. Turned up at the end of the season when there was nothing to play for. Get rid.

12045~~~
Motm for me. Granted, I only watched the second half, but he was brilliant!

12046~~~
Very good game from him. Midfielder Rooney from now on.

12047~~~
Excellent game from him. His passing was fantastic.

12048~~~
Very good performance, this is why I still think he deserves a shot in a more functional team, still the best passer in our team bar Carrick.

12049~~~
He was fecking brilliant today.

Too bad it was in a game that didn't matter against a pretty weak opponent. Not to mention it being a single game(he's done well in midfield before, but it hasn't really lasted).

12050~~~
I think he's been pretty good in midfield in recent weeks.
Its hard to say if hes good enough in general anymore, its hard to judge individual players nowadays. 
He started the season in dire form, probably the worst of his career but his form since christmas has been much better
I think midfield is his best position by a distance these days though.

I think him, rashford and martial around the left is one of the few functioning parts of our team really.
It'd be the other two midfielders and the guy on the right i'd be looking to swap up.

12051~~~
If we play lots of teams who don't put any effort or press in midfield he'll be fine. He did fine in the second half but the fact he's getting deeper and deeper worries me.

12052~~~
This experiment really won't end well going forward, in spite of a great game against a team already on their holidays.

12053~~~
Agreed

12054~~~
Outstanding in the second half tonight, MotM. It was against a weak, unmotivated team but it was still a class performance, credit where it's due. Worked hard defensively, played some great passes, and involved in all 3 goals tonight.

12055~~~
he deserved to be named MOTM but as I said earlier Scholes in his 4Os would boss the game like this, Bmouth were on their holidays and never really pressed him in a game which suited him, but not that many will come next season..

12056~~~
It's only games like tonight whereby he can play in midfield, in the bigger games he'll be found out

I personally see him as a number 10 next season which has arguably always been his best position

12057~~~
Found his level. Good for him.

12058~~~
Granted he is very good at the ball out to Valencia however it's still one of the weirdest things I've seen at OT. It's literally and I mean literally all he wants to do. He's capable of doing other stuff but it doesn't interest him.

Like all once great players if you give him time he'll make something happen. He couldn't have wished for easier opposition since he came back.

It's going to take a run of games against motivated, decent opposition for the fans and probably him to realise he can't play in midfield.

12059~~~
Played well.

12060~~~
Give me a break with this talk about him finding his role.  He passed it straight out of bounds under no pressure like 5 times.  No, thanks.  Go away Roo.

12061~~~
Outstanding game from him today. We'll see less of them Hollywood passes as he settles down into the role.

12062~~~
That's not how this works. Context will be completely forgotten and he's now a world class midfielder until it can't be denied that he's not. Then he's a striker again and we've been hampering him by playing him in midfield.

He did ok tonight, but for every good ball there was one he put out of play. Tony V's pace and willingness to work his bollocks off kept that ratio down a fair bit too. We all know what the narrative is going to be though.

12063~~~
I'm usually one of the most critical of Rooney but I thought he should he could potentially offer us something in that role tonight. 

Can he do it in a proper game though? Not sure

12064~~~
Typical first half, bordering between anonymous and ineffective but was magnificent in the second half, that ball for youngs goal was simply gorgeous.

12065~~~
Poor first half, good second half. Utilised the space he was given well and made a few cracking passes.

12066~~~
Narrative! this place is unbelievable, literally no praise can ever be given <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12067~~~
He played well in what was in effect a friendly. No-one really seemed up for it from either side.

12068~~~
This, United nor Bournemouth cared, nothing was on the line at all. Rooney was probably up for it trying to make sure he's a starter for the Euros. We shouldn't read anything in to this performance.

12069~~~
He was great tonight, but the game felt like a pre season friendly.   Bournemouth had nothing to play for; some of the players would have been on a beach today if the match had not been postponed on Sunday.  

Lets see how he does on Saturday in a high intensity cup final and also with England in Euro's. He certainly has the footballing instinct to make the switch, simply of question of is his skill set is good enough.

12070~~~
Very good performance and certainly one of his best this season. Only criticism was that he played a few needless hollywood passes.

12071~~~
Super game by our captain. Best passing display I've seen in a while from a United midfielder. Not only his switch of play to open things up, but the vision to get players in behind i.e. Young, Valencia. No one, bar Carrick, at times, does that for us. 

If we're going to play him in midfield next season, we really need to think about what type of midfielder we need to bring the best out of him.

12072~~~
Great way to finish the season, excellent game from him again.

12073~~~
He is a scouser after all

12074~~~
I think it's inevitable he's going to end up playing the quarter back style role Gerrard played in the last year or two at Liverpool.

12075~~~
In front of the back four, or an 8?

12076~~~
As the deepest midfielder playing the ball from deep, with two more mobile midfielders ahead of him.

If I remember correctly, Liverpool played Gerrard deepest with Coutinho/Allen and Henderson ahead of him as #8s.

12077~~~
It was bad enough when he was pretending to be a #10 but he is actually trying to be CM now, we are fecked if he is a starter in that role for us next season.

12078~~~
They did and it was terrible because that role requires good defensive positioning as well which Gerrard and Rooney don't have.

12079~~~
I don't disagree, it's what I think will happen unless Mourinho gets rid of him though.

12080~~~
Great game from him tonight, looking forward to seeing him play at CM next season. I'm glad he's come to realise himself that this is what he has to do to prolong his career in the game. He'll only get better with time in his new role. That is what I expect from a UTD captain, lead by example, dictated the game, creativity and defended well all in the heart of the game.

12081~~~
Looking at how he has tried to play the role so far I'd think we would buy a proper #6 to cover him and let him be the box to box CM, it's a dreadful idea any way you look at it, we shouldn't be bending over backwards to prolong this has-beens career here.

12082~~~
The fact he looked half decent says more about the opposition than him, Bournmouth were quite understandably half arsed in this game.

My worst nightmare is Rooney been given the midfielders role next season, and LvG staying....

12083~~~
Sticking Him in midfield isn't the worst idea. As long as we don't pretend that he can score 25+ goals for us and use him in a limited fashion we should be fine.

12084~~~
Great game for him, hopefully this experiment continue in the Euros to see how he plays in a more fluid team.

12085~~~
Agree, that was by far the best and most creative any of our CM have been this season. Hope he can continue next season. If he had started the season in CM we would have still had at least 1 of RVP or Hernandez and we wouldn't have needed to buy Bastian. I have to say the way Rooney played tonight was what I expected Bastian to do for us all season but he didn't ever influence a game like Rooney did. I'd still keep Bastian as we don't know what's going on with Carrick and who is available in the market.

12086~~~
Just friggin sell him and get a proper midfielder to do the job, just beacuse Rooney can't play as the striker anymore doesn't mean we need to accommodate him elsewhere, fact is he is on too much money, and is too much of an 'icon' for the club for him not to play, so if he stays he'll play when fit, so I'd rather he went personally.

12087~~~
Played well, but Bournemouth let us do what we wanted to do

12088~~~
I can't take any performance from any of the players too serious. This was a dead rubber match against a Bournmouth side that had one foot in Vegas. Cue in the qualitative like great, magic, superb, magnificent, awesome after that match.

12089~~~
Think Rooney gets massively over criticised these days, even when he plays well it seems he's useless. I know one thing for sure, had it been Rooney tracking Grabban instead of Herrera, we would not have conceded that goal.

12090~~~
It doesn't look like he is going to leave though.

12091~~~
If he's doing the job as a midfielder, then why not keep him there? He put in a better display tonight than any of our 'natural' centre midfielders this season.

12092~~~
Agree, and not sure Louis will either, so I'll expect more of the same old shoe horning Rooney in next season.

12093~~~
Yes he did tonight but so what, Bournmouth were in their holidays already.

Unless my memory is failing me we have been here with Rooney before, and quite how he can be expected to become a top class midfielder just because he is not a top class striker anymore is baffling to me.

12094~~~
I think a lot will depend on where Roy will play him in the euros. If Louis stays, I don't expect him to persist with Rooney as our main striker.

12095~~~
No I don't either, so he'll be given the role in midfield, which is maybe why Carrick is seemingly going. 

Not sure what Roy will do with him though, because Kane, Sturridge, and Vardy should all be ahead him as a striker. He'll no doubt find a place for him though.

12096~~~
Definitely man of the match, more of the same again on Saturday please.

12097~~~
I personally think Rooney has done what he's had to do since being put in midfield. Shown a lot more ambition and bravery than all our midifelders put together. Sure, he may lose it at times, but that's down to him playing an optimistic pass as we saw tonight. I mean, I'd prefer that than a 5 yard pass that's not going to get us anywhere.


According to <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.whoscored.com/Players/3859" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">whoscored.com</a>, Rooney has been rated 7.57 whilst playing in centre midfield. In my opinion, he hasn't looked out of place, and would be even better with better players around him.

12098~~~
It's all a matter of opinion and I don't agree, he will always a few good games, and look world class at times, but overall he will get found out in that role, as he has done recently as a striker, the decline has set in and a change of postion doesn't stop that.

12099~~~
Do you prefer Rooney as: midfielder, #10 or striker? (China/MLS/Bench are not options)

12100~~~
Retirement.

12101~~~
The only positive I can think of for playing him midfield is that at least it keeps him out of the attack.

12102~~~
His numbers tonight, seeing as people are quick to post them when he has a poor game:

Passes: 100

Pass accuracy: 88%

Touches: 113

Shots: 2

Goals: 1

Tackles: 3

Interceptions: 3

Key Passes: 3

12103~~~
Can't wait for the testimonial!

12104~~~
Assuming he can perform like that regularly and is dropped when he doesn't then no one will mind him staying/playing

12105~~~
Really... one decent game against throw away oposition in a throw away game and people are claiming he do well there next season?

Like the other 90% of the season didn't happen.

How may players in his pay range scored less than 10 league goals this season?

12106~~~
Goodbye and thanks for all the bliss!

12107~~~
We've been hearing this since January. "one decent game and that's it?"

It's very obvious some of you just wont credit Rooney when he has good games. Why is it so difficult to accept he's been in pretty good form since 2016? Whether or not he should still be a part of our squad going forward is a separate debate but let's not take any credit from him for what he does.

12108~~~
Yep. 


He can't. 
He won't. 
We will.

12109~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">I hope Mourinho isn't stupid enough to continue the midfield experiment with Rooney and buys some proper ones</span>

12110~~~
He hasn't been in pretty good form since 2016. He had a decent January, and has been average since. That is not pretty good form.

12111~~~
I've seen him had a few average games. Other than he's been pretty good for me since 2016.

12112~~~
Well your standards and most other people's are very different, I expect a damn sight more from mr undroppable than what he brings.

12113~~~
I think the notion that he has been good this year is another signal of how far standards have dropped. My biggest issue with Rooney is his undroppable status. If he'd accept a squad role then great, but I'm sick of him being shoehorned in all of the time.

12114~~~
One thing that has kept me entertained this season despite the on-field gash has been the amount of absolute drivel being spouted in this thread on a game by game basis.

He had an absolute banger last night. The goal typifies just how important he is when he isn't playing up front with his back to goal as a hold up striker. The intelligence to speed up the transition and take up space in the box to finish will be exactly what we need next season if we change the manager. Whether he plays from a set #10 position of plays just off the front striker and is allowed to drop, I think it will be important with just how good Martial is at dribbling. Getting Luke Shaw back will only boost our attacking creativity down the stretch. I envisage a lot of assists for Martial next season if we can use that as a go-to offensive weapon. Loved that little dink for Young, superb ball.

I'm buzzing for this final now, the whole squad has a reason to win this cup and the form Rooney has shown in the last month has been excellent. If he plays like he played last night then we'll have nothing to worry about in the final.

I'll go back to my comments from a month ago about his maturity. He's slotted into the team perfectly despite peoples fear of Rashford being dislodged. Fair play to him for noticing that he is on a good thing and not breaking it up.

Bingo. The system is flawed, right out of the gate.

12115~~~
brilliant today - unlike others, I actually felt he has been decent in midfield since his return - his worst games have been when he has played up front. His positioning can be suspect, but he has the ability to spread the play more and today he showed his desire to win the ball back.

12116~~~
He was good last night but I'm not changing my stance off the back of a dead rubber fixture at testimonial pace. He's not good enough in any position (ie each position has 2 or 3 better than him), he earns too much to justify being around and he should be kicked out of the door to China or whoever gives money for him on Sunday.

12117~~~
Big game player. Stepped up in the right moment. Bournemouth were determined to stop him and pressed him all over the pitch but Rooney wasn't bothered and rode the challenges. Tell me, where would be in the table without his inavluable contributions?

12118~~~
As CMs go Rooney is quite mobile. He should be one of the more attack minded midfielders since that's where his talents lie.

12119~~~
He's better than most of the proper midfielders we have.

12120~~~
He's a liability in midfield in high intensity games and it won't take long time for the next manager to notice it. WHam's midfielders dominated him without much problems.

12121~~~
Good game against a weak opponent. That's all.

But tbh it's more than he has shown for most of the season so I'm happy with that.

12122~~~
How many other players in the league could put in that performance last night? I'm fed up of coming to this thread and seeing any mistake overblown and any good performance swept under the rug. Rooney has played well in 2016, yes he's had afew poor games but in general he been good and certainly showed that he can grow into the role under a different manager. Last night showed a glimpse of what a top form Rooney could do in misfiled for us next year. I agree that under high press he will need to step it up, but surely when he adjusts to the role that that will be achievable.

The other stupid comment I'm seeing crop up is that he's a striker so will never be able to play CM properly and that we have to buy a proper CM. Football isn't black and white where people can only play one position. Scholes started off as a striker but as he got older he moved from that role and dictated play from deeper, just because Rooney has played upfront doesn't mean he can't adapt to a new role now. That's just people looking through blinkers. 

Forget the name, forget the wage, the player that we saw last night (and have seen the last month in my opinion) has the attributes that we are crying out for in CM and I'm sure that he will get another change to show that under Mounrinho.

12123~~~
He gets generally battered on here which I mainly put down to people not liking as a person more than anything and therefore see every stray pass as a reason to get at him. For me he's been probably the most influential player for United over the last ten years. Of course we have had other players who have come in sporadically and ignited success....but he's been consistently here and no one can say he doesn't work his proverbial ass off for the team, even if he has off days.

12124~~~
Er loads?

Rooney had a really good game last night. But for me to claim that he "has all the attributes we have been crying out for in CM" I'd have to see him perform like a quality CM with some sort of consistency. That was one proper performance but it was against Bournemouth. Fellaini has also had top notch performances for us in midfield as has Herrera. So one good pass a match, or one great match, doesn't really say <i>that </i>much.

His issue with him is two fold:

A) If he's going to be a central midfielder for Manchester United, and not a #10, then can he consistently show the engine, accuracy of passing, defensive discipline, positional sense, running power etc. that we need from midfield? The same question goes for all the other under performing players - Herrera, Schweinsteiger, Fellaini and Schneiderlin. It's all well and good playing like Charlie Adam and giving a great highlights pass for people to drool over, when Swansea give you all the time in the world in match with no relevance, but can you step it up against the likes of Noble and co. away at West Ham, or Carzola and co. away at Arsenal. I have my doubts. I personally don't see the defensive nous, engine etc to see him as a CM in games apart from those against poor sides at home. I'd much rather play him as a #10 where he has to display less discipline and control over his game.

B) That he's a starter regardless of form. This has always been the biggest issue with Wayne Rooney. Noone is going to complain if he plays when he's playing like that, and not playing when he serves up the nonsense he did in the first of the season. That is just. That is logical. But our treatment of Rooney is neither of those things and he's clearly got either LVG or the club itself, by the balls.

So yeah, I have no issue with Rooney playing the same role for us that Giggs did the latter part of his career i.e starting when he's playing great and rested/dropped/rotated when he's not. Him "reinventing" himself as a CM is also not out of the question, as Giggs did. But I think we'll be making a mistake if we rely on that.

12125~~~
He's playing well in midfield.  A lot of somewhat blinkered people won't give him any credit for it regardless... but thankfully they aren't making the decisions.  He'd be the first name on the team sheet for me when I was selecting our midfield at the moment.  He has a good game and you hear so many excuses from the opposition being poor to whatever else.

He had a decent game in midfield against Leicester too... but people say he will be useless against a high energy mobile midfield like theirs.  Whenever he loses the ball his detractors pounce on it as evidence that he isn't good enough and then make excuses for all of his positive contribution.

The biggest problem we have in midfield at the moment is that we could actually do with some decent midfielders to play alongside Rooney because Schneiderlin and Herrera have not been up to it so far.

12126~~~
The problem is that the off days have become off months and off half seasons over the last years. He was genunely terrible in the first half of the season, the most impotent <i>main</i> striker that United have ever had. He's finished the season on 8 league goals despite playing many many games as a centre forward. Defoe scored about twice as many as Rooney. Mitrovich scored more for a relegation side. He has declined. It's a delusion that he can be excellent in midfield. He shit himself when he doesn't have acres of space to operate in.

12127~~~
I disagree that loads of midfielders could have put in that showing because his passing was top class, can he do that consistently I don't know but he has it in him to do it which is more than you can say for a lot of players. I agree that he shouldn't be untouchable and I think if Mounrinho comes in that will not be the case. I also don't disagree that he has a lot to prove still but what is can't understand is why people aren't willing to give him the time to try and find top form and reinvent himself in this new role. If he succeeds then we have sorted a whole in this team for the next few years. We still need to make further signings in the middle to provide greater energy and drive with the ball but i thought that was assumed a given. Under Mourinho Rooney will likely play number 10 anyway I assume so you won't have to worry too much but he deserves the praise he's getting from recent showings.

12128~~~
I don't mind giving him time but not as an automatic starter. 

If we put all our eggs in the "build the CM around Rooney" basket then there's a good chance it will splatter in our faces just like it did this season with "build the attack around Rooney" basket. He was supposedly going to become this amazing striker this season and LVG foolishly pinned all his hopes on that, and Memphis playing as he did in the Dutch league. Neither happened, and we were lucky we had an 18 year old saving us to an extent.

Same with midfield, for me. Don't pin your hopes on him, and don't build it around him. Keep him in your pool of 4-5 CM's for next season if you want, as someone who is capable of great things on his day, rather than treating like the new savior of the midfield where everything is attuned to making sure he plays. Two different approaches we can take. Both would include Rooney. But one would most likely cost us.

I'm not sure he deserves praise for "recent showings" but definitely for yesterday. He was really good yesterday and credit to him. But one good cross field pass per game isn't really impressive which is what was happening for most of the games prior. I mean, he was the best of rubbish set of CM's against West Ham, who annihilated our defence and midfield, so I'm not sure I can give him that much credit for that one.

12129~~~
He barely stood out in a game that was played at pre-season/Soccer-aid pace. 
His predictable cross-field ball is as boring now as Steven Gerrard's were when we used to laugh at him. 
I fully expect Rooney to be exposed in the Euros.

12130~~~
He's been exposed this season, but it's been wilfully ignored. The Euros will be more of the same.

12131~~~
It's remarkable how many midfielders seem incapable of doing it though.

12132~~~
Best match by a united midfielder in eons. Honestly, don't see too many midfielders on the market that can pass the ball like that. I'm sick and tired of this crab like play from midfielders that we see nowadays. They just make it hard to break teams down by doing nothing with the ball that can launch an attack.

12133~~~
Excellent yesterday. Good variety in his passing. The pass to young, was not something he's done enough in the past. He ghosted in well for the goal and he made some good tackles - showing he's still got a decent engine. If he remembers to vary his game and keeps up the work rate then that's fine. This is the first time (regardless of opponent), he's shown himself a good option in midfield. The first time. Nice ball to Valencia for Rashfords goal too.

12134~~~
He had a good game last night, but it was a played at the pace of pre-season.

I'm tired of him constantly looking to pass the ball out wide, that's pretty much all he does now, even when its not necessary and there are options ahead of him.

12135~~~
Incapable, or more economic with it? Blind offers much more going forward with his direct, incisive, cutting passes than Rooney's showboat, floaty passes that hang in the air long enough for any defence to get organised. At least Scholesy used to whizz them across field with pace. 
Once in a while is fine Wayne but every. single. time.

12136~~~
He played well last night and he does seem to accept that next season a midfield role is more likely. But will he just be holding back other options.

12137~~~
He's not actually accepting it, he's claiming it like he has a right to just dictate where he plays. Will Troy Deeney come back next season and say "I'm a defender now."? Will De Gea suddenly decide he's no longer a keeper? I really think it's absurd that he's getting to do this, "I've been shit here, but I don't want to sit on the bench so I'll play here instead." How many other players get to do that? It's no wonder he can barely be arsed to keep himself fit.

12138~~~
Rooney was very good last night indeed and some of his passes were of the highest quality. But the problem is that this game was a bit like a pre-season friendly, the opposition was poor. 

Depay had a brilliant game vs Midgetland, he absolutely destroyed their defence. But that was Midgetland and in the next games he reverted to his usual underwhelming level this season. 

It will be the same with Rooney. He has an eye for a pass and sometimes impresses with his passing. But he needs more space and more time to do it than the truly excellent midfielders. When there is not enough space and time (as it is the case in most games vs quality teams), he loses his ability and looks downright average, e.g. vs W. Ham. 

Even though Palace aren't exactly a very good team, he won't look half as good vs them. Here is a prediction. It's up to Rooney to prove it wrong.

12139~~~
He played much better last night - no doubt about that.

But can we please remember the opposition? The tone/intensity of the match? The fact there was feck all pressure on any of our players? That it was the equivalent of a training exercise?

I'd have no problem if he actually did that in big/important matches - but he never does and never will. Same with Carrick quite frankly - looked excellent as well against a poor side but again one of the major weak points in our first XI when we come up against a decent side.

12140~~~
Even considering opposition, it was much better than a certain german misfit, who hardly had any good games, maybe apart from the Swansea one against a side than was losing every game back then as well.

12141~~~
Scholes<span style="color: #ffffff">0.</span><span style="color: #000000">2.0</span>

12142~~~
For all the bad season he has, he still managed more league assists than anyone else in MU. And that's given that he has not played as many minutes as for example Mata and also played as a CF for much of those, not in attacking midfield. He also leads the way with chances created per game. While these numbers do not impress, i'd say it rather shows our overall lack of attacking play. The fact than no one did better kind of a testament to that.
Still this creativity shows he can do different jobs in attack and can be useful in deeper role.

12143~~~
The biggest problem with having him as a midfielder comes when he has his inevitable pub footballer phase, that will be disastrous in midfield, far more damaging than as a striker, and there is no way his ego will allow him to be benched until it passes.

12144~~~
Well how very sad is that, he maybe wouldn't be though if Schneiderlin hadn't had the confidence knocked out of him, and Herrera was given a proper chance.

12145~~~
it'd be strange if rooney was not up for this final, since this is the only cup missing in his CV. or I believe it is.

12146~~~
I like both Schneiderlin and Herrera. They're decent players. However I don't agree with making excuses for them. They need to step up and show what they can do. Schneiderlin has been a bit passive this season and Herrera's been really fcking erratic on the ball. They need to earn a regular place by playing well enough. Same goes for Rooney btw

12147~~~
Score 4 goals on Saturday to equal Sir Bob, and then a glorious departure into the sunset to earn huge money in China...

12148~~~
I think getting him more involved with the ball via midfield could see him growing in consistency in his general play to be honest.

Besides, Rooney always puts in decent performances when people start questioning what he offers, or he needs to prove his place in the team. He generally goes shit when the bashing is focused on someone else.

12149~~~
He had a good 2nd half in the last game. But I'm not sure that he is good enough to be a starter as midfielder next season. 

Do you think a midfield of Rooney-Schneiderlin could work?

12150~~~
15 goals and 6 assists in 40 games is not bad at all, considering almost half of his games were in midfield.

12151~~~
It's pretty hard for them when they don't get a proper run of games, LvG clearly doesn't rate them much given his habit of picking Fellaini and Carrick over them, and now Rooney has decided he isn't a striker they have to compete against him too, I just feel like they haven't been given a fair crack of the whip.

If LvG stays I wouldn't blame either of them for pushing for a move away, and if Mourinho comes in then I'm still not sure where it will leave these two, as by all accounts he'll buy a midfielder, and Rooney of course has to play.

12152~~~
How many of those were against good opposition though? Seem to remember him getting a fair few in the CL qualifiers?

But no on paper it's not bad but it's far from good in the context of us going in to the season with him as our main striker let alone his position as the best paid player in the team and one of the best in the world. If Rooney was just an important player then I'm sure he wouldn't get to much stick but as supposedly our best player it's average at best and really he only played a few games as a deeper midfielder.

12153~~~
'His future is in midfield' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12154~~~
Fixed that for you.

12155~~~
Can't deal with a full season (or 3, contract til 2019!) of him tugging around 50yards from goal.
Occasional games if we have to , but not as a regular please.

12156~~~
What? He hasn't been special but hasn't been terrible either. Just alright so far. Don't see what's so laughable.

12157~~~
Decent first half, wish hed cut out the odd miss pass but he looks the most likely to open up the palace defence. That defensive challenge was brilliant tho and saved a goal, he showed more pace than people made it out he has.

12158~~~
5 mins in was it Keown and the commentator actually said he is morphing into Scholes? I cant take it anymore <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

12159~~~
He's been better in 2016, but he's been terrible the 1st half. 

So many loose passes. Like he had too many drinks the night before. How do we have a midfield of Rooney-Carrick-Fellaini after spending that much money? Insane when you think about it.

12160~~~
Not a bad first half. Some nice through balls early on. He seems to be looking for those kind of passes a lot more than he normally would

12161~~~
Him and Carrick are diabolical.

12162~~~
I thought he was ok in that half in terms of trying to find the right pass amidst a crowded Palace half, but he's sluggish when running and careless at times.

12163~~~
I think he really wants to play in DM or is it CB? 

One charity match against B'Mouth and some here are calling him the future, Mr. United. Needs to go, please!

12164~~~
Thought he was one of our better players easily

12165~~~
How has Rooney been diabolical?

12166~~~
They see one miss placed pass and then ignore everything else it seems

12167~~~
Did Rooney kill one of your family? i see you in every thread and if Rooney isnt bashed in every single one of your posts its beyond a joke. Easily our best CM that half

12168~~~
Definitely, others on here seem to looking at Rooney's game through the usual biased goggles.

12169~~~
deep lying playmaker

12170~~~
He's just not good enough at this level in midfield. 
Herrera and Schneiderlein are both easily better options for the 2nd half imo.

12171~~~
He's misplaced possibly every single short pass he played, defensively saved our asses on that Zaha breakaway though.

12172~~~
Which Herrera are you talking taking about? Crock of shite.

12173~~~
Herrera has been one of our worst performers this season and Schneiderlin has shown nothing creative or going forward. You really want to play with Carrick-Schneiderlin-Fellaini?

12174~~~
84.6% pass success in that half. Not bad at all.

12175~~~
Ignoring everything else like slowing us down to a walking pace whenever he gets the ball, sauntering around like an old man, and doing nothing but spraying hollywood passes?

He's shite at this midfield lark, it was a joke when Gerrard decided he was a deep-lying playmaker, its a joke now Rooney's decided it.

12176~~~
Just talking shite for the sake of it now? He's been one of our best players.

12177~~~
God some of you take opinions very personally. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12178~~~
I couldn't disagree with you more

It was a very good performance from Rooney for that half

12179~~~
And what are we to do with this?

I expect more from him given the freedom he has in the midfield and he has been very poor. You don't need to dwell on my comments on him cos there is always someone that will say that he is still a top player to balance it out!

12180~~~
The beauty of football hey?

12181~~~
This.

Most people here seem to try square their pre-arranged narrative with the game though. Most times this season Rooney was terrible but today if you actually watch the game he's been good so far

12182~~~
Well I prefer midfielders who don't lose the ball. I'm a bit old school I guess.

12183~~~
Probably best if you watch the game.
I really want Rooney gone in the Summer but today he's been good so far

12184~~~
Or you could feck off you sarcastic twat?

12185~~~
One camp says he's the best player today 

The other camp says he's shit

Someone definitely drunk, or blind, or having an agenda,  i guess probably blind

12186~~~
Relax. We're on the same side here. Enjoy the final if you can

12187~~~
Please leave

12188~~~
He's not shit, but I am not sure he's close to being our best player today.

12189~~~
He's been absolutely shocking. Worst player on the pitch.

12190~~~
He popped in a lovely pass to Rojo in the first half but his passing has been an absolute liability, it's the same every game, he needs the run of the pitch of be effective, any presser and he goes to pot, he has no awareness of the ball, how many times does he blindly turn or pass into an opposition player?

12191~~~
Rooney needs to go..  This is looking grim..

12192~~~
He plays a few lovely passes every game but then spends most of it being sloppy and giving the ball away needlessly. His technique isn't consistent enough to play in midfield.

12193~~~
Magnificent.

12194~~~
Well fecking played.

12195~~~
He looked like young Rooney with his contribution to our goal.

12196~~~
Captains response. Brilliant assist

12197~~~
Just like Scholes. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

If ever a moment shows you what Rooneys strengths are and what he should be doing.

12198~~~
That run was top class

12199~~~
My hero, my mate.

12200~~~
Class.

12201~~~
Brilliant play.

12202~~~
Literally cannot fault Rooney there. Humble pie on my face. Brilliant.

12203~~~
He's played like a leader today and been our best player by far. People calling him diabolical after the first half goes to show how biased some people are against him. 

It's sad to see. Rooney has had a very decent 2016 so far. Still an important player for us in the right role.

12204~~~
Pace, power, technique. That's everything Rooney is about.

12205~~~
He did great for the goal and deserves lot of praise for that but some of the comments are laughable.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That's literally he is nothing about these days.

12206~~~
As Meatloaf said, one run every 18 months ain't bad.

12207~~~
His run says otherwise.

12208~~~
A bit more wasteful in the second half but what an amazing run. Brilliant play

12209~~~
He was like a slow motion Maradona for our goal! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

12210~~~
Some of you are pathetic. Just compliment and him and enjoy the moment. 

"great run but xyzxyzxyz". You're just embarrassing yourself. What a run from Rooney. To think someone on here said he'd been Falcao'd

12211~~~
Did well for the goal, but other than that he's not been good. He could well have been sent off for the tackle he got booked for.

12212~~~
Hasnt been great today, but played a major role in the equaliser. The drive from midfield is what we needed, and what we should have seen earlier in the game.

12213~~~
Okay, one moment in a season defines a player who is nothing like that for about 6 or 7 years.

12214~~~
You're mental. It's a forum - anonymous people giving their opinion - there's nothing embarrassing about anything said in here you lunatic. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12215~~~
That's patently untrue.

12216~~~
Looks like he's getting grey hair!!! Threadmark please.

12217~~~
FA cup final. Captain helps us get the equalizer in a beautiful goal but posters on here are reminding us how bad he is right after that. I think it's embarrassing.

12218~~~
Ran his balls off

12219~~~
Well done Rooney

12220~~~
Captain's performance.

12221~~~
Saved us with that run. Incredible decisiveness.

12222~~~
Sloppy passes aside, he showed character & leadership when we needed it. Well played Wazza!

12223~~~
Well done, Wayne, played and acted like a captain.

12224~~~
Delighted for him. Deserved to lift the trophy.

12225~~~
Brilliant performance. He wanted that more than anyone today.

12226~~~
Despite my opinions, well done to him. Ridiculous how long it took us to lift the FA Cup

12227~~~
MotM (for United).

12228~~~
MotM, easily.

12229~~~
No one on the pitch was flawless for 120 minutes today so qualifying his performance with a "but" is harsh.

A true captains performance today. Heart and quality, thank you Wayne.

12230~~~
Amazing performance. An absolute leader today. The amount of chasing he did was brilliant. 

That run to create Mata's goal too - like Rooney of old. Rolling back the years. 

Chuffed for him.

12231~~~
He actually got better as the game went on, I thought he was really poor until about 70 minutes. To be fair though, you can never fault his work rate, he never gives less than 100%.

12232~~~
Ten years ago if you told Wayne he'd live to see his hair go grey he'd have hugged you

12233~~~
I'm sure it's an unpopular opinion but I failed to see how he had an amazing performance. We didn't play great today but not badly either. He was OK. As were many others. Don't think he should be first choice in our midfield next season if we want to win things.

12234~~~
Our new Scholes for the coming years.

12235~~~
Yes, they did quite some job to keep him at bay. Could be that they've given him some sort of downers to slow him down a bit. 

Who knows how many things they've had to cover up for him. Can't wait to read his book.

12236~~~
I think he might actually reinvent himself like Scholes and Giggs. What a player.

12237~~~
agreed, credit where its due

12238~~~
I was looking at him today and trying to compare him with Scholes. Can't believe how big the difference is. Rooney makes a pass and then he's passive and not really sure on what to do next. Scholes made a pass and before that had reached the player he had moved in for a new position. I don't think the future is in midfield for Rooney. He's supposed to be higher up the pitch, no doubt.

12239~~~
Don't know why people love to hate Wazza. I couldn't be happier for him to get this award. And playing his balls off to get it.

12240~~~
He's nothing like Scholes. 

You'd think just being able to float a ball over to the RW makes you Paul fecking Scholes. Charlie Adam can also do that.

12241~~~
A disaster in midfield, but still a matchwinner as an attacker

12242~~~
Thought he was shite for 129 minutes and lucky not to be sent off.

But credit to the man, when he was needed he stepped up. Mans a winner, we don't have enough of them in this squad.

12243~~~
I know i know. Take it with a pinch of salt!

12244~~~
Brilliant today. So please he has now won that one trophy that eluded him.

12245~~~
Weren't great but he dug in and put in a real captain's performance.

12246~~~
Very sloppy at times in possession which will be punished against better sides with attacking purpose, but his run was what got us back into it and picked the team up, so MOTM for his Captain's role more so than his midfield role.

12247~~~
To gain some perspective:

12248~~~
Clearly MOTM today. Im warming to him in this role, gets better as the games go by compared to over the past couple of seasons when he was sporadically played there. Delighted for him.

12249~~~
I thought he was pretty poor overall, but he showed great character to drag us back into the game.

His powers have waned, but he was up for it today. Was good to see.

12250~~~
He was really good today. It was his desire that got us straight back into the match. Brilliant run.

12251~~~
He has been shit as a forward, but probably been our best CM overall this season. 

If we are going to play him there next season then we need players that can complement him, and compensate for his weaknesses.

Captain's performance from him today, drove us forward when we needed a lift. Well done, probably due to his mutant powers though.

12252~~~
I hope he goes on to lift the Euros this summer by playing his best football ever and then returning to Utd with that form, breaks Sir Bobby's record and signs a contract for lower wages

12253~~~
Carrick just said Wayne offered to share lifting the trophy.

Classy from Wayne

12254~~~
Thought he was ok today and in true fan/Rooney fashion the odd thing he does well papers over the cracks.

Thats said, i whole heartedly agree with this, very classy from him and a thoroughly decent, professional thing to do.

12255~~~
Pretty hit and miss today I thought but the things he did well were very good. That run was probably one of the best things he's done in a couple years. Glad he stepped up when we needed it.

12256~~~
Passing wasn't great, some good passes and some bad ones but the run was great and saved the day. Showed good energy levels as well. Well done, Wayne.

12257~~~
I was proud of his performance today. He's trying to adjust to this position and we know his passing has a certain failure rate. But that never stopped him from attempting the range of short and long passes. He worked hard up and down the pitch and showed glimpses of his ability to drive us forward with the ball again. You can see how much he wanted to ensure that winners medal was his this time.

12258~~~
I don't understand how anyone can say we lack mobility with Rooney in midfield.

12259~~~
88% pass completion today. He was excellent.

12260~~~
He was brilliant today. He wanted that trophy more than anyone on that pitch. Worked his arse off.

12261~~~
I agree with all this.

There was a desire to his game today and the performance was good.

12262~~~
Captain fantastic today.Well done

12263~~~
Beastly performance. He really wanted it today didn't he?

12264~~~
fecking beast today. Dragged us back in the match with that brilliant run.

12265~~~
Wasn't the neatest of performances but personally one of my favourite from Rooney for a very long time.

Showed great drive for the equaliser and you could see he was hungry to get his hands on the trophy.

Still maintain that he is nowhere near good enough to be in the midfield of a top side. I'd be very surprised to see him line up in midfield under Mourinho, personally I see him being given a go in the number 10 position.

Thankfully we will have a manager who will not be so forgiving or accommodating for him should he put in sunday league level performances again next season. 

I don't see him as a starter but could do a job as a squad player.

12266~~~
There's no doubting his will to win and today he looked like a leader that stood up when it mattered...but it was hardly a performance of high quality and IMO we'd be a better team if we replaced him with a 'proper' midfielder.

12267~~~
Brilliant; so happy for Wayne and the lads. What a run, for the first goal

12268~~~
That assist for the goal was truly brilliant.

12269~~~
Yes, watching it now, on MotD want to go with this, tbh.

Not his biggest fan but that was a big try, plenty of bottle, well played, fantastic.

12270~~~
Yeah, I've given him a lot of stick, but he looked like a young Rooney during that moment. Fabulous play.

12271~~~
Good performance today and it was nice to see him make his experience and desire count when we went a goal down.

If we only saw more of those surging runs I would be infinitely more optimistic about his future role in the team.

12272~~~
That run for the goal........<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Coupled with a proper captains performance. Well done lad.

12273~~~
Brilliant performance, and most of all he showed heart and desire. Alot of people need to be ashamed with the agenda on Rooney its ridiculous. Hes still clearly one of our best players and will be key in the next few seasons. Looks like he will really make CM his own next season and i personally cannot wait.

12274~~~
Think he should survive under Mourinho ?

12275~~~
First name on the team sheet...

12276~~~
As a back up at best.

A bit sloppy performance today but brilliant run for the goal and he actually played with a lot of determination and passion.

But people need to remember we were playing Palace, a team verging on relegation, who sat back and were gave us plenty of time. Just 2 weeks ago we were schooled by Mark Noble for christs sake. Carrick and Fellaini were useless on the ball whereas Rooney actually tried things although a lot of his choices weren't great and sloppy at times. Hopefully we'll see a proper playmaker brought in like Pjanic or Dahoud. Rooney still has a part to play versus the lesser teams, similar to Del Piero's final years but lets not pretend that was Robbo,Keane or Scholes out there.

12277~~~
His run for the goal was awesome. Great drive and stepped up at the most crucial time, when it mattered. His defensive work has never been in doubt tbh, and he does get back really well to help out the team.

I still think hes a 45 minute guy at most for getting the best out of him. He should be an impact player for us next season or a 1 game in a week guy. He gives away the ball too easily at times, and I dont think hes great when pressured. But against teams who will sit deep, I think he will be useful / valuable. 

However, im happy for him. Got the missing medal / trophy from his collection.

12278~~~
You really are overstating his performances of late. It's quite crazy. It makes rational discussion of the player very difficult, equally as people who give him nothing but stick without recognizing when he does well.

There is NO agenda against him. He's a United player and this is a United forum, we want to see him do well. 

He HAS been poor this season on the whole, that much is undeniable. A purple patch in January and some half decent performances against poor sides will not change the fact he failed to contribute a single point in the first half of the season.

I mean: 

Really? First on the team sheet over Martial, De Gea, Smalling and Luke Shaw? Come on man. A key player for the next few seasons he quite clearly will not be, all the evidence suggests otherwise no matte how much you refuse to see it. 

He hasn't shown enough to prove he has what it takes to be a top class midfielder, he was dominated by Cleverly and Gibson in the second half of the FA cup semi-final a few weeks ago.

However, he displayed great heart and drive in the final. It was refreshing to see in a side which has lacked it all season.

What I'm trying to say is making comments like 'clearly one of our best players' is just silly and really doesn't help conversation at all. Then ignoring all criticism accusing posters of having agendas doesn't help either.

12279~~~
You have a go at my criticism and you come up with stuff like this? He was one of the better players but if you call that Brilliant? Key for the next few seasons? Make the CM his own? You say people have agendas against him but it seems you have an agenda against United!

12280~~~
I thought he was poor. He had flashes of good play but overall he was extremely sloppy. How can someone of such ability get so many 5 yard passes wrong? He drove the team forward for the equalizer but overall I was not impressed.

12281~~~
Was excellent. Someone said he was the worst player on the pitch a few pages ago. What game were some people watching?

12282~~~
Thought he was fairly good in his new role today, anyone who thinks we would've got better out of our other options in the same roles are daft. I've lost my love for Rooney and he's not the midfielder who'll lead us to glory but credit where its due, he's had a good season.

12283~~~
That stat is meaningless when you consider all the passes that put our defenders in trouble were considered completed, because our player touched the ball.

Apart from that great run for our first goal, he created more danger for our own goal than on the other end.

12284~~~
That's his best performance as captain as a United player.
Not to say he was immaculate with everything he did. But yeah that's what you're meant to do when you're United captain.

12285~~~
Its easy to hate Wayne Rooney. But the man was fecking great at times in the cup final. Especially when he put his head down when we were 1-0 down and drove through their side and put a cross in. He was our best player.

12286~~~
I thought he was very poor in the first half, but really stepped up in the second... proper, actual, captain stuff.

12287~~~
I didn't think he played all that well overall. Still voted him man of the match because, without that run leading up to the equaliser, I think we'd be drowning our sorrows tonight!

12288~~~
If Rooney is going to be a starter next season. Where do you think he should play?
<ol>
<li>CM in a midfield of 2 (4231)</li>
<li>CM in a midfield of 3 (433)</li>
<li>CAM/#10 in a 4231 formation</li>
<li>Striker </li>
</ol>

12289~~~
Like others have said, he looked like a real captain today. His run for the goal was amazing, rolling back the years kind of thing. In the last few games he's started to convince me as a midfielder - he's shown some excellent vision and has played the kind of passes that we've missed so much for years. Chips over the top and passes out to the running winger/full back that we just haven't had for ages. They don't always come off, but it's still a big improvement. He played one pass out to Rojo on the left that left their defence for dead, and if it had found a better player we'd have had a great chance. Good performance from him for sure.

12290~~~
Love Rooney. As I have said many times, when all the fickle tossbags on here were berating him, he's got the heart and soul to be a great leader on the pitch. Always gives 100%. It's the kind of winning mentality the team needs.

12291~~~
I hope you two have changed your opinions.

12292~~~
No, I don't see us challenging for a PL or CL with Rooney as a regular.

12293~~~
What I see in Rooney is a player who's capable of moments of brilliance but over a 90 minute match just doesn't have the engine to be a significant contributor for a top club.

I'd love to see what a genuine summer conditioning program could do for him.  And maybe removing the arm band could remove some of the mental pressure he puts on himself.  Get him fit and play him only 2 or 3 times a month and he might be a serious factor for us next season.

But the best option would be selling him to a club in China, though I don't see that happening.

12294~~~
Great timing. 

One great performance can buy him 6 mths of excuses

12295~~~
That run was brilliant and a flash of the old Rooney. What i want to know is why is took him until the 80th minute and a goal conceded to do it. For the first 75 minutes he would have just passed that sideways at the first sign of a defender. So many times we (it wasn't just Rooney) were in positions to run at an unorganised defence but we dithered and waited for them to catch up and get their positions reset.

12296~~~
His energy level was top notch. He also made, at least, 2 crucial tackles in our box which seems like less appreciated here.

12297~~~
I meant him being Falcao..

12298~~~
I believe when that post was made I was referring to him as a striker, in which case I stand by it, but I admit he looks capable of extending his career as a squad CM.

12299~~~
Fair enough. Only point I was making was that he hasn't been "falcaod".

12300~~~
Happy for him - whatever said, he's been fantastic for this club and deserved to win this trophy. 

Still don't think he has much to offer and I wonder what Mourinho will do with him.

12301~~~
I dont care how much he gets paid. He has done enough for the club and the club waste way too much money on nonsense anyway. Might as well give it to someone who has actually contributed.

But he cant be a guaranteed starter. 
If he is fine with that, then I would like him to stay.

12302~~~
Awful in the first half and then pulled a captain's performance in the second and AET. 

I like Rooney and feel has given a lot to this club. He has been moved around and tried to give his best in any position he has been asked to play. However, I am unsure if he has a future for us. His days as a Striker/Support striker are over and I am not usually a big fan of his in the CM. Tough decision for Jose coming up. Can he make him his Lampard?

12303~~~
Rooney is the kind of player that excels when he is at the centre and at the hub of things. Very rare few can live up to this responsibility, much less relish it. Even fewer amongst modern players. Cherish him whilst we can. He struggles when he is isolated and his frustration shows through when he is not in a position to influence things when he is isolated. That's what happens to him under Sir Alex, during some of his indifferent seasons, and with Van Gaal until recent months. I'm surprised the managers/ coaches don't realise this sooner. Or maybe he was the easy compromise or sacrifice for other players.

First and foremost with Rooney is NOT that he is a striker or a no. 10 or he is a midfielder or that he needs to be top scorer. First and foremost of what makes him tick is that he has to be the main man, in the sense that he has to be involved constantly, which means he is the "centre". Much like his responsibility as a Captain. He flourish with captaincy rather than suffered like some will or some where the experience does not lift them. Unfortunately for him and his teams, club and country have mucked about too much with his position and role.

12304~~~
I still would prefer a proper midfielder in there, but credit where it's due, I thought he was our best player at Wembley.

12305~~~
I have been very critical of him this season, but that was a real captains performance from him. Really had a fire in his belly last night, and it was reminiscent of the old Rooney

12306~~~
Yup, no complaining from me, we've been poor overall but he dragged us at the moment he must have with that run, credit where is due.

12307~~~
I saw his face immediately after they scored and there was no way was he thinking it was over.... he had that cold steely determined look, it was like he was saying 'right, feck this...' Took the bull by the horns and made that run. Top notch from our captain. He's a winner......

12308~~~
A skippers performance. Single handedly got us back on level terms. Enjoy the Euro's Wayne, when you get back there will be work to do. That record should fall next season and we can work on getting near Shearer.

12309~~~
Delighted for him!  Dragged us back from the brink of defeat yesterday.

I think he could assist 3, score 4 and have 100% pass completion and some on here would still say 'thought he was average'.

Also, all the comments about us needing to replace him with a 'proper midfielder'. Like the ones we've spent about £100m on so far and not one of them is better than him in midfield?  I think we'd be better off worrying about what midfielders we should get to play with him before anything else given that he's the best we have.

12310~~~
I'll say it again, I've really liked him in that box to box midfield role since he returned.

12311~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Too true.

12312~~~
Someone said what will Mourinho do with Rooney and so I replied predicting that he will be the first name on the team sheet in midfield for Mounrinho because quite clearly managers see something that apparently you lot don't see. There's no way Mounriho is dropping Rooney unless he plays like he did up till Christmas. If he plays as he has in 2016 then of course he will start and deservedly so. 

You can say all you want about there not being an agenda but it's simply not true, the reason I can say this with certainty is if he was a new signing from Spain putting in the showings from the last 2 months the only thing I would read is how brilliant he is and just what we've been missing for the rest of the season in CM. But because it Rooney and people don't like him over his contract dealings, or the way he talks and acts they judge him ridiculously highly to areas that most players in the world would not achieve. 

I can quite happily have rational discussion as long as the criticsim is rational rather than people jumping on a bandwagon because it's become popular to bash Rooney for every small mistake. Take Rooneys performance yesterday, he certainly misplaced some easy and simple passes and to some I've seen them say that's a shocking performance... Well clearly they know nothing about football then, because afew misplaced passes doesn't change the fact that he was the only player willing to try something with the ball;pass forward, run with some purpose,get stuck in. That's what we have missed in midfield not the abilty to keep every pass perfect and get 100% pass accuracy, that's LVG philosophy brainwashing. Is Rooney a top class CM probably not, but he's certainly good enough for where we are currently. If we signed some players in midfield to complement him then we would have a very strong midfield indeed, but I'm fed up of coming on the thread and seeing every other post as, he's crap ship him to China, it's disrepecteful and stupid.

12313~~~
If that isn't a brilliant performance in a cup final then I don't know what is! Again if, that was a new signing and not Rooney the praise he received would have been monumental and I would bet you'd be one of the first people in line to say how brilliant said player is. Like it or not, Rooney will still play a key and fundamental role under Mounrinho of that I'm sure, because managers are clearly seeing what I'm seeing and not what your seeing. His performance yesterday showed everything we have lacked for the rest of the season in the heart of our team and the main thing being heart and desire. When he made that goal saving block, it was because he wanted it more than the opposition and this season I've seen too many of our player lack that heart. If you can't see that then continue to drive your anti Rooney agenda on this forum but I think you'd be much better suited channeling your energy into how we can build a compelementary midfield around him.

12314~~~
The pundits were calling him man of the match at half time. They know football. Very good performance and his work rate was phenomenal.

12315~~~
Exactly! "Passing was atrocious".. But... 88% completion?... What?

12316~~~
He was definitely knackered in extra time but still kept going

I think it was his best captains performance for the club so far

Jose is going to love him

12317~~~
He has looked our best player since his return

12318~~~
I don't think I've ever seen a player have as many 'where the hell did that come from' moments than Rooney. Fantastic run and cross for the goal. He needs to lead like that more often, through example rather than the pointless gesticulating and shouting. I think yesterday showed why he's still a valuable asset, the desire he showed not only for the goal but to track back and save Blind was terrific. You're not going to find players like that anymore, he's not even a midfielder and he showed more heart tracking back than Schneiderlin has all season. The problem with Rooney is in spite of this he's not really a midfielder, he doesn't have any idea how to manipulate space or how to control the tempo, all he has is crossfield balls. Still I think Mourinho can coax another few seasons out of him.

12319~~~
First time I see him play like a captain. We wouldn't have won without him on the pitch, so some of you are being far too harsh.

12320~~~
There is potentially a role for him, but he HAS to accept being managed differently, there are games he will need to be rested for, and when his form bottoms out he will be dropped, if he is putting in performances like yesterday and accepts those terms then he will be very useful to have around

12321~~~
Ironically, the move to midfield vindicates the people that criticized him and said he wasn't good enough up front. 

If it were for all his fans on here he'd still be playing as a striker for us.

12322~~~
Good performance but you're dreaming if we can expect that level of performance week in week out. He needs to be a Giggs type player.. rested for ages and brought into certain games. 

He will not be a regular starter under Jose.. I can't see him being consistent enough.

12323~~~
He did misplace quite a few easy passes, in the game.

Nonetheless, it was a terrific performance.

12324~~~
Agreed. Let's not pretend that Palace are some team. They've been <i>absolutely terrible</i> in the league since December and won only <b>11</b> league points in the second half of the season! That's worse than relegation form.Yet we were on the brink of losing to them...

Rooney had a great run for the first goal and did reasonably well (still had several sloppy passes that created opportunities for the opposition) but let's not exaggerate. I predicted long ago that we won't make top 4 with Rooney as our main man in attack and reiterated it even in the midst of his rich vein of form in January. I fear for next season if Rooney is our main man in midfield. We'll make the life of our rivals a lot easier.

12325~~~
He doesn't think, move or pass like a midfielder. He doesn't know what to do a lot of the time and then we see those pregnant pauses and hesitations that lead to him playing square or backward and the entire build up losing momentum, which is catastrophic if he's supposed to be the creative hub of the team.

The run was Gascoigne-esque, but he'd have to do that with the frequency of a Gascoigne for it to be a worthwhile attribute in him as a full-time midfielder.

His passing is inconsistent and conservative when it needs to be probing, expansive and accurate. His short-passing game is also a big worry and often leads to needless turnovers that put the whole team on the backfoot. I feel he can and will get away with this stuff against the smaller sides, but will be badly exposed against better opposition - if the same goes for an actual midfielder in Yaya, I can't see how it won't apply to Rooney who is not.

Very pleased for him for yesterday, but there are so many questions revolving around him and this Mourinho era. I think it's AM behind Ibra or bust.

12326~~~
You summed my feeling up. I thought he was excellent, for a striker who was obviously not a natural centre midfielder. That bit was obvious by the amount of times he screwed up an easy pass or did not received a pass in an optimal body position to take advantage of situations.

Him in midfield will not do if we're to get back to the top of the pile. We need someone better.

12327~~~
I don't think anyone can deny that he has heart and desire. That has never been in question whether you are a fan or not and yesterday he showed that and played like he wanted something out of that game but I will not go as far as saying that it was a brilliant performance by any stretch. I will always call it as I see it. Football does not start and end with United, and if I watched that as a neutral I will not call that a brilliant performance either. 

Maybe, we have different standards which I appreciate the diversity of opinions, it is a forum after all but I would never be bias towards a United player in terms of performance. If Gerrard put in a performance like Rooney did, I doubt many United fans will call it above average just because he is a Liverpool player. For me, I will never do that. I thought he was poor in the first half, and surprisingly got better as the game wore on. I say surprisingly because in the last couple of games, he has been decent in the first 45 and poor in the second. And as far as yesterday was concerned, I will give him credit for picking himself up and playing with some drive and heart but I will not call that a brilliant performance by pretending the first half never happened. 

One thing I have noticed about home fans in general is that a player can be playing a 2/10 game for 85mins and score a hat trick before the 90mins and he gets bumped up to a 9/10. I find that ridiculous. A good example was Lukaku against us. He was poor for most of the match but had like 2/3 good chances towards the end of the game. If he scored I would find it difficult to call that an amazing performance.

I will always judge a performance relatively and in the I have watched football , I have witnessed some real top performances by individuals and collectively. So when I someone says to me, "Rooney played a 9/10", I expect to see a 9/10 that compares with the 9/10 I have seen. So I find it weird when after the B'mouth game, a charity in every sense, a poster said that he put in a super performance and to me, it was just a good performance. The opposition was non existent, the game was flat, I can hardly remember much that stood out in the game yet I can remember Alex Song putting in a super performance against Man City last, single handedly destroying City.

You keep on pushing your agenda against my comments by saying that I have an agenda against Rooney because I don't he is as good as you think he is. You think he is a top player, I don't. You think he will be key for seasons to come, I don't. You think we should build around him, I don't. You have your opinions, I have mine, deal with the difference in opinions and stop using my comments to enhance your comments here.

12328~~~
Brilliant post this.

12329~~~
I just don't want him to become one dimensional. He has to learn to very his game. That was a great run for the goal and if he can do that - he should do that more often not just spray balls round. If he could tidy up his game - and he does make too many sloppy passes. I'd like to see Scholes also teach him to put backspin on the ball because I don't think Rooney does that well enough. He's shown enough quality in the season to say he's not past it. I just hope he learns to mix up his game more and pays more attention to simple passes.

12330~~~
I look at Herrera's 1st season as a better indication of his abilities than this. When given consistent playing time in the right system he is a very good passer of the baller, presses the opposition well, and will score a few goals as well. He is never going to be world class but he can be a very key clog in the right system. IMO he is a much better all around midfield than Wayne. 

Schneiderlein has suffered in a similar fashion to Ander in that he plays one week is on the bench the next despite having played well the week before. The best midfield performance I saw us have this season was against Arsenal with Ander and Morgan both keeping the ball fairly well in possession, maintaining their positions, and Ander getting forward on the counter. If we can get Schneiderlein in the team week in week out with a clear position I think he is one of the best defensive midfielders in the league and has shown that in his time at Southampton.

12331~~~
Yeah him and Valencia have made a big difference for the last few games.

12332~~~
It really isn't true.

12333~~~
sure its not...<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

12334~~~
Better than Martial or Rashford? No chance. There's a confusion between being the best player and being the most involved player.

I've never questioned his work rate or on pitch attitude. It's always good and that carried on yesterday. However comparing him to poor players doesn't really say much. He's been better than Herrera and Schneiderlin lately. It's true but so what? Most teams in the premiership probably have a better performing midfielder than those two.

Let's start judging players against what we need to be EPL and ECL champions again. Rather than "he was better than Fellaini, Lingard and Rojo therefore he's brilliant."

12335~~~
His passing was a bit off but his work rate made up for that. His part in the Mata goal was almost as important as scoring the goal. You could tell he was genuinely desperate to win yesterday.

12336~~~
It's undeniable that many posters on here have an agenda against Rooney too deep rooted to be able to accurately assess his performances anymore. 

He was man of the match yesterday without a doubt, and as has been said already if that performance came from any other player it would be receiving more praise.

I believe he still has a lot to offer this club, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing what Mourinho will do with him. He could sell him, build the team around him, or anything in between. He has certainly coveted him in the past, so I expect that using a system to get the best out of Rooney will be high on his agenda.

For what's it's worth I've been reading this forum for many years and believe me when I tell you that the Cafe as a collective love to write a player off. It happened with both Giggs and Scholes well before the end.

12337~~~
His was brilliant in FA Cup win anyone who fails to recognize that is just being silly.

12338~~~
He was class and there is a good chance he evolves into a superb midfielder. Give him a break

12339~~~
So, in a season where he missed 2 months through injury, and played the last few games in midfield, he still managed 15 goals. Which isn't too shabby.

He was generally poor until January, after which I would say he's played quite well. Scored and created some really nice goals.

I think he is now past his very best, but a good manager could still get something out of him. He can still pass it well, he can still finish, and he still has a good attitude: is willing to work hard for the team, and follow instructions, which is why Van Gaal liked him so much.

Coupled with his trophy winning experience, I see no reason why he can't contribute for a couple of seasons yet, and i'll bet Mourinho takes to him.

12340~~~
That was a captain performance on Saturday if I ever saw one. He wanted that Cup and wanted it badly. He was a leader among men.

12341~~~
You might be a bit biased... Bastian

12342~~~
Actually, I think it's hard to argue that Schweinsteiger should be an automatic option for the 2 CM spots. And Morgan needs to seriously step up to take his chance. We still need top quality in midfield. I hope Jose does not think Rooney in midfield is a great idea.

12343~~~
He does like Rooney though, he tried to sign him when he first arrived back at Chelsea, don't know where he would play him though. I think Mourinho will love Schweini, he has had a nothing season but he's a leader and a top player, I really think we will see the best of him under Jose.

12344~~~
Yeah he did. But wouldn't all agree that this season was a turning point for Rooney? I at least hope there won't be any undroppable nonsense and that he'll find another captain. De Gea would be a good shout. Best player. Always plays.

12345~~~
Based on his first season at United it would seem he is more suited to be an automatic option for the out spot.
But not to fret, given how misfit Bastian is, i doubt he'll stay injury free next year, probably miss huge chunks of the season as well.

12346~~~
I think it's unlikely Mourinho wouldn't bench Rooney if he was playing anywhere near as shit as he was for the majority of this season. That's just one of many examples of LVG being a lunatic.

12347~~~
Rooney much like VG were enough to get us a FA Cup, but lets not start playing square pegs in round holes, Mourinho needs to strengthen the back bone of the team. I look what we have got, there is a platform, but I hope next season plans does not involve wayne rooney. Was rooney good in the FA Cup? yes and no, he made a difference, but his overall play, his passing sums up why he is not good enough for united going forward next season. We defiantly need a RB, a couple of CB's, defiantly we need a few CM, upfront I feel the team has the quality, it maybe given one more signing, but I hope mourinho does not try playing rooney much next season. If his striker days are over, I feel jose should move him on along with the likes of fellaini, young, etc etc

12348~~~
Another reason to not get excited about Rooney in midfield is his possible other partners.

Rooney/Schweinsteiger - too old and too slow to be effective in the EPL
Rooney/Carrick - same problem
Rooney/Schneiderlein - might work if they both play very well. If one has a poor outing our midfield could get run over.
Rooney/Herrera - not good enough defensively

So the only way it works is if we play 3 midfielders and the most advanced midfielder has to come back and help often.

12349~~~
Blind is missing. Surely with loony tunes gone he is more welcome in midfield rather than at center-half position

12350~~~
It's called Squarepegoroundholism - playing players where they should not be considered because of age, past history, big name appeal. Also called Shoehornism. Commonly suffered by Manchester United!

12351~~~
The old Teflon potato looked pretty sharp when he came on and took his goal well.

12352~~~
Well done Wazza:

12353~~~
Some finish for his goal yesterday.

12354~~~
You would think a coach like Mourinho will understand not marginalizing players and hoping they meet a certain line. He'll understand how to get the best out of Rooney in my opinion, I'm looking forward to seeing how it plays out.

<a class="username" data-user="82503, @Wade3" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82503/">@Wade3</a> that YT link is dead.

12355~~~
Why he doesn't have number 10 anymore. Was it only for this game or did they gave it to Sterling.

12356~~~
He wasn't a starter. In friendlies, England number their starters 1-11.

Have to say, he did very well yesterday in his cameo too.

12357~~~
Oh thanks, didn't noticed it before and was genuinely suprised that they would gave Rashford number 9 too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12358~~~
Let's hope it was a mistake. A captain for England should not be wearing fecking #19. Let's hope this was just a thing that happened for the friendly games. Embarrassing to say the least. Such a great servant to club and country should not be degraded like that.

12359~~~
I think Rooney will have a great season under Mourinho. He may play him as an out and out striker or have him in midfield as he has been in recent matches.

12360~~~
Is this a joke?

12361~~~
Rooney will still be captain and he will wear the #10. For both club and country.

12362~~~
eh?

12363~~~
Hahaha what!

12364~~~
Man, that is one ugly football kit.

12365~~~
Anyone afraid he's becoming our Gerrard? Feel like regardless of what position he plays there's always much better options, both in the club or in the transfer window.

12366~~~
When were this "options" in FA Cip final i wonder.

12367~~~
To be fair - the fact that we consider struggling for the majority of the game against Crystal Palace in a final further is proof that we need to strengthen in that area. He's slow, lethargic, his first touch is pub standard at times and he doesn't seem to do very well when pressed. It's as if he's just played for the sake of being played because he's Wayne Rooney, which takes me back to my earlier point. Gerrard was in a similar untouchable status at Liverpool.

He played well in the final but he was given so much space to do so. In fast paced games where he is pressed he isn't as reliable in midfield.

12368~~~
I am.

He shouldn't be starting every game for us. The idea of him being our midfield playmaker is laughable, he can do a hollywood pass out to Valencia but that doesn't make him Pirlo.
You can expect him to have a few world class moments in a season still, but it's not enough to justify him being untouchable.

Benching a player who is on 300k a week sounds mental to me, ideally we would ship him out to China, but i doubt it will happen.

12369~~~
Absolutely. Only a small minority of teams will give him enough room to amble around the pitch spraying balls across to each wing and not put him under enough pressure for his awful first touch and poor short passing to be woefully shown up.

The mysterious case of "Roonesia" is upon us again whereby a couple of games where everything goes right for him and suddenly we've found a position he can play to a top class level. He can't. These last 4 seasons he's been a world class number 10, until he's played there consistently and disproven it beyond reasonable doubt. He's then a world class number 9, until he disproved likewise. He's also been a potentially fantastic number 8, until again he gets shown up as not having the required skill set against any decent opposition. Rinse repeat.

Is he awful in any if these positions? No. Will his desire and natural talent mean that he could play the occasional role in central defence and look like England's answer to Beckenbauer? Yes. Does that mean he can consistently be relied upon in any position for a side wanting to win trophies? Hell no.

In that respect you're spot on; he's our Gerrard. The difference is Gerrard was a liability for a couple of seasons. This time next year Rooney will have been here for his 5th consecutive year of (on the whole) utter mediocrity.

We need a strong manager willing to finally show him the door, as Fergie was about to rightfully do 3 years ago. I hope that's Jose.

12370~~~
No. Mourinho will know how to sort him out.

12371~~~
You mean bench him?

12372~~~
No, I don't.

12373~~~
What do you mean?

12374~~~
His best position is always the position he's not currently playing

12375~~~
I find it a bit strange the diagonal ball criticism. That was Scholes' go to ball for his last 2-3 seasons with us and we all loved it. Rooney does it and we beat him round the head with it.

12376~~~
I was just trying to say you need more than that to play in midfield. But yeah, it's been effective. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

12377~~~
Hope he won't be given Ivanovic treatment, the guy just could not be dropped no matter how awful he was.

12378~~~
Tbh Scholes used to switch the play all the time and not just do it for the sake of it. Rooney is predictable (only one receiver), Scholesy was not. And the diagonal pass was just one part of his amazing passing array. And the great thing about Scholes was that he dictated where the players should run by passing it in the space in front of them. Also it helps when the receiver is C.Ronaldo, RvN, Giggs and Rooney in their prime rather than a very limited midfielder-turned fullback. And Scholes was also way better at actually hitting the intended target.

12379~~~
In Scholes last couple of seasons it was Valencia he was pinging it out to. I'm not sure he was that much better at it than Rooney, just seems a bit harsh to me. Not saying Rooney is anywhere near Scholes level as a midfielder but he's showing signs that he can play there.

12380~~~
Mourinho has become a miracle worker on here now. In the past week I've seen posters claim he will rejuvenate even Rojo. Everyone is becoming world class under him, don't you worry.

12381~~~
Give up mate, people just won't have it that Rooney might be a functional midfielder

12382~~~
No one is saying that all the players will be world class but it's very reasonable to expect most of the players performance levels to go up because isn't that the main goal of management, to extract every ounce of quality out of each player in the team?

12383~~~
You'll soon see the LVG excuse will be bs, it was as much on him as on the players. Even around the end of Fergie's reign you could see clear signs of Rooney tailing off, he's 31 soon, has a hilbilly body structure which has been battered by professional football since he was 16. The sooner people accept that maybe, just maybe his time is over the faster we will grow in quality as a football team.

12384~~~
If he plays like he did in the opening 4-5 months of last season Mourinho will bench him and then sell him. Rightly so.

12385~~~
Ivanovic...

12386~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

12387~~~
I think he will keep Rooney for this season but I definitely see him benching him and both of them ultimately falling out unless Rooney accepts being more of a squad player and utilised against lesser opposition.

12388~~~
Just not at the highest level.

12389~~~
Just needs to vary it. Rooney had a pretty decent season considering. I hope Jose works on him to work on the kinks in his game.

12390~~~
I've always thought people were overly harsh of Rooney on here. Yeah he's not what he was but he's still a good player I think. Under Mourinho I wouldn't be surprised if he put him behind whoever ends up being our striker and id be fairly happy with that. I highly doubt he's going to go into a premier league season with Rooney as his main creative midfielder, unless Woody seriously messes up the transfer window.

12391~~~
Rooney came in and was far better than the show ponny, the man who is compared to Messi, who is compared to Maradona. Do you remember Ronaldo being calle a show ponny?

So, Rooney gave us glorious performances since day 1. We knew he would reach the sky. Everybody was expecting him to do amazing stuff each week. And if we want to be fair, he did for a long period of time.

When you lift such a weight as an U-21 player and you keep doing this for over a decade, EPL level, you are damned. Your body will let you down. Rooney 's body could never be the same after some serious injuries, so it let him down. But he kept doing what he was told to do. A true red soldier.

Ronaldo left the team, Rooney stayed and we reached the CHL final again. I have always said that Rooney, Evra and Carrick were the lungs, Rio and Vida the heart of the team. Ronaldo was a shiny necklace over them. But hte heart and lungs could do without the necklace.

Manchester United fans, especially the english ones, are very harsh on Rooney. He obviously is less than half of what he was, but I respect the lad. He is a legend.

12392~~~
Some will be upset, some will be delighted, and most will be indifferent, especially if  United get
a high class midfielder IMO.

United were virtually out of the title race after those four months or five months , lets hope Mourhino does not leave if that long. Cannot hope to compete for titles in a competitive league carrying a player for that long.

12393~~~
I just disagree here LVG was clearly making the players worse which is just not what good managers do. When players like schniderlin come to utd in the past they would then move up a level not down a level and thats my point. Under Mourinho i fully expect all players to move back up a level and if they dont then the players arnt good enough. Im sure that might be the case with some of them but others certainly have more to give.

12394~~~
No one is doubting what he gave the club, and he may yet improve under Mourinho. But the bolded part, whatever it means, is just wrong. He held the club to ransom twice, and would've left if he hadn't gotten astronomical wages. I don't want to move off topic, but making him out to be some hero because he stayed and 'settled" for Man United just irritates me. 

Also, whichever way you look at it, we wouldn't have won the champions league without Ronaldo. To say he was a luxury is just daft in my opinion.

12395~~~
The fact is without Rooney FA Cup would have been likely lost and it was Rooney who managed to do something special to get us into extra time. No one else was really bothered, so much for lethargic.

12396~~~
Wah, look at Twit Rooney and his band:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/05/30/00/34C317B800000578-3615453-image-m-86_1464565578767.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/05/30/00/34C317B800000578-3615453-image-m-86_1464565578767.jpg"/> 

He should be doing 5million laps every day to get himself fit for next season, not singing songs with Failure Neville.

12397~~~
What a fascinating human being Wayne Rooney is.

12398~~~
I understand your point of view. But first, let me clear the "red soldier" thing.

When I say "soldier" I 'm talking about what 's happening before, during and after the match day. He has played where he was asked to play. Everywhere. 9, 10, wings, midfield. And he 's done a good job. As for training days, I ve got an official MU magazine where his coaches state that when somebody asks "who 's gonna play CB and can do this" Rooney is the man who answers "me coach". Finally, his teammates always see him arriving first in Carrington every morning.

Nobody in pro football denies a better contract and modern day players will use managers, media and rivals to achieve a betrer salary. That 's all.

As for CHL, yes we did, we reached the final without Ronaldo but SAF decided to use Giggs and Carrick against Xavi and Iniesta. Ridiculous. And we could have reached the final again, if it wasn't for stupid or unfair red cards to Rafael (against Bayern Munich) and Nani (against Real Madrid). So, Ronaldo wasn 't the missing part.

In fact, I always felt it was somebody like Hargreaves that would give us something against Barcelona. Not to mention that nobody reached Brown 's top form.

12399~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Neville on acoustic.

Is that James Bay?

12400~~~
I've noticed that some think he's a miracle worker, the ability to turn back time on Rooney and Schweini would be a neat trick.

12401~~~
It's the unconditional Rooney haters. They will hate him no matter what. That's not be saying he was terrible throughout 2015, but since 2016 he's been very good yet some will just hate him regardless.

I also don't have a problem with anyone thinking he should be benched or not a part of Man United anymore, even though I don't agree with that, it is a valid opinion. It's the ones that will say "oh so one good performance in 1 year? not worth it" etc

Anyway, here's my prediction: He will be a part of the team and will be one of our best 3-4 players of the season next year. Mourinho will know exactly what to do.

12402~~~
I understand where he's coming from, though. Not that Ronaldo was a luxury, just that Rooney, Carrick and co were harshly criticized for long periods of time. As it happens, Rooney probably deserves his criticism by virtue of being our "star" player, but one who is in steep decline. Not sure how much of it is Rooney's fault -- might just be that he's shot as a top class player. We'll see if Mourinho can get more out of him though.

12403~~~
I just hope he doesn't have enough player power to hinder our progress as a team.

12404~~~
Well put.

I think for the rest of his time here, probably another 2-3 years, we'll have tonnes of "oh if he was number 10", "if he was up front", "if he was deep in mid" he'd be great type threads.

Hopefully we've got a good team so these inevitable threads don't take over.

12405~~~
Mourinho knows how to coach an attack properly in this league/climate. He won't marginalize the forward position and ensure that their job is to hold the ball up, play with their back to goal and operate strictly within the lane of the two CB's. (Then in a rather bizarre turn of events, sell off a bunch of players and play our smallest forward in this role who has no ability to play with his back to goal, go figure on that one).

This will allow the attacking players the freedom to use their creativity from deeper positions and allow them the licence to play passes through the lines or overload the wide areas to create passing options in the final third. The majority of the attack to return to a functioning dynamic unit. From the CF position, through to the attacking/central midfield out to the wide positions.

Most of the last two seasons in the 4-3-3 and the 4-2-3-1 the entire attack has played facing the ball carrier with it being brought forward at a slow speed or recycled in the middle third. It, logically would be one of the first area's I would be fixing in terms of structure, before looking at individual players and their worth.

12406~~~
Goal posts are always being moved when it comes to discussion about Rooney. 

His sunday league performances of the start of the season, unsurprisingly, blamed on LvG. 

He'd be great in midfield, if we were facing a shite everton side, a crystal palace side struggling to win for 6 months and playing nothing games against Bournemouth week in week out.

This has shades of 'Rooney will score 20+ goals this season'. Ya'll are crazy.

It's not irrational Rooney hate, it's delusional Rooney love. I start to think people are bigger Wayne Rooney fans than Manchester United fans. The guy will be our Gerrard next season. I have 0 doubt about it. He may have a few good performances which will make some in here feel vindicated. But he will return to shite. His hollywood passes to the right wing may please many in here, but it isn't enough to cut it in midfield.

Hopefully Jose isn't as blind to it as LVG and isn't afraid to drop him.

12407~~~
I agree with you, I want him sold. But Mourinho is gonna risk a media shitstorm in his first summer. Like it or not, that's what will happen. The media love Wayne Rooney.

Relying on Wayne Rooney was LVG's biggest mistake. If he had have dropped him back in that August-January period where he couldn't register a goal in 12 consecutive matches, we probably would have won the league. But LVG showed a lack of guts and was too busy trying to prove something to the press. I believe his first words when Rooney finally broke the duck were "I told you so"... how mad is that? If we gave every player enough time to get themselves back into form, the likes of Falcao and Forlan etc would have probably been a big success here. But we never allowed that. Anything less than 100%, especially when you're a striker not scoring goals should be enough to relegate you to the bench. But not the great Wayne Rooney...

Honestly, I was convinced then Rooney had a clause in his contract or something like that and if Mourinho pulls the same stunt this season, then something is up. At first I thought "Oh, the board are telling LVG to play him so he will eventually break the record", but the more I look into it, I think that shiny new 300k-a-week contract that Moyesy gave him had playing and captain privileges in there somewhere. Which is absolute madness.

12408~~~
No idea where to post this, but has the K/O time of his testimonial been announced yet?

12409~~~
It's on wednesday, surely in the evening then?


First Mou game at Old Trafford!

12410~~~
Surely the Euro is a make or break for Rooney, whether Mou wants to bank in his managerial fate on Rooney next season. So far, two managers have failed.

12411~~~
Our boy needs a good tournament. The heat is already on and the knives are being sharpened.

12412~~~
Bs articles as usual. Hogdson's not playing a diamond to suit Rooney. Its to fit Kane and Vardy in, but it clearly doesnt work. Not as a plan A anyway.

We should go back to 433. If that means leaving Kane or Vardy out, then so be it. We need to think about the balance of the team.

12413~~~
Should just play a 4-1-4-1 and bring Vardy off the bench or rotate between him and Kane during the tournament. A fresh Vardy checking in around 60 mins against a tired defense would be very effective. Nothing wrong with having some quality in reserve and keeping balance in the line up. Rooney should just rotate with Barkley or Wilshere in midfield.

12414~~~
Yes, or the whole world will start seeing what we've been seeing for the past 2 seasons

12415~~~
He played crap for months for us and there was barely a peep out of the UK media, England have one boring performance where Vardy and Kane clearly didn't know how to play their roles and suddenly the journos are on him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12416~~~
it does seem familiar doesn't it

12417~~~
I don't want to see any more possession football, thanks.

12418~~~
The English media have always defended him, and seemingly have ignored that his United displays for the large part simply haven't been good enough. A part of me thinks they dont  really care if his performances negatively affect United. 

But now with England, they cant ignore it. Rooney's decline has been evident to anyone with a functioning pair of eyes, yet the excuses are usually aplenty. 

It would be great if he breaks the record and moves on next season. Everyone is happy.

12419~~~
It's not as if England were going to win the tournement anyway, but it's still ridiculous. Let's move the most effective English at taking centre midfielder of last season out to he left to shoehorn in a finished cf in midfield because he doesn't have the self awareness to retire and the manager is too much of a little bitch to leave him out <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12420~~~
good.. can't wait for the fat cnut to get found out. Hopefully a bad euros would make it easier for Jose to get rid of him before next season begins.

12421~~~
The sooner he retires the sooner both United and England will improve. He's just not good enough anymore, and the odd flash of brilliance shouldn't hide that.

12422~~~
I felt it was some hopeless formation than Rooney . Rooney was far too much in front if they were trying 41212 and Kane and Vardy too wide. It seemed more like a 4-3-3 they were playing. Also, using Milner over Wilshere is pretty much a useless pick. I'd rather see Rooney and Wilshere at CM, Alli as CAM and Vardy and Kane as Forwards if they want to try 41212. Add to that Rose and Walker need to attack. you cant be having the 2 forwards going so wide to chase the balls.

12423~~~
You can't blame Rooney for a ridiculously incompetent manager playing a god aweful system. It was almost like Rooney was in false 9 with Kane and Vardy either side of him, just didn't work at all. Rooney needs to drop deeper with Alli furthe forward and Kane and Vardy then up top. Kane as th focal point with Vardy running channels

12424~~~
He has to play either deeper in midfield where he has space to knock 30 yard passes, or stick him upfront and ask him not to do anything defensive. 

Really though the answer is bench him. Alli is better as a 10, Vardy and Kane are better as a 2, and playing him wide is completely pointless. I would probably try him in midfield over Milner in last nights formation, but he would probably struggle there anyway. 

Either way the 4-1-2-1-2 looks a poor formation, it relys so heavily on fullbacks, but we don't seem to push them high up enough to fully make it effective.

12425~~~
Wouldn't blame him for their performance. I think the defenders were slow and pondering - like they were thinking about the nature of reality in between touches. Not much width provided by Kane or Vardy. Rooney had one good run and cross but when you've got those strikers playing - it seems silly to play that formation. Would be better off 4-3-3 and let teams worry about your strikers since they are Englands hope of winning. England ain't going to win every game 1-0. 

I thought Roy did the right thing and was bold selecting that many strikers but if they are going to be defending half the time, it almost seems redundant.

12426~~~
I don't think he was much more average than any other player last night so can't really criticise him too much.

What is daft is playing a striker in a midfield role when there's really no need to do so.

12427~~~
Rest of the country now seeing what Utd have had to watch for the last 2 or 3 years.

12428~~~
Fact is he shouldn't be starting for club or country.

I think everybody knows what to expect from Rooney nowadays, his last 3 years have been pretty much the same added with a steady decline. For some odd reason some fans and managers have this misplaced hope that he's still capable of showing the quality he was once capable of which is where you get "Rooney can get 20+ goals if played up front" or "Rooney can change his game to become a fantastic midfielder".

Like a poster above me said the sooner he leaves both United and England team both theses teams will improve a lot because he occupies such an integral position within theses teams but has such limited ability and performances nowadays.

12429~~~
Yeah deep in midfield is where he does the least damage and can actually be a positive influence because, like you said, he gets enough space and time.

12430~~~
The formation didn't help but come on people, can we just stop making excuses for him?

He's physically done. Completely.

He's never once 'fit' into a system, he's always been a square peg in a round hole, now with his physical decline he's an anchor dragging both United and England down.

Shouldn't be anywhere near the starting lineup for either, let alone having the system of both teams changed just to accommodate him.

12431~~~
England are having the same problem we've had for the last 4 seasons. Trying to accommodate a player that is past his best who is living of his past reputation.

12432~~~
England have the same issue as us. He's captain, has to play and still a decent player but the team can always do better in any position you place him.

12433~~~
What's all this crazy talk? It's clearly the system and his team mates causing him to be poor for England as well as us. He's just waiting to get played in his proper position, with the right system, the right players around him, the weather to be just right and the correct Chinese year so he can dominate the world as the new Scholes/old Rooney.

Always the victim, never his fault. I thought he'd last until November calling himself a midfielder, but I'm starting to think he will be calling himself a striker again after the Euros.

12434~~~
Any excuse to bash Rooney <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12435~~~
More like any excuse not to, lets review shall we?

He needs to play upfront
He gets no support
Its the other players not being good enough
Its the system
He needs to play at number 10
He needs to play in midfield
blah blah blah blah

12436~~~
But the game last night was completely the system as was seen by the fact that everyone was shite. If Rooney had played in the midfield position that's he's been taking up for Utd in recent months he would have been far better as would the whole team. He's not got the pace to play up top but can certainly stil cover ground in the middle. I understand critasism when it's just, but Rooney was completly played wrong Yesterday in a sort of false 9. (Here comes the response about excuses...<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>)

12437~~~
I hope everyone in the world from Ronaldo to Messi to Zlatan now get to see how shit it would be to have Rooney in your team (with their interviews saying what a wonderful player he is and stuff) and i hope Jose takes note that with Rooney in the starting line up United will keep going backwards.

12438~~~
Always the victim. Never his fault.

You're going on like he's been great in midfield for us, he hasn't. He had one good spell at the end of the cup final, before that he was average at best. He played against some of the worst teams in the league in midfield and still didn't shine. Nothing he's shown has indicated he would have been far better if played in a different position. He's been tried in several and not been particularly good in any of them. If he was really that good he'd have a position and wouldn't be getting moved around to try and find one that he can play in.

12439~~~
Personally think he's been easily our best midfielder this year in the last month and has put in displays that none of our other players have shown or are frankly capable of. Poor opponents means jack shit then they are the same teams that the rest of our players are playing and look crap against. I've defended Rooney to death on here, but I don't really know why I bother considering people don't actually judge him on performance.

I have generally defended Rooney. Let's be fair will we- You can single him out if he is the only player who is struggling, looking out of place. Like Rojo type of cases, but yesterday, all 3 strikers were struggling. Eng fielded a 41212 but it was more of 433 with Kane and Vardy on flanks. I agree Rooney as a striker is over, but he is more than useful if utilised properly. Rooney should be in central midfield with someone like Wilshere. Kane and Vardy upfront with Alli behind them. But Rose and Walker need to advance and make the pitch wide.
We can't be having arguments week in week out of how good/past it he is. Last 2 games- he becomes the rooney of old, deserves to stay; then the next week- he is past it.

12441~~~
If we have any player the same opportunity,  privileges,  game time that was afforded to Rooney,  they will eventually hit form and look. Same with Borini two years ago. The manager at Sunderland presisted with his poor displays until he hit form towards the end of the season and was putting on some terrific displays until they paid big money for him. Does that make him an awesome player? 

We also need to get our heads out of the clouds if we think he'll be an awesome midfielder. I'm struggling to think of any forward that was successfully converted to a midfielder. We keep on using Scholes, Lampard and Pirlo as examples but forget these guys for at least 15years as midfielders at the top level. Frankly,  I find it disrespectful that we can call him the next Scholes,  like the midfield position is some irrelevant position and a retirement home. 

He should not be anywhere the midfield at all. His competition should be with the forwards only and if he's good enough to oust them then he should start but until then...

12442~~~
I think England's problem is much worse, because the quality of players they have right now in positions Rooney can play are of higher quality than the ones United have had the past two seasons.

Alli, Kane and Vardy are suffering and playing out of positions with Hodgson trying to shoehorn him.

12443~~~
In this case yes, agreed the system didnt help, but for a player who still gets treated like he does, and being undroppable to play like crap unless everything is perfect for him is not acceptable.

12444~~~
I'm praying that with Mourinho in charge we finally have a manager strong enough to make him a squad player.

12445~~~
remember the big debate last world cup regarding should Rooney or Sterling be in the middle? 2 years later still shoehorning him in teams

12446~~~
What are we judging him on then? Frankly if he was delivering the performances and looked like he could do it consistently then he wouldn't need anyone to defend him.

12447~~~
Last year everyone was calling him our best striker. The media, the fans, the majority of people on this forum, etc. Some even went as far as to call him our best player. This was when we had the likes of Di Maria, De Gea, Mata, RVP, etc in our team. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Everyone was slating LVG for playing him in CM and playing RVP and Falcao ahead of him upfront.

Fast forward to the next season and Van Gaal places his entire faith in Rooney and sells all his other strikers including Chicharito to accommodate the main man. Rooney had an absolutely dire season. He failed to score a goal in 12 consecutive games at one point and LVG refused to drop him. Instead he was repeatedly standing up for him in the press conferences, saying garbage like "I told you so" when he finally broke the duck and scored a lucky tap in. This is the same manager who was hanging the likes of Mata and Schweinsteiger in the media by saying they've not been good enough, etc etc.

I was honestly embarrassed for the team this season. Thank god Rashford came onto the scene cause I don't think I could stomach watching Rooney up front again. His back was always turned to goal, 90% of the time he was chillin in midfield or making tackles in our own box so it left us absent up top. The guy can't dribble past players either. No pace whatsoever. Unless he manages to hit a long shot or score a tap in, we're fecked.

After realising he's had an absolute mare as a ST, all of a sudden he's a midfielder again. After saying last season he was a striker and should be played up front. Soon enough, he'll be saying he should be played in the number 10 position. And when that starts going wrong, "Oh I should be played up front again"

The best position for Rooney is on the bench. Preferably in Everton or even China. If we want to get back to the top, we need to be ruthless. Ferguson got rid of Beckham, Van Nistelrooy, Tevez, and more. So why are we still holding onto a player who's obviously past it? He's never gonna be a top CM. We're literally just playing him there because they're too afraid to drop him. Which leads me to believe there's a clause in his contract that states he must play every game when fit. And the club don't want anybody knowing about this.

12448~~~
Agree and there's really no more analysis needed.There's no need to talk about tactics, formations or his position. He's going to be physically shot wherever you play him.

12449~~~
This would be true of Rooney was an out and out striker but his whole career he has been a versatile player that has often had seasons in midfield in number 10 or even played as a wide player. It's been said for years that he has the skill set to prolong his game by moving deeper and I still think he can. Hes certainly not got Scholes quality but then who does. But what he does offer is still more than many players in the Prem and we will find it harder to buy someone like that than people make out. He's finished as a stiker, doesn't have the pace but for a CM he still seems to cover the ground pretty well. I just think there's too many people that are keen to place all the blame on Rooneys head before looking at the state of the overall team and the rest of the players in it. 

Do I expect the likes of Herrera, schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger to improve under Mourinho? ABSOLUTELY I do because i strongly believe the possession football wasn't suited to many of our players and held many back from performing at their top level. I've also seen plenty of people on this forum that agree with that view that the players we have are better than they have shown. So why then is Rooney not afforded the same chance. A chance to work under a top class manager , in a team that is hopefully functioning far better. I think if that was to be the case then Rooney would be able to maintain his form much more and would be a highly influential player as he was in the last couple months of the season. 

The big thing is we need to ensure that all the pressure isn't on him, he's no longer the top class player that he was for years and is now just a good player but he still has the ability to change a game with a moment of magic (see run in final, or backheal goal winner). He's still good enough to have an impact and he's still good enough to fight through a bad season and return a better player next year. Many don't want to see him afforded that chance and my pointing to an agenda is because a lot of posers are jumping on the bandwagon in a sheep mentality. We will wait and see next year but I think Mourinho will be keen to work with him and I still have hope that we can get some good form out of him consistently for next season.

12450~~~
He shouldn't be undroppable but nor should be chucked on the curb when he's still a very good player.

12451~~~
This is all well and good,  and you have laid some good points. I think the point that many are making is not just about the ability but the status the carries. This will be the eternal problem with him being around. There is every chance that if the likes of Herrera and Schneiderlin and Pereira were given the same vote of confidence in the midfield as Rooney was afforded,  they could have become better and hit some form towards the end of the season. Instead,  Rooney,  who probably wasn't expected to play in the midfield at the start from the season has jumped the queue ahead of actual midfielders. Same with England,  Rooney is a threat to every player regardless of his form but it is not vice versa. This in itself is a detriment to other players. Losing 2/3 players with potential for a player in decline is not worth it.

12452~~~
If he was to become a permanent midfielder where approximately would you rank him? Compared to other midfielders currently playing in Europe.

Would he be in the top 30?

12453~~~
The problem is that whether he plays as a #10 or a CM we'll always be a team that is less than it could be with him in it.

12454~~~
You think that making him a squad player would show how JM is strong!? More like dumb as feck,if you dont plan to play him,sell him. Not only Rooney would get worse in fitness but he has enough power to shit stir rest of squad.

12455~~~
Mourinho is a fan of Rooney.

Anyone who thinks he's going to get rid of him from not just the squad but the starting eleven is deluded.

12456~~~
I don't know that's a hard thing to say because we just arnt a functional team so until that happens its a tough call, although I think in the last few months he's shown more in CM than our other options have. I think in terms of in the league his passing is up there as pretty good and certainly better than many premiership alternatives. His drive and hunger sets him apart of afew for me, saw it in the cup final where he just has a willingness to push the team on. And I'm still of the opinion that while he might have a poor game he's still capable of a moment of magic like his run in the cup final or that backheal goal. I think we need to sign a top class midfield partner ie a Pogba etc and then Rooney will have a better complement in the team.

12457~~~
Yeh I can understand the frustration in his status but ultimately we can't hold that againt the guy personally because he has earned that through a decade of top performances. He shouldn't be undroppable but I do still think he's got another part to play in the next year or 2 and the thing is while there may be better midfielders available, we can only sign a certain number of players and we need to prioritise. Personally I think I'd prefer to sign another top class midfielder like a Pogba to complement Rooney in midfield and build from there. If he sucks then that's it for him and I'll finally hop on the Rooney out bandwagon but until he's had at least till January under Mourinho I'd like people to just be open to him getting one final chance.

12458~~~
Don't you think it's a bit risky to go into a season not knowing where Rooney stands as a midfielder? Is he top 30? Top 40? Even as a big fan of his you can't say.

12459~~~
perhaps but unfortuanately I think 90% of our players are in that same uncertain boat where they may simply be not good enough, or LVG might have been severely holding them back and stopping individuals and the team performing to their top level. Personally I believe we have more quality in this squad than people realise and I think with just a couple of top class additions this summer Mourinho will have a team that he really likes the look of already. Of Rooney has played as our best midfielder over the last couple of months compared to our other options(as I believe he has) then he's not the problem player, we need to be looking at a top class player alongside him. I think one of big problems in that Rooney has been under so much pressure because our squad just lacks those world class players. Add afew for next season and it's all looking brighter.

12460~~~
Rooney is lucky to still be at the club given his performances the last few years and plenty of fans would have no issues if he was sold and he knows it. There's no chance he starts shit stirring while he's the club captain, if he did the entire fan base would soon find out about it and the wouldn't turn on Mourinho.

12461~~~
Yea he wouldnt be the captain if he is on the bench,maybe fan base would be in JM corner but that means nothing,like we saw in Chelsea case this season.

12462~~~
You're still adamant he should be regarded as a midfielder simply because he is done at the top. Moreso,  you are keep saying he is the best midfielder. This I doubt very much,  how a failed striker can be regarded a better midfielder than 4/5 natural midfielders who have been out of form or just mismanaged. Either one of Herrera,  Schneiderlin,  Blind or Schweisnstiger on form would simply outperform Rooney on his best midfield display, hands down. To compare a privileged and pampered (for lack of better words) Rooney to a bunch of mismanaged, out of favoured midfielders is not a just comparison. If any of the other midfielders had been afforded the same opportunities and confidence by the manager,  I doubt you would be saying what you are saying. The funny thing is this guys can become better midfielders,  on the account of their age and potential whereas Rooney can hardly match that potential progress given his undeniable decline as a footballer.

So rather than persist with Rooney who IMO would be behind our other midfielders if all things considered were equal,  I'd rather we buy a Pogba,  as you say to complement our actual midfielders and make sure we have a bunch of midfielders reaching their maximum potential. This is for me is progress.

You really need to stop saying that a player has earned the right to start because of what he has done for the last decade. We live in the present albeit on the shoulders of history. It's like saying that LvG should be given a 5 year contract because of his illustrious history. When are going to start moving forward? What is the point a legacy when it doesn't hand over power to the incoming generation. Bigger and better legends like Raul and Xavi left the club at a time when they're still putting better performances than Rooney,  making way for younger potential. Leaving hasn't diminished their legendary one bit

This is not to say that Rooney can't add to the team but given his status will always be an issue we need to move ahead,  other than that I'm happy to have him as a squad player.

12463~~~
Mourinho's favorite system is 4231, now with Zlatan I guess Rooney will play as No.10. 

Do you think it would work? To be honest, I have my doubts on this (I hope to be wrong). IMO we should play 433... If both players start, which formation do you prefer?

12464~~~
I have to agree that delusion afflicts anyone who thinks Jose is going to get rid of Wayne.  What's left to debate is how Mourinho would use him and we're doing that here.

The way to shoehorn in Rooney that does the least damage is to use him as a one of the two defensive midfielders.  It's a horrible idea, of course, but it's the least horrible of the available options.  

He can't physically handle 9 or 10 and he's obviously not a wide player.  But he does like to ping long passes from deep positions.  But if we're going to use Rooney this way we better have a rock solid back line and a top shelf other defensive mid who can cover for Rooney's defensive weaknesses.

The other route for Mourinho, but this is risky, is to unleash Rooney at 10 until it becomes painfully obvious that he can't handle the job and must be relegated to the bench for cameo duty.  But I don't see that happening.

12465~~~
When a club has been unsuccessful it's the players who win feel the wrath from fans and I doubt Rooney holds very much sway in the United dressing room considering how much it's changed in the last 3 seasons. He can act like a moody bitch all he wants I serious doubt Ibra/Martial/Schneiderlin etc will give a feck.

12466~~~
He will more than likely play as a second striker like you say, structurally from the #10 position. (Not as a traditional number 10.) It will be a lot better because he will be able to drop and support the midfield and at the same time transition the attack. I think he'll score a lot of goals ghosting in with the power that Martial commands on the wing. All he will need to do is show at the edge of the area for a cut back and that is something he's done consistently over his entire career. Instead of Martial starting from almost a stand still in a possession system I think Mourinho's 4-2-3-1 will be perfect and allow the central players to drop and spread while leaving fast counter attacking players to break and be utilized.

Zlatan is a much better hold up player than Rooney, Martial and Rashford is on paper. I mean, coming into the EPL as a first time player at 34 it could go any which way to be truthful. But structurally on paper we should be able to get a lot of productivity out of a spread forward line of Martial left, Rooney free to play between the midfield and striker and a right winger coached to play quickly on the transition and counter attack.

Looking at it from a perspective of "how is it possible to utilize Rooney properly" I think that is probably the easiest and most productive way on paper. I highly doubt Mourinho will pursue a style that doesn't work so ferociously and marginalize some of the better player we have in the squad.

It would be nice if this thread could go more than 6 posts without the usual suspects desperately shoving their way into a civil discussion to expunge a pound and a half of brown about Rooney, we all know that won't be happening.

12467~~~
this is going to get found out very quickly, just like Gerrard did. If many United fans can see it, many opposition fans see it then coaches analyzing us will be well aware of it. Its not exactly subtle

12468~~~
Apparently Hodgson has said Rooney is a mandatory starter.

12469~~~
A lot of your pro Rooney argument is based on him being better than Herrera and Scneiderlin for the last couple of months. Those two were truly awful during that period. It really doesn't mean much to say Rooney was better.

12470~~~
Rooney playing upfront with Ibrahimovic would be a shambles. 

If he's still at the club next season then he should either be played in midfield or not at all.

12471~~~
he leads a charmed life

12472~~~
I'm sorry but the bolder part is just not how football works. I have no idea where people get this idea that players can only ever play one position at the top level and never change their game but it's just bollocks. Valencia is no longer a RW in my book, he's now a very high level RB and that's his position. He now plays that 'unnatural' position better than 90% of RBs in the league. Similarly, Rooney was a CF/CAM and he is now moving a little deeper to become a midfielder as he was always touted to do. It's not about pampering to a player it's about looking at the attributes he brings to the team; passing, running into space, shooting/scoring and saying he brings those things better than all our other 'natural' midfielders. He's been the best midfielder for us this season I just don't understand how that can be argued when the rest have been shite. 

I'm also not saying he should play on past performances, what I said was that he deserves his status and wages from what he has achieved in the past in the club. He should earn his spot in the team on merit of performances just like every player but it just seems like no matter how well he plays you just don't want him here. That doesn't make any sense, why would you not want a top performing Rooney in the side unless you have something fundamentally against him. 

If we could go out this window and sign Pjanic and Pogba then I'd agree Rooney shouldn't be first choice but if we only sigh one new midfielder then I'm looking at our options and thinking Rooney can offer more than Schniderlin, Mata, Herrera, schweinsteiger, Blind and Fellaini because quite simply he's a better player.

12473~~~
And yet he was better and if you expect Herrera and Schniderlin to up there game then it's reasonable to expect Rooney to do the same. Rooney might well be shite or he might be a victim of the system like everyone else however, unlike other players Rooney will always take the blame and it's very unfair.

12474~~~
If rooney can no longer play has a striker, I don't see any use rooney has to offer. Would rather united invested in a top class midfielder, than shoehorn rooney into a starting 11. With zlaten, rashford, martial, don't think we even need rooney, if he is willing to be part of a squad maybe, but a guaranteed starter he should not be a guarantee

12475~~~

This will be put to bed this euros, thankfully.

No doubt hodgson's system will be blamed.

Can I just ask, why judge Rooney on a few decent performances in midfield and not the first half of the season where he failed to contribute a single point? The teams he put a good shift against were poor. Did Rooney do well in midfield against Leicester? He disapppeared in the second half against Everton and was dominated by Cleverly and Gibson....

Do you truly believe Rooney is good enough to line up in midfield for a top side?

12476~~~
I think schweinsteiger is a top class player but his injuries mean he's so immobile, people call Rooney slow but Christ knows he's not as leggy as schweinsteiger. He was utterly shocking in the first half of the season I agree, literally one of the worst half seasons I have seen but he's done as a striker and then that's only amplified by the fact that he didn't get any ball or chances in that Utd system. When you combine those factors it causes it to create a severe problem. Past Christmas tho he's been back to being very good with that good run of goals in January and then some good midfield performances over the last two months.

I'm terms of the games you meantioned, I thought he played ok against Leicester tbh and against Everton he didn't get dominated by cleverly and Gibson he played very well up until the point where Everton just came into the game and had us penned back. You can't expect a team to not have a spell of the game where they are on top and it wasn't Rooneys fault the whole team went down a gear in that period. There's a common theme on here that people target Rooney individually even when the whole rest of the team is following the exact same trend.

What people need to realise is that when the team plays poorly so does Rooney and by the same token when we play well Rooney plays well. I expect us to play well the majority of next season under a far better Mourinho system and therefore Rooney will have a good year.

12477~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://uk.soccerway.com/news/2016/June/04/hodgson-rooneys-best-position-is-anywhere/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://uk.soccerway.com/news/2016/June/04/hodgson-rooneys-best-position-is-anywhere/</a>

'Rooney can play at his best in any position and shoehorning players into the team is a good thing.' 

England will disappoint in the Euros and Hodgson will get the boot. Thus becoming the third manager in three years to refuse to acknowledge problems with Rooney and consequently fail at his job.

12478~~~
Once you start going down the "show some respect!" road then you've already lost the argument. Respect from 99.9% of supporters towards formerly great players (Rooney, Giggs etc etc) is a given, and is besides the point; what supporters of both United and England want is what is best for their teams <i>now</i>.

12479~~~
But if Rooney plays the midfield role well, and better than 'natural' midfielders why is that shoehorning?

12480~~~
Because he is not a midfielder, and we could do better than wayne rooney

12481~~~
That's why playing Rooney in midfield is a horrible idea, but every other idea is even worse.

12482~~~
Haha this argument just doesn't make sense if he plays the role well. It's baffling me that everyone thinks you can only play one position over your career.

12483~~~
Contrary to many, I think Rooney will play quite well at the Euros and (initially) under Mourinho; why? because he'll have to - it's his last chance to be considered a top-tier player and so maintain his elite-player treatment for club and country. While teams insist on showing him enough respect not to hassle him when on the ball, he'll get away with fooling people, managers and all.

12484~~~
LVG refused to invest in our attack because he wanted Rooney as his main man. Where is he now?
Rooney will also add Roy to his casualty list. 
I feel for England fans. I am almost certain he will have a poor tournament. Hopefully it gives Mourinho the liscence to dump him and n the bench.

12485~~~
How? Rooney is terrible in midfield, distribution is average, he continues to give the ball away, and clearly his best days are behind him. Why shoehorn rooney in midfield? when he is past it, when united can sign a top class midfielder that is better than anything rooney has to offer. Rooney is shoehorned into the team, he is not a midfielder, never has been and never will be. Fergie thought rooney's best days were behind him, and that has proven to be true

12486~~~
He might want to but IMO, he's not physically capable. The added reinforce nts we will bring will put even more pressure on him.

12487~~~
why is your judgement so bad?

12488~~~
That's the thing <a class="username" data-user="95327, @TrustInJanuzai" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95327/">@TrustInJanuzai</a>, he doesn't play the role well and outside of a few isolated instances, he never has. I just hope Mourinho doesn't prove to be as stubborn in picking Rooney as LVG was...

12489~~~
I've said this somewhere before - if someone offers you £20m, take it and sell him.

If you're striving to be around the top, you cannot let underperforming players hang around for so long. It's not a season of underperforming as well, it's been at least two, and Rooney's fitness could very well decline further. 

I'd be happy to see him continue in midfield though. :P

12490~~~
Can't see anyone in Europe offering us 20m for him though with his wages and the signing on fee he and his agent would demand. It's very difficult to offload players like this profitably. He also seems to have quite a lot of influence in the dressing room so letting him go abruptly might backfire.

12491~~~
Never said it the buying club had to be Europe. :P But you're right, he won't be easy to sell.

As for the influence in the dressing room, given the hatchet jobs on Moyes and LvG, maybe it's a good time to "reset" it as well.

12492~~~
Oh yeah, we might lose a great deal of character our current team obviously possesses, never say die attitude on the pitch, true leadership ever-present in the team and winning mentality that wasn't thrown into dumpster even if it looked that way.

12493~~~
It is not how football works but I disagree with that point. It is one thing to play as a CM it is another thing thing to play as a make shift. When players transition from one position to another, they tend to be very proficient in their natural and they carry on the "excess" into another role. Look at the likes of Alves, Mascherano, Lahm, Zanetti, Maldini et al, these guys mastered their primary positions and were amongst the best in the world at the time when they got shifted into other positions. it wasn't until when they were done and dusted, failed in their primary capacity before they nailed down another position. 

Valencia is effectively a failed winger and if you think that he is a very high level RB, then we are finished. He plays more like a make shift player than a proper RB. To call him a high level RB (high praise indeed) is to say that as far as RBs go, he is in the top bracket. He is not even in the top 10 RBs in the PL. He lacks the key attributes that the top RBs do and his physicality and energy is what gives him the opportunity, that still doesn't make him a RB. Blind has done well in his first season as a CB, would you call him a CB, despite playing more games there than Rooney has in CM. They're are all make shifts. This isnt bad in itself but let's not be naive and pretend a player can just become a CM just like that. 

Don't take this the wrong way but do you know the difference between an SS and a CAM? They are completely different roles and Rooney was always best used as the former. The SS is NOT a midfield role in anyway, so just because some pundit say he was always going to be a midfielder doesn't mean they are right. The whole #10 business was a desperate attempt by the English media to try to fit in with the elite teams on the continent. Calling Rooney a #10 was laughable at the time. Fergie , rightly used Rooney as a support force to more potent strikers like RVN, RVP, Saha, Chicarito, Ronaldo etc but never as a creative force which is primarily from the wings. Before you knew it, every Tom, Dick and Harry was called a #10, from Wilshire to Barkley to Sterling to Alli, pure desperation . Lallana is the only one closest to a #10. From there, he has now progressed to becoming the new Paul Scholes. What next? The next DM?

Wayne is not a midfielder neither is he a better midfielder. He simply just played better than midfielders that were mismanaged, underused , out of favour , low on confidence and definitely out of form.  He's our player but let's not be blinded by our love for the club all the time. 

If every single player was on sale, how clubs do you think would say, "let's buy Rooney for our midfield"! How many forwards in world football have successfully converted to a CM?

12494~~~
On the contrary, I think the reinforcements, if they are top class, will lessen the burden of creativity on him and create a bit more room for him. He could function as a 10 in a front four but he'd have to up his work rate a bit. If Mourinho could live with Oscar as a ten then Rooney has a chance. 
Its clear that he will start the season in the first 11 and its up to him to keep it that way because I don't expect Jose to maintain those infamous privileges.

12495~~~
I think Valencia is easily in the top 5 right-backs in the league and is ridiculously underrated in that position.His positioning can be suspect but his strength, pace and energy make him formidable both in 1-1 defending and as an attacking outlet. He absolutely bossed Alexis Sanchez in a game and was excleent against Hazard the year before so im not sure what else he can do to get rid of his detractors. I fully expect him to be first choice under Mourinho in that position but thats a debate for another thread.

Your reading way to much into the CF(SS)-CAM debate, football isnt as technical as people make it out to be and formations, positions dont mean half as much as fans would like to think. The main thing is that Rooney knows how to play with the game all around him rather than just being able to handle the game being behind him like other pure strikers. If you have positional awareness then your able to play in CM and one of Rooneys best attributes as always been his ability to see the bigger picture of the game, his intelligence on the pitch if you will. When players slow down they often drop into deeper roles, the best and most famous example being Scholes who started as a similar CF and moved deeper till he played the deep lying play maker. Now i dont think Rooney has Scholes quality and should be our deepest midfielder but hes certainly got the ability to provide some goals and assists from deeper. 

In terms of saying hes played better than other midfielders that have been "mismanaged, underused, low on confidence, out of form" all of those same things could be put in the direction of Rooney as well which might indicate that instead of a huge decline hes actually not playing at his top level. His brilliant career to date makes that just as likely as saying a 29 year old player has just suddenly become shite. Just a quick query, do you like Rooney?and did you like him in his pomp (as a player and person) because the answer to that will change the way i judge your view

12496~~~
Mate, you can't use the same measuring stick for Rooney and the other players. Rooney was not in the same boat as these guys were. Do you think fans will be on Rooney's back if they were all in the same boat? Whether knowingly or not, you keep on ignoring this obvious fact. I'm hoping the others get a fair and equal chance that was only afforded to Rooney. Even if blame can be laid on the system, Rooney still had a lot built around him.

12497~~~
Lampard role. Zlatan top and Martial left. Rashford to play on the right and rotate with Zlatan and a new right winger. Sorted.

12498~~~
Well rightly or wrongly i do measure all the players by the same stick because thats the fairest way.

12499~~~
Rooney can't be measured by the same increments as the other CM's as clearly he has huge preferential treatment to say Herrera and Schneiderlin who played on egg shells and were prone to be dropped on a whim, where as no matter how bad Rooney played his starting spot was secure, that security alone breeds extra confidence.

12500~~~
Yeh probably correct but i cant see that preferential treatment occuring to the same degree under Mourinho. That being said Rooney being captain and having well known qualities does mean that managers are much more likely to try and play him into form.

12501~~~
Those qualities are in the past, much of what made Rooney a threat is gone, he's declined substantially on a physical level and shouldn't be given a CM birth instead of buying in a proper top class CM. He should compete with Ibra for the striker role and that's it.

12502~~~
I suspected you were going to ask me that, haha. 

I'm a football fan and a supported of Manchester United. I owe no allegiance to any player and I call it fair and square, whether you play for Liverpool, City , Leeds or United. Just because a player plays for Manchester United, it doesn't make them immune to criticism. I still have a massive poster of Wayne Rooney, I still have my first player selfies with Fellaini on my Nokia 6230 (throw back. Lol) but will not stand in my way of criticism or praise. Did I like him in his pomp? I thought he was an awesome player, not my favourite by any stretch as I have a preference for CMs over Forwards. Do I think he is amongst the best forwards in my time? Far from it but he was an awesome player in his pomp IMO. Do I like the fact that he toyed with us during contact negotiations twice? No but it still does not infringe on my opinion in his on field display . Doe stay answer your question?

As for the 29 year old player suddenly becoming crap. It's because sport age is different to regular age. You calculate sport age from when an individual begins to exert close to his maximum potential on his physique. To is Rooney 30, but sport wise he has the body of a 35 year old. You have to appreciate that Rooney has been pushing his frame 4 years earlier than his peers had started. Not only that, he was an energetic player in his prime and by the time he was 27 his body gradually began to slow down. If I'm not wrong, footballers tend to have an avergae playing span of 15 years, injuries permitting. If Rooney started at 16, it makes that by now , he is way into his decline. Look at Designs, he didn't start till like 21, he's 38 and still active and in his decline. Rooney's body is shot and honestly is not too different from Gerrard in his final years at Liverpool. He wasn't as bad as Rooney was in the context of a whole season regardless of how biased United fans want to be but he just had to go for the sake of the team. In similar fashion, fans, pundits and coaches tried to shoehorn him whenever the opportunity arose. He has left, they have a new manager and the players look like they can get better but Gerrard is still a legend.

This is why you can't keep feeling like people hate Rooney, he time is near and that is just the reality. It's nothing personal, it's just the circle of life. He has had a good career that has spanned a long time. That's just it really. The fact that his form and decline has been a topic for discussion for United and England for a few years now is testament to that. If at 28, people feel like his time was nearing its end, it says it all really.

For this reason, we can't keep using history or past career achievements to justify his privileges. Like I earlier stated, Raul was much better than Rooney is now, so good that he left for a very good team in Schalke  and helped them to 2 successful campaigns. But because if his status, he needed to be moved on to allow others behind him to also reach their potential. Personally, I don't think he can't do much better next season and making excuses, changing formations all the time to suit him, shoehorning will not make anything better. One game for England , the golden was finally put on the spot light, like wise in the good display against Germany in Rooney's absence, he was also up for discussion. 

Mate, all good things come an end. I admire your support for him but it's only a matter of time before things change.

12503~~~
This is a good post and i can understand why you have your opinion. You might well be right that his body has gone and he can no longer play at the top level and im also well aware that all good things must come to an end. I just wouldnt feel happy without giving him one season under Mourinho to see if hes absolutely done or if hes been a victim of the system because at the end of the day if he can find any semblance of top form hes a hell of player. Perhaps im basing my opinion on nothing but bind faith and i will only know that after another season. What i think we do know tho is that Rooney isnt getting sold this summer. Rightly or wrongly managers, his fellow professionals and the media still hold him in the highest regard so i dont see him being sold before Mournho gets a chance to view him himself. What i also realise is that if im sat here in January still defending Rooney then im wrong and hes probably not done enough.

12504~~~
We are being linked with midfielders left right and center. Ibra is supposedly coming in too. Where the hell does Rooney play?

12505~~~
sounds like Mourinho is happy to see Rooney end his playing days with us.

12506~~~

“I am happy to say now that, whatever may happen in the future, I will never play for another Premier League club,” Rooney said.

12507~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

12508~~~
off to china, then.

12509~~~
LOL. It would be funny if Jose keeps using him often. I said that awhile ago though.

Tbh, why not? He is a club and england's great. I see him still very useful for the teams for 2 more years. He is United's captain too.

Not many managers who take the job right now would not just discard a player like him right away especially when you have no idea who to replace at first.

12510~~~
Rooney still has his basic skill set but his ability to compete at high tempo is virtually shot.  I actually have no doubt he could turn in 3 or 4 impressive performances for us as a midfielder but there's no way his body can maintain the kind of intensity for 38 games the English premier league is known for.  

Father Time claims all of us and Wayne in not exempt from the laws of nature.

12511~~~

12512~~~
wow he looks old there

12513~~~
He'll still be an automatic starter next season. Mourinho won't want to rock the boat instantly as he'll be weary of what happened at Chelsea repeating itself.

12514~~~
Well what happened to Van Gaal could well happen to him here in that case.

12515~~~
Indeed. 

But I imagine he'll ensure that the quality in other positions are of a standard that reduce the reliance on a player that can't be relied on in a big manner anymore.

If Rooney of the first half of last season returns we'd  be in trouble though. That was a complete farce.

12516~~~
I'm sure he could try that but looking at who we are competing with we'd be in trouble anyway unless we sign a Ronaldosque player, City do not have to carry anyone, Spurs aren't going away and Wenger looks like he's finally caught on. If we are to achieve top 3 we will need to Rooney to step up or lose his privileges for a player who can, imo.

12517~~~
I think Mourinho will up the quality of the squad to the point where Rooney knows he needs to be on top form or be on the bench. He will squeeze him out of the team and Rooney will be forced to accept being a bench player or move elsewhere. 

Mourinho will be subtle in getting rid of him rather than take Wayne on directly due to the length of his contractand lack of realistic suitors (no team in england would take him who can afford him and one Rooney himself would be interested in). 

I can't see Jose being stupid enough to build a team round him and think he's going to lead us to success. You don't spend 6 months out analysing us and come to the conclusion that Rooney is a worthy starter for a team with EPL and CL aspirations. 

Keep him on board until the contract wears down and once we have more leverage on our side.. we can get rid.

12518~~~
What is this Jose analysing our team for 6 months thing? 
Is it just wishful thinking from fans or did he say anything?

12519~~~
Mourinho might want to play him, but I'm positive he won't hesitate to drop him when he starts putting in similar performances like beginning of last season. No more 2/3 full shite months of 'playing him into form'. That's a luxury that JM won't be able to afford.

12520~~~
We look at rooney's ball retention and technique is one of the worst, always guilty of giving the ball away, playing him in midfield seems the worst decision anyone could make.

12521~~~
<b><i>Wayne Rooney sees benefit of moving backwards to go forward with England</i></b>
• <i>Captain to adopt midfield role alongside Dele Alli in attacking lineup</i> 
• "<i>I feel, with my football intelligence, I can play there and further my career."</i>

<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

12524~~~
That's like Dylan saying his recent albums are better than what he did in the 60s.

12525~~~
If Mourinho lacks the balls to do what needs to be done, he will end up like his predecessors.

12526~~~
2018 World Cup:

England are set to adopt a unique 2-4-3-2 system with Rooney playing as a second goalkeeper who "can do everything but use his hands". Rooney started in attack 14 years ago and has been moved around to accommodate better players since. After playing as a third centre back for qualifiers he now finds himself in the unique position where there are better players than him in every single position. 

His new role, which is designed to make use of his best abilities, will make it much easier for him to make a gut busting run to left back before fulfilling his inspirational role as captain by pointing, spitting bile and reminding someone that "<i>that was their fecking job</i>". 

When asked about the role Wayne said he was most excited about taking the goal kicks: <i>"ehhhm well there's this drill we've been practicing in training where I use the goal kick to float it diagonally to Milner on the right wing....".</i>

12527~~~
Where do we think he will play positionally this season coming?

Lots think as the Attacking mid role, similar to how Mourinho played Lampard or Sneijder. Personally, I think he is a typical Mourinho striker.

12528~~~
You forgot to include " obviously" otherwise good

12529~~~
How is he a typical Mourinho striker? Mourinho loves his strikers playing on the edge of the defensive line. His strikers always have immense power and pace and he doesn't mind them not seeing the ball as long as their stretching defenses.

12530~~~
Self-satisfied, precious about criticism, unwilling to do the work required to truly hone his game, and coasting towards retirement.

12531~~~
And we are helping him along the way. Pretty sure England will dump him before we do.

12532~~~
Well I would say Rooney is a powerful player capable of stretching a defense and is capable of off the ball duties. Which can then free up space for the quicker players around him

I take it you see him in Mourinho's attacking mid role then

12533~~~
Sad but true 

It's a sad indictment of us that we let it get this far.

12534~~~
Either that or midfield. Pretty confident he's not going to be a striker.

12535~~~
Now looking back it's quite obvious Summer of 2013 was the best opportunity to move him on. Chelsea were willing to offer 30 million and we still had Kagawa, RvP, Hernandez and Welbeck with us.

12536~~~
I've read others players' performance thread and in most of them, posters here believe that LVG had somehow made them worse than they really are. Why does Rooney don't get the same leeway is just something that I dont understand. 

Performance wise, though the 1st part of the season he was bad, as most of our players. I think most of us can agree that since the starts of 2016, he was one of our better players. Hope he can build on that and I truly believe that if he don't perform, Mourinho will bench him.

12537~~~
Jose likes strikers who go an entire calendar year scoring less than 5 goals and could conceivably do it again?

12538~~~
No, he wasn't. He was our worst player, and one of the worst in the league. He was ridiculously bad.

And he still had the privileges neither of our player have or had before.

12539~~~
I agree he was given ridiculous privileges at the start of the season and that is LVG's fault. If I remember correctly, he was dropped at the end of last year in Stoke game and consequently he performed better after that. So, maybe he felt too comfortable with his position in the team, and that is again LVG's fault, which will not be the case with Mourinho.

12540~~~
Huge game for him tonight. The next couple of weeks could well define the perception surrounding this move to midfield and whether or not the press will get on board.

His pass out wide to the right will make for a cracking drinking game, at the very least.

12541~~~
If he has a stinker of a tournament, he's would be under tremendous pressure going into the new season. Every Tom, Dick and Harry will be saying, he's finished.

12542~~~
He <i>might</i> have a good tournament - he can, given his ability, shine against the lesser teams, and may raise his game in eye-catching fixtures against better teams.

12543~~~
I reckon there's not half as much pressure on Rooney's back as in past tournaments. That might just benefit himself and England.

12544~~~
Kagawa was probably going to be moved on under SAF anyway, RVP had just come off a rare injury free season so the odds of repeating that were low, Welbeck is shite and Hernandez wasn't as good for us near the end as he was when he joined. He was never going to be relied on.

12545~~~
<span style="color: #ffffff">...</span>

12546~~~
I don't for one second believe that, what makes you think SAF would have sold him just after one season where wasn't even that bad just very inconsistent. 

Also i think no top club in Europe would have offered Rooney a new 300k a week contract for five fecking years when his decline was inevitable in his late twenties. Any competent board would have taken the 30 millions offered from Chelsea and give the whole sum to the manager to replace him.

12547~~~
3 months into the season, City top of the table and we draw or lose to some shit team and questions start being asked and the pressure starts building...JM will be throwing players under the bus, under the bench, into the stands....I jest but I don't think JM will not indulge Rooney too long. Rooney's own father wouldn't have persisted with Rooney as much as LVG. It was just bizzare and inexplicable and weird like a lot of other things he did here

12548~~~
That right there is Moyes' legacy.

12549~~~
The truth.

12550~~~
100%. 

Ferguson put it on a plate so Moyes could have culled him without looking like the bad guy - he had other ideas though.

12551~~~
<i>"Nice to hear your own fans booing ya.."</i>

To be honest that moment in South Africa sums up the bad side of Rooney. Entitled to play, to high pay and platitudes because believes in his innate 'talent', regardless of the shite he serves up on the pitch and narrow-minded towards any opinion to the contrary.

Even when he's shite, he expects privileges, platitudes and to freedom to criticise anyone around him so long as it's not himself.

Wayne Rooney has never been the type of player you give freedom to. He has always excelled massively when he's had a strong manager and a disciplined role handed to him that intuitively made it clear he was a cog in the machine.

This move back to midfield is sad. It's really sad England are having to put with this like we are.

12552~~~
Hoping he has a good tournament, thus making a few people look a bit silly. And it's certainly not beyond him to do that.

But some of you are clearly f*cking desperate for him to do badly, and i'm sure he'll get slated regardless of how he plays.

12553~~~
Managers keep on picking him. They can't all be wrong.

12554~~~
Managers keep picking him since when? Ferguson and Capello are the only recent managers that have any credibility and the former was ready to boot him out. The latter had him last in 2010 when he was genuinely one of the best players in Europe.

You think I care what Hodgson, Moyes and crazy LVG think? Hodgson especially is fecking moron.

12555~~~
Capello picked him whenever he was fit, and in Fergies last season, Rooney played 40 games.

I've a hunch Mourinho will play him regularly as well, probably because he isn't half as bad as some of you make out.

12556~~~
With the career he's had I hope so. In reality I think it'll be the opposite. I'm with those who think he's done physically and tournament football will expose this. Everybody brings their A game which is bad news for a guy who needs time on the ball.

12557~~~
Have a read of this pre-Van Gaal thread, on how Rooney and Van Gaal would get along: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/rooney-vs-van-gaal.391019/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/rooney-vs-van-gaal.391019/</a>

Predictably, the usual suspects were convinced that Rooney was in for a rude awakening under Van Gaal. Dropped, sold, etc. How'd that one turn out for you?

I see the same wishful thinking here.

12558~~~
Fergie put the wheels in motion for Moyes to move him on. The clown instead completely missed this very obvious lead and signed him on for life.

12559~~~
What is even more sad is that, Englsnd will see the light before we do.

12560~~~
And where is Van a Gaal today?

12561~~~
No one was arguing about Rooney being dropped in 2010. 
Why do you think there is a discussion in the press about he's position in the team? 
You think we are picking on him because of some hate?
His performances don't command his status in the team. Simple as that.

12562~~~
From around 550 of your posts I can see since you have been promoted, 442 have "Rooney" in it. Always had you bit obsessed about him, but never realised that's all you post about.


And btw you said it yourself he should have been dropped long time ago. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12563~~~
Well it worked out really well for Van Gaal didn't it? Putting so much trust and faith in Rooney.

Let's hope Mourinho is smarter.

12564~~~
is this a scouse thing?

12565~~~
The captain is playing well. Hope it continues.

12566~~~
Good first half from Rooney.

12567~~~
Playing very well in that midfield role. Love to see Rooney do well on the big stage.

12568~~~
He's been decent, would have loved to have seen that half volley go in.

12569~~~
Some of his crossfield passes have been glorious.. but the best one has to be the pass to Alli between the Russian defenders..

12570~~~
On this first half showing he's our best midfielder!

12571~~~
He's been the best player on the park, his new role really is in midfield.

12572~~~
Been great

12573~~~
That pass to Alli highlighted his vision. 
He's not bad in midfield, is he?

12574~~~
Very good half, very good.

12575~~~
We're sorted if he can do this week in week out. Unfortunately, I really can't see it. But here's hoping.

12576~~~
Maybe he could reinvent himself like Scholes and Giggs did so brilliantly in the last part of their career.

12577~~~
Controlling the game so far.

12578~~~
Scholes-like performance in the first half.

12579~~~
I'll judge him against the better sides when he doesn't have time to take 10 touches on the ball. He has been good though.

12580~~~
He always does well when he's auditioning for a new position/manager/contract.

12581~~~
Had a good first half.

Appears to have gone missing for the 2nd.

12582~~~
Has had an awful 2nd half so far. Has to be said. Russia's best chance came from his failed dribble and lack of work to win it back.

12583~~~
I don't know, I watch him play, and he has the "football intelligence" of a caveman. He may be effective at times, but you can literally watch the thoughts form in his mind as the ball reaches him, he stops, looks around, and decides what to do. There is no quick touch passing, no dynamic movement to receive the ball or open space for a teammate. His moves and decisions are almost all apparent to those around him before they happen. He is Captain Obvious. Obviously.

12584~~~
Standard

12585~~~
The thing with Wayne though, in any given situation, no matter how bad he's played, he can produce a moment of magic. Even in his darkest moments, of which there have been many over the past 3 years, he's still a good player that can do great things.

12586~~~
He was very good at times in the first half, but as I said in the match thread he was massively benefiting from the fact that England players were being afforded ridiculous amounts of space, therefore meaning he had as much time as he wanted to play those cross-field passes, and was a lot more likely to find a teammate considering they were often unchallenged.

It's not that much of a surprise he went missing in the second half once Russia showed a bit of an improvement and actually sort of came into the game.

12587~~~
Disappointed yet again. It's quite telling that the captain was subbed. It's quite indicative of how low his star has fallen.

12588~~~
Very good today. Got forward well, controlled the game for England. 

Should never have come off.

12589~~~
Usual standards.

12590~~~
What are you on about? I'm sorry, but you're just plain wrong. Rooney played well and lots of people were surprised that he got subbed off.

12591~~~
Arguably best player on the pitch along with Dier... what a weird sub to take him off but leave on Alli, lallana or kane.

12592~~~
No it's not, don't be ridiculous.

12593~~~
He was England's best player your on the wind up or drunk

12594~~~
Between him and Dier for man of the match tonight

12595~~~
My thoughts exactly.

Why are people criticising him? He was nowhere near the worst player on the pitch. Sterling, Kane and Alli werent great. Walker and Rose were very good along with Llalana, Dier and Rooney.

12596~~~
Because he isn't Paul Pogba.

12597~~~
Not sure what was so good. It was just average.

12598~~~
Played very well. Along with Dier and Walker, England's best player.

12599~~~
Hodgson screwed up taking his most experienced player and captain off. He had a very good game.

12600~~~
Yes individualy he didn't have a bad game but the team doesn't work best as a unit. It's like when we were trying to shoehorn giggs and at times scholes to the team in late fergie years. Barkley would not do worse what's more he would provide more drive.. rooneys le le gone from the start of the second half..just my opinion

12601~~~
Good performance.

12602~~~
Fair enough, but I actually thought he brought players into the game really well. The things England didn't do so well were the decision making on the flanks and some generally sloppy play in the final third. Thought the balance was fine with Rooney orchestrating things.

12603~~~
I think it was a great performance, except one defensive mistake. He was tired and didn't track back, so Russia got into the box, but Cahill was there to rescue the team. Also unlucky he didn't score.
Year by year it seems like Rooney is better when coming late in the box. He needs space on and off the ball.

P.S.: That's what his pass to the right wing is needed for. If it's not useless Valencia who receives then it counts as a fantastic ball.

12604~~~
Good first half, quieter second, decent overall. Probably behind Dier and maybe Walker as England's best player.

12605~~~
I don't think he had a great game but it pretty much went pair shaped when he went off.

12606~~~
Thought he did quite well, shouldn't have come off unless he was totally gassed.

12607~~~
In the first half when England had Russia pinned back he played some great passes, showing real variety. In the second when Russia got on the front foot he struggled to make space against the press and was much less effective, this is where the problem will come in a lot of PL games..

12608~~~
In fact, Wilshere came in and tried the most difficult pass in each and every attack. This destroyed the free flowing football that Rooney established. 

These are things I didn't expect to say before the match  started.

12609~~~
Not sure what others were seeing. He was good in the second half of the first half. Because he had space. But it wasn't a great game from him by any means and playing him means England lining up quite defensively.

12610~~~
I think the problem with Rooney is no one knows how good he is. He has divided the entire fanbase and possibly journalists as well into good and poor category. So much so, that I myself am not very confident about my judgement of his performance. I personally felt he was good today. Better in 1st and a bid tired in 2nd.

12611~~~
Played better then Pogba did anyway

12612~~~
he was good today no question. the question is all these games are against crap opposition so far, relegation fodder and tonight Russia were even below that. Plus he tends to fade in the second half regardless. Being taken off today might be telltale to his physical shape at top level. Was surprised Roy actually had the balls to do it

12613~~~
Maybe Woy was trying to show he got balls with that move, just it backfired as he won't do the same to Kane and Sterling/llama.

12614~~~
Which they really ought to do; they're not exactly free-flowing offensively anyway, and the defence is equally suspect. Scrapping through matches with defensive resolution is normally what can get teams far in International tournaments. van Gaal did so with Netherlands who vastly overachieved and ended third in the tournament.

12615~~~
England lined up defensively?

England had 5 attack minded players on the pitch in the forward and midfield positions and two very attacking full backs.  

Tonight's line up is the polar opposite of defensive which is kind of show in the number of chances the team created.

12616~~~
Rooney can play deeper in midfield just as Lampard did. It's really not a problem for him it's easy. Shocking that he got hooked especially when England needed composure but that's Roy Hodgson for you.

12617~~~
Average performance. He somehow gets praised way more than what he actually shows, both for the club and national team.

12618~~~
Rooney played very well'he is still a very good footballer and should have not been taken off as his experience was needed to see off the Russians,I think Roy took him off to please the press and the anti-Rooney brigade

12619~~~
Decent/Good performance. Unlucky not to score (top save tbh). Did well and I think its the only way he should play next season for United (deep lying midfielder next to somebody like he did today with Dier (eg maybe with Morgan). 
Then with somebody ahead of them (like they did with Ali - so maybe Herrera). From that deep he gets more time which helps him especially if he has runners and width out wide (Shaw and whoever is RB eg TonyV)

12620~~~
This. What he showed today would not be enough for any PL team in that position. You have to consider how much space and time the Russians gave him.

12621~~~
Very good first half, disappeared in the second.

12622~~~
Exactly, that is the key. Lets judge him against a decent side where he will be closed down on his first touch.

12623~~~
Sure, Roy went into his first game of this Euros thinking this. I'm sure it had nothing to do with his performance.

12624~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12625~~~
Not sure you can say that Rooney disappeared in the second half when he was denied from opening the scoring by a fantastic Akinfeev save and also played a good forward ball into the path of Alli leading to the freekick from which Dier scored.

12626~~~
He was Man of the match in the fa cup final against a PL Team

Thought he did really well, but he should be embarrassed about his fitness levels. Too many footballers have such poor fitness that it is truly remarkable considering they are supposedly top athletes. Also, he was great in the first half when Russia gave him acres of space, but once they started playing like a PL team with high intensity pressing, Rooney struggled.

12629~~~
Guess I was watching a different game to the majority of Rooney fans then.

Thought the lineup was shocking for a start. Couldn't believe he dropped arguably the player of the season and changed the formation to accommodate Rooney. This was Van Gaal's problem last season. He flat-out REFUSED to drop Rooney. Even if when he failed to score in 12 games, he remained the first name on the team sheet. And look where that got Van Gaal? If it wasn't for Rashford, he would still be starting up top for us.

It's no surprise though. Vardy isn't a "name", just like Noble and Drinkwater aren't "names". Hodgson doesn't pick players in form, especially ones that play for "small" teams like Leicester and West Ham.

I thought he had an average game. It was probably a 5/10 performance all things considered. He didn't play bad and he didn't play good. But some people on twitter were claiming he was the best player on the pitch? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Dier, Walker and Alli were all comfortably ahead of him.

He had two shots. One was struck well in fairness but hit right at the keeper. The second (although a good save by the keeper)... IMO, should have been put away.

I guess I've come to expect it from the media now. No matter what Rooney does, he's always 'the best player on the pitch'. I knew when he was substituted, people would say "Why did he take him off? We would have won if Rooney was on the pitch!" - It's typical really. I guess some of these fans have short memories. How many times did we lose this season with Rooney on the pitch? What about the World Cup in 2014? I don't recall him being left out back then.

IMO the result would have been the same if Rooney was on the pitch tonight. England just aren't good enough. And a big reason of that is because they constantly make decisions like they made today.

I've seen Wayne Rooney's good games and tonight wasn't one of them. To say otherwise would be completely biased. If England want to win matches, they will play a more BALANCED team. No more putting a striker in CM. Play a diamond with Kane and Vardy up top, and maybe Sterling or Barkley behind with Alli/Wilshere/Dier in the middle. That's my opinion.

12630~~~
Fantastic performance, watched it live. Really looking promising for United for next season, slot him in behind a front striker and give him the free role with two behind him, two beside him and one in front of him and I think he will thrive. Imagine how many times he's going to arrive at the edge of the area unmarked and have a shot at goal. Lucky Akinfeev made a couple of absolute worldy's tonight.

I think so as well, he was damned if he did and damned if he didn't. "Why didn't he take Rooney off and bring somebody else on with legs".. Concede late 1-1 "why did Roy take Rooney off omg!!!", still Rooney at the heart of a promising performance from the team with a great contribution himself bodes well for the rest of the tournament. I really hope that late goal doesn't knock the stuffing out of the English advance at the Euro, I think it will have an impact on Rooney for United at the start of next season if they have a poor tournament and endure a summer of brutal scapegoating (which is nailed on if they go out at the groups).

12631~~~
It wasn't a bad choice to play Rooney where he played him but I still could imagine better set ups without him and more difficult games will come up so it can cost England like it cost United champions league. And I'm not saying he's alone to blame but he should be played only in certain games if he has to start at all

12632~~~
Could easily have had a goal in the second half. Nice disappearance.

12633~~~
It's more defensive than to field 2 strikers who scored 40+ goals in the league, IMV. It's less balanced too. I remind people, this is a Russia squad that is decimated with injuries.

12634~~~
Wasn't able to catch the Wales-Slovakia game.. how do we think he'll fare against their midfields? Do they sit back like Russia or will they press him more like a typical PL team?

12635~~~
As ever with any thread about Rooney people exaggerate his performances positively or negatively (some on the negative side as usual do so to the extreme).

For a striker playing out of position in a big international tournament match i thought he played really well. Not brilliant but well enough, England went to shit when he was taken off with his replacement Wilshire taking too many risks and affecting Englands tempo that Rooney had been setting.

12636~~~
Denied by an absolute worldy, I was 3/4 of the way off my seat and in the air.

12637~~~
I thought he played damn well. Could easily have scored 2 great goals with a little more luck.

12638~~~
One of the best midfielder's in the world when the oppositions game plan is to treat him like he has a deadly incurable disease that can be transmitted from 20 yards.

12639~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12640~~~
He had a good game, was one of England's better players....the fact that Russia were completely useless helped though

12641~~~
I'm a tough critic of Rooney but I thought he put in a solid performance (about a 6 for me), at least in the first half.  But we have to keep in mind the quality of the opposition and its tactics.  He was given space and he did well with it, until he no longer had space.  I'm still concerned about fitness.  This has to be his last international tournament.

If we're looking ahead to how Rooney might perform in this role for an entire season against EPL sides, it's not going to be pretty.

12642~~~
He had the face of a tomato by the time he came off and was clearly flagging. He was becoming lax because of that, which is why he got the hook, imo.
Don't think this is fair. He's learning a new position on the hop and energy conservation is an art in itself. Rooney expends too much needless energy and tires himself out in the process; that does not necessarily point towards a lack of fitness but rather a naive approach to playing in midfield. He'll surely learn over time to better manage his tank if he plays there full time. He's going from the 100m or 200m to the 400m to 800m that midfield is, it's a different discipline give him time to adjust to it if you're being objective.

12643~~~
I keep reading after every good performance on here that he won't be able to do it against better teams. But I don't see these better teams coming really. He's been doing well for a while now.

12644~~~
Some folk just will never give the guy credit but quick to slag him off. I get why people don't like him but credit should be given when due. He played really well vs Russia and was England's best player end off. All this nonsense about Russia bring weak etc well what about Kane and Sterling?

12645~~~
Anyway, I hope opposing teams continue to think like the fans on here and believe Rooney is rubbish and continue to "give him space". It's good for us.

12646~~~
He had a very good game last night, looked tired in the 2nd half, I think that's why he was subbed.

12647~~~
Played very well in the first half, but if he doesn't start being able to do it for the full 90 then he should be a sub and nothing else,

12648~~~
And in roughly the same period, you've mentioned him in 380 posts, so not a huge difference. It's irrelevant anyway.

I don't think i've ever said that, actually. But if you can link to the post where I did, okay.

I think what I have said is that, based on form, he could have no real complaints if Kane and/or Vardy were picked ahead of him. I stick by that, because -  unlike some of the haterz - I think my opinion on Rooney is generally fair and objective.

And essentially, Kane - who struggled last night, incidentally -  *has* been picked ahead of him as the main striker. But Hodgson obviously feels Rooney is still good enough to warrant a place in the side, hence him being picked in midfield. And the general consensus is that he played very well in the role. Some pundits even awarded him Man of the Match.

Of course, for some - naming no names, but i'm sure everyone knows who they are - it'll never really be good enough

12649~~~
Very good performance but I'm still not surprised that there are dozens of morons on here discrediting him.

12650~~~
Interesting and detailed breakdown of his stats from last night, by Sky Sports:

<b>Misplaces too many passes:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s33.postimg.org/eahtoh9fz/roo1.jpg" src="http://s33.postimg.org/eahtoh9fz/roo1.jpg"/> 

Shit first touch:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s33.postimg.org/s6mdpde6n/roo2.jpg" src="http://s33.postimg.org/s6mdpde6n/roo2.jpg"/> 

Can't beat a man:

Positionally suspect: </b>

But joking aside, and while he'll come up against tougher opposition than Russia, it *was* a good performance from him. And he is still, even at his age, learning the role. Perhaps there is 2-3 years in him yet as a good midfielder. Maybe not as the main man, but as someone who can contribute to overall team success. More so for us than for England, who haven't won anything for 50 years anyway.

12651~~~
A very good performance from him to be fair.

Yet, he still prefers a long ball to the right over more promising passes
I don't think that any translation is needed.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://s5o.ru/storage/simple/ru/ugc/21/78/12/89/ruu9c353ba04e.jpg" src="https://s5o.ru/storage/simple/ru/ugc/21/78/12/89/ruu9c353ba04e.jpg"/>

12652~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ignore Amar, he's a special case.

12653~~~
I didn't see the England game but Rooney played well in the last few games for United. But I would still like to see how he does against better teams. This is not to discredit what we does but because he has played in midfield before also and not justified being a permanent first teamer at midfield. So its only natural to be skeptical.

12654~~~
Walker was 10 times more of a threat and put in better crosses and balls into the box. Even I would have put the ball to him over sterling

12655~~~
Marvelous. This whole "he needs time to adjust to playing in midfield" is going to be the new trending excuse for him. People keep citing his last handful of games where he played better for us but forget about the shite for the rest of the season. Odd.

12656~~~
He does tend to have tunnel vision in that role.

12657~~~
Really unlucky not to score. It was a good hit with the right accuracy, but an absolute freak save by Akinfeev.

12658~~~
The problem is not how good he was last night. Let's assume that he was very good. More important is another question: How long can he maintain a good form? I don't see any evidence from the last 4 years that this Rooney can be good enough for more than 2-3 months per season. Most of the season he isn't good. Two years ago he played many games in midfield under LVG. He was decent at best. United need more than just decent midfielders to compete for the title. The notion that Rooney can improve his performances because this is a new role for him is very dubious. In short, it won't happen.

12659~~~
I was very impressed with Rooney in the last part of the season when he fully adopted this role. And last night I thought he ran the show for much of the game

If he can stay fit and consistent he will be key for us next season. I think Jose will love him

I'm even gonna stick my neck out and say if he continues in this role he will be among the candidates for player of the year next season

12660~~~
What do neutrals find worse the pro or anti Rooney brigade ?

5/10 performance <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12661~~~
Only a freak save stopped Rooney from scoring last night, and he ran the game for large periods. Hardly put a single foot wrong. It was easily a sold 8/10 performance. Those giving him 5/10's should watch another sport to save us all the misery of reading your posts.

12662~~~
That was more a miss than a save. It was a pretty normal save for a keeper at the Euros. The goal he conceded was a mistake, no top keeper would concede that goal.

12663~~~
Not a chance.

12664~~~
I don't blame him for 'missing' that chance - two defenders were absolutely rushing in to tackle him, so putting him under pressure; it was hardly a sitter.

12665~~~
It wasn't a sitter but it wasn't a <i>freak</i> save either.

12666~~~
It wasn't a freak save looking back at it there but it was a very good one. It could also have easily crept in after the save. Rooney was unlucky not to score.

12667~~~
I don't feel strongly about him either way, but I find the anti brigade most annoying. He's still our player and will be for a while, so why keep trying to convince the world how shit he is? It's almost like they want him to suck.

12668~~~
Ive been very, very critical of Rooney this season, as have many others, however, I thought he was brilliant yesterday. Best English player, by a distance, as well.

Its no surprise that everything went to shit after he went off.

12669~~~
It's a lot easier for Wayne's defenders to keep their heads though - he's seemingly undroppable for club & country, so the situation is nowhere near as exasperating for them as it is for Rooney's critics.

In any case, people see things very differently: how often, in Matchday threads, do we read stuff like "We're playing sh*t" immediately followed by another poster stating "Massive improvement by the team"? Often, and rather like the Rooney debate, no party has the monopoly on truth.

12670~~~
wow. you realise he has won 1 player of the month award since about 2010

12671~~~
Yeah, but then you praised him even when he was our worst player so you are not the one to trust to.

12672~~~
As many as Messi then. Player of the month awards mean nothing.

12673~~~
You can't be serious! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12674~~~
Always seems to convince me that he'll be vital in the next season despite having a mixed season. Hope I'm right this time...

12675~~~
No point trying to reason with fanboys.

12676~~~
I thought Rooney played well, I'm not sure where the negativity comes from, in fact, Rooney would be crucified if he played how Kane did against Russia. In midfield he ran the show and did what was required.

12677~~~
Englands 30 year old captain came off as he was tired in the first game of the tournament, that is pathetic. He did ok against a poor Russian defence, don't recall too many incisive passes from though.

12678~~~
Doing the same thing and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12679~~~
Hardly anti-Rooney. I call it like I see it. He gave a few decent passes but he hardly "controlled the midfield" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> . Russia sat back and invited England to attack for the majority of the game. Of course he got time on the ball.

This little dream world some United fans are living in where Rooney is the new Scholes needs to just stop. He'll never be a CM, let alone a Scholes. He's a striker forced into midfield cause he can't be dropped. Nothing more, nothing less.

I give it a 5/10 cause it's in the middle. Giving it a 7 or an 8 would be way too generous.

12680~~~
We literally sold a bunch of top class players like Di Maria, Van Persie, Hernandez, Nani and Falcao to focus on Rooney this season. The majority of those weren't even given a chance under LVG, and look where that got us. If it wasn't for Rashford and Martial, we would be utterly fecked.

Rooney's form from August-January was what cost us the title this season. Continuing to start with him up top when he's failed to score a goal in 12 games... no wonder he got sacked.

12681~~~
Well said. But from the second striker position please.

12682~~~
That's not the point though, a ball to a player in a central position, who can then turn AND face the goal is several times more useful than going wide. A half decently drilled team can close the space on the 'good' positions on crossing and the defence will be set for any one-twos, dribbles from wide, crosses etc. 

That's why it's so frustrating watching LVG's Utd. You can't 'move' teams out of position by spreading it wide and moving left and right. You NEED movement going towards and AT the goal. 

It's why we lament Rooney's shit touch. He's often in central areas and his touch almost always means he can only pass it back or to the sides. Rinse repeat.

12683~~~
Nowadays spraying a few decent passes like any other player should be able to do is all it takes to rate him an 8/10. Standards for judging him have been falling for so long so much so that as long as he doesn't feck up majorly it's a decent performance. It'll be a fecking lunatic plan to build a team around him again.

12684~~~
So slow on the ball in midfield. In my opinion, there isn't a place for him in our starting 11. If he wants first team football then he has to leave.

12685~~~
Completely agree. The fundamentals aren't there for him. He can make great passes but they're often not the right ones for the situation. Never mind defensive work or positional game.

12686~~~
He's no where near good enough but that's been clear as day all season. Apparently that doesn't matter though.

12687~~~
Which game are you people watching? He's absolutely bossing it in the middle. Decision making and delivery from set pieces has been spot on so far.

12688~~~
Serviceable in midfield. Nothing special at all.

12689~~~
The last few posts are mental.

12690~~~
Am watching the match without being biased.

12691~~~
good set piece delivery but he's been mediocre in open play

passing it sideways and losing the ball

12692~~~
Safe passes, no spark. He's not been bad but it's been a very safe performance.

12693~~~
Every other pass is a forward pass to the attackers feet!

12694~~~
He's had a fine match so far.

12695~~~
Was a great player for United but he has to go IMO. Sadly wont happen though.

12696~~~
Looks back to his old self this tournament, where has this Rooney been all season?

12697~~~
"Absolutely bossing it" is more apt when used to describe a typical Modric or Iniesta performance. In no way does Rooney ever "absolutely boss" midfield. I can't wrap my head around how some of you can be so impressed with such underwhelming performances when it comes to Rooney.

12698~~~
Fair enough bossing it was a bit OTT but the criticism was uncalled for. He played very well. Better? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

12699~~~
He's playing better than anything I'd expect of Henderson, Milner or Wilshere(at least right now with his fitness) over 90. Hell he's doing better than what Gerrard and Lampard have done over the past however many tournaments.

12700~~~
I've not seen him have one bad performance as a midfielder since van Gaal started playing him there towards the end of the season. Another good showing; completely dominating Wales' midfield.

12701~~~
Leader for a team full of shy youngsters. Playmaker. Hard working. Created two quality chances. 

Probably one of England's best players for the second game in a row. Plays for Manchester United btw...

12702~~~
So, you are sad if he stays, what is wrong with you? Fair play if you don't want to start games, but to be sad to see him as part of United is just pathetic.

12703~~~
Another good game looks very composed.

12704~~~
Made the most passes in our team, created 6 chances (half at least from corners, which makes Kane taking them previously even more baffling) 9 of his 11 long passes were successful. 

Overall our best player over the two games IMO.

12705~~~
He did well today, people tend just to remember bad things. He did varied his passes, one great ball to Alli but to no avail. Good in set pieces too.

12706~~~
People praising his average performance all wants him stuck on our starting 11 right?

12707~~~
I think Rooney will be even better with Wilshire's energy in midfield.

12708~~~
It called confirmation bias. Now I am a fan of Wayne Rooney so I probably do cut him some slack but so many fans on here are so full of disdain for him, as you say, they hold on to the two misplaced long passes that he made in the game as confirmation of him being crap.

12709~~~
One of which should have been kept in by Walker.

12710~~~
He was good, spent a bit too much time on the ball in the first half, but improved in the second. His delivery on free kicks and corners was good as well.

Stupid foul leading to the goal though.

12711~~~

12712~~~
Played well again Wayne. I have no complaints with him in midfield really. Is he Iniesta? Not quite but he has a brilliant football brain.

12713~~~
See his post match interview - his forehead looks like he's had a load of botox!

12714~~~
That wasn't an average performance

12715~~~
This. 

Hope Mou will find better solutiions for our midfield.

12716~~~
I definitely wouldn't be considered a biased Rooney fan by his fanboys and I thought he had a good game, especially off the ball where he picked up some very good positions to receive and keep shuttling play along.

12717~~~
I don't think he was very good at all but he does do good things. Game changing things.

12718~~~
Guess Van gaal's masterplan worked on you.

12719~~~
If the master plan was to correct wrong posts then yes it did

12720~~~
Thought he had other good game. Him and Walker where equally MOTM for me.

12721~~~

12722~~~
I thought he did well, i'd be happy to have him in midfield next season if he gives 38 games of that, his short passing wasn't as sloppy as we've seen at times.
Some agenda posters in here me thinks.

12723~~~
Don't know who's wrong.

12724~~~
He's looked better in these two matches for England than he has all season for United

12725~~~

12726~~~
This isn't average by any means.

12727~~~
5 chances created? Would love to hear which ones!

Average and it's embarrassing how much the media are overrating him on today's showing.

12728~~~
I suppose I should prepare myself for yet another wave of "Rooney reinvents himself" and "he's back" type newspaper articles. feck.

12729~~~
Rooney has had loads of crap moments this season. This game (and the last few) showed more good than bad. He has done well and I'm not averse to actually supporting a player whose form is on an upturn, and whose testimonial will be held in less than 2 months' time. If that makes me biased and delusional, then I'll carry that label gladly.

12730~~~
At least three came from corners, missed headers. One was a nice ball for Alli IIRC. The stat is accurate. Whoscored actually have him at 6 chances created.

12731~~~
Very good game again. Clear to see what people here are biased against him and can't admit to a good performance because of a blatant dislike of him.

12732~~~
He played decent in my opinion. To say he had a great game or bad game would be over reacting.

12733~~~
I thought he was good against Russia but poor today.

12734~~~
he played decent enough.

10 crosses though...AKA corners <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

12735~~~
That's why stats can be so miss leading, the interpretation of 'chances created' can be so minimal. I can't think of a pass or cross that set up a clear chance on goal, nevermind 5 or 6.

12736~~~
If Rooney got 3 assists and 3 goals some people would still bash him.

12737~~~
It's not like the basis for this stat is different for Rooney. If this set of numbers were under the name Pogba his value would increase another €10m

12738~~~
Those are such lazy stats, which is common for football.

How about passes completed in the final third. Passing accuracy in the final third. Interceptions. Successful forward passes longer than 10 yards. Number of passes that lead to a scoring attempt/shot on goal.

Watching Pogba yesterday, he had more of an impact than Rooney did in today's game.

12739~~~
If Pogba put in the same performance and the commentators wanked over it, I would still say it's pathetic. Rooney was average, in my view and I can't fathom the praise he's receiving and the stats won't chance my views on this. Played much better against Russia albeit they provided him while loads of space. Rooney wasn't shit like Sterling, Kane or Bale right enough.

12740~~~
I get the feeling nothing would change your view on this as you've made your mind up on Rooney. Even Shearer said he was man of the match and he will take any opportunity to slate United and our players.

12741~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12742~~~
Good stats, happy for him.

I wasn't able to watch the match. Did he play in a midfield of 2?

12743~~~
Classy little player. Sign him up!

12744~~~
9 successful long passes out of 11 attempted. 6 passes/crosses that led to a chance on goal. Tonni Kroos, arguably the best passer in the tournament, hit 12 of 13 accurate long passes against Ukraine, for comparison.

<a class="username" data-user="102387, @Mark_Barca" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/102387/">@Mark_Barca</a>

You obviously were not watching the game very keenly. Smalling nearly scored from a corner and Cahill missed two headers from corners that I can think of.

Using the same chances created metric averaged per game the best in the tournament so far are as follows

1. Payet 7 (2 games)
2. Fellani 7  (1 game)
3. Silva 6 (1 game)
4. A Gomes 5 (1 game)
5. Iniesta 5 (1 game)
6. Kroos 5 (1 game)
7. Alaba 4 (1 game)
8. Rakitic 4 (1 game)
9. J Mario 4 (1 game)
10. De Brunye 4 (1 game)

Rooney is 12th at the moment. Given that everyone in front of him has played only one game (except for Payet) after this round of games is over I would expect Rooney to be in the top 10 at least.

I have faith in the metric as it is almost like most of the players on that list are among the best at creating chances in the game.

12745~~~
I've been quite critical of Rooney this season and wouldn't have had him in the England team pre tournament. He's playing well though. When people don't give credit where it's due it makes criticism from those same people much harder to take, not to mention removes all credibility of said criticism.

12746~~~
Its not at all funny though, its a bit sad how some United fans hate him that much that they can't even admit to him playing well whether its for England or United. One bad crossfield pass and he gets criticized and its remember until the end, while the other 90 minutes are ignored. Or every postive thing he is done comes with a "but wales put him under no pressure" or "it was easy" or what not. Never just saying well done on a second very good performance which that was.

12747~~~
I thought he was decent, but not really that good. Gets too much praise for one or two good passes, ultimately was too lethargic and lacks the urgency. He just didnt offer much dynamism and forward passes (besides the first 20 minutes of the second half)

From open play? Payet would have had at least 10 passes/crosses that lead to a chance on goal yesterday from his FKs alone. And Wayne's "long passes"...how many are to the right flank when Walker was alone because Wales is defending from inside out? It's the same passes to Valencia...very nice passes, but the net yardage going forward isn't penetrative.

Wayne's playing good in two matches, but we all know he needs to be better and fitter if he's truly going to play in a Premier League midfield in a title chasing/winning side.

12749~~~
Have to agree.

12750~~~
Yes I guess he kind of did because Alli was upfield most of the time.

I think he played well overall, but sometimes it really bugs me when there is a clear pass forward right in front of him but he opts to pass out wide to Walker. It happened several times with Sterling.

All in all though I am happy to see him adapting to his role very well. If he plays like this all the time I would not mind him in midfield next season at all.

12751~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>￼￼ come on, pogba has been a tiny bit more then wank in the euros in his game and a half, while Rooney has been very good in both. Pogba is obviously a better player but he hasnt been close to Rooney so far.

12752~~~
3. Alli furthest forward and dier deepest.

12753~~~
Payet created 6 chances in the whole game from open play and set pieces. The same as Rooney today. Besides, a chance created from a set play is a chance created!?

12754~~~
Completely agree.

Completely disagree. Lethargic? That's just completely wrong, sorry.

12755~~~
Rooney has 5 chances created so he's 7th not 12th

12756~~~
If you didn't watch any of England's two games and solely looked at the 'stats' it would suggest Rooney was much better today than against Russia. Anybody who watched both games knows that is certainly not the case.

12757~~~
Yeah it feels like he is going to get stick despite what he puts up in terms of a performance. Of course it was a decent performance against a Wales team who had parked the bus and he had no competition in midfield.

However, you can only play what's in front of you. Is he a player who will dictate the tempo, recycle possession, win the ball of opposition players, make crucial interceptions and make himself available for receiving the ball? Of course not, but it was a decent performance from him and he deserves some credit.

12758~~~
Rooney had a very poor first half - and a very strong second half.

12759~~~
Because the stats say so? Pogba for Martial changed the game for France, it was much better a fluid and they matched midfield numbers once Pogba came on.

12760~~~
He has 6 in that game by whoscored's metric. That list is average per game so it considers both England games played. It is highly likely that he rise up the list after this round of games is over as only 3 players in the top 20 (including Rooney) have played 2 games.

12761~~~
Payet got more involved is what changed it. And sure the tactics were better, pogba individually was still average at best while he was wank in the first game. That yesterday and rooney in his 2 full games are huge differences though and if pogba put in games like that, he would be roundly praised.

12762~~~
Please define your metric for 'better'.

He was good in both games IMO but he took corners in this game so has more created chances because he is very good on set pieces. It is a very useful asset, especially in international tournaments which have so many tight games these days.

12763~~~
If Pogba got all the time and touches Rooney is afforded, then it wouldn't be a contest...but that midfield three of Matuidi, Kante and Pogba was a joy to watch. Three gifted number 8s.

12764~~~
Maybe people just don't like him in midfield and can't see what he brings there, because a player whose first thought when receives the ball is to hoof it to a right back shouldn't generally be considered as a good midfielder. His way of playing isn't really getting the best out of attacking players, only right backs. He simply isn't really good midfielder and doesn't play how midfielders should play, that's what I think when I see Fellaini playing there too, neither of them have that midfield awereness and never look like good midfielders to me, altough they aren't really that similar. He looks pretty much how Gerrard looked for Liverpool or England playing in midfield, I simply didn't think they are natural there and Gerrard actually played much better in Africa for instance than Rooney but I criticised him and never understood why he plays there. His play pretty much reflects on his teams play, England are slow, predictable easy to defend against, same as Rooney. 

One thing that people who like him in midfield also tend to ignore, is that he is non existent defensively when playing in midfield, his reading of the game is terrible and mostly his only interception in games are those one or two heroic runs towards the back where he makes some heroic tackle or something so he can be praised by pundits for playing like a captain. He is regulary one of the worst in the team when it comes to intercepting and winning the ball back.

12765~~~
Everybody is average then compared to Payet.  He has created 14 chances in 2 games.  Only Zidane created more for France  since 1980 in an entire tournament and thats 15!

12766~~~
Those who criticize his performance after a game like this probably don't see his contribution to the NT team in a objective way. If they can't recognize that he's one of England's best player in this tournament then they are biased or having an agenda against him. 

I have been very critical against him this season, mainly when he was playing as a striker in a three man attack. But after his transformation to midfield he has improved his game once again and showed that he still is a quality player worthy of playing both for his NT and United. I'm quite sure that Mourinho has no thoughts about replaceing him if he contributes like he did today and against Russia. He will not play every game, or two games a week for a full 90 minutes, that's to much to ask for but he still has the quality to be labeled a starter when fit and healthy. 

A midfield with Rooney, preferd dm and Mhkitaryan would be mouth watering with two new addition together with Rash and Martial in our attack. I have full confidence that Wayne Rooney still can play on highest premier league level for another season.

12767~~~
He was good but that's about it. I'd like to know what people's basis for comparison are before calling that an excellent performance.

12768~~~
He didn't just hoof to right back, I know you watched the game so you know it's not true. Based on the past 2 games, I disagree with your opinion to say Gerard was better in Africa. And Rooney's defensive positioning is not bad at all. For instance against Wales, I see he restricted Allen's movement quite well, if defensive work only about interception, Carrick was never a good CM as well. Rooney is not there as a DCM. 

Actually, I think you really hate the man, in the matchday thread you even called him horrible after 28 minutes<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

12769~~~
Ran the game, but it's only Wales so I can't say too much before I get attacked.

Good game, Wayne.

12770~~~
Great again today. 

England's best player.

12771~~~
Played superb and looked like the talisman of the England team...

12772~~~
So far he's been alright circulating the ball. We need to see him having the edge on last third, though.

12773~~~
People who dismiss set-pieces are just foolish, half of the goals scored at euro if not more were results of set-pieces. It is absolutely vital for a team to have a good delivery and England's delivery was improved against Wales.

As for Rooney he did well in both games, i think today he was slightly better because he had more responsibility including corners and stuff. I don't think he was great or very good, but he did put in reliably good performances and was one of better England's players in both games.

12774~~~
I like his performance as midfielder today. I hope he can keep his performance and stay out of injury..

12775~~~
Looked like England's most dangerous player again to me. Seems to have that little bit of quality that others maybe lack. I mean, *of course* he does. He's Wayne f*cking Rooney.

Certainly looks better than Alli, Kane, Sterling, and all these other young guns who some would have you believe are his superior.

12776~~~
A bit poor 1st half like the rest of the team but in 2nd I think he was one of the best England players. Another captain performance.

12777~~~
This passage in bold is pretty telling as to your pre determination. You could just as easily say "he offers nothing in attack but scores the odd 30 yard screamer so he can be praised by pundits etc." Its just negating things to suit your argument.

12778~~~
Rooney was decent nothing more. His set pieces were good but he can take them playing in any position.

He's slow on the ball and always picking the safe pass sideways or backwards. He definitely did not run the show or was not even close to man of the match.

He did do some good things in the game to be fair to him but people are vastly over rating him.

12779~~~
Englands second game and Rooney was the best player in both games.We should be pleased.

12780~~~
Watched the game in Leeds and a huge chunk of the crowd absolutely love Rooney despite all the associations. 

A huge chunk is at least a 100 Yorkshire men (it was a big crowd).

I'd swap him for scrabble.

12781~~~
Had a good game, if he could play like that for the whole season it would be great. But he can't, can he do a job as a squad midfielder, certainly. Should he be our first choice and the player we build our midfield around, not with his consistency or lack of.

12782~~~

12783~~~
The Wayne Rooney debate is all down to how individual fans on here judge players on a whole. 

Personally, I find it weird how a football fan can watch a midfield performances like the ones Modric, Kroos and Iniesta put on their opening games of the Euros and think that Rooney's performances have been excellent. Particularly Modric's performance, which was a 8/10 at best, a brilliant performance against a solid midfield opposition, playing some high intensity stuff. What basis are we using to judge player's performances these days? If Modric's was an 8, I don't see how Rooney's can be pushing past a 6. IMO, standards have been lowered so much that fans are comfortable to judge Wayne Rooney with the players around him rather than what top professionals put it. His performances in midfield is bread and butter to this top guys, on a slow day at the office. I don't remember one of his performances in the last 6 months that tops the one I saw from Modric the other day.

On the other hand, you get the media, pundits and some fans waxing lyrical about what I consider an average to ok performance with respect to the highest level of football. Yet, we want to be taken serious as far as quality is concerned. Sometimes, when I see comments like;

"<i>He has a sat nav passing range

This new role for him looks to have given him a new lease of life and could extend his career at the highest level for a few more years Atleast.

Not every footballer can reinvent themselves in different roles especially this late in the game.. So credit to Rooney for that. True World Class footballer.

He has always put the team first above his own aspirations.. Ronaldo for example would never accept not being the "the main man" anymore on a team. Rooney is a good captain.

Mourinho must be drooling at this.. He has a massive hard-on for Rooney he tried to sign him after all.</i>"

It begs the question, what is the basis for our comparison? Otherwise, we would keep going on in circles. 

Personally, I think he is just ok as a midfielder. If a random player in the league put in the performances that he is putting in, I really doubt that there will be any bigging up of the player in question. Everything Wayne Rooney does is magnified because of of the past and nothing to do with now. While his performances are not terrible, they are nothing to write home about.

12784~~~
It's only Wales...

12785~~~
This is really all I'm personally doing. I just want United to be progressing in this post-Ferguson period and the idea of his performances being good enough to fulfil this is just not entertained by me.

I couldn't care less if RedCafe thinks I'm a mindless and cruel 'hater'. I have plenty of detailed footballing reasons why I think we'd be better to move him on.

I personally take the view that some folks just can't let go of Rooney as an entity and I can tell some genuinely grew up with him as a personal footballing hero. They expected him to be a real legend of the game like Messi and he's nothing of the sort. They want to drag out every last purpose he can have at United until he retires. Something that at many other clubs we would be laughing at. So they will turn average performances into 'great' ones and poor performances into 'well he wasn't the worst' and so on.

Just imagine if Gerrard decided he was going to drop back and be a centre-back and Liverpool went along with it. Yeah, just imagine our reaction to that.

12786~~~
Aaah thanks for clearing that up, Urgh some of my friends said payet would get player of the tournament and I'm erring to the side of agreement. I know he's too old but he really deserves a few years at the top of his game at a top top side

12787~~~
Everyone in this thread needs to view this post.

12788~~~
This comment doesn't deserve a reply, so I won't.

12789~~~
I share these sentiments. 

It seems that on here if you say he's doing well in the midfield you'll get replied with "Oh really? He's doing well? Then what is Modric doing?! What is Iniesta doing?!" I don't get such reasoning. Why can't some people just accept that he has done well, regardless of whether or not he should be a key player of the club moving forward. 

I have hopes that Rooney will gradually reinvent himself as a very capable midfielder. He will have his own unique style of play. At times it seems like the perfect gel between the forward attacking line and the midfield.

12790~~~
He created twice as many chances in tbe game than anyone else but he played it 'safe. '

12791~~~
Obviously modric, kroos and iniesta are better midfielders than Rooney, but i dont see what is the point of saying this?

We don't have those players in our team. Unless we buy them or have players with same abilities in the team, there's no way Rooney is going to be benched for the like of Herrera, Fellaini etc.

But I agree that better midfielders will do us good, but atm Rooney is the one of the best options we have in midfield.

P/S: <a class="username" data-user="81556, @Silverman" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81556/">@Silverman</a>, thanks for not replying, i would assume your reason for your sadness is going to be daft anyway.

12792~~~
What makes Rooney a better midfielder than Herrera? Herrera can do all the things Rooney does with the ball apart from being a classy finisher.

12793~~~
Herrera has similar abilities to Kagawa IMO. the ability to seem like a brilliant player despite doing little to suggest so on the pitch. Tremendous ability I say.

12794~~~
Watch Dortmunds games from last season before making such a statement. And Herrera has been poor all season but the same goes for Rooney, they both lost the ball easily often.

12795~~~
I frankly don't give a feck what Kagawa does for Dortmund, all that maters is what he did in a red shirt, which is very little yet a lot of people on the Caf vastly overrated his performances. Saying Rooney has been as poor as Herrera is ridiculous.

12796~~~
I'm glad someone's said it. I remember last season, everyone kept going on about how RVP and Falcao are past it and Rooney is wasted in CM as he's our best striker and needs to be played up front regularly the following season.

Look how that turned out.

If we sold Rooney and kept RVP this season, we would have probably won the league. And now he's playing in midfield again because he can't be dropped. What happens when he starts playing shite in midfield? "Oh he's a natural striker, he needs to be played up front"... rinse and repeat. We'll never get rid of this guy.

12797~~~
I didn't really see anything great from him against Wales to be honest. it was decent, nothing more although he does have potential in this new role.

12798~~~
I kept saying that Rooney should be played as 9 or not at all. Never have been convinced when he played as 10.

However, in his role as a deep(er) lying midfielder he is really good so far. I have not seen what Modric, Kroos or any other midfielder in a similar role has done so much better in this tournament.

In fact Rooney 2016 playing this role is quite similar to Schweinsteiger 2016.
Difference is that Rooney is in a much better physical condition and can be a Goal threat as well.

12799~~~
He monopolised the corners and in-swinging free kicks though, so the stats would be inflated by that (credit to him, he put some great crosses in).

12800~~~

12801~~~
It all comes down to what "doing well" means. I don't think it's unreasonable that for some doing well means more than just being tidy in possession.

12802~~~
Yeah right <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12803~~~
That's just low standards.

12804~~~
It is low standards. It's the result of us having a poor midfield for years.

I think today's midfielders, playing in a three, get away with murder anyway. Keane was playing in a two man midfield, with big defensive responsibilities and could still score over 10. The two 8's(or whatever you want to call them) should be weighing in with a real good amount of goals and/or assists. As well as providing all the finer points of being a midfielder. That to me would constitute playing well.

12805~~~
And that is the bar to which we should be holding Rooney to. Not "being tidy in possession" and "being able to string passes together".

12806~~~
We have played 2 pretty sub par teams in Russia and Wales where he was given all the time and space he wanted to pick out passes. The true test will come when he comes against opponents who pressure him and don't let England dominate possession. I think we will see him struggle badly in those situations.

12807~~~
I agree but I think that there was already a true test and Rooney didn't deliver the goods. That was the most important game of last season when a win vs Wham would have almost guaranteed a CL place. 

Wham have been the only quality opposition against which he's played in midfield so far and they aren't exactly a top team with top midfielders. 

Of course, Rooney deserves a chance to show that he can be useful against a top opposition as well. I think that Mou will give him that chance. I'm not optimistic about his future as a regular midfielder at United though if United really want to tin big titles.

12808~~~
After England played Russia, most people who said Rooney played well because Russia's midfield are wank (which is true) deemed that he will struggle against Wales as they pressed high. But yesterday I see Rooney managed to get passed this high pressing multiple times, from Allen and Ramsey. 

Yes, we can see how he deals with better team when the time comes but is it to hard for some to say he has done well for this two games?

 And as i said in previous post, as long as we don't sign new midfielder, he is one of the best options we have in midfield. Regarding the West Ham game, most of our problems arised from Herrera's constant fouling. From that game I made up my mind that He is not gonna be better than Rooney in midfield.

12809~~~
The thing is, we're Manchester United. We shouldn't have to wait for a player to <i>gradually </i>reinvent himself so he can continue to be shoe horned into the starting side. We should be actively seeking a much more capable midfielder, of the elk of Modric and Iniesta to play in the role. 

If we're happy with seasons like the last 3 - scrapping it out for 4th and most likely missing out, Rooney in midfield would be perfect. If we want to challenge for the title and, looking foward, the Champions League, Rooney should be no where near our starting midfield. His wages are too great for him to be a bench option and he is no longer good upfront. 

He was fairly quiet in the first half yesterday, when Wales pressed. He came into the game much more when Wales sat back and allowed him room to do so. He will not get these allowances in the Premier League. People cling onto performances against Crystal Palace (a shite side) and Bournemouth (a dead game). One poster even brought up <b>TWO </b>outstanding performances in the position over the last <b>TWO </b>seasons. When pressed, we've seen that Rooney does very little. A la second half against Everton, Leicester, West Ham and first half against Wales yesterday. The bending of logic is insanse.

Contrary to what many will label me, I'm not a Rooney hater. First and foremost I am a Manchester United fan. I want to see us challenge for titles. We need to be much more ruthless to do so and not allow for the shoe horning in of players out of sentiment and hope. History has told us Rooney struggles in midfield (last season), he struggles when a team is built around him (early this season) and he struggles to perform consistently throughout a season (the past 5 seasons).

12810~~~
Unless I am not seeing it, England still lack a connection between midfield and forwards. I honestly don't see what he is doing that is so extra ordinary that needs praising.

12811~~~
Superb post.

12812~~~
First off, very mature reply, good man. There are many many more midfielders better than Rooney apart from the ones you mentioned. You make it sound like he is in a tier immediately below them which is nonsense. There are so many CM's in the premier league alone that is better than Rooney.

12813~~~
can somebody please post the passing map of rooney vs wales ... or if possible the website name wer i can find one <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

edit: got one

12814~~~
He couldn't deal with the pressure against West Ham and Norwich.

12815~~~
Rooney did not play in midfield against Norwich. He had to play upfront due to Rashford being rested and Martial picking up an injury in the warmup before the game.

Also please watch the West Ham game back. He was the only midfielder with a bit of composure. He also stayed on his feet and did not foul every five minutes like Ander. 

If you remember LVG has to sub Schneiderlin at half time because he was so poor and Carrick his replacement didn't fare much better.

12816~~~
I'll watch the game later on before I agree/disagree with this.

12817~~~
that puts a different spin on things. Id say its refreshing that he is at least keeping possession better

12818~~~
Again, those players are not at United. Buy them 1st then we can have 'mature' discussion on who should play in midfield.

12819~~~
The big problem is that playing Rooney in midfield means the striker will see little of the ball. For whatever reason he just doesn't pass into the strikers feet. The above passing map confirms this again.

It'd be interesting to see it compared to other top midfielders. Or indeed Joe Allens.

12820~~~
To be honest, I think he's been average for England in these two games. Usually when I say someone's average it has a bias towards the negativity. But here, it's more of a positive. He has surpassed my expectations. He's certainly not been trash, looking out of place. More, he's looked like a competent midfield who's had a couple of steady game, without actually shining all that much.

12821~~~
That's a lot of crab passes

12822~~~
Funny thing is that Rooney's pass to Sturridge between two Wales players kick-started the last attack when England scored. So much for seeing little of the ball...
Also he is pretty much the only player that is capable of producing that kind of pass he did for Alli, a long one over the top of the defence, when Alli could not control it well and if he did, it could have been 1-on-1. Any midfield needs a player that has a long-range pass, it's important to shift the tempo and sides.

12823~~~
First of all there is a difference between crediting his performance and wanting him to stay at Manchester United. I want both, and understandably some people don't want the latter as they think he is no longer an important influence on the team or for whatever reason. I was talking about the posters who will only criticize him after a good performance. Why must every England performance of his in the midfield be "oh he was offered space, if he wasn't offered space he'd have sucked"? If you see a player has a good game then just say he has. 

I don't agree with what you have to say about Rooney and people clinging to performances against shite opposition. I find that a very weak argument. A good performance is a good performance.

12824~~~
I'm not going to write about 'the potential midfield general' or anything, but rather about 'Wayne Rooney's performances'. The ones in this tournament.

I always follow United players for their teams, and while I was disappointed in Martial and De Gea and Fellaini did as expected, I was positively surprised by Rooney in the first game. I thought England commanded most of the game and Rooney was the one keeping them ticking. So much so taht the second game, I tried pretending (to myself) that Rooney was some nondescript player (NDP) for another quite good team (QGT), like, say, Portugal, Belgium or Croatia.

I noticed two things. One: This QGT had very good control of the defence and midfield, they got up into the last third repeatedly, and they produced a few ok chances. Slightly less than croatia. More than portugal and easily more than belgium. This was a bit surprising, as the movement and precision of the three up top where nowhere near the quality of attackers on said teams. Also, Alli was losing most duels, even if he was very mobile, and often failed to position himself in space to receive the ball. Dier was almost stationary, accessible, but mere sideways in his passing. Second:  Almost the entire flow of the team was down to the constant mobility and availability of NDP, and of his high level of precision in passes, and variation. Also, the few times someone could pick a run with a through ball, it was mostly him. Also, the few chances (cahills header, smalling almost connecting at five yards mostly arrived from his feet). A few glaring mistakes, but generelly very few misses. A few brilliant moves, but not too many. It struck me that this very much resembled what Modric did for Croatia that had made me think 'this is some of the best we have in the Euros so far'. Even if he had better options around him in Srna, Rakitic and Perisic, and a more flexible Mandzucic up top. Most of what he does isn't fantastic, you just think 'typical Modric making it look so easy'. Which is correct.

It suddenly struck me that both England and Rooney are almost never regarded outside of this particular over-hype story where they are constantly (also by me) expected to disappoint because they are expected to be better.

To me, Rooney has been twice MoM for a team with four points in two games after having been clearly the better team in both of them. Who in a Euro isn't satisfied with that? You know who.

12825~~~
Was excellent against Wales, easily the best player on the pitch. This bodes well for his confidence leading to the end of the Euro's and then working with Mourinho, I suspect the more confidence he has the faster he will hit the ground running for us next season. I think he can realistically put up 15/15+ in the AM/SS role playing with the form he has shown in the last three months.

12826~~~
I think a lot of people here believe in some sort of 'player vacuum' i.e. if Rooney is sold/benched/hit by a bus then someone amazing will step into his place and lead us into glory. 

It's a little naive to be honest, and it should always be competition that dictates who's on the pitch rather than packing players we don't like to China. Rooney has been good for the last few games which frightens people, because a good Rooney will get game time. If any amazing players were being benched for Rooney then that would be a travesty but currently, such a situation could not be further away from the truth.

12827~~~
This. As much as I loath Van Gaal's rimming Rooney's arse I  still find time to be honest and acknowledge his good/great games. Imho opinion LVG's hero worshipping was a bad influence, Rooney needs to be kept on the edge inorder to perform yet Van Gaal and Moyes pampered him and allowed him to let himself go.

12828~~~
Just seen this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ridiculous. Relentless sideward passing and (shock horror) the diagonal out wide!

Modric vs Turkey

12832~~~
There are so many CM's better than Rooney available. Your making it sound like we have a transfer ban. Its not like we need to sign Modric to see an improvement. The fact that they are not at United is irrelevant, it's during the transfer market, its the time to discuss transfers.

12833~~~
Woah, crabs everywhere!


Glad that Rooney is finest English player on Euro so far. Proud.

12834~~~
Modric makes a lot off passes to his rb/rw...

12835~~~
Rooney was far poorer than Herrera on the first half of last season. In fact, he might have been poorer than any regular player I have ever seen in a United shirt, bar Falcao.

On the second half, Rooney was better, especially on that spell at the beginning of year and then on the last few matches.

Herrera for Bilbao and on his first season here has been a better midfielder than Rooney has ever been. Or will ever be.

12836~~~
Yep let's sign one of the best CMs in the league like we did last year with Schneiderlin...oh wait Rooney has greatly outperformed him in midfield even when most people considered schneiderlin one of the best in the league. Rooney has quickly become one of the most underrated players in the world.

12837~~~
Pretty much agree. Think Rooney will be used as one of the main midfield options. But Jose will add a tackling midfielder. Matic? not sure. His teams are about power.

12838~~~
Rooney was out worst outfield player in the first half of the season(Greatly improved in the second).

He hardly played at midfield this season. If we are going to slate Morgan over his season perfomances ,shouldn't we judge Rooney too over his entire season perfomances too?

12839~~~
Chelsea will not sell him to us.

Just the lazy English media linking us heavily to Chelsea players just like we were heavily linked with all Dutch players that could kick a ball under Van Gaal.

12840~~~
Thats why I raised a question. But Mourinho will want a tackling midfielder. As for Rooney, he still is a quality player. I think he will be a very good option for us.

12841~~~
So cos Schneiderlin had a bad season means not to buy anyone in CM. Yeah good logic there.

12842~~~
Yeah, never sign a midfielder again.

Why? Because Schneiderlin.

12843~~~
I really think Morgan can be that player. They were glimpses there last season of a good player.

As for Rooney ,I wasn't really a big fan of this midfield experiment but he had done recently so far. I'm willing to give him a chance too.

12844~~~
Haha, as i said, let's buy these 'better' player 1st, and if you want to discuss transfer I believe we do have transfer forum here in Caf. This is a thread to discuss Rooney's performance.

If you think he is poor, fair enough. There will be others here who will argue if they think he is not. But surely it is a stupid argument, in a performance thread, to say other players; playing in a different team, against different opponents, perform better.

I reinstated, I'm all in for a new better midfielder to play instead of Rooney as I don't see anyone in our current midfield is significantly better than him.

12845~~~
Anybody calling Rooney's perfomances excellent must be 
1. British
2. Have some serious rose tinted syndrome issues

12846~~~
If Rooney's performances in CM have been excellent, then people have forgotten the standards a an Utd player should play at. I blame Moyes and LVG

12847~~~
tbf every player needs to be reassessed under Mourinho.

van Gaal destroyed a number of players.

12848~~~
It baffles me how some already are convinced he's a great midfielder after what...3/4 games. 
Same with the debate about him getting 25-30 goals last summer.

12849~~~
Van Gaal is a terrible man manager.

Let's hope for an overall improvement on that side and better perfomances from the players.

12850~~~
Well, it took us 2 seasons to finally accept he wasn't a good enough striker, let's hope we don't wait that long before we give up this midfield experiment. Question is where do we now move him when this experiment fails?

12851~~~
Good post. Not surprisingly it's been passed over. People refuse, or are unable, to objectively praise or critique Rooney on here anymore. That, or the posters that can have gotten bored fighting his corner.

It's pretty clear to me that he has been England's best player by some margin. If he adds some goals and assists before the end he will talked about as one of the better players in the tournament.

12852~~~
There is a difference in saying he played well for england in 2 games so far, and saying we should build around him next season. Though I guess many on here dislike him that much that they can't admit he played well out of fear it will look like they think he should be a key player for us or something.

12853~~~
He will be a number 10 again, wasted deep in midfield, then back to striker, then midfield again. It's a process.

12854~~~
Wait, Rooney is getting criticized for the West Ham game? He was our best player after Martial and the only one in midfield who didn't look like he's playing football for the first time in his life. Showed good composure, good tracking back and also did really well for the Martial goal.

12855~~~
I admit he's played well. Just look at my post following his performances. However, I am petrified that Mourinho will bank on him being our main midfield man without a back up plan going into the new season. Same way I was petrified last season that LVG was going to make him our main man upfront without a back up plan.

12856~~~
If Rooney's been excellent I wonder what people think of Modric, Iniesta & Kroos so far.

12857~~~
They were good?

12858~~~
So you are making the rules about what is relevant now? My point is he is not good enough for midfield or up front. That's related to performance.

12859~~~
Not sure why that's so funny considering Rooney's form from August-January meant we finished most of our games scoring no goals? LVG stuck by him through thick and thin and look where it got him.

If only he gave poor Chicharito that privilege. Guarantee he have gone 12 games without a goal. But I've always stressed that relying on Rooney and building the team around him is a bad idea. He's finished as a striker and only playing in midfield cause they're afraid to drop him. Letting RVP, Chicha and Falcao go so they could play Rooney up top on his own every game is probably the worst decision I've ever seen in my 15 years of watching United.

12860~~~
It's funny how everything is Rooneys fault and, by your words, if we have kept RVP we would probably win the league. Yet it same RVP couldn't help Fener to win the title but would help United in harder league eventhough he's more done than Rooney is? Cool story bro.

Rooney was poor up-front, but it's not his fault our midfield looked rigid and without and creation, that our defence leaked with DDG making it look much better than it really was and that apart from DDG, Martial, Shaw (preinjury) and Smalling everyone else looked like they've forgot how to play football. That's somebody else fault (hint- he's been replaced with Mourinho) not Rooney.

We should've kept Hernandez, that's only thing that you're right about, but Falcao and RVP are gone, they've both regressed even more than Rooney and thinking that RVP would win us league is just pure delusion on your part.

12861~~~
I know it is repeated often that it is continually Rooney's fault we didn't score in the first half of the season, our shots at goal only increased minimally when he was not playing up front in the second half of the season. I think it is a fairly safe bet the attacking situation was as a result of poor coaching and directives from the manager.

12862~~~
I f*cking give up.

12863~~~
I think people might be saying he's been excellent there because they've taken into consideration that he's only just started playing in centre midfield, whereas, the players you mentioned have done so for most of their careers.

12864~~~
Steve, you have become very bitter. I no longer believe the "all-round nice guy" tag is correct.

12865~~~
He also seems very concerned about the English national team for a supposed 'Welshman' <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

12866~~~
Our Wayne must spread the footballing equivalent of toxoplasma.

12867~~~
His 1st half was worse than Herrera's much-discussed performance in that same game, he improved in fits and starts after the break.

12868~~~
So, he's not really excellent when you compare him with actual midfielders, he is just playing well for a player who is playing in a new position?

12869~~~
Yeah but give him 3 years in his "New" role and he might end up 1/10 of the player Kroos is!

12870~~~
Oh, I'm not bitter - just utterly exasperated with the 'indulgence of Rooney by his managers' situation; so exasperated, in fact, that I can no longer be bothered to argue the toss about Wayne in any depth - what's the point when neither side will give an inch?

As for the tag: I didn't choose it.

12871~~~
its a bit like auditions he always go through and pulls his finger out for; new contract, possible captaincy, midfield general.

12872~~~
Indulging the Midfield Maestro seemingly buys his managers time, so why not?

12873~~~
A mediocre English manager talking about a mediocre English midfielder. It reminds me of United over the last few years. The bar is being set lower and lower to accommodate him, yet we all wonder why we're lagging so far behind the best teams. I mean there's something seriously wrong when Rooney is being talked about as being England's and United's best midfielder. I wonder if he'll eventually become a mediocre defender once people tire of him being a mediocre midfielder? It wouldn't surprise me.

12874~~~
Indeed. You don't pay £300kpw (or whatever figure it is), to a player who is "learning to play".
For that sort of money, I'd expect the best in the World performances.

Hehehe. Indeed.

12875~~~
Right and that problem has nothing to do with Wayne Rooney.  He's not the greatest CM in the history of the game, but he's been solid in that role for United and now England.  That is an indictment on the quality of the other CM players in both the United and England squad than anything else.  

Honestly, it seems like people don't understand that even if you think Rooney has been solid you could still want United to add better quality in CM to challenge and create competition for starting XI spots so that we aren't forced in to a situation where Wayne Rooney is our best midfielder.  Thinking he's been good in that role doesn't preclude recognizing we need better quality players in CM.

12876~~~
agree with this.

It would be sad to think Rooney is the best we can aspire to for United and England. But it would also be wrong to say he is crap. Rooney still has a very good football brain. A quality player. But age and all the games he has played is taking a toll on him.  I am not interested in discussing what he is paid. It has no relevence. I still see him being a valuable player for us until he finishes his contract. It is up to the manager to use him how he sees fit.

12877~~~
Tell us another blatant lie.

He's been in and out of midfield for the past three seasons and had a few experiments under Ferguson too.

And have I just read some gossip that there's talk of a new fecking contract?! Jesus fecking christ, this club is going down the tubes. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

12878~~~
This is the first time I've heard of this.


I sure hope its the last time as well!

12879~~~
He wants to extend his contract.

12880~~~
Nah......

12881~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football365.com/news/rooney-keen-to-extend-his-man-united-contract" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.football365.com/news/rooney-keen-to-extend-his-man-united-contract</a>

12882~~~
If it's true, he's lunatic.

12883~~~
Naah, he's smart. It's our decision makers who'd be lunatics if they agree to his demand

12884~~~
Player for the next 3 years, then player/manager role, brilliant! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

12885~~~
He's been in and out of attacking midfield, not centre midfield. Massive difference. Yes, he has played a few games in centre midfield under Sir Alex, but not a whole host. 


Guess you could say that, but having watched him for us and England, I wouldn't say he looks out of place.

12886~~~
Judging by his midfield M.O., this'll mean that he starts off in the OT toilets before gradually ambling his way up to the Manager's office, and then he'll constantly throw contracts out of the right-hand window.

12887~~~
why isn't he concerned about the level of the team anymore?

12888~~~
now mentioning extending a contract after getting plaudits against relegation fodder and Russia/Wales. He doesn't miss a trick does he

12889~~~
Good news Steve:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-rooney-contract-mourinho-11493005" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...ews/man-utd-rooney-contract-mourinho-11493005</a>
(Now even comparing himself to Giggs after the comparision with Scholes got boring. )
<i>
"Not that I am am saying it needs to happen, but Manchester United should think about giving me a new contract after I learn to play new position, I should earn bonus for that. "
</i>
I really don't think this guy has any shame left in him.

12890~~~
Would be so funny if it was happening to one of our rivals instead!

12891~~~
I'm a fan of Rooney, think he has a lot to offer us this season and next under Mourinho, but that's as far as it goes for me. Extending his contract in the Messi/Ronaldo wage he's on would be lunacy.

12892~~~
But what a defender he could be for us. Ricardo Carvalho is 38 and still plays football with good effect at a top french club as well as in national team. Wayne's potential is unrivalled. He goes backwards while aging, however it concerns only his positioning on the pitch. You know what's coming when he gets 40?!

12893~~~
In all seriousness does no one remember years ago when it was revealed he was pretty useful in nets? There was even that Nike advert with him kicking the goalkeeper out, taking the gloves and then running the entire pitch with the ball to score.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqtMy8qVbwE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Headline in 2020 - "Wayne Rooney might just be the goalkeeper United need!"

12894~~~
His past boxing training and sparrings with premier league players will do him world of good when he finally takes on the gloves. Goalkeeper gloves I mean.

On a bit more serious note: my, my, how fast was he when they were making that advert. Sigh...

12895~~~
Disgusting to see Cantona being dubbed. His real voice makes me so happy.

12896~~~
Because he knows he is shite himself and will never get a better contract in Europe again after he leaves.

12897~~~
How did we get to the point where a player can be as bad as he was for the first half of the season and still come out of it talking about a new contract?

12898~~~
New contract!!!

He has 3 years to run on his current one and he's 30 years of age. Get real Wayne, see the contract out, maybe you will get an extra year at the end of it.

12899~~~
Giggs played on a club-friendly rolling contract at a reasonable wage. He never was a guaranteed starter nor a passenger in the team during those years. He kept himself in excellent physical condition through hard work and banging plenty of young women. There is simply no comparison.

12900~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's insane isn't it. He has no shame. Even if he was playing decently (and I mean decently, not outrageously well to fit his 300k price tag) he's nowhere close the end of the current one.

12901~~~
Probably sees himself as United manager in a few years time.

12902~~~
Probably sees himself as United owner in a few years time.

Jokes aside I was just about making peace with him not being such a clusterfeck in midfield so far, then he comes out with this.

12903~~~
Did I read the article differently? And I see one even came up with a made up quotation<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

Personally, he should be given a chance to see out his contract. But to give a new one is crazy, he is already the highest paid player in the squad. Or maybe he is willing to get lower wage for a longer contract? (Which is doubful).

12904~~~
No. 

Just, no.

12905~~~
If you have a problem with him saying 'I'd like to extend my contract if the club want me, and am trying hard to improve myself as a player', then frankly, there's no pleasing you. Which, of course, there isn't when it comes to Wayne Rooney.

Gets slated for asking to leave and apparently thinking he's too good for the club.

Gets slated for expressing a desire to stay and develop his game as a midfielder.

That's why some of us think, when it comes to this player, the criticism is less about his performances than it is about personal dislike and grudges. I mean, it's pretty damn obvious, and has been for a few years.

Even now, when anyone who's watched the games can see that, yes, he *has* been one of England's better players in this tournament - if not their best - people are still quick to come on here to try and take him down a peg or two.

England's record goal scorer - a phenomenal sporting achievement, by any measure - is now playing well in midfield in a major tournament. For me, that's the mark of a very classy and talented player indeed.

That there is is any doubt that this is exactly what Wayne Rooney has been, and what he still is - even if in a different way -  shows just how irrational, bizarre and ugly the debate around him has been allowed to get.

EDIT:

Although given the dogs abuse Cristinao Ronaldo (!) was getting last night - overrated, not one of the best of his generation, a glorified RvN, a poacher who offers nothing else, selfish, a big game bottle job, etc - perhaps it's just time to give up altogether on expecting a half way sensible or moderate discussion about certain players.

12906~~~
I seriously think not all of those who slated Rooney for what he said in the article read it.

12907~~~
Yeah, here's exactly what Rooney is quoted as saying in the article:

Now here's what the Usual Suspects pretend he said:

And then based on their own misrepresentation of his words, they proceed to slate him.

12908~~~
SAF/Moyes/LvG/Hodgson rated him. All reports say Mourinho rates him.  Going out on a limb to say they all know better than any of us. 

I'll freely admit to being a Rooney fanboy.  I love the way he plays and always have. He should no longer be viewed as undroppable.  He has regressed after a Legendary career for our favorite squad. 

That said comparing him to Kroos/Modric is a little silly.  Were he that effective, with his marketing reach, £300k a week would be a bargain. Side Note:  why should I care what the owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers spend in the roster? It's not like a salary cap exists or his wage is inhibiting transfers.

He has, I think objectively, performed at big club level in his new role.  (ONLY AGAINST CRAP TEAMS scream some. ......need I remind you it was crap teams that we struggled against the last two years? )  His all around game makes me optimistic he'll be spraying Hollywood balls to the right for 2 more seasons. 

If he's ineffective next year then we can move on.  If he's good in the MF the haters will continue to hate.......and eventually they'll be right.....not good enough for United.

12909~~~
name me one top side across Europe who would even consider having a 30+ Rooney in their midfield, let alone offer him several years there

12910~~~
Manchester United.

(Although it remains to be seen where or even if he plays under Mourinho. Just didn't see the need to slate him for what were perfectly reasonable comments)

12911~~~
Could have said the same about after 30 years Scholes and Giggs.

12912~~~
He's hardly going to get game time as a midfielder, or at all for that matter, at any other major clubs, is he?

12913~~~
Yeah, you carry on believing that if it makes you feel better.

12914~~~
Pep said he would have had Scholes at Barca in 2011, he was around 35 then

12915~~~
Giggs was always linked with Italian sides (Juventus, Inter). Don't remember much about Scholes but we are talking a guy who continually said he had zero interest in leaving Manchester.

12916~~~
I really don't think it's a leap to suggest a lot of fans footballing opinion of Rooney is influenced as much by his persona and history than his actual performances and statistics.

On both the positive and negative sides of course.

12917~~~
If we were the same calibre of team we used to be he wouldn't get a game, that's why.

Nothing symbolises our current predicament more accurately than the idea of starting a season with an over the hill Wayne Rooney as a first choice midfielder.

12918~~~
Only post that needs reading on here really. Would be true insanity to even dream of any new contract, unless it massively reduced the wage. But then why would he sign it?

12919~~~
True enough, mate. But my problem is with some people's claim that such knee-jerk/shallow opinions represent <i>all</i> Rooney criticism. 

Curiously enough, the shift in opinions regarding Giggs has been even more violent lately, I reckon.

12920~~~
very odd thing to say after the season he's just had, and being ousted from his natural game

12921~~~
That's this thread in a nutshell though. You have people who can criticise and praise Rooney with objectivity, but in the main it's lunatics at either end laughing at and abusing each other stating their own opinion as fact and labelling opposite viewpoints as laughable or delusion. Seeking any excuse to either big up or tear a United player/captain/legend down.

On Giggs and Scholes I thought both should have been replaced long before they retired or transisioned deeper, at stages I was pulling my hair out with Fergie failing to strengthen midfield and constantly relying on what I thought were over the hill players. 

In both instances I think I was wrong looking back, they were both so valuable even in their final seasons, so I won't rush to be rid of Rooney - who I don't even think is in that kind of decline yet.

12922~~~
It's not odd at all if you think about it without bias.

12923~~~
his performances up till xmas were dreadful. Why isn't he a striker anymore?

12924~~~
This.
If I may add, I also dont get the part where people slate him for underachievement. It was the press that compared him to great footballers like Pele, not any manager. If you dislike him because he didn't turn out to be that good, I'm sorry to break this news to you but you will soon start disliking Martial, Rashford, etc. as well. Also, the amount of sacrifices he made to the team should account for something positive. He did exchange a part of his development for benefit for the team

12925~~~
Most managers and players hail Rooney as well. What does that prove?

12926~~~
My post was about how posters personal opinion of Rooney impacts their opinion of his performances.

Your questions are random and unrelated, I think you missed the point.

Rooney was shite before Christmas, as poor a patch as he has ever had for us and his worst season as a striker altogether. However that doesn't stop his performances at 10 or midfield being good after January... Yet a lot of posters would seemingly rather die than even begrudge calling him anything over average in any of those games.

Pointing at one half of a season is a bit silly when his career has spanned 12 years with us, I do think he's in decline and wouldn't play him as a main striker anymore but still a damn good player a level above most. I'd have him somewhere in the starting 11 in our current squad and I bet Mourinho will too, and that's based on merit.

Really no use talking to you about it I think.

12927~~~
you insist criticism is due to him being disliked as a person, how much he is paid, his attitude etc. Anything in return ive said is to do with being on a pitch. 12 years service has nothing to do with a team moving forward, his decline has nothing to do with bias

12928~~~
Bolded is completely untrue, you've literally made that up. What is the point in having a conversation here when your not going to read things properly and then just make shit up.

Again you're not getting the point I've made, you've the second most posts in this thread and 26 of your last 60 posts have been about Wayne Rooney, which really tells the story.

I once again, regret entering this thread.

Have a good night.

12929~~~
goodnight Duafc <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

12930~~~
That's a perfectly sound opinion to have.  Though I'd wonder if you would apply the same calculating logic if say Martial or Shaw asked for a transfer to a club in the UCL?

I, personally, will always be pissed at 'good' United players that leave.....because I'm petty.  If they stay, however, like DDG/Rooney then I can rationalize and accept it's a business and threats to leave is how a player can maximize their earning potential.

12931~~~
id clearly be gutted if Martial/Shaw asked to leave, but they are entitled. Not sure if youre making parallels to Rooney's demands back then?, I think its more how he went about it, compared to DDG who was professional and in being so had most of our blessings to go

thats off the pitch stuff though, I'm mainly concerned how the team functions. id be happy with Rooney around if he played on merit and understood he can be benched. We're not here to serve him, its the other way round

12932~~~
I don't know why you bother reading it if it makes you feel that way. He's a footballer, he's in form and he's playing well for club and country. The rest as far as I am concerned is white noise.

12933~~~
It so obvious that, as I said, i'm surprised it even needs pointing out.

But you keep believing otherwise if it makes you feel better.

12934~~~
Tbf how anyone can say he isnt having a good tournament so is beyond me

12935~~~
I think it's obvious that Rooney critics are way better at predicting his performances over the course of a season than his fans. Look at the thread before the start of last season when his fans ridiculed the prediction that Rooney was going to struggle as a striker and wouldn't score more than 10-12 league goals. His fans predicted 20+ goals. Imagine their reaction if someone had written that Rooney would score 8 league goals! Look at the comments when Rooney hit good form in January. His critics insisted that he had no future as a striker and his fans were pretty sure that his bad performances as a striker were only a matter of poor form and mismanagement. They still thought of Rooney as one of the top 5 strikers in the league!

Generaly, Rooney fans are always quite optimistic whereas the predictions of his critics are much closer to the truth. I argued already 3 years ago that Rooney was declining and Rooney fans didn't want to hear a word of it. The next 3 seasons he was good for 2-3 months per season and during the other months he was bellow average or very poor.

12936~~~
This thread will be funny next season, his usual fans praising the 2-3 good passes he makes in 90 mins, the excuses when he goes through his months of shite(he needs x games to get into form, it's Mourinho, his teammates), the hyperbolic reactions when he manages 2-3 good games (he's back, midfield general, feck the haters)...it's going to be amazing. I just hope Mou doesn't bench him and spoil all the fun

12937~~~
I'm more inclined to want to ignore last season and put it down to a Vangling of the entire attack in search of more possession and more control. Which, ultimately you are on a hiding to nothing trying to keep the ball and play a control based game in the Premier League. It has shown for numerous clubs and managers that it results in more draws, more possession and less shots at goal. Lets see what Mourinho will do with him. I think it is a fascinating prospect in development. Especially considering his form at the moment (add in the back end of last season). Of course, you'd back Jose's pedigree to drop him the second he dips in form. I'm glass half full in that regard, I think Mourinho can tailor the game to suit Rooney's offensive instincts and negate and decline in physicality by building a down hill system that Rooney can play in.

I have to say I am very skeptical of your claim that he was declining three years ago. I mean he was club top scorer for two seasons running and was two goals shy of becoming top goal scorer again. I am not convinced entirely because they were two completely separate regimes and he is a versatility player who can play many positions for the club. There just isn't something right there in my opinion, maybe it is masquerading as "carrying the attack and making something out of absolutely nothing"? Maybe that is an illusion that presents itself as "player is declining".

The new manager absolutely has to get him scoring though if he is to remain in the team. That is a certainty.

12938~~~
Being a top scorer in a realtively bad United team means feck all. Defoe scored plenty for a struggling Sunderland side, doesn't mean he is a top  forward or something.

Rooney was pretty average in the second half of the season under Moyes, the same happened in the first season under LVG. He was terrible in the first half of last season as well. Compare his performances from 4-5 years ago to what he's served over the last 3 years and you will see a big difference. It is true that United were struggling under Moyes and LVG but it is also true that Rooney's influence was almost non-existing. Liverpool were struggling before Suarez but he made them compete for the title. After he left them, they have been struggling again. Great players have huge influence on the results of their team. Payet has made Wham good enough to compete for top 6. Rooney doesn't have any significant iinfluence anymore. If anything, his influence has been negative. We won more points per game when he was injured. We'd have finished 7th, 4th, 5th in the last 3 seasons even if he hadn't played a single minute.

12939~~~
It doesn't mean "feck all", it is a team game and the club's footballing match day direction was changed under the last coach. You can't blast your top scorer because he didn't score 60 (or 40 or X) when he only scored 18. You just admit you need to do more to get more goals. Van Gaal's philosophy was never about scoring a lot of goals, we created 11 shots per game and that only went up from around 8 in December.

Mourinho will bring at least some ideas that work in the PL at the very least. If they don't for Rooney, then he'll be out on his rear end to the delight of many. Nobody will be able to dispute that.

12940~~~
I'm surprised you're still blaming LvG for Rooney's lack of goals. Back in December you could maybe do that but since then surely Martial and Rashford have put that argument to bed. Two young lads, barely got their careers off the ground, both finding goals easier to come by than Rooney.

With that in mind I didn't think even the biggest devotees were still blaming LvG/the team.

12941~~~
He got 15 in all competitions, despite missing 3 months of the season through injury, and finishing it in midfield. Granted, he struggled for goals up until January, but after that he actually went on quite a hot streak (the claim is that he basically started ignoring LvG's instructions at this point, and it helped improve his form massively). Had it not been for the injuries, it's quite conceivable he'd have hit 20 goals in all competitions. And this, remember, in a side which struggled for goals in general, whether Rooney was playing or not.

Imagine the reaction if someone had said we'd fail to finish in the top 4, while scoring less goals than West Ham, Southampton, Liverpool and Everton, and managing only one more goal than relegation threatened Sunderland. But that's what happened. We had all the cutting edge of a wet sponge *as a team*. Rooney has to take some blame for that, granted, but in a more attacking system, I think he is actually still capable of a decent goal return.

Maybe. Hard to judge any of our players based on the last 3 years. If he struggles under Mourinho - presuming he'll even play - then yes, us Rooney Raters are running out of excuses fast. But let's just see.

12942~~~
Rooney has been in decline as a footballer since 2010. Ever since he's been hit or miss for large portions of each season. Some good goals and good performances aside, he's largely been a let down and Ferguson clearly had enough towards the end with his reluctance to acknowledge that he deserved to be benched when he was on a bad run. 

You can disagree all you want but he's barely been spoken of (in any serious way) as one of the best players in Europe since then.

12943~~~
Dress the argument up as you like but he got 8 league goals. Not 20, not 15. Treble was talking about league goals.

12944~~~
Rooney being dogshit for the entire first half of the season has a lot to do with this. 2 goals and 1 assist in the league with ZERO contributed points is an absolutely terrible return. There was a reason why LVG didn't want to play with Rooney in attack when he returned from injury even though we were in an all-important battle for a CL spot. Rashford was doing better! It's as simple as that. Yougsters like Martial and Rashford put him to shame and showed that his poor performances up front weren't down to the managers (Moyes, LVG) but to him being in decline.

Where would we have finsihed without Rooney over the last 3 seasons? 17th, 14th, 15? No, of course! Acually, his presence made no difference at all. Or it did make a difference maybe? A negative one?

12945~~~
The hater/fan debate is an odd one. On the one hand the "haters" have seen a player they believe has been declining for years and that is no longer anywhere near good enough to be in the first team have two managers build around him and refuse to even sub him when he's often been, in our eyes, the worst player on the pitch. We believe Rooney being on the pitch isn't what's best for the club and are tired of him being given special treatment above and beyond everyone else. What he did for the first years of his time with us is irrelevant now as we don't see him delivering and pandering to him isn't what's best for the club. We don't want what's best for a 30 year old player that's in decline, we want what's best for the club.

Do we fail to give him credit when he does well? Maybe. On the other hand, in our opinion, he has been very poor yet we've watched the media pretend he's brilliant while refusing to acknowledge any of his faults. It's an unbelievable and exasperating situation being on the other end of that. Herrera scored a goal in the FA Cup a couple of seasons ago, he bent it in and an offside Rooney stepped out of the way to avoid interfering with play. All the talk after the match was how Rooney was a genius for moving, no mention of Herrera's finish. The one match he was dropped we had to watch pundit after pundit going on about how the captain, leader and best player needs to be on the pitch and it's insane that he's been dropped as they wilfully ignored him being absolute shite for months. Every few minutes the commentator was going on about needing the leader and best player on the pitch. Has he been better recently? Yes. Does that mean we should now feel it's good enough or that he's the best option going forward? No. As much as his fans feel we won't give him credit for good performances many of us feel he gets far too much praise for anything he does well while what we see as his faults are ignored. Better doesn't mean good enough. There is also a fear that what we feel is the disproportionate praise will again lead to us failing to strengthen in areas because we are going to rely on a player we see as not good enough.

Is his personality a factor? Maybe not for all of us, but I think many of us see what's happened before and it is a factor, but not the way many see it as a black and white "you just don't like him". It's not just the transfer requests, it's how those transfer requests were handled. Handing one in before a CL match, openly questioning the club and implying the players around him weren't up to his standards then letting those standards massively drop while still expecting to be in the team. The fluff stories leaked to the press, the predatory way he tried to destabilise Moyes before he'd even got started in order to get his last contract. We see someone that will happily destabilise the team and manager in order to get what he wants. There's a very real fear that if he is benched then his camp will start leaking stories trying to destabilise the manager. He's far from the only player that's capable of that sort of thing, we've seen Lampard do it to AVB for example. Using mates in the media and leaked stories to pressurise and destabilise the manager enough to get what they want. His fans might feel it's ludicrous and he's a team player. That's not going to change the impression he's given to people less enamoured with him. We see the PR machine at work and it doesn't sit well.

At the end of the day his fans just have to tolerate some people not liking him like they do and the possibility a player they like might get benched. They still get the media praising him and get to watch him every week put in performances they feel are good enough. Outside of some people not wanting him in the team they are getting what they want. The "haters" have to put up with what they see as him getting praise many feel he's not done enough to earn, watching him repeatedly get special treatment that many feel he doesn't deserve, watching him play regardless of form, said form many feel is often so bad it's hurting the team and the very real fear that it's going to continue under Mourinho. Many of us feel that all that is to the detriment of the team and at the end of the day we want what's best for the team. Not believing in a player that you feel has not done enough in the last few years to earn belief isn't a ludicrous state of mind to have.

12946~~~
Are there still people blaming LVG for Rooney's woeful first half of last season? Despite the fact that the man delusionally stuck with Rooney when it was obvious we weren't going anywhere playing him week in week out? I still shudder when I try to imagine where we would have finished if Rooney hadn't gotten injured and we were forced to play Rashford.

12947~~~
Edit: nevermind.

12948~~~
Media is just falling short of singing "Are you Iniesta in disguise?"

12949~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a weak ass argument. News flash: we are not one of the top sides in Europe. And don't sell me any of the commercial power sales off trhe pitch bullshit because it's football that does the talking.

12950~~~
He got slated for saying something perfectly reasonable. That's evidence of a very definite agenda - of people looking for any little thing to pick at or jump on. 

If you think he's past it and no longer good enough for United, great. There *are* better strikers, No.10s and midfielders out there.

But that's not really the point i'm making, or the attitude towards him i'm criticizing.

12951~~~
Paul Scholes would still be a better midfielder even now than Wayne Rooney though.

Rooney doesn't have the first touch, the guile, the consistency nor the positioning to start regularly in a club that aspires to compete with the big hitters.

12952~~~
Don't know if you noticed, but even when Rooney wasn't in the team, we created very few chances. It basically *was* the system that lead to us being so pedestrian in attack.

12953~~~
Yes I agree with you that there was agenda posting there. But what <a class="username" data-user="81882, @clarkydaz" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81882/">@clarkydaz</a>  said was also extremely valid; what top club in Europe would want Rooney in their midfield? Your answer to which was Manchester United, hence my response. This is the standard to which we should be holding ourselves to. 

The last 4 in the recent Champion's League were City, Bayern, Athletico and Real. I will count Barcelona in although they were beaten by Athletico because of their undisputed position as one of the superpowers. Would Rooney walk into any of their midfields? A sensible person would say no.

12954~~~
Do you even read the 'papers regularly? This is a pure myth - bizarro world stuff. I can show you plenty of articles where Rooney is described as in decline, not the player he was, struggling for form, where his place for both Manchester United and England is questioned. He's been getting a bit of praise over the last 10 days or so, granted, but that's because he's been playing well.

To which I always reply: Fergie openly says in Managing My Life that United's refusal to spend big on star players from the continent had stopped the club winning more European Cups/CLs. What is that if not a tacit suggestion that the players he did have weren't good enough? This from *their manager*. He also writes about how he once threatened to resign if he wasn't given a contract that he felt reflected his worth. This is football, a business as much as a game. Players and managers play hardball to get more money. Rooney wasn't the first, and he won't be the last. Big deal.

Hmm. Well you can criticize him for things that haven't happened yet if you want.

I would have no problem with him being benched if the manager deems it best for the club. What I don't like is the blatant lack of objectivity that you get from some of his detractors. Constantly painting him as worse than he actually was/is, constantly attributing the most nefarious motives to him,  and generally using him as a scapegoat and whipping boy. It's an unpleasant tendency among all fanbases, including United's (in the past it's also been Cleverley, Young, Carrick, etc).

12955~~~
And yet, oddly, he's been better than Feli, Herrera, Morgan, and arguably an equally declining Michael Carrick and often injured Basti.

So are we just not a big hitter or is our midfield a state.

Don't get me wrong I think buying a top class CM is as big a priority as a RW. But I still imagine Rooney in the pairing or at 10. I genuinely believe he is a better all round midfielder than almost all of our current options.

Just because it's depressing doesn't stop it being true.

12956~~~
The biggest question mark over Rooney in midfield for Utd is his ego, starting and persevering with him when he has his mid season/start of the season slump whilst in midfield will be suicidal, its much easier to carry a badly out of form forward than a midfielder. If he accept this and accepts being rotated in and out of the side based on performances then he can be a useful member of the squad in midfield, if he is, as I suspect not going to accept that then getting rid would be best for both parties. Hopefully he can accept that, because although I think he will struggle against high quality midfields, he does appear to provide something we lack at the moment, the ability to break down teams that have come purely to defend.

12957~~~
Then we have very different opinions on where he is as a midfielder; I'd say he was only better than Fellaini and that really isn't much of a compliment.

If we were playing him at number ten I wouldn't mind much but, when playing deeper, I think you either need positioning or defensive skills (Carrick, Schneiderlin) or technique/mobility (BFS, Herrera). 

It seems to be that we're trying to shoehorn him in because of his name rather than what he brings to the team; despite the fact that it will harm us to do so.

12958~~~
He's played just 6 or 7 games in midfield, being good in just half of them and pretty much every of those "good" games he was actually good for about 45 minutes, he could hardly connect good 90 minutes.

For example, against Everton he had periods were he was terrible, they were counter attacking the shit out of us through our midfield and yet he's came out of that game like he had some cracking game, and I many here are giving example of that game like an argument that he can play in midfield, when in reality he was good just on highlights.

Schweinsteiger even in poor form was better than this, we actually looked like we have a midfield that can control the game when Schweinsteiger was there. Herrera of year before was much better than this too, so was even Blind from last year.

I don't rate Fellaini though, nor Schneiderlin, but if he can replicate Southampton's form he is better than Rooney in midfield, but they aren't same position anyway. 

Comparing his just best games to our players out of form isn't fair.

12959~~~
Do you watch us regularly? Did you watch us from August-January when he was at his worst and every performance was glossed over or ignored by commentators/pundits while they tried to pretend he was still brilliant? There were times he was giving the ball away and they would literally go silent while refusing to acknowledge he'd made a mistake. It's only recently he's started actually getting any sort of criticism and even then it was noteworthy as "the media finally starting to turn on him". What happens then? A few half decent performances and he's reinvented himself as the key midfielder which they were only too happy to buy into. We're back where we started.

Don't care about other people playing hardball. I'm talking about Wayne Rooney, how he handled it and how he can be expected to handle it again. He lost a certain amount of trust. He demanded better players the first time, then used better players as excuse the second time when he was "angry and confused" at Moyes saying RVP was his best striker. He has shown he's not above destabilising the team/manager to further his own ends and again that has lost him trust. Does it apply to other players? Yes.  But we are talking about Rooney specifically and it's one of several factors for some fans feeling he is detrimental to Manchester United.

I used his past behaviour when not getting what he wants to point out why people might be reluctant to trust him to handle not getting what he wants any better in the future.

Why do you care? If his detractors are so wrong about him then it shouldn't bother you. You're not going to change anyone's mind on him at this point. My post was to highlight some of the reasons why a lot of his detractors are frustrated with the situation and venting. His fans really shouldn't be bothered as they are getting what they want. If you don't like seeing him criticised then don't read it, you're not going to force people to stop criticising him because you feel it's unfair.

I've probably seriously fecked up the formatting of this and I'm dreading hitting post reply.

12960~~~
This is just where we will always differ (until he maybe gets even worse!)

I think Rooney has always shown great defensive capabilities, that has been exhibited as a striker, 10, left midfielder and CM, and I don't just mean the one gut busting run back to left back to put in a slide tackle or a goal line clearance, I think he is very hardworking and tactically astute and pretty much always has been. So I think he gives only slightly less protection than Carrick/Morgan (on their good days) certainly more than the statuesque elbower and Hererra, whom I'm a big fan of.

Similarly whilst not as mobile as he was he still offers enough for me, easily capable of playing box to box. In terms of technique I think only Carrick has a better passing range actually going forward, Hererra plays a different way, very pass and move which I love but unfortunately only really Mata seems to be on his wavelength in that regard and it just never really works for him.

I think from Midfield Rooney gives more attacking threat than Basti, both in his passing and his arrivals in the box, though i agree Basti is more experienced in really dictating a game.

I think we lack a first choice midfield, they all do little bits, but not others so you have to pick and choose and it's all debatable, for me out of the 4 or 5 of them Rooney combines most of the qualities I want in a CM though does lack a few, however it's worth bearing in mind he's probably only played 20-30 games there if even. Testament to his overall quality and versatility.

Still want a CM bought and think Rooney should be at 10, and shouldn't be on the pitch if he's playing like he did the first half of the season.

12961~~~
This sounds right, he must accept being treated just like any other player based on form not status (captain privilages).

What's the worst is that, atm, he looks better option in midfield than the 'real' midfielders Herrera, Bastian, Morgan who all were shocking last year. But I really hope it's just down to LVGs rigid system, no their true ability.

Rooney still has a role to play within this team, but not then main one like he's used to and the sooner he accepts that the better for all parties involved!

12962~~~
If we're picking out the best performance seen in midfield from individual games and forgetting about consistency or fitness, then BFS was comfortably the highest quality performer last season. He had feck all competition mind. Simply strolling around against Liverpool at Old Trafford early on in the season was as good as any midfielder did all season under Van Gaal.

Rooney came in to midfield near the end when Van Gaal had practically gave up enforcing his system and things started loosening up.

12963~~~
The system was shit alright, but Martial and Rashford still managed to perform in that system. If your going to attribute Rooney scoring 5? League goals in all 2015 then I frankly don't know where to start

12964~~~

Yes, I watched pretty much every game, and said he'd been poor whenever he was. I'll dig up the posts if you really want me to.

I also followed a lot of the post-game media coverage, in which you would find articles like:

<span style="font-family: 'Tahoma'"><span style="font-size: 12px">
There are loads more where those came from. This idea that he gets praise no matter how he plays, that he's an untouchable Golden Boy, is lazy, cliched nonsense. It is demonstrably false, and a narrative that is itself part of the anti-Rooney agenda

And as I said, exactly the same could be argued of Fergie circa the release of 'Managing My Life'. But both subsequently re-settled into their roles. However, if the club do decide he's becoming irredeemably detrimental to the prospect of footballing success, they'll boot him out. It's that simple. Until then, i'm going to support him, not bitch and whine over every transgression, real or imagined, current or ancient history.

(Although what I will point out is that both LvG and Hodgson have recently said that it's Rooney's professionalism, his dedication to the team and the role allotted to him, that sets him apart, and have praised him highly for it)

Of course not. Although this thread, over the last 2 years or so, has become an endless torrent of Rooney bashing. That's about 70% what it is. And i'd say it's those who are the most vociferous in criticising him - generally the same few names, over and over again - who are quick to try and shout down any praise or defence of him themselves.


</span></span>

12967~~~
<span style="font-family: 'Tahoma'"><span style="font-size: 12px">One was a series of tweets from randomers, one ended with the caveat that LVG let Rooney down, one was talking about the burden being too much because we didn't sign any other strikers and the other was Di Canio saying he's on the decline. Scathing.

Yet before, after and during every match, no matter what happens we are force fed the line he is great. He will a float a ball out to the wing and the commentators will react like he's just shot a stream of pixies out of his arse to put on a magical air display. When he tries the same thing and pumps the ball straight out of play or fails to control a pass they will go quiet or change the subject. It happens time and time again.

And as I said I don't care what other managers or players have done with their contracts or how they behaved. This thread is about Rooney. How can they boot him out when they caved and gave him that massive deal?

LVG also thought that Rooney should be allowed to decide the fate of the kitchen staff and that Marcus Rojo should be allowed on the pitch. He was a stupid, stupid man. If Rooney's so professional then why was it a big story when he turned up for pre-season training actually fit a couple of seasons ago? If he's so dedicated why does it take him so long to get going when he's been out? Why was he refusing to play midfield?

</span></span>It's the internet. What did you expect? People have opinions and they are going to voice them. So about 70% of this thread is people not liking a man as much as you do, what's the problem? I've not really noticed people trying to shout down praise but maybe I just missed it. I've seen some people exasperated by it because they don't feel he's earned it and it's their right to feel that way.

This entire debate is pointless. My initial post was trying to help the people annoyed by the Rooney "hate" see why a lot of people are so frustrated, I wasn't saying anyone is wrong for feeling different. Yet you got defensive about it. Why? He's a millionaire and we are all strangers on the internet with opinions, he doesn't need protected from it. This isn't a Wayne Rooney universal praise thread, people have opinions negative and positive. If you only want the positive then maybe you should create a Wayne Rooney praise thread. It won't end well, but that's because people have different opinions and they will air them on a forum. Getting annoyed by it isn't good for you. I dunno why people are getting all annoyed at other people thinking differently. If you know who the people are that are always negative and you don't want to read the negativity then block them or don't read their posts. It's not a massive deal and no one is going to change opinion on him over the summer, but people do have a right to not only feel negative towards him, but to express it. Even if it is 70% of this thread, so be it, that's how people feel.

Edit: I dunno what's happened to the font size, but I couldn't be arsed fixing it and I'm leaving it the way it is even if makes me look like I'm Nicolas Cage talking at random volumes.

</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 12px">
I realise you're probably exaggerating for rhetorical effect, but . . . well, Wayne Rooney has actually been a pretty damn good player over the years. And he's capable of very good play even now. Perhaps that's why he gets a degree of respect from commentators. When he does play well, and do something good, he's liable to get praised - and perhaps he plays well a bit more often than some will allow.

And perhaps that's why what praise he does get sounds like ridiculous 'bias'. Because they <i>themselves</i> are the biased ones. And while commentators see a player still capable of moments of real quality - there have been loads of them even this season -  they apparently see a donkey who contributes nothing but aimless balls out to the ring wing.

And if Mourinho plays him regularly, no doubt he'll be a 'stupid, stupid' man as well. All these top managers are idiots, and the boo boys are right. If only they could see it.

Yes, and your initial post made at least one blatantly unsupportable accusation, which I have tried to correct. 

</span></span>

12969~~~
RVP not winning the league with Fenerbahce proves nothing. Defoe was horrid in the MLS and managed to score 14 goals this season in the Premier League. It's all about the team you're playing in and the way I see it is, RVP had more than enough left in the tank to play at United. People say he had a bad season last season and yet he still managed to get into double figures and score some worldies along the way.

If Rooney not scoring was Van Gaal's fault, then how come Rashford was the solution? He was managed by Van Gaal and he could score.

Face it, Rooney's just fecking past it. That's why England are playing him in CM now. He's officially our Stevie G. Undroppable and accommodated. We'll be playing him in CDM next so the commentators can cream themselves over those wonderful cross-field balls to Valencia on the right wing.

I fear for Jose's job if he sticks by him through thick and thin like Van Gaal did. I want Mourinho to be a success here but it's just not gonna happen if he builds the team around Rooney. And the board never wanted Mourinho here in the first place, so they won't hesitate to kick him out if the results aren't coming in.

12970~~~
Defoe scoring 14 goals proves nothing, each player to it's own, RVP was done with the club as a whole the moment Fergie left so letting him go was good decision.

When did I say he's not past it? It's plain obvious too see and if we want to move forward as a club then Rooney should lose all his privilages and play only if deserves that.

But he's not sole problem that we didn't win the league no matter what you think, that's only reason I've responded for yours 'should've kept RVP, probably would win the league' nonsense.

12971~~~
To be fair, you are both right, the print media are more open to criticising him, especially the past 12 months, but TV pundits, usually ex players almost to a man refuse to do so.

As for the argument that managers know best, usually......yes. But let's not forget successive managers played Gerard and lampard together in a two, many managers played Emile hesky as a forward despite not being able to hit a cows arse with a banjo, several managers managed Chelsea of their own free will despite that meaning being in close proximity to Adolf terry, Gordon strachan signed Ali dia.............

12972~~~
Martial and Rashford have most definitely not put that argument to bed. But the argument in general is in the past and thankfully with the sacking of Van Gaal the argument was put out of it's misery and a lot of the <i>blame </i>(or cohesion issues I would prefer to say) can be forgotten and we can move on to a manager who knows how to coach attacking teams in this environment. For the sake of what the numbers say, they are listed below courtesy of transfermarkt.

<b>at CF</b>: Rashford scored 8 in 18 (all comps). Easily the best return of the three, but don't forget Van Gaal let slip that he was basically "dropped" for not playing the position properly (in his eyes) for the game against Norwich.
<b>at</b> <b>CF</b>: Martial scored 4 in 20 (all comps). Although played out wide left, a much MUCH better position for him proved to be fruitful and basically destroy any hope of Memphis making the starting lineup on the left.
<b>at CF: </b>Rooney scored 9 in 23 (all comps). Not really that dissimilar to Rashford in all honesty.

It was just not a good attacking mix of players last season and coached in an unproductive way, from Moyes to Van Gaal we played 13 different players up front and none bar an 18yo raw Rashford stood out.

My comment was that I was skeptical of Rooney's decline when the timeframe was three years and I flat out disagree with you that it could be as long as six years ago. Six years, 2010, when Rooney was 24. It warrants no further discussion on the matter.

12973~~~
Except Rashord scored goals vs top 6 teams and Rooney didn't. Rashford  scored 2 vs Arsenal, 1 vs Cty and 1 vs Wham (FA Cup) and his goals made all the difference in these games. Rooney's goals came mostly against poor teams. Context matters.

12974~~~
Context does matter, if you can't get on the park through injury then you sure as hell won't be scoring goals another guy has the opportunity to score. (Not to mention Van Gaal's non existent policy on player rotation.)

12975~~~
You say Rashford and Rooney had about the same rate as if it's nothing. Why does an 18 year old, who hadn't played a top flight game until 2016 have a better record than Rooney? The  captain, highly experienced, undroppable. Surely that should ring some alarm bells. I've not even mentioned the difference in who they scored against.

Look you blamed Rooney's lack of goals on LvG. Yet both Rashford and Martial (not sure why you discounted his goals from LW) given their age and experience found goals pretty easy to come by. How do you explain this?

12976~~~
Well, yes. The manager was sacked come the end of the season and a new one appointed.

12977~~~
Ah you're just dodging now.

I asked why did Rooney struggle so badly to score as a centre forward until January yet Rahford found it relatively easy. One's the captain with massive experience, the other we'd barely heard of. Never had a top flight game. Why doesn't that make you question Rooney's performances?

12978~~~
Rooney fans love to come up with misleading stats and when you explain them that they are misleading, they avoid a proper discussion. Happens all the time on here.

12979~~~
I've explained it before, it was also outlined when <a class="username" data-user="65492, @NessunDorma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65492/">@NessunDorma</a> posted on this page.

Ultimately, the archetype CF role in the team for Van Gaal was essentially to stand up front and occupy the CB's and barely touch the ball and not get involved. Hence why I made reference to the comments that Van Gaal made in the wake of the Norwich game on the United website. "You see in the games, Marcus is not doing the things he did in his first match or second match anymore." ie. He's breaking from the archetype system "because he is tired". Which in my opinion was an outright dig at the way Rashford was playing (ie. Not the archetype role). I also think that at 6'1" with a larger frame and youthful speed he was more suited to the hold up role than Rooney (who in all my years of watching him has never looked comfortable playing in the same type of role.)

If you want one player in our squad to play the archetype role in both performance and in terms of all-round professionalism then you would look no further than Rooney. If you tell him to drink the kool-aid, he drinks it right up, including standing about up front doing sweet nothing for the first half of the season. This is probably why I am happy to let Mourinho sort him out and I feel comfortable with the feeling of how I think he will use Rooney and I am not particularly worried. I never thought Van Gaal's type of football would work in England, I am not surprised it ended with so few chances created, shots created and ultimately goals scored.

I am happy for a manager who has won the league in this country multiple times recently with a style of football not to dissimilar to Sir Alex Ferguson's to give him one last shot before we get rid of him.

12980~~~
Honestly the lengths you guys go to in order to avoid saying he just didn't play well.

Two kids, one playing left wing, one who didn't make a competitive appearance till 2016 both outscored Rooney. Rooney the highly experienced, undroppable, captain. All three playing for the same manager under the same tactics. You still don't question Rooney at all, instead you blame LvG. It's just baffling.

12981~~~
I've not mentioned anything about how he played, because that wasn't the original discussion. The original discussion was that it is a team game and when you look deeper into the nuts and bolts of the system and how players were performing as individuals then there is a strong case that no forward under Van Gaal was able to score consistently because the amount of chances were low, this figure didn't magically rise with any particular player to a level that the data suggested the way the team was coached wasn't a major impact. (Hence me refuting that the claim had been put to bed with the stats.)

It seems the goalposts have now shifted to you wanting me to come out and say Rooney is shite and agree with you. But I do not, if you would like me totell you he didn't play well then fine, he didn't really play well. I don't really think he was here nor there and certainly not as bad as it was made out on here and generally accepted as gospel by many. I was never really expecting much from him because expecting a 5'8" forward who excels with the ball at his feet and facing goal was never going to do much playing with his back to goal as a hold-up forward. Even Martial struggled and was moved to the left where he was much better with the ball facing goal and he could use his pace and dribbling ability to create from the left. (Whether it was natural selection or evolution is an entirely different argument).

Two kids? Or one kid? As far as I am aware, Martial lead all scorers with 18 in all competitions. Rooney's 15 goals was higher than Rashfords 6. Maybe it isn't just the <i>Rooney fans </i>that come up with misleading stats eh? I think we can all agree that Van Gaal is done and dusted and lets see what Mourinho can and will do with him, there were signs of flickering life at the back end of the season and have been signs through the Euro's so far. I'll trust the coach and his decisions over the vociferous baying for his blood from the fans. But that is just my two pennies.

12982~~~
As always when you have zero to offer to the argument. I think most fair minded people would say 2009/10 was the last season Rooney was excellent and one of the genuine elite players and strikers in Europe from start to finish. Although the WC in S.Africa seemed to be the turning point. Anyone saying he's been favourably compared to Europes best strikers since then is just wearing their rose-tinted glasses. He hasn't had that recognition in a long, long time.

He of course has had good moments since, perhaps even some of his best matches in isolation and goals, but taking entire seasons into consideration you see an undependable striker for a top side. Ferguson knew what was up towards the end.

Just to clarify something: I'm not saying I think Rooney has been shite since 2010. I'm saying since 2010 I have seen a gradual decline in his average performance - which believe it or not is usually an indicator of a players genuine worth. I think as a combination of his physical strengths diminishing and certainly since Ferguson left, a real lack of accountability for his performances.

Only in the last couple of seasons have I seen a rapid deterioration in his 'bottom' performances - to an extent he wouldn't look out of place in the Championship at times.

12983~~~
I would bold this entire post but the part that I did frames it rather well.

12984~~~
"vociferous baying for his blood"

I just asked does two young, highly inexperienced players producing a better scoring rate not alarm you. 

Your argument is that LvG's penchant for asking his striker to occupy the centre backs and hold the ball up suits the younger lads better. That you can't expect anything of Rooney under such instruction.

Mate that's a big part of any No.9's job. It was the same under SAF, it'll be the same under Mourinho. It's like saying a keeper shouldn't be expected to deal with high balls.

It's not that LvG's tactics suited the pace and agility of the younger lads. Football in general suits those attributes.

12985~~~
I'm outrageously going to write even more about Rooney's performances. He played yesterday for 40 mins against Slovakia. 

I thought he was less effective in a role higher up and more to the left than in the last two games. He struggled more with connecting the forward passes to teammaates, though it should be mentioned that Slovakia sat tight against an England resting players, and the same went for all of his fellow coubtrymen with Sturridge a notable exception on a few occasions. I thought Rooney increased the intensity and ball tempo after he came in, and improved the corners, without it being enough to open up a disciplined Slovakia clearly content with a    draw. 

A typical 6 of 10 performance, probably the best performer in midfield on the night, though Dier could also get that accolade considering his tasks.

12986~~~
Dier was man of the match by a landslide.

12987~~~
Considering his meagre attacking contribution/role against a deep-sitting Slovakia, I think landslide is excessive, but I won't dispute your MoM call.

(Btw I commend you on commenting the actual game at hand, although it wasn't actually about Wayne Rooney's performance.  ... <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> )

12988~~~
You did and I answered that. No, the manager was not coaching the attack correctly as a whole unit. I have more (full) trust in Mourinho to sort that out and that caveat goes to many of the players in our squad in various positions. I share a similar stance on had Van Gaal stayed and Rooney would be played as a striker and not behind the front striker I would have just said get rid, there is no point. LVG's coaching does not suit a player like Rooney playing at 9.

That is why I have tried to segregate Rooney's versatility to the role that LVG was asking him (and many, 12 different strikers), it ties into my understanding that asking a guy who rarely played as a hold up striker and is 5'8" doesn't suit tactics that don't allow for him to flourish. I don't agree it was the same under SAF, SAF rarely had his forwards facing the ball and not occupying either various roles for their versatility or having them drop off and face goal a lot more which suits Rooney a lot more. (Something LVG was happy to flat out drop players for.)

I don't think it will be the same under Mourinho either, but I have gone over that. I think Rooney will play behind the front striker and will get much more active support in Mourinho's system than any player ever received for Van Gaal. I reiterate that I am just happy that the type of football we played under LVG is now gone, wipe the slate clean and see what Mourinho does.

12989~~~
Please, please don't let us go into the season with him in the starting lineup!

12990~~~
Why he has played ok in cm this tournament I think he has done well

12991~~~
What are you talking about? It's not his fault that Iceland are pressing him and exposing his lack of agility when in tight areas, it's their fault for not allowing him just to stroll around playing passes.

12992~~~
I don't have the energy to criticise him anymore.

12993~~~
I dont think there is a palyer in the history of football who would come from being one of the best and most exciting footballers in the world to one of the worst in the league. He's absolutely pointless, he has no skills to play as midfielder and that is one of the last possible positions for him to play as his pace is all gone either.. I say it again he needs to go, I cant stand him on the pitch, he will destroy another season

12994~~~
I thought he had done alright in the first half. Then again when England are losing it does tend to be put on Rooneys shoulders.

12995~~~
How dare they...

12996~~~
Midfield general, laughable that people actually rate him as a midfielder. Scholes back from retirement would be better.

12997~~~
its Iceland

12998~~~
How dare I suggest that Rooney isn't at the heart of the loss, when he scored and Hart has done the biggest howler of the tournament so far.

12999~~~
Nah his biggest competition has been Hart and Walker

13000~~~
Don't indulge <a class="username" data-user="98285, @Dec9003" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/98285/">@Dec9003</a> attempts to distract from his performance. Nobody's blaming Rooney for the entire team performance, others have been equally as poor.

What I can't believe is how placid he is these days. Of course as he got older you'd expect some maturity, for him to calm down. Not to this extent though. He's gone to far the other way. He and the team need some bite and aggression. Right now he makes Carrick look like a hothead.

13001~~~
Those people who think he has done alright as a CM should at least explain why England's movement/rotation of the ball and passing out of midfield have been so poor at this tournament.

13002~~~
Exactly.

13003~~~
Don't expect from him too much. If Jose won't kick him in the arse, nobody will.

13004~~~
He's been awful in this match

13005~~~
State of that post, I'd delete it before anyone sees it if I were you. 
I'm not rooneys mum I have no reason to distract from his performance.

13006~~~
He has been so lackluster. Lost the ball so many times with half-arsed passes up the field which could have been costly against a better counter attacking team. He's so average.

13007~~~
Just awful.

13008~~~
This guy shouldn't be a starter for us next season. It's going to be hard dropping him though due to his name and media support

13009~~~
With just your second sentence you're suggesting the entire performance is being blamed on Rooney. Nobody here has said that. Not even hinted at it. So I'd leave that thought where it belongs.

13010~~~
He's been beyond terrible. England and Uniteds best midifelder, apparently.

13011~~~
No defending him tonight from me, if Jose is watching, he'll be lucky to be on the bench.

13012~~~
Imagine Rooney starting for us in midfield next season. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

13013~~~
He plays like he's 45y old not 30.

13014~~~

13015~~~
Bar a decent first half against a poor Russian side Rooney is having a crap Euro's.

13016~~~
He's been awful but in fairness, he's got some tough competition if we're talking in terms of England's worst player tonight - but he is a candidate.

13017~~~
Loses it again!

13018~~~
I really hope Mourinho has the balls to push him out of the first team but I just cant see it. Moyes giving him that 5 year contract was an awful decision, left us with a huge problem to fix

13019~~~
Dreadful from him. Overcooked passes, not tricky enough to get out jail when bodies are in and around him. He'll want this game back.

13020~~~
he is sinking 2nd half

13021~~~
Just cant believe that people actually think that he's good enough to start for us, the guy is mediocre at best in everything he does.

13022~~~
He's fecking pathetic these days. Painful to watch.

13023~~~
Absolute rubbish again. It's going to be depressing and a source of much arguing amongst fans, watching him stinking up our midfield next season. Let's hope Jose has the balls to drop him.

13024~~~
Yup, probably the most catastrophic decision since Fergie left.

13025~~~
I pray to god some Chinese club comes in for him. The thought of him being our captain and main man next season makes my blood boil. He doesn't even look remotely good enough.

13026~~~
Rooneys nightmare and a lackluster frontline is a disaster. 
Look at that volley attempt ffs.

13027~~~
He can barely stand up on his own.

13028~~~
He is having a mare

13029~~~
Shapes to shoot, stands on ball, loses it.

13030~~~
Absolute shocker. Really falling apart under pressure.

13031~~~
Midfield general my arse

13032~~~
Very bad tonight.

13033~~~
stop the fight. stop the fight

13034~~~
The saddest part is that this isn't even his worst performance of the season either. Aston Villa away.

13035~~~
I'm not suggesting it I'm stating it outright. It happens all the time and it'l happen again when England inevitably go out. 
You're blinkered if you don't think people are using England being a bit shite to fulfil their negative bias against Rooney though. That's coming from one of the only people who thought he'd struggle before the season just gone started.

13036~~~
Midfield general my arse

13037~~~
When the hollywood balls fail there's not much else in his game.

13038~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13039~~~
so bad... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

13040~~~
that crossed my mind a few mins ago, its getting there if continues

13041~~~
It's by distance the worst individual performance of the tournament so far this second half.

13042~~~
Hope Jose's watching this.

13043~~~
Putting the "midfield general" into "in midfield, generally shit".

13044~~~
If England go out tonight the media will hopefully realise what the vast majority of United fans have known for ages - Rooney is finished as a top class player. No more defending the shit he has been serving up.

13045~~~
How anyone can state he should be in our starting 11 is beyond me. A great servant for United but its time to move on.

13046~~~
it will be really interesting seeing players ratings tomorrow

13047~~~
Why can't he retire instead. Said it before but United need to sell him if we are to be successful.

13048~~~
Just about to post this, now can all the Rooney midfield lovers just stop, he is a horrendous there, and will be a chain around our neck next season if he is given a stating role.

Substitute striker, or he has to go.

13049~~~
I've not caught the second half because I'm having tea. England in general have been shite though they're too slow to break a packed defence down. 
Rooney is certainly someone we need to start taking out the side to upgrade but he wouldn't be the first on my list like many on here.

13050~~~
Sad part is he's still our captain and will most probably be in the starting XI

13051~~~
Here's Chris Waddle from the bbc.

"Daniel Sturridge has gone out of the game. Wayne Rooney is doing everything. He's the only one demanding the ball. Iceland are very comfortable at the moment."

Nothing is going to change. Rooney will stink up Old Trafford as usual next season.

13052~~~
You're all pathetic. He's not a midfielder, he's a striker. It's all Roy's fault for playing him in midfield when he should be up front banging them in from all angles. He's a legend! Leave him alone! It's not him! It's the lack of movement around hi<span style="color: #ffffff"><span style="color: #000000">m! <span style="color: #ffffff">White text!</span></span></span>

13053~~~
The English Rojo.

13054~~~
Last game in an England shirt imo.

13055~~~
Crazy stuff. Even tonight, after this performance, it's not possible to say he's been poor without it being a negative bias.

Tell you what. When we get knocked out you show me some evidence of the entire performance being blamed on Rooney.

13056~~~
He's average as they come. No need to be over the top but he's ordinary now at best.

United show be showcasing better footballers. Should be squad player status, if he must stay.

13057~~~
PLEASE SELL HIM FFS!

13058~~~
ahh the 'he demands the ball' angle

13059~~~
3 more years left <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

13060~~~
Just thinking about him playing for us next season makes my blood boil. Hate the sight of him in a United shirt now.

13061~~~
Like Gerrard, Rooney will live on his reputation for a couple more years before his decline can no longer be ignored by even the most blinded and diehard of fans. Until then we'll have to put up with his miserable performances.

13062~~~

13063~~~
Something tells me we aren't going to consider selling him until he becomes the club's top goalscorer. Only 5 more goals until that's the case however. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

13064~~~
Ease up with the agenda guys! We know he needs 4 to 6 months warm up before each tournament or competition to hit form. The Euros came too early.

13065~~~
Welcome to the club. He should have left in 2013. Stupid Moyes bent over for him and now United are bending over for him. Hope Jose gets him kicked out of the club.

13066~~~
10 minutes ago. He's misplaces two more passes since this tweet.

13067~~~
You take what I say and exaggerate it to the point where you're not even answering to what I'm saying.
He's been poor tonight of course but that doesn't mean there isn't a section of posters who will go out of their way to suggest he's a crap footballer when he obviously isn't. 
Why would I? I don't need to prove myself to you mate.
It'l be there though. The media will most likely be all over him.

13068~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Genuinely the worse performance iv seen from him in his career.

13069~~~
Was starting up a game of FM thinking of pushing Rooney into the midfield, and then I saw Rooney's performance today. Time to bump him up to #1 on my unwanted list.

13070~~~
He's actually been subbed. Shocking.

13071~~~
Hope Mourinho watched this and called Ed or Agent 47 or something.

13072~~~
Diabolical today, as other players in England shirt. But as a captain he should have rallied his teammates.

13073~~~
I think this is even worse than the Aston Villa fiasco. He's really taken the cake today.

13074~~~
I've only just turned it back on and he's come off
Was he that bad?

13075~~~

13076~~~
He's gonna waltz into this position for us next season as well. I reckon a petition to get him out of the team would get more signatures than the brexit second reforendum.

13077~~~
He's been crap for years.

13078~~~
I hope the media finally start to give him shit. 

Chance would be a fine thing though, he's too well connected.

13079~~~
You know when he's at his absolute worst?

13080~~~
That's really poor. 
I wonder if he will retire from international football now. It's never gonna happen for him.

13081~~~
Yes. Yes he was. He was atrocious.

13082~~~
Easilly the worst midfielder in the tournament, even minnows midfielder traps pass and hold the ball better than him

13083~~~
That's the worst I've ever seen him play

13084~~~
Simply awful in the 2nd half.

13085~~~
Was it August until Christmas level of shite just in the middle instead of upfront. 
As good as he can be on his day he's certainly capable of pulling out some of the worst performances of a 'top footballer'

13086~~~
Not excusing Rooney, but imo, against Iceland Alli was too far foward. It's like no proper connection between midfield and attacking 3rd. Rooney was wank though, he should be ashamed of himself for not being a 'general' he should be.

But to say he is finished at United is ott. He still has a role here and I'm sure Mourinho will not adhere to his bad performance like LVG.

13087~~~
Seriously, we will struggle to finish 4th with him as our starting midfielder. Doesn't matter how many attacking stars we buy if he's there to slow everything down and lose the ball at will.

13088~~~
Awful from him tonight. No way can he be our midfielder next season

13089~~~
It'l be interesting if Mourinho was watching. He's been brilliant for us but if he suddenly decides he's a midfielder and then pulls out pretty decent performances at his best and just awful at his worst then it's probably time for him to lose that God status he has at United in terms of getting picked every week. 
Not that I can see that happening though

13090~~~
Hopefully tonights performance will let people see what a liability he has become and the media won't go mental when he is dropped

13091~~~
Remember when the thought of starting another season with David Moyes as manager kind of put you off football? that's how I feel about Rooney starting in midfield for us.

13092~~~
Watch him start every game for United from now!

13093~~~
Ah yes. Someone else's fault again. FFS.

13094~~~
But.....but.....it's the tacticS/manager/pitch/weather/brexit/ etc etc

13095~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> For all the people shocked at his performance tonight, don't be. This was what he was serving up for more than half the season.

13096~~~
Scholes in midfield has more talent in his left testicle than the whole of Rooney.

13097~~~
Unbelievable that he was on the pitch till the 85th minute. Shocking stuff from Hodgson (and Rooney for that matter).

13098~~~
Haha you guys twist yourself in knots trying to defend the impossible.

13099~~~
Absolutely dreadful tonight.

13100~~~
Should retire from Internationals, no point anymore.

13101~~~
Absolutely shocking.

This is the guy we are hoping to unlock defences and dictate tempo next year? Have a bloody laugh.

13102~~~
That was shockingly bad. 

He can't be consistent even over 2-3 games, his fans want him to play central role at United <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> 

Hopefully Mou has watched and is ready to move for new CMs.

13103~~~
I've hated him with a passion for the last 2 years

Sell or just plain Sack the Cnut, he's shit upfront and even shitter in midfield he will be a constantly dragging us down next season.

13104~~~
Edited

13105~~~
So predictable. 

Said it before and I'll say it again, what Mourinho does with Rooney is the single biggest factor in how successful he will be at United. Will he see what the fans see or will he follow Moyes, Van Gaal and Hodgson and doom himself to failure.

13106~~~
International retirement time I think.

13107~~~
Hahaha Dutch pundit ripping into Rooney "he cant do anything anymore, why does he even play"

13108~~~
He's been one of England's better players this tournament, but beyond shocking tonight. He just looked like he was finished.

It was like watching Neville vs West Brom.

13109~~~
One decent half against a piss poor Russia and he was being lauded to high heaven. What we've seen since is the level Rooney is really at these days. No range of passing or appreciation of what ball to play.

He was also knackered by about the 60th minute.

13110~~~
My take on it as well. We can throw money around as much as we want, as long as we let players like him that are clearly not good enough anymore be our main men we won't win shit.

13111~~~
Several months ago i wrote Roy Hodgson had the chance of going down with the likes of Terry Venables and Bobby Robson as a liked England manager if he had the bottle to drop Rooney in these Euros. As I predicted if he shoe horns Rooney into the side then he will come up short, he will be remembered in the same bracket as umbrella Steve or Turnip Taylor.
Please don't expect Rooney ever to be top draw in any midfield that's challenging.
His career has been in decline for some time now and if any one thinks he's going to be the main man in a Utd side is deluded.
We have got to move on and not keep hanging on to his former glories.

13112~~~
I must admit saying from what I saw of him in the second half was poor isn't my best attempt at "defending the impossible" 
You're very strange, Dobbs

13113~~~
Tell that the English

13114~~~
I take back this comment he was bad

13115~~~
Hype over reality. Has been for 3 or 4 years now. It's sad but it's true.

13116~~~
And to think Lahm, Ibra, Messi and possibly Aguero and Mascherano have quit internationals with the latter 3 thinking they can't hack it anymore!

13117~~~
I dont get why is anybody willing to to give him another chance as a striker he proved himself absolutely incompetent, it will be shoehorning again if he stays around no matter what role he plays. Even as a substitute we can do better, why him? he can play exhibition games. I don't actually think that based on his performances he would get into any team in the premier league as a starting player, he's been that bad and he still earns 300k per week being a captain, starting every game, absolute ridiculous situation we got into because of Dickhead dave

13118~~~
You didn't see him at all in the second half, you said as much. Yet your opinion switched from him doing alright in the first half to being poor. How does that happen?

Like I say, by defending him when there's no need, saying others are blaming the whole performance on him, to trying to appear to be neutral, you end up talking nonsense. Just call it as it is. Much simpler.

13119~~~
The difference between himself and these guys is that they still have so much to give at club level. 

If Rooney's international career is finished, it's the first step towards irrelevance for him. It makes him easier to drop at club level and that's a slippery slope.

13121~~~
They forgot to include 

1 Silent Domination

13122~~~
I saw him for a few minute then he came off for Rashford didn't he. 
Even still when you read on here he was shocking without a single poster disagreeing I don't even need to have seen him to understand he was poor in the second half. He was alright though in the first half, not brilliant mind you but certainly alright.  
Has anyone other than you actually said that people are blaming the "whole performance on him" in those words? I think you're a getting a bit hot and bothered over what I'm posting but I'm not actually meaning what you think I am.

13123~~~
Please retire from football Wayne. Not been good enough for a few years now

13124~~~
Lol, i did say he was wank. I didn't blame anyone in that post, it was just based on my observation.

13125~~~
Hopefully January at the latest then!

13126~~~
Shame we don't have Europa League qualifier against some small minnow side. He could still whack in 3 or 4 against them I'm sure.

13127~~~
Would 5 goals during pre-season count? <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/> Could feck him off before the first game of actual season then.

13128~~~
Yeah that would be great, don't preseason games count <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13129~~~
Beat me to it lol.

13130~~~
There were a few just as bad infact 10 more and big bad Joe wtf lol

13131~~~
I guess LvG was telling to let the ball role under his feet or bounce of his shins...<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13132~~~
Yeah right <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13133~~~
But he got a goal, therefore he's the best player we ever had and are lucky to have him!

13134~~~
Haha, that's the Caf logic. Play a 1/10 for 89mins, score a goal on the 90 and get bumped to an 8/10

13135~~~
somewhere within him there is a midfield gem


<span style="color: #ffffff">
or not :-D</span>

13136~~~
His career reminds me of Totti's at Roma and Italy. His diminishing performances are just making more problems for club and country. I hope Jose doesn't bow down to reputations and gutless analysts opinions on him and sorts the problem out as soon as possible.

13137~~~
If it's there, it's in his anus.

13138~~~
Fair enough. But Alli being too far up the pitch had nought to do with him making all the mistakes that he made.

13139~~~
Maybe if his hair transplant contains some of Iniestas. Slim pickings though.

13140~~~
I could even understand that people wanted to give him this last season one more chance as a forward, but I seriously think anyone who thinks he was ever good enough in midfield has no idea about football. Not saying I have, but it is so easy to see just from watching him in few games that he is never a midfielder, it is beyond me how so many people cannot see it.

13141~~~
See below. Is this not you saying Rooney is being blamed for the team's performance?


Having told another poster to not give this opinion any oxygen I've gone and done just that. I'll leave it there.

13142~~~
Let's hope Jose was watching that load of garbage

13143~~~
Not a good comparison. Totti played really rarely this year and even when he played he scored goals which helped Roma to secure them a CL spot.

13144~~~
Totti is also loved and respected by most Italians I think. Same cannot be said with Rooney.

13145~~~
It's funny going back to the start of this thread and all the talk was whether he was a 20 goal a season striker because that's what Van Gaal and Wayne were saying. Once Martial and Rashford started banging them in the he's really a midfielder excuse starting cropping up.

13146~~~
They not only think he is a midfielder. They think he can be a top midfielder and win Player of the season as a midfielder <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13147~~~
In years gone by England's woes have been pretty much blamed on Rooney it was more tongue in cheek than anything. Perhaps you're not intelligent enough to see that? I mean I can understand if that's the case, jokes are hard Dobbs<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

13148~~~
Woeful tonight but I'm gonna say it, he was decent in the first 2 group games. Dropping him for Slovakia was stupid but not an excuse for that performance.

13149~~~
This!!!!

That's what is so infuriating. This isn't a Gerrard or Shearer situation where there's a player clearly well past his best but they're a beloved legend so you don't want to get rid. 

Rooney is a deeply divisive player amongst the fanbase to put it mildly. Add to that he's absolutely fecking shit now and it's just baffling that we haven't got rid.

13150~~~
No way.
Are there any posts predicting this?

Rooney is a Championship level player, IMO. He may even be of a bottom 3 EPL level player, but certainly not of MUFC standard.
And how on Earth did he get into the England squad with so many other strikers who are proven to be better?
Yes, we know he can score a penalty which another player creates...but that's not good enough to play as England attacking midfielder or striker.
He is living off of past reputation and no manager has the guts to make the right decition.

LVG  basically got sacked because he put too much faith in Rooney's ability to score goals.
Yet Rooney is still lingering.

13151~~~
someone said after the Russia game he could be player of the season

13152~~~
<b>Stage 1</b>. He's a legend and should be afford the respect he deserves! He's still a 20 goal striker! 

<b>Stage 2. </b>He needs a run at number 9 to get his rhythm / He doesn't get enough service / The play style doesn't suit him 

<b>Stage 3. </b>Well he's really a midfielder and could end up being like Scholes. 

<b>Stage 4. </b>His team mates let him down / He can hit that one cross field pass / Scholes mk.II / Needs time to learn the role / Alli and Wilshere too far ahead of him / Too many defenders sitting deep

13153~~~
I'm not wanting to give another chance as a striker at all, but it is the lesser from the evils if he stays, a few sub appearances, and behind Ibra and Rashord in the pecking order, that's it.

Personally I'd rather we get some money back for him and flog him to China, but it's not going to happen.

13154~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/england-1-2-iceland-player-8295875#rlabs=1%20rt$category%20p$3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/footb...celand-player-8295875#rlabs=1 rt$category p$3</a>

Rooney's ratings. "Did all he could"

He got higher than Sturridge, despite Sturridge actually looking more like a professional footballer than Rooney. You can't make it up.

13155~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a joke. "Did what he could to get England going"

13156~~~
Really wouldn't be bothered to see Wayne move on now, he is a player in decline and is showing no sign off slowing the rate down. He isn't a midfielder, he shouldn't be get in to our midfield next season nor should he be a striker if we get our targets.

13157~~~
There's no back from this tonight, I've never seen him this bad and he shouldn't be anywhere near United squad let alone captain of it! Really hope Jose eases him out so he doesn't throw any tantrums and we get clean break. Pay the rest of his contract if needed and turn to the future, he's been great servant to the club, but my God his attempted dribbling tonight showed how far he's fallen. 

Who thinks that?

13158~~~
Motd live now and not one criticism about Rooney. Pathetic how much support he has got in the media.

13159~~~
This could be the final nail in his coffin tonight. He won't get a place in Jose's midfield. Absolutely garbage - hands down one of the worst performances I've seen from a player of supposed quality in my life.

13160~~~
My only hope for this tournament was for the English media to wake up and smell the coffee with regards to Rooney, to make it easier for Mourinho to Casillas/Mata him this season.

Apparently, since he can hit the Valencia pass, which Iceland also did several times tonight, he's the best midfielder ever and an English version of a Xavi/Iniesta hybrid. I hope Mourinho sells him to Scunthorpe.

13161~~~
He genuinely did, and that's what's so sad about his decline.

13162~~~
Said it before and I'll say it again. United will have trouble becoming a powerhouse again with him still in the squad.

I don't think Mourinho will do anything though... Could be another 2-3 years before united truly becomes great again

13163~~~
David fecking Moyes. This is his legacy. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

13164~~~
He's crap. Mourinho's comments about Rooney being England's best player really worry me. My hope is he does the right thing once he sees Wayne in training and sells him to China.

13165~~~
What if he sees him chip the keeper in training and decides he's fantastic and should play the way LVG did?

Actually that's something Mourinho is going to have to look at, the amount of privileges LVG gave Rooney like never being dropped and deciding on the canteen staff. Imagine walking in to discover someone has been given that amount of leeway and power, it could possibly feel daunting wrestling some of it away from him.

13166~~~
one of my highlights of last season that, interview and footage of a goal he scored in training

13167~~~
Said it before, has become our Gerrard. Really just want him to feck off.

13168~~~
Mouriniho will not arselick him. If he starts it's because the manager thinks he's good enough which is good enough for me. With England I know it's Woy having no balls.

13169~~~
One of Jose's most important decision. How does he handle this Rooney mess? 

He is still unanimously loved amongst most journalists and pundits - which I still cant understand.

13170~~~
Disgraceful performance by him, if that's what we should expect next season if he's to be played in midfield, then maybe this might not be the brightest idea.

13171~~~
Just proves what an amazing manager SAF was, managed to keep Rooney when he needed him and not tarnish the brand by losing him to Citeh.  And then, as soon as possible he got a better player (RVP) to replace him, dropped him and left it perfect for the next gaffer to start off his reign by kicking him out and showing who the new boss is.

Moyes responded by helping him get 250k a week for 5 years... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13172~~~
Fergy had literally done all the hard work needed to get Rooney out. But its the clubs Rooney was trying to leave to that have stopped it happening. I mean Moyes selling Rooney to Chelsea who then go on to win a league would have been seen as a huge error.

13173~~~

13174~~~

13175~~~
You're probably right. I was so sure LVG would be the same way (ie. not bowing down to him,) yet that sadly didn't appear to be the case.

13176~~~
this is why I'm not convinced that mourinho will drop rooney for good if he doesn't deliver.

13177~~~
Worst thing about him is he just doesnt look fit. Looks overweight, slow, and doesnt concentrate to do the simple things consistently. Mourinho has to tell him he will be a squad player and make rooney earn his spot in the team if he wants a starting spot. 

As it is, youngsters like rashford or even januzaj can do a lot more simply because they are fit to play and are quick. Rooney has good games now and then, but its not enough.

13178~~~
He will start under Jose.

It's how long that will last which is the question.

13179~~~
But not by the fans.

That makes it easier

13180~~~
I hope the man that ended Raul's career at Real Madrid when he arrived and later openly went to war with Iker Casillas hasn't mellowed too much.

13181~~~
This

13182~~~
Yep. Mourinho has previous of basically telling club legends when their time is done and just dropping them. Hopefully he does the same here. Rooney can still have a role, but it is at best a squad player and a sub. Starting him means you have to shoehorn him somewhere that we have better players, or more effective players, or simply players who are more fit. Herrera for example in midfield. Someone who doesn't have to worry about miscontrolling a simple pass and can pass it firmly and quickly.

13183~~~
I hope that Rooney doesn't have some clause which forces us to play him when fit in his contract.  <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

13184~~~
I have nothing, I was at the game. What a horror show, the entire team was dreadful. Get him back, get him rested, get him onto the Mourinho diet and get him ready to play behind the front striker next season. By far the worst game he's played this year, hope he can put all this Euro caper behind him. What an absolutely abhorrent way to cap off a tournament personally and for his country.

13185~~~
He's just not good enough and hasn't been for a while. I'm not even angry at Wayne anymore, if he's going to keep getting picked then it isn't his fault. The media need to stop protecting him and coaches/managers need to have the balls to not select him.

13186~~~
bingo. I wonder what LVG would be making of this

13187~~~
My Captain shall always play!

13188~~~
If we can't sell him, force him to retire from England and hire Giggs as his personal trainer. Your our only hope, Yogi Ryan.

13189~~~
Was poor tonight. But England's best player this tournament, or among the best. The entire team was at fault and not just him. Sure he was among the worse players, but surely blaming it all on him is a bit over the top

13190~~~
Fixed.

13191~~~
Agreed. He was bad last night but he definitely wasn't the only one but it is expected for Rooney to be the scapegoat because he's the biggest name in the team and he's the captain. He played well in the other games though can't take that away from him.

13192~~~
I think sometimes we overstate playing well. What did he actually do in the other games? If you mean he wasnt quite as bad as some of the other players in the team, then yes your probably right.

It's not about making Rooney a scapecoat. He is the captain of the National Team. He is expected to lead and deliver. He was abysmal last night.

13193~~~
I kinda agree. I'm a bit annoyed at myself for taking the anger out on a player who is a legend for us (but he's ruining his legacy now) but he should have been booted out the summer Sir Alex left. Instead we have had two weak managers who couldn't look beyond Rooney's status at the club - which ultimately led to their demise.

13194~~~
That makes no sense.

13195~~~
Your attachment to Rooney makes no sense either. United can't make progress with him, be it in midfield or attack. He <i>was</i> a great player. He<i> is</i> a hindrance <i>now.</i>

13196~~~
Kane was equally shocking but who wouldn't what him in a Utd shirt next season....

13197~~~
Kane's about 10 years younger and had a great season with Spurs. And had a great season before that. Spot the differences...

13198~~~
It only takes one game for the knives to come out again. Unsurprising really.

13199~~~
That was Kane's first International tournament....

13200~~~
One game? Rooney hasn't had <i>one</i> very good season over the last 4 years...He's been declinng for years and was absolutely atrocious in the first half of last season which pretty much costed United a CL spot. One game, eh?

13201~~~
That's not my point, my point is International performances aren't a reflection on your ability as a club player. England as a collective are poor but there are some quality English players. It's all about context...

13202~~~
I and many on here have always said how rubbish Rooney is. Yes he played 3/4 okay games in midfield but the gap between he and Scholes is huge, even when Scholes was 38! I hope this now ends any debate ot hioe that Rooney is the saviour. 

Rooney was an amazing talent 6 years ago. Quite frankly, he has been on the decline and rapidly since he was 24. Hes not even half the player he was back then. I jist hope the media get over there facination with him

13203~~~
Not sure what your point is? I'm saying let's not judge players purely based on international football.

13204~~~
My point is that Kane has been great in the PL, Rooney hasn't been great for years. People do not base their evaluation of Rooney only on last night but on his performances over the last 4 years.

13205~~~
Fergie did alot wrong in his last few years, But his evaluation of Rooney before he left was spot on. Unfortunately he was the only one with the balls to get shot of Rooney, The rest won't.

13206~~~
Rooneys bar is higher than Kane's. You can't compare them. Not saying he's been great but he's still better than 90% of English players in this country. Conversely you could argue that Kane should have been better as he was the form player where Rooney wasn't.

Age or tournament experience....Wales and Iceland players?

13207~~~
This, people have such low standards nowadays, that his useless ball retention, slow speed in thought, and the cross passes to the right are seen as playing well, that's beyond me.

13208~~~
Not sure what you talking about. It is obvious that any team would rather have Kane than Rooney. Rooney being better than most English players means feck all. This is United. Being better than most English players is not enough to be good for United.

13209~~~
Considering that there's an estimation of 8 million English men playing football in England then your statement sounds just about right. Close call though. 

As for Rooney's bar being higher than Kane's, that surely must be a joke. Despite being perhaps England's worst player this tournament, Kane has had two great seasons at club level. Rooney been abysmal for most part of six years now.

13210~~~
Well that's just plain bollocks

13211~~~
Was beginning to wonder when the Rooney we all know and love was going to reappear.

13212~~~
We haven't had one full season of an in form Rooney in four years.......Hardly one game, it just makes a change that I can find it funny because its England and not united that suffer.

13213~~~
Rooney can only play one position for Utd and that is as a number 10. He cannot play as a striker as the little pace he had has gone. Also I would prefer Martial, Ibra and Rashford all ahead of him there. He cannot play in a midfield 2 as he is far too slow on the ball, and when pressed his ball retention goes. I would prefer to have Schneiderlin, Schwensteiger, Herrera, Blind and Forsu Mensah all there instead of him. With that being said

Schneiderlin/CM
Mkhitarian Rooney Martial
Ibra

or
Schneiderlin/CM
RW Mkhitarian Martial
Ibra

I prefer the second option. Ibra likes to drop deeper and would end up taking the space that Rooney occupies. Neither of them have any pace. I would like to see us sign a pacy direct right winger like Sane

13214~~~
Lets call a spade a spade here, he isn't a good player anymore and certainly cannot be relied upon.

13215~~~
Yet the Rooney can still play number 10 myth endures...

13216~~~
28 Premier League apperances last season 8 goals and 6 assists. His stats resemble where his position currently is. Not quite a striker, not quite a creator. If the last 3 years of suffering with Moyes and Van Gaal has taught me is the time for sentiment is over. We need to be back challenging and winning the league. We stand a better chance to do that without him.

13217~~~
I get your point but you're on a United forum... do you really think the people here are judging Rooney based on a couple of games for England <a class="username" data-user="83071, @Wilson Litchmore" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83071/">@Wilson Litchmore</a> <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/><img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

13218~~~
Yeah people criticising Rooney are doing so off one bad game, and actually it was appalling rather than just bad, for England.

Not the at least 4 seasons now of increasingly shit performances for Utd.

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

13219~~~
He played the vast majority of games up front. 
He only moved into midfield towards the end of the season.

13220~~~
Spare us the crap. It's not as if he's been putting in consistent top level performances. On the contrary, he's been subpar for the majority of the last 3 seasons now, and that's putting it nicely. You're surprised the knives come out after one game? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13221~~~
Surley hes going to lose the captaincy. Probably should follow Messi lead and retire as well from the international team

13222~~~
The worst part is Rooney still thinks he can play for a couple of more years but his performance suggest otherwise. I think He should be sold.

13223~~~
Not really, the whole team has been shuffled around in order to fit him in, and when it really counts he vanishes. Playing 3 in midfield against a team that are going to park the bus to accommodate such a hot and cold player as Rooney is madness. He should be on the bench, coming on as an impact player for both England and United.

It's myopic to look at Rooney's performances in isolation, of course he looks good occasionally, the whole team is geared around him even though it disrupts the natural game of the players that surround him. Alli is a notable example in my mind of someone who's looked poorer playing alongside Rooney. He's essentially Gerrard Mk 2,  a headless chicken whose inclusion stops England looking like a much more cohesive team.

It's only three months ago since England beat Germany, admittedly it was a friendly, but if I was English I'd have much preferred to have seen Vardy and Kane both playing over three in midfield in this tournament. England shouldn't be messing around trying to play Spanish football, they have youthful, pacey players and an abundance of strikers. As a neutral it really annoys me, because there's potentially a really entertaining team there. 

Three in midfield against teams that park the bus and high possession with a low amount of chances, sounds just like United, guess who the common link is!

13224~~~
The Rooney Defence Force are struggling with this one.

13225~~~
Majority of us here keep saying that Rooney is done as top player for years now. But how come the media in UK still think that he is still good. I couldn't think one but only Stan Collymore who actually did said that Rooney was done. Others than him keep repeating the same shit. New Scholes my arse.

13226~~~
Orwell, 1984.The media are creating a parallel world in which Rooney is still a top player.

13227~~~
Rooney finished the season well for us and IMO was having a decent tournament up until that 2nd half yesterday. He then reached the lowest level I have ever seen him reach - and that includes Villa away last year. Roy should have taken him off at 60 mins.

Saying all of that, I think he still has a role to play at United. I think Jose will like him at No.10 given how he likes his No.10s to put in a good defensive shift as well as chip in with goals. He's just not fit enough to play every week and I am sure we will see him rotated in CM/No.10/St next season. We hardly have loads of options in those positions so I do not want him sold.

13228~~~
There are preparing, monitoring, considering excuses ala Woodward.

13229~~~
At some point last season I think when he made his 500th appearance for us United put a graph of how many goals he scored per 50 games in that time and it was really obvious when he peaked and that he was on the decline.

13230~~~
He was pretty average already vs Slovakia, played 40 min. there. He was poor already in the fist half vs Iceland. I shudder to think about Rooney as our No 10 next season. It would be less detrimental to United to use him as a FB.

13231~~~
But the 3 in midfield contain Rooney and Ali, so its really 2 attacking mids and a DM. Thats not a good enough excuse for these guys to mess up.

But I agree with you in general.

13232~~~
Hasn't been crap for six years. However, he has been getting slightly worse as a player every year since 2010. 

Ferguson knew what was around the corner.

13233~~~
Rooney's bar is higher than Kane's in the same way that Maradona's is higher than Rooney's.

Rooney is finished at this level. He should have left with Fergie.

13234~~~
He needs to stop wearing a compression top/boddice every fecking game, it's summer for christ's sake. I can't remember the last time we saw his arms.

13235~~~
It is inconceivable that Rooney has one of those clauses that stipulates that he must play a certain percentage of games when fit?

13236~~~
Yes, it is inconceivable because there is no benefit for the club and United isn't managed by idiots.

13237~~~
If Mourinho refuses to drop him when he's inevitably shite, then it will start to look like it.

13238~~~
You say that but there are quite a few players with contracts like that albeit more common in La Liga.

13239~~~
I wouldn't be so sure

13240~~~
I have always defended Wayne even over the last 2 seasons, i always felt he deserved the extra chances for what he has done at the club and for how long he's been here and have no shame saying he's been one of my favorite United players. But the penny has finally dropped for me, its come to a point where hardcore Rooney fans are defending the indefensible. 

He's clearly lost a lot of his physical ability which he relied a lot on and doesn't have the nouse to play in midfield. Yes we will get the odd moment/games where he shows some brilliance (e.g FA cup final) but it's clear he's finished as a top level footballer. 

I don't mind him staying at the club but not as a starter. I have a feeling Mourinho will start him for a few months but his decline will be clear and eventually drops him. This could also mean this is Rooney's last season here as i can't see him being happy as a squad player.

13241~~~
Bebe.........£7 million.........Nuff said.

13242~~~
For me this is the key. His defenders and fanboys will always point to individual or a handful of games where he played well. Most recently, it's been "Oh but he's played well in the group stages" and "He played well in the closing stages of the season and in the FA Cup final". Even then, he was by no means stand out against Wales nor was he top level against Slovakia. Also, he performed during the last 2-3 games of the season when there was nothing to play for. The standard for "Good" when used to judge Rooney is really actually "decent / average / normal" for any other footballer. If you had him put on another name and face, there is no way in hell his fanboys would be calling his performances good.

On the other hand, his critics can easily point to vast stretches of games over the last 3-4 seasons where he's been undeniably shit. We don't need a player who is praised for performing in a handful of games but serves up pub level performances for the rest of it.

Daniel Storey at F365, I salute you.

13244~~~
No, the contracts in Spain determine the price of the players. The club isn't forced to play the player and the players will just see his price tag lowered.

13245~~~
Arise Sir Daniel Storey

13246~~~
Jose will stick with him like he stuck with Ivanovic despite being absolutely terrible for Chelsea last season. But I think he'll eventually grasp that Rooney simply can't hack it, he's not been able to hack it for a few seasons now and that's been clear to see for United fans who watch him week in, week out. The problem is how much damage that will have cost us, alternatively whether Jose will have learnt his mistakes from last season and might act quicker.

Rooneys done though as a player imo. He never really was consistent, he had runs of good form which masked his awful runs of form. I do feel for him yesterday though, all eyes were on him to rescue the situation and he crumbled under the pressure. Shame really that a player like Rooney never really did anything on International level and despite breaking the goal scoring record will imo seen as a failure.

For what its worth, I think he was horribly managed this Tournament. There was no way either him or Wilshere should ever had started any games. You want a motivated Rooney with a point to prove, should have dropped him and have him chomping at the bit for the knockouts.

"Did what he could" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
That is peak.

13249~~~
It saddens me to read so much rubbish coming from Schmeichel. I thought he was better than that.

13250~~~
its quite concerning how blinkered he is

13251~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That got me too. The level of stupidity is real.

13252~~~
Thankfully his eyesight was better when he played for us!

13253~~~
It's always the same now. He plays terrible; people say he's finished and then his supporters suggest that it's only one game. Then the same arguments happen after the next game. And the next.

The reality is that he's been consistently awful for years now. He's a has-been as a forward and a never will be as a midfielder.

13254~~~
Apparently senior England players thought he was the best no9 in the squad, is it any wonder we do so shit when we have a bunch of idiots with zero intelligence as well as game intelligence.

13255~~~
Link please?

13256~~~

Please keep starting him next season.

Rooney's poor performances aren't his fault lads. He was played out of position. He's in his prime as an attacker you know. Didn't you see him last season?

13263~~~
Seems to neglect the fact it was actually Rooney publicly calling himself a midfielder weeks before the tournament. Has Garth Crooks blamed Herrera yet?

13264~~~
It's like clockwork. He's shit upfront, move him to 10. He's shit at 10, move him to midfield. Rinse and repeat.

13265~~~
<i>"We could drop him? Could we?!"

"300k lad. Cracking hair transplant too, let's keep thinking..."

"Bit expensive for canteen chef I guess..."

"cnut can't even boil an egg. Made the poor Italian lad pretend it was him..."

"Yeah, 'captain privileges' I know. Wait, how long is it now since he was playing no.9?"
</i>
And round we go

13266~~~
If he can't get in the England team he should be nowhere near our squad. Yes. I said squad.

England has to play with rules. ie They can only pick English players.

We can do whatever the hell we like.

As a midfielder he's currently behind; Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, Mata, Herrera, Blind, Carrick. That's without us signing anyone.
As a forward he's behind Martial, Ibra (if signed), Rashford, Mkhi

You've then got Young, Fellaini, Januzaj, Depay, Young, Wilson, Lingard, Pereira, Fosu-Mensah that are going to feature to varying degrees.

I reckon he'll start the season in one of two positions;

As one of the front 3 in a 4-2-3-1
Or one of the front 3 in a 4-3-3

Then slowly see fewer starts as other players just present themselves as better options.

13267~~~
Really hoped he did not decline that offer from China.
I don't want to see him in our club again.

13268~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>! This!

13269~~~
In a way, he's a bit like Giggs at 35+. On his day he can be brilliant anywhere across the front six. When he's bad, he's the worst player on the pitch. Unfortunately the older he gets, the longer are those periods of bad form.

13270~~~
When was the last time he had "his day"? He has the occasional decent 45 minutes then fades in the second half. He's nowhere near as useful as Giggs was at 35+.

13271~~~
He was really good against Russia if nothing else. And he certainly had a few good to great performances over the course of the season. To suggest he is nowhere as good as Giggs was in his last few seasons is a bit silly. Especially considering the latter one had his fair share of abysmal performances. The difference is one was used as a squad player while the other one is starting pretty much every game.

13272~~~
He was decent against Russia who were the worst team in the tournament and just stood off him letting him do what he wanted. Which still wasn't that much. His performances towards the end of the season were against some of the worst teams in the league, most of which did the exact same thing as Russia and just stood off him. None of those performances were particularly good and they all, bar the cup final, involved him fading completely in the second half.

The bar needs to stop being lowered for him. If it was any other player those performances would have been seen as decent at best.

13273~~~
The only way I would want Rooney to stay is if he takes a huge pay cut and is ready to be a backup striker and an occasional midfield option from the bench when we are totally dominating. But his stock is still high around the world and he should do himself a favor and find a good deal abroad.

13274~~~
If Kagawa played at this level for even a game or two people would be shitting on him so hard their intestines would be flowing out their asses. Rooney has served up this shit 3 seasons at least.

13275~~~
<b>
Strikers and Forwards</b>
Zlatan - if it happens
Rasford
Martial
Memphis
Januzaj

<b>Midfielders</b>
McRyan
Herrera
Bastian
Morgan
TFM
Pereira
Blind

Rooney should have to wait in line or pray for a lasange gate MK:II to get any chance

13276~~~
Our central strikers are going to be Zlatan and Rashford. Others you listed are all going to mostly compete for wide forward roles. Pereira will also be competing for wider roles. Rooney should be behind Zlatan and Rashford in the pecking order at start the season. Depending on how Rashford does, he may go on to become the top choice or the third choice. More likely to become our first choice in my opinion. 

In second striker position we have Zlatan, Rooney, Mata and Fellaini as options. Mata might even leave. There are no clear favorites in terms of effectiveness. Maybe Zlatan could be considered a favorite there but others are about equally effective in different situations even though a lot of fans seem to have clear favorites.

In midfield, Blind(who might be sold as well), Morgan and a new signing will be competing for a single defensive midfielder position. Herrera, Bastian and Rooney will compete for the other more attacking position, neither of whom are fit enough to start for us next season so pick your poison.

In summary Rooney would be my 2nd/3rd choice for any position so he's not a player we can do without, but as a squad player he can fill in a few positions which is not bad.

13277~~~
It's staggering the amount of slack he's given and how far standards are lowered for him. It boggles the mind how he's getting away with it and has done for so long.

13278~~~
If for some reason Zlatan and Rash get injured, you would have Rooney as next over Martial? If Memphis shows any form like he did at PSV, I'd have him over Rooney. Rooney is done as a CF IMO.

Rooney is way overrated as a #10 IMO. Mhki, Mata and Pereira have better abilities suited for that role.

Rooney is not a CM so I cannot place him above any natural CM at the club.

13279~~~
Giggs was a lot better at 35, also never had the "automatic starter" role which is complete lunacy.

13280~~~
We're stuck with him for years sadly.

13281~~~
I want Martial to have a settled position in the starting 11 and that should be left forward. 

Our midfield is quite mediocre and I wouldn't sweat if Rooney is chosen ahead of anyone currently in our squad except of maybe Morgan who has potential to be very good. Ultimately, we probably need a proper upgrade in midfield.

13282~~~
How much will he be booed next season? Even at away grounds I could imagine it getting pretty bad, since he's now becoming a liability to more than just United.

Old Trafford will probably remain its meek, standing ovation-giving self for quite a while, though.

13283~~~
Wait so England going out is his fault as well?

13284~~~
Now that's really pushing it...

13285~~~
Main difference was Giggs was fit and looked after himself. Rooney on the pitch looke like he is in his 40's and is so slow and looks tired and weak. Its why I'm at the point where we would be better off without him. Bench player at most. Players like scholes and giggs had their great technique and intelligence, but even at their old age were fit and agile so if used properly could have a good impact.

13286~~~
I literally said, in the quote that it was unsurprising.

13287~~~
Giggs at 35+ vs Rooney at not-even-31-yet. Giggs at 35+ also didn't start that often. It's quite shocking to see how a player has run out so early.

So, you all will keep starting him, right? :P

13288~~~
Rapidly declining? No.

Decline slowly since 2010? 100% in my eyes. 

He peaked in 2010. Never been rated as highly as then.

It's his body largely. He did feck all to look after himself and it cost him.

13289~~~
It don't have to be a problem. All a manager needs to do is demand standards. The worst thing managers sometimes do, is ignore bad performances. We're talking about a player who's been playing since he was 16. I would hope that Jose is strong enough  because he's going to have to man manage Wayne far better then Moyes and LVG and various managers have. A lot of mistakes he makes are sloppy play and a loss of concentration. So they need to work in his head more then anything. Any forward pass is a risk and that's ok - for me, we should be looking to correct the aspect of him when he get's sloppy and messes up simple passes. When there's no pressure and perhaps he get's a bit too relaxed. That has to be corrected in his game and that is what Jose has to demand. The rest is just practice practice practice.

13290~~~
very likely

People are being overly critical. I am confident Mourinho will see his worth in the team. He's largely had a good 2016 apart from a few bad matches (and a disastorous one against Iceland I hear - I didn't watch it)

If by January he truly is halting us Mourinho will relegate him to the bench. Honestly, like so many of our players who have been shit I want to see them in team that isn't Van Gaal'd or Moyes'd.

13299~~~
Read a book.

13300~~~
This is such a misleading statement. The season ended by May (not even half the year had gone by then). Discounting the FA Cup final and the last couple of League games after we'd failed to qualify, which meant there was nothing on the line, he was by and large average after an atrocious and below average 2014-2015.

13301~~~
I think he was better than average. Most of the bad games (during 2016) were exaggarated to me.

13302~~~
Holding our club back, literally a burden at this point. We should be aiming for much better than a burnt out former striker, turned CM, who's speciality is a terrible first touch and the most predictable hollywood pass out to the right on a consistent basis. Also, for someone so meaty, he seems to get knocked off the ball in midfield quite easily too. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

13303~~~
Rooney does not fall into this category of players, as does Fellaini. They were "key" to Moyes' and LvG's plans and so they should have struggled less than the other players. These 2 IMO just don't have the ability. The other players suffered for mismanagement and flawed tactics, they were not lacking in ability hence why their main areas of struggle were in concentrations, decision making, poor tactical discipline and poor positional awareness.  Picking all the segments, currently Rooney and Fellaini,  don't more ability than Schneiderlin, Schweinstiger, Mata, Herrera, Memphis. Rooney might have better mental abilities by virtue of experience but not physical or technical abilities. That is why I have more hope in them developing into better players in a better environment.

13304~~~
I couldnt disagree more. He was one of the worse players last season and shoehorning him into our team did and will hinder us. He cant play as a striker anymore and he just isnt a good midfielder

13305~~~
I think Shamans is talking about 2016 only. And Rooney was certainly pretty good in 2016. I think his bad games were only vs Southampton to certain extent and Iceland iirc. And in each of these games, you can say that everyone was poor and not him alone. You can curse him for West Ham game, but again, Roo created the 2nd goal and the defence was poor that game.

13306~~~
Hello? The year isn't over yet.

13307~~~
His "good" games all lasted about 45 minutes too before he reverted to his usual form. The decent performances are a blip amongst the bad ones.

13308~~~
I just dont think he's a great midfielder. He is extremely one-sided, repetitive. Look at the performance of the top midfielders and compare it to Rooney. I doubt he'd start for any of the top 6 teams

13309~~~
You're forgetting that the Caf logic is that the first half and second half of the same game are actuality 2 different games. The same way the first half of the season is actually not part of the whole season.

13310~~~
My worry is when you see a team without any long standing players they seem to either be sublime or awful. I'm talking Liverpool/Spurs, do they suffer from not having that experience sometimes?

13311~~~
When Jose won the leagues with Chelsea and Real,  there were hardly any long serving players in the squad. I'm in support of clearing out the old to make way for the new. We have enough experience in Zlatan and Bastian and Jose but more importantly we need leadership and ability, stuff the more senior players in Rooney,  Carrick,  Valencia,  Fellaini,  Young and Mata lack.

13312~~~
He did have Terry/Ramos. Not sure if it makes much difference off the pitch but I agree Rooney should not play on merit.

13313~~~
They were both young players upon Jose's arrival.

13314~~~
I don't really care whether Wayne is having a luxury holiday or not but, bloody hell, the ridiculous scrutiny top players are under...there must be about 50 photos in this stupid article:

I always wonder the type of people who do these jobs. Taking pictures of people on vacation. What a great contribution to society.

13316~~~
He's an overrated, overpaid, sack of shite who's been average for seasons. He is everything that is wrong in both United and England yet continues to get a free ride. The sooner he is sold or dropped permanently the better.

13317~~~
promote this guy.

13318~~~
This guy gets it.

13319~~~
Finally some well balanced, objective opinion which describes the situation perfectly.

13320~~~
Never known a player have so many excuses made about him. It started with his mates in the media blaming the tactics, then the players around him and finally its finished with him changing positions. How hard is it to accept he's finished as a player? Why can't people move on, he's simply a shadow of the player he used to be and doesn't possess the skills to become a player good enough to play in our midfield. I can't remember this happening to any other player at United.  As for his leadership qualities, he's hardly a Keane or a Robson; He's comfortably the worst captain we've had in my time watching United. Most of us have played in team sports and would have respected the captain, I wouldn't respect Rooney the way I'd have respected Robbo, Bruce, Eric, Keane & Vidic; They were all leaders of men whilst Rooney isn't. 

He peaked as a player at 24 and has been in decline ever since, he still had a very good season at 26 but ever since then he's been a million miles away from a world class player yet his earnings have resembled that as one of the best players in the world. He was only 27 when Fergie knew he was finished as a United player yet going on 31 in a few months he's still here mainly because none of our big names have ever been replaced. Thankfully Mourinho doesn't care who he upsets and once he gets a good look at Rooney close up he won't be first choice.

13321~~~
But factually correct. Well, bar the sack of shit part.

13322~~~
This should be taken as gospel.

13323~~~
He's definitely a sack of shit. He's from Liverpool.

13324~~~
Hal Robson Kanu > Rooney
Sam volkes > Rooney

13325~~~
This should be in the thread title.

13326~~~
He hasn't been good in 2016. He was alright for one month, with a decent goal haul putting a shine on some otherwise average performances, then he was injured for two months, then largely shit for the last three months leading up to present day.

He's sprinkled this with a handful of good performances here and there, but we should be getting far more than sprinkles from a player like him. Now watch him get fat and out of shape during his holiday and spend five months training himself into something that barely passes for a professional footballer. Maybe he'll even score a couple of goals against a team of lorry drivers and earn himself a starting place in the team for the next ten months.

The emergence of Rashford in his absence should have been the death knell for him, but he found a way to keep himself getting selected by inventing new positions that he's supposedly good enough at to be a starter for United and England. In reality, though, it just involves him passing long floaters out to the right back from a different area of the pitch than he did in the last game.

13327~~~
Ah, summer. The perfect season for packing on the pounds. Only a few short unsupervised weeks for an elite athlete to enjoy chips, sausage, cake, pie, fried chicken and cigarettes. Deep lying playmakers who can spray passes around don't need to be as mobile as "support strikers". This is known. Extra gravy on mine, please.

13328~~~
I'm sure he'll score plenty against Europa League fodder next season to pad out his stats. And his die hard fans will use that to justify him starting every week.

13329~~~
You think he will be a striker?

13330~~~
Well I'm guessing once he starts the season playing like shite in Midfield we'll start to hear the usual crap about how his best position is actually up front and that's where he should play. And then when he's shite up front, he'll be moved back into midfield.

And so on and so on.

13331~~~
He won't be pushing Zlatan off the 9 position any time soon.

13332~~~
I told you guys we should have sold him years ago, back when Chelsea was giving us 30 million for him. Moyes with another, and hopefully last, "feck you" to us.

Just sell him no matter how much they give. He is detrimental to the team and he hasn't been good for years, anyway.

13333~~~
I wasn't on the Caf then, but I thought so as well at the time. Just hope that Jose doesn't persist with him if he's not performing. Make him earn his place.

13334~~~
Question,  if we sold him now. Would it be to the detriment of the team? Would it strengthen our rivals?  Would United lose its big name appeal? Would Rooney lose his status,  for those wanting him to retire here? 

No. As a matter of fact,  in a month or two we all would get over it easily. 

Sell

13335~~~
If we had sold him then we would have been even worse. He was arguably our best outfielder that season

13336~~~
It's going to be tough for some to keep the 'agenda' argument going when only 9.8% of Caf posters think he's still got a big part to play (according to the Mains poll); are we then supposed to still believe that the vast majority are 'bitter, twisted, deluded and disloyal'?

13337~~~
I somehow remember it differently. I thought he was playing well up until the point he finally signed his contract extension. After that, he was mostly back to being hit and miss (mostly miss) for the rest of that season.

13338~~~
Seems about right to me. Caf seems to amplify performances. Oh Wayne Rooney has had a terrific 2016 when he actually had just one good month.

13339~~~
Even if that's true, he signed the contract end of Feb or beginning of March? It's still a good season.

13340~~~
We came 7th!<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Not such a good season...

But I honestly don't remember the time line of when he signed the contract. i thought it was a few months into the new season.
Anyway we'll see what happens next.

13341~~~
He does tend to have one or two good months in the season<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> But unfortunately, if we want to win the title, we need consistency from all the players. As I've said, I can only hope that Jose doesn't afford him 'privileges' even when he plays shit.

13342~~~
Yeah team was horrible bar him DDG and for a few months januzaj. 

For what it's worth I doubt he would be sold a few goals off Sir Bobby's record. Plus reportedly mourinho loves him too

13343~~~
He started the a Moyes season well and descended into the same form as everyone around November. Can't really say that's a good season. RVP was still comfortably our highest goal scorer that year.

13344~~~
I don't know how Jose trying to buy a player in 2013 equates to loving him in 2016. Jose also reportedly loved Falcao. Lvg also loved Rooney,  so did Hodgson.

13345~~~
He won't go to China, he just does not seem the type to pack his bags from his comfort and move to a new continent. Our best hope would have been to sell him to Madrid/Chelsea but that boat sailed when Moyes screwed it up after SAF literally gave him the easy route to sell Rooney. Fergie knew all along that Wayne was past it.

13346~~~
This is what I've been trying to say.

13347~~~
I think he's in trouble. Mourinho made it clear he's not going to move him around. 
If he fails to impress in the No.10 role, he's going to be dropped. 
The thinkg is Ibrahimovic likes dropping into the No,10 so that space could be clogged up.

13348~~~
Mou also said he prefers specialists as well and don't think it will take him long to see Rooney is not a specialist 10. Rooney and Ibra also for me is not an ideal combo, can see them alternating more than playing together.

13349~~~
Bit premature to write obituaries about him saying he is finished at the club. What Mourinho pretty much confirmed was he is going to be his Number 10 just off Ibra and flanked by Martial and Mkhitaryan. Rooney's job now is to basically score goals for the team and considering his last best return in the league was 17 goals three years back, onus is firmly on him to prove that he has a place in the side.

13350~~~
He said he would play as a 9 MAYBE a 10. Key word being maybe.
The other part you are missing is he said things like even I can play a great pass without pressure. This was a bit of an assault on Rooney tbh

13351~~~
Expect a Paul Stratford style briefing any day now to address Mourinho's press conference. 

I'd put money on it being from Ogden.

13352~~~
No Rooney in CM. Rooney as a 10.

This means Fellaini or him is out the door. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Yes, I liked that Mourinho settled this Rooney in midfield debate with that one quote. IMO that maybe was in regards to Rooney's position under him, not in regards to if he'll actually play. I suspect he still views him as a key player and most likely his captain so it would be interesting to see what happens if Rooney under performs in his new role. I just think reactions are bit premature where a lot are convinced this is it for him.

I think it marks the beginning of the end tbh

I also think he'll definitely be a starter but unlike before, he won't be moved around if he doesn't play well, he'll be dropped.

Angry and confused again? Possibly miffed and unsure this time?

Angrier and even more confused.

He <i>might</i> just accept a secondary role, you never know. That way, he keeps his high wages and doesn't get worn out. Plus, he won't have to move to another club/country when he's so settled here.

That's the beauty isn't it? Dropped once and forever. Nobody in management to hide behind. If he can't cut it in his best position then he can't be a first team for this club.
