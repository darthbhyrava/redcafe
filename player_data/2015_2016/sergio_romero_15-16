1~~~
So how many appearances will our #2 keeper make this season after Valdes got like 100 minutes all of last season? 
Also he couldn't try to look more pissed off if he tried for his picture

2~~~
I think he will basically be a direct replacement for Valdes. But... I dont know what this will do for Johnstone and Lindegaard. Hopefully if DDG goes we will still buy a new no. 1.

3~~~
Our keepers are now De Gea, Romero, Valdes, Lindegaard and Johnstone.

Valdes is obviously gone, Lindegaard probably gone too. I just hope Romero isn't a De Gea replacement.

4~~~
Very decent shot stopper, but flappy and will make mistakes
Our new PIG, Mignolet type

Hoping we dont need to call on him often

5~~~
no comment

6~~~
Let's hope for this thread not to be bumped too often then.

7~~~
for free, he is a good signing (hopefully as a back up)

8~~~
And what performances he's had for us.

9~~~
Valdes and Lindegaard will go this season.
De Gea a possibility to go as well but as for now, De Gea, Romero and Johnstone is good enough.

10~~~
Might aswell keep lindegaard as number 2 tbh but I don't expect him to be playing much, maybe capitol 1 cup games only. Good luck to him though.

11~~~
Meh

12~~~
If De Gea is sold I think he will be the starter for this season, maybe not for the following season.

13~~~
If DDG does go, I'll be happy to go in the season with Johnstone and Romero. Ideally the former will solidify that #1 spot. I have faith in him.

14~~~
Decent back up but not a number 1 in my eyes

15~~~
Here's hoping he start both PSG and Spurs games! I think he can step up to be our number 1 as he did well for Argentina in the world cup.

16~~~
A tad worried after his blooper video, doesn't look that confident coming for the balls crossed into the box. Doesn't command the box that well, something De Gea has really grown in.

17~~~
The thought of him in our goal for the first game of the season makes me sick...

18~~~
Might need to get usedbto it. Unless we can get Navas from Madrid included in the Ddg deal, which club do you see selling us their no.1 keeper at this stage of the window?

Romero it is.

19~~~
I kind of hoped Valdes and van Gaal would get their act together or get a decent GK in, like Navas or Lloris with a huge offer

The thing is i didnt expect him to start that soon, would be surprised if he wont have a mare.

20~~~
Seems people don't really rate Romero?

21~~~
The De Gea effect.

22~~~
Of course not, because he is shit.

23~~~
Not good enough to be our permanent no.1 keeper but he's hardly shit.

24~~~
God bless the caf.

25~~~
Hope he only plays for reserves and starts in the first team only when DDG's mind is off and Sam Johnstone is injured.

26~~~
He is as good in goal as Blind is at CB. He will get murdered if he gets thrown in. His decent WC appearances wont change my stance on him being an absolute average GK and not PL material.

27~~~
God bless us.

28~~~
Well if he gets 'murdered' tomorrow then you can rejoice in the fact he probably won't ever start for us again..

29~~~
Has anybody really seen enough of him to label him as "shit"? Most of the people giving out have probably seen him play one or two times and are talking through their arse. Give him a fecking chance

30~~~
Didn't do too bad at the WC, did he?

31~~~
If someone put together a reel of all de gea's errors sure some people would be exactly the same as they are with Romero. Apart from with Argentina I can't really imagine people would have seen much of him at all, and in the world cup he was fine as far as I remember.

32~~~
He wasn't good enough to get in the team at Monaco or sampdoria so no one can have seen him play much but that tells you everything you need to know. He might not be terrible but if he hasn't been good enough at those clubs then why would he be good enough here.

He is fine as a backup to do a job every so often but anyone thinking he is good enough to be our number one is going to be very disappointed.

33~~~
Err....

Don't think he's very good. Looks terrified on the ball.

34~~~
Give him time to settle in.

35~~~
He looks rubbish.

36~~~
In what sense? His distribution has been decent and he at least tries to find a man rather than kick it aimlessly.

37~~~
Looks like a bemused contest winner stood in goal. What a shit show.

38~~~
I'm scared everytime Spurs get the ball anywhere within 20 metres from goal.

39~~~
Sign a new keeper now. He's a reserve and nothing more.

40~~~
Funny how differently people see things - I think he's looked quite relaxed, bar a few balls carelessly put-out for throw-ins.

41~~~
The bit where he completely panicked and kicked it out for a throw in wasn't very reassuring.

42~~~
Don't understand all the negativity, he's hardly done anything wrong this half. It's like people have already made up their minds.

43~~~
Bizarre. Just goes to show how two moments can overshadow an entire performance. His first misplaced pass was from him trying to chip it past a striker in his own box with his weaker foot for Christ's sake - if anything he's too confident and casual. Aside from that he's been stroking the ball around with ease and authority.

44~~~
Bit shakey today, it's scaring the beejeezus out of me.

45~~~
He's been a little nervy when Spurs close him down. Our goalkeeper situation is a mess.

46~~~
Yeah because none of our defenders offered themselves for the ball.

47~~~
Yeah, I thought he did fine. Quick off his line, vitally, to deny Walker a great chance. Very good distribution.

48~~~
To be fair his defence hasn't exactly been all that helpful, not with some of those back passes and how easily they're getting out-muscled.

At this point I'm more concerned with Blind at CB.

49~~~
He made a really good save at one point.

Not enjoying some of his kicking though.

50~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You've already made up your mind on him so I doubt anything he does will matter.

51~~~
A couple of dodgy kicks, which is to be expected when thrown in at the deep end. Otherwise fine

52~~~
I could see why he might be playing under a bit of pressure. Signed less than a week ago, give him some time to settle in.

53~~~
It's his first game at possibly last minute notice at a huge club after barely playing at club level, he's going to have shaky moments but his distribution apart from that has been pretty good, people are panicking because it suits the hyperbole.

54~~~
They were less than helpful, yeah. I'm not sure it called for whacking it in to touch, though.

55~~~
Yeah he looked as relaxed as Cleverley spraying the ball around, true that

56~~~
Debut aside, he's barely played first team football recently. Let's be patient, but I'm not sure what he is doing that a low team goalie couldn't do better

57~~~
He's doing well. Don't forget, he had not game time for a long time

58~~~
I'm not saying it's clear from one moment that he's crap.

59~~~
Couple of bad passes but feck he's hardly helped with no option to pass to. He's barely played club football recently and even then his passing is still better than most goalies around.

60~~~
Good point. Most keepers would be a bit nervy in similar circumstances.

61~~~
I think he had a bad first touch and the ball got stuck under him

62~~~
This is kinda why I rarely post here. At least about United topics. 45 minutes against a good team where we have 4 new starters and score and the top topic of conversation seems to be the "contest winner" in goals. I'll be posting in the Caf goes into meltdown thread by the end of today. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Two bad kicks and that's kind of it really. I can understand I suppose, after all DDG started like a house on fire when he signed.

63~~~
Romero found a man with 8 of his 10(not exact numbers) passes but people will judge him for the 2 he missed

64~~~
Carrick stitched him up on the second one really but he doesn't inspire confidence, not that he will ever be first choice anyway.

65~~~
He put our players under pressure a lot. On the other hand I don't understand how so many players can't cover the ball properly back to opponents. It's just baffling how slow start some palyers have, you'd expect them to be quite sharp..

66~~~
As long as the ball is out of our net, I am happy with him.

67~~~
Contrast his passing with that of Johnstone or Lindegaard, guys.

Also, his shot stopping is supposed to be the strong part of his game. So no worries yet.

68~~~
Actually he played copa final in July.

69~~~
They have. He's not DDG so he must be sh!t.

70~~~
He's average, always been. Wonder how many times he'll play to get LVG to know that.

71~~~
yeah and 6out of eight attempts put us under immense pressure.. great statistics though!

72~~~
True but I meant with United. He's been here for a week or so

73~~~
Apart from maybe him possibly coming out a bit faster for that Kane chance he hasn't really had anything at all to do for anyone to start making assumptions. Either way he'll need time to get into the swing of things at Utd so lets hope he gets it.

74~~~
I think it's more 'he was back up at a not particularly good Italian club, so he must be shit', to be fair.

75~~~
Let's not  forget this is his debut game after a grand total of 0 minutes in preseason, I think we can forgive him for the occasional  moment of nerves or rustiness.

76~~~
So because other players aren't fully aware of their surroundings it's Romero's fault? He's a keeper fs not Xavi. Our players take too long on the ball, been a problem for years and other teams know it.

77~~~
A couple of dodgy kicks, impressed with him besides that though.

78~~~
2 bad passes to his right

One pass to Morgan who then lost it. But I would blame Morgan more in that for not playing it quicker

Apart from that he looks ok

New signing, new country, probably found out yesterday he was starting

79~~~
No problem with him, will be a good backup keeper for us.

80~~~
I'm not convinced by him at all and don't think he is suddenly going to become good enough for United when he has not been good enough for Monaco or Sampdoria, much smaller teams with significantly less pressure, but at least give him a chance. Stranger things have happened.

81~~~
He's hiding a shady past.

82~~~
It's more about his facial expressions than anything. No confidence whatsoever.

83~~~
He has been exactly what I expect from him.

84~~~
Look, he's our second choice. How good do we really expect him to be?

As long as we have a good first choice by the time the transfer window closes then I really couldn't care less.

85~~~
He's really stepped up this half. Seems much more composed and has held a couple of tricky crosses, done well this half.

86~~~
You expected him to play well? Good man. That's what he's done.

87~~~
I expected him to have a decent game if he does play.It's not like he's a Conference keeper anyway, just not a top one.

88~~~
I was surprised he was getting a lot of shit at HT in the match thread (although it's a match thread so I probably shouldn't have been), he's done pretty well. 

Some nice saves.

89~~~
Some damn good saves today.

90~~~
Romero BGITW

91~~~
Could have literally just given us 2 points.

92~~~
He looks dodgy to me.

93~~~
a better goalkeeper would have done better with both of those.

94~~~
Second half, you really cant have a go at him. He has went from abysmal to decent. Keep that up until the goalkeeper situation is sorted, please.

95~~~
Very good saves towards the end of the game.

96~~~
At what point was he abysmal?

97~~~
He's saved the game for us

98~~~
Dodgy how? A bit shakey? Or a bit mental?

99~~~
First half he was rotten. He was shaking like a shitting dog everytime he recieved the ball.

100~~~
That "shakey" looking Palm away was a lot better than it looked.

101~~~
Nerves were to be expected. He still won't be good enough mind.

102~~~
yes, I'll take the points

103~~~
Jesus, talk about exaggerating.

104~~~
On course for the Golden Glove... but then again so is every other goalkeeper than isn't Michael Vorm.

105~~~
Dont call me Jesus.

106~~~
I'm delighted with that. Feck off Dave!

107~~~
Thought he coped really well under enormous pressure. Decent start for sure.

108~~~
Some of you numpties need to binge on humble pie.

109~~~
He was a bit nervy in the beginning but probably saved us the three points today.

110~~~
Did quite well all things considered. Not quite the assured keeper De Gea is but you cannot expect it in one game.

111~~~
Well done. Some crucial saves we wouldn't have won without.

112~~~
Very good debut.

113~~~
How can we survive with a Sampdoria reject ? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

114~~~
Love him already.

115~~~
Really pleased. Two dodgy kicks aside he was great. Saved and caught everything.

116~~~
Good performance. Obviously it doesn't change much and we still need De Gea replacement but it will be good for Romero's confidence.

117~~~
Good Debut. De Gea would have been getting MOTM votes for this performance

118~~~
He had a nervy few minutes which is to be expected but he grew into the game and then did rather well. Encouraging debut.

119~~~
He will be a  decent backup keeper. A regular international for Argentina has to be better than the backup we have over the years.

120~~~
Some absolutely vital saves at the end. I'm pleased.

121~~~
The odd dodgy moment but definitely better than feared.

122~~~
People see what they want to see. He made his debut, haven't played in a month. Some shaky touches in the start shouldn't come as a surprise. He was solid and made some good saves late.

123~~~
Impressive debut, pretty decent distribution overall. Wasn't tested much but showed great mental strength for the end.

124~~~
Still a good goalkeeper, he will make mistakes from time to time but he is okay.

125~~~
Good 2nd half from him, some nice saves and took up good positions as well. Very impressed with his distribution too.

Still have to see how he deals with crosses and corners though

126~~~
Not the best with the ball at his feet, his handling from balls in the box were top draw.

127~~~
Good match from him overall. Looked very shaky at the start with his kicking, but sorted that out in the second half. Then pulled off some solid saves in the second and was quick off his line and read play well.

128~~~
To be fair he played very well in the 2nd half.

129~~~
Impressed, I have to say.

130~~~
No complaints. Well done. Much better than what I have seen of Cillessen e.g.

131~~~
Holy hell, some people really don't want to give him credit. Nothing spectacular, but very solid second half. Not sure if I'd like him as our first choice, but he's plenty competent as a backup.

132~~~
Well played sir.

133~~~
Average first half, good second half fair play to him.

134~~~
Shakey in the first half but once the nerves settled he looked very good.

Good debut seeing as the commentators were ready pounce on a bad performance.

135~~~
solid debut. grew in confidence as the game progressed

136~~~
Solid debut

137~~~
good second half, I am less worried now. Really don't want Cillesen

138~~~
What kind of guy is Romero in real life? He played good but are there any stories about how he has behaved at his previous clubs etc? He comes across as too humble and a little shy. He looks very nervous after making saves and looks very relieved at the same time. Im hoping he can come out of it and become a bit arrogant and more confident.

Or is that just his character?

139~~~
I find him hilarious and I've no idea why.

140~~~
I thought he was pretty good. Also, why is his demeanor so odd? Looks like one of those people you force to play in goal in your park football match.

141~~~
Solid

142~~~
Exactly how I see it. I'd still like to see us go for Lloris.

143~~~
This is my first time properly seeing him but I feel like he could be a better keeper than he is. He seems too shy and afraid. I mean, he's afraid to smile in his signing picture!

144~~~
Had some brainfarts but saved us towards the end.

145~~~
Turns out he isn't some sort of performing clown who has blagged his way into one of the biggest international sides and one of the biggest club sides... who'd have thought it? 

Decent performance, didn't have much to do but sometimes that's the way with goalkeepers.

146~~~
He looked very alert, his distribution didn't look half bad either. Overall a very good debut and especially when you take all things into consideration.

147~~~
I don't know much, but at Monaco he joined to be a starter and warmed the bench, but acted lack a great professional. According to some journos he was extremely sad but didn't complained publicly.

148~~~
I like him. Him and Johnstone to battle it out all season.

149~~~
Aye exactly the  same as Valdes for us last season. One of the most experienced keepers about and zome dodgy kicking on his debut too.

150~~~
Looked good. Clean sheet.

Cash in on De Gea asap if his heart isn't in it.

151~~~
This

152~~~
Very strange facial expressions! Did a sort of odd grimace when he made a decent save and had a weird weird look when he made a couple of mistakes. Can't really put my finger on it, but an odd demeanour isn't a bad way of summing it up.

-

Thought he looked as good as you'd expect from a second keeper. Decent reflexes as we expected. His distribution was pretty good - he was always looking before passing, picked out the wingers and full backs a few times - but I think he looked nervy rather than <i>bad </i>on the ball. And when it really came to it at the end, he made the saves he needed to.

153~~~
A good performance
\

154~~~
Oh yeah. He looks like the white guy from Let's be Cops

155~~~
Parried shots but held crosses. Superb distribution but also a couple of dodgy pass attempts.

Not sure what to make of him yet. Nothing to worry though, by the looks of things, he won't have too many saves to make.

156~~~
Considering circumstances he did OK. Didn't look too comfortable though, maybe nervous becsuse of new league, club and huge crowd and all that.

157~~~
I hope that was a reflection of his ability and not one of those adrenaline inspired debuts.

I just can't take him seriously given his club career and gormless expression. Prove me wrong Sergio, please.

158~~~
I keep seeing people say this, am I the only one who thinks different? He put it out of play as much as he hit his man. 

Not having a go, because I thought he played very well, but I thought he was very shaky in this department for sure.

159~~~
Lacked a bit of confidence during the 1st half, but did well in the 2nd. The saves towards the end must have done him a world of good to his confidence levels!

160~~~
It was nice of spurs to give him such an easy introduction. Had nothing difficult to do but did it well regardless. 

Tougher tests to follow

161~~~
Was very good today. Give him some credit ffs. It was his debut and made a couple of very good saves and read the few crosses well. A couple of poor touches, but it's to be expected. It's not like he's used to playing in Van Gaal's system.

162~~~
I suppose so. Still, some people here clearly are just looking for a chance to complain about him. If he is shit, we'll get better clues than slightly poor kicks.

163~~~
After all the shit he was getting on here during the game I thought he was pretty good. Never going to be a long term number one but came in late, didn't play any pre season and probably doesn't speak any English yet put in a solid dependable performance today. Well done Sergio

164~~~
Started a bit nervy - as did the whole team really, but he grew into the game and made some nice saves. His kicking wasn't too bad either. Hopefully that'll give him the confidence to push on.

165~~~
It's his first game for us having just joined, and thrown straight into the mix in the league's opening game in front of 75k fans at Old Trafford. Safe to say, it can be mentally overwhelming. Was nice to see the fans getting behind him. All things considered, he handled his debut impressively.

166~~~
he played ok but didn't make any saves you wouldn't expect a keeper to Save. 

His distribution was awful and nearly cost us a couple of times and a coupe of shots he parried when he didn't need to. It will cost us when playing against better teams

167~~~
I thought he did very well, circumstances taken into consideration. Looked quite composed, even if he had a couple of minor blips with the ball at his feet.

168~~~
Its a mark of a good goalkeeper to be that nervous early on and totally step up when the pressure is on late on. What he did late on showed far more bottle than a lot of us (myself included) gave him credit for when I first saw him.

Its not like he's been plucked from some reserve side either. He's played in World Cup finals.

169~~~
Played very good and didn't make any costly mistakes. The mistakes he did make he made sure they'd be the least risky mistakes he could make.

170~~~
Did well, nothing special and was the kind of performance you expect from a competent number two. Real test will be how he performs week in week out because his career history suggests that is where he struggles.

171~~~
Looks a top notch shot stopper. Wish we would stop making our keepers fanny about with the ball at their feet. Must have got instructions in the second half not to have to play as a fecking 5th Defender. Thank feck for that.

172~~~
Impressed. 8/10 for me, some dodgy passes but didn't do bad with his clearances and long range hoofs. Showed good reflexes and great positioning. It was his debut people, been in the country 20 minutes and doesn't know half his teammates names yet. 

Compare it to De Gea's debut and we're onto a winner...

173~~~
Clean sheet debut, shut a lot of people up

174~~~
He had a decent debut without a doubt, couple of wobbly moments and needs to hold the ball more but overall solid enough with thankfully no aerial pressure to face.

175~~~
One of the best players on the pitch today. He controlled his area and made some good saves to keep us in the lead. His distribution was also very good from his throw-outs.

176~~~
Was excellent, did everything required. He was the reason we got three points, two more than we probably deserved today.

177~~~
I don't think he have played week-in, week-out for a while. He was second choice at Monaco and not into reckoning at Sampdoria last season. He is decent, the only thing he's bad at is punching shots rather than holding on. Otherwise, he is decent. It'd be interesting to see how he plays VIlla next week.

178~~~
Was pleased for him that it went ok and I so love our fans - giving him some much needed support. Keeping my fingers crossed for him in our second game..

179~~~
With some of the comments made before the game you would've thought he couldn't catch a cold.

180~~~
Not getting ahead of myself after one game, still don't rate him to be honest.

181~~~
I like his litte grimace/smile. It's funny

182~~~
Well exactly that's the problem he wasn't good enough to start at Monaco and was dropped at sampdoria and he wasn't behind world class keepers at either club so he will probably struggle if he has to play regularly here.

183~~~
Horrendous kicking to defenders apart, he was very good.

184~~~
Given the circumstances I think he did ok.

185~~~
I thought his first couple of ball distributions were good, and then after that mishap on his left foot he seemed to lose confidence.

186~~~
I feel like its 2011 all over again. We've got a talented shot stopper who has kittens any time the ball comes anywhere near him.

Decent debut considering the circumstances but hes going to have to step up massively if he becomes our first choice.

187~~~
Reads play very well and was quick off his line.

Good to see.

188~~~
Well done to him. Good performance given the difficult circumstances.

189~~~
De gea who?

190~~~
He's also take De Gea's chant.

This game will do him wonders towards his confidence.

191~~~
He did well today but looks shaky. No more than a No.2 for me. I'd hope LVG makes amends with Valdes if we are going to lose De Gea because Romero will cost us points as the season progresses

192~~~
Was good. Hope he kicks on from here.

193~~~
This guy looks like a PES character, he even has the same emotional range as one

194~~~
Was good, did what was required in the end. Didn't expect anything else, the communication with defence will improve.

195~~~
Thought he did okay. Especially the two saves in the end.

196~~~
Very impressed with him today. Struggled with the ball at his feet but made some really good saves (the one from Walker in the first half was excellent - he came out quickly to cut the angle down) and commanded his area well late on. If he keeps up that level he will do a very good job for the club.

197~~~
Very solid performance today especially considering the circumstances. Good shot stopping, very good anticipation on crosses and balls into the box for the most part, excellent distribution when not under pressure and didn't take any risks when he was. His clearances under pressure probably his weakest point today but thats probably a smart decision to just hoof it away in these situations.

I think Romero's negative reputation on here are vastly exaggerated. With that said, I would still like to bring in a better number 1.

198~~~
Good performance overall. His distribution was quite poor but he was put under pressure from bad back passes a few times and if we don't have Fellaini up front then Young/Rooney/Mata/Memphis aren't going to win many ariel duels from his clearances.

199~~~
First half was poor. The chance that got lofted over the bar, I think he lacked authority. He had another moment being indecisive in the first half and some poor kicking. Second half saw some good moments but even one of the saves that was at his feet, he pushed it in front of him - think if has confident, that would be an easy save for him. Was more confident in the second half and he just needs to be calm. Obviously, it's a big opportunity for him but he should take confidence in the fact he's LVGS buy. Another day we would have conceded but if he's a lucky goalkeeper, then that will do. Not sure he can speak English yet but just needs to maintain the authority in his game.

200~~~
A bit crazy save to make but this needed to be done when Tottenham really didn't had serious problems with our marking.

201~~~
Solid debut and a few good claims from crosses that other keepers may have stayed back for. Some fun to come with his passing and possession if he continues in the same vein.

202~~~
I was impressed. Not perfect but a lot better than I expected.

203~~~
Great game from him today and he certainly made up for not having De gea between the sticks. His distribution was a little off but I believe thats down to him getting used to LVGs 'philosophy' . I actually remember De Gea really struggling with his distribution for the first few games last season where before LVG that was one of his strongest assets. As we all know, it was back to normal, if not better for the remainder of the season. Nothing to be worried about.

204~~~
60+ caps for Argentina, I suppose he can't be so bad, particuarly for a longterm no.2, based on today.

205~~~
Very impressive debut.

206~~~
So hes not so incredibly shit?

207~~~
He's no De Gea but if we're stuck with him for any length of time, perhaps the improvement in our backline with Darmian there will not make the GK situation look so bad.

208~~~
don't worry. He will have a howler in his 7th game or something and people will use it to say 'I told you he was shit'

209~~~
Yup. Sthing like that.

210~~~
Really really impressive debut. Deserves a huge amount of credit. 

His handing was spot on. Which I think was the main worry before hand.

211~~~
all things considered.

he did well, some good saves in there and as time goes on I'm sure his distribution will get better

212~~~
Don't see him as a long-term replacement for De Gea. Missed a few heart beats with his distribution and decision-making today.

We missed out on Begovic.

213~~~
Impressive debut today and hopefully he can do a good job here. However, I don't see him being a long-term number one choice, he just doesn't have that calm aura of a United-keeper that feels like a must.

214~~~
Considering the circumstances he did well. Nothing that impressive about his debut though. I was surprised by his hesitancy to receive the ball to feet. He looked shocked, scared at times, and really nervous with his kicking and distribution. I also think the saves he was praised for near the end were fairly routine. Arguably had he dealt with the ball at the first time off asking Eriksen would not have been able to rifle one at him. He will need to work <b>hard</b> on how he deals with the aerial ball to survive in this league. If the De Gea and Valdes situations aren't resolved soon we'll need him to too.

215~~~
Maybe I'm just used to VDS and DDG being ultra composed, but his nervous smile / excrement eating grin every time he had to do anything was very scary. Looked as if even he was surprised he didn't feck up, let alone the caf

216~~~
Considering it was his first game for 7 months he did exceptionally well after a nervous start - looks to have very good hands and made some vital DDGesque saves late on

Not as much of a muppet as people thought - maybe not first choice but a damn good backup if needed

217~~~
Did well considering the circumstances. Can't ask for much more than a clean sheet.

218~~~
Uhm, he played and reached the final of the Copa America... Not his first game in 7 months...

219~~~
First club game I meant <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

220~~~
He wasn't great. Distribution at times was beyond questionable, and I don't think Smalling had much confidence in him at all.

221~~~
Sure <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

222~~~
His distribution with his feet was terrible, but his throws for quick counters were decent. Dealt with everything, perhaps could have been better placed for Eriksen's 'chip' but otherwise he was ok.

223~~~
Ok I must admit. He wasnt shit. I was one of those who thought he looked like we randomly signed a Hobo from outside OT and put him in goal. Aside from some dodgy passing to  the center backs which i can more than understand as it takes practice and training to know how to do our passing from out the back, he did well, came out for catches well and made some good saves. Well played sir. my apologies for my first thoughts of you.

224~~~
Surprised me actually, he showed some fine reflexes. Obviously really struggled with playing the ball out of defence but your keeper is there to make saves and he did that, above expectation in my eyes.

225~~~
I was pleased with his performance too. He did look nervous at the beginning and his distribution wasn't brilliant but that is understandable, he was thrown into the deep end today, especially after not playing club football for so long and making his debut. LVG said after the game that he was planning on playing De Gea but changed his mind a few days ago, so i suspect the decision to play Romero would have come unexpected to him. It did feel unusual seeing him in goal for us and I'm sure it would have felt unusual for him too. 

His distribution wasn't great but his handling and reflexes were fine, I'm sure if we had Fellaini on the pitch he would have been told to kick it to him. I'm happy he didn't make any major mistakes and I grateful we kept a clean sheet and that he helped contribute to that, hopefully it will have given him a confidence boost for the next game.

226~~~
After reading this forum, I was expecting a one armed blind man in goal. He surprised me.

227~~~
He played very well today. Granted he wasn't that tested but when he was called upon he delivered. A few decent saves and I was impressed at how well he was reading the game. Quick off his line and has great distribution.

228~~~
He did a good job.

229~~~
He did what we expect of a Man United goalkeeper.

230~~~
You were surprised a professional goalkeeper who has played in a World Cup final had fine reflexes

That's great. He did grand today nothing out of the ordinary but what you would expect from a professional keeper

But then I'm reminded of the comments about him over the last two weeks which would suggest he barely belonged in the non league

231~~~
He made a few really good saves, especially that parry off the far post with Dembele pretty much coming in to put a shot on goal (if not tap in). One can expect for a player who hasn't played club football in a while and basically being dropped into the first game of the season may struggle in all aspects. I didn't say he is terrible and that I thought he'd be awful. I said I was surprised at how sharp he was considering the lack of the above. Very refreshing to see and I think he will do well.

232~~~
Solid debut from Romero. Hopefully the unwarranted and OTT criticism we've been seeing on here since his transfer will finally stop

233~~~
If you honestly think people will stop criticizing him after just one game then you will be disappointed. Long way to go before he proves himself.

234~~~
He did play for Argentina in Copa America.

235~~~
Did reasonably well for his first game.

236~~~
I wouldn't say terrible. Well, maybe the first half, but I though his distribution looked better and better as the game went on.

237~~~
a decent debut

i think the major weakness that hinders him from becoming a top goalkeeper is his footwork.  not about his kick on the ball but how he's stationed and moved by his legs.  if he's getting some training what a basketball player usually does i'm sure he can become an even much greater goalie than he used to be

238~~~
I actually put him down as MotM given the unnerving circumstances and how well he responded.

Distribution was off and I have to say I was baffled why we signed a keeper I have seen no evidence of being any good on the ball.

Let's wait and see though. LvG managed him before and they should be familiar with each other. I would be surprised if he can't sort it out as LvG would have known that.

239~~~
I think he is very solid. Not fully tested though but looks very confident.

240~~~
Didn't really have much to do today, all our defenders had a good game.

But when he was called on to make a couple of saves at the end, he did so well enough.

Wouldn't expect anything less given his background as a first choice keeper for a top ten international team.

241~~~
He is a n.12

242~~~
Really good today I thought. Got a very loud chant as well.

243~~~
I voted him MotM too. He saved our skin especially saving the Eriksen shot towards the end which I think is a much better save than it looks. I was highly impressed with Smalling and Darmian too but Romero certainly took his chance yesterday. Once he gets used to the way the team plays and feels settled in the team then he is surely going to improve. He may not be our number one this year but on yesterday's performance I'd be comfortable with him playing several games this season.

244~~~
Brilliant stuff. A huge contrast from the "support" some here provided.

245~~~
He did (mostly) what he suppose to do, albeit some nervous passes and saves. Some of his distributions are very good though especially one or two of his long throws which straight away sent the team for counter attacks. 

Having said that, can he handle the pressure against Stoke away though? Old joke it seems now as Mark Hughes is slowly turning Stoke into non-Stoke team.

246~~~
Was excellent yesterday the only thing was he changed his mind a few times on coming for the ball. But looked to have great hands.

247~~~
He did look a bit nervous with distribution in the 1st half but that's really understandable.

248~~~
That's great to see.

249~~~
I thought his distribution was actually good, especially the times he threw the ball straight out to the wings can't really recall DDG doing that.Didnt give me the jitters either unlike Taibi/Barthez/Howard hope if DDG does goes we keep faith in him.

250~~~
He looks fine to me, the wayward passes don't bother me as people are saying his distribution is supposed to be quite good. However, the only slight worry I have is that he's barely played regularly for a club team lately. How come?

251~~~
looked good...

252~~~
Just read a tweet suggesting he wasn't a backup more that he was frozen out at Sampdoria as they wanted his wages off the books. Not sure how true though.

253~~~
Fair play to him, did well given the language barrier and lack of time he has had.

254~~~
Either way, van Gaal knows his shit. If he trust him, so should we.

255~~~
You'd imagine Hoek would have a lot of say in this and with he's vastly experienced too.

256~~~
Aye.

257~~~
I'd agree with you. I thought he actually looked very confident with the ball at his feet he didn't seem to rush to me and seemed to be trying to find attacking options with the ball. There was one point on 12 minutes where under pressure he kicked it down the middle and you could see Carrick pointing to kick it to the left or right wing and from then on he was fine.

I watched the game again last night and the majority of his passes found it's man.

258~~~
Was really good yesterday, yes he had two awful passes but his saving was excellent and that's what we bought him for. If it was De Gea, he would have been Man of the Match. It's been his first game for us and his first game for a while so I can forgive the rustiness of his passing but his saving really helped the team.

The goal keeper coaches just need to help him with his choices as they did with De Gea.

Welcome Sergio <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

259~~~
The lad did alright just glad he was not another Taibi

260~~~
the lad will slowly get used to his team mates and playing regularly will help. His kicking and throwing will improve.

The coaches will be working with him.

261~~~
Ok he did well yesterday, besides his distribution, but we knew he was talented. Argentina couldn't get to a World Cup final with an absolute bum in goal. The question for me is whether he can actually do it over the course of a season. Easy to be well up for the occasion on your debut, but if that concentration slips as the season progresses then we could suffer. There must be some reason he's not really consistently played for a decent club.

262~~~
Save for Rooney, Van Gaal seems to have no problems dropping players who are off the boil so I'm not too worried there. However if De Gea does leave, and we do not sign a new GK having Johnstone as next in line could be quite troublesome.

263~~~
Well yeah that's what I'm getting at. We definitely need someone else if/when De Gea leaves. Can't afford to let that potential drop in concentration hit us.

264~~~
Not bad for a first game at OT after joining us a week ago. With more time here, he can only get better

265~~~
The criticism was still unwarranted before he even played a freakin game. I don't expect it to be at the same levels of ridiculousness but then im never surprised by what people do

266~~~
Did anyone else got the feeling that he is little bit cocky and has confidence in his passing rather then the other way round and it was just little bit of nerves why he misplaced some passes.

267~~~
Yep. There were a few times he received back passes that other keepers would just hoof back up the pitch aimlessly but he actually fancied himself on the ball so was happy to take touches and look for a pass out instead of just a big clearance.

268~~~
I keep clicking on this thinking it's the Sergio Ramos thread <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>
Quick, to the Sergio Ramos thread <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

269~~~
Good debut .Needs to work on distribution. But considering he as not had much time with the squad was composed.

270~~~
Save for two mishit passes his distribution was excellent

271~~~
This. His passes were mostly accurate.

272~~~
Decent debut for him, made 1 or 2 decent saves. He handled the pressure very well, hope he keeps it up if DDG is dropped again.

273~~~
His distribution was a bit ropey but apart from that he did well for his first match. Some of the stick he was getting from a few people on here before he'd even kicked a ball for us was totally unwarranted.

274~~~
Romero played very well. Some good saves in the end, and looked cool as anything all game. I didn't see these nerves everyone was going on about, even in the first half. He was kicking well, chipping the ball out to people with both feet. He played one out into touch, but I don't understand how the confidence to chip the ball over a striker with your weak foot instead of just booting it clear is an example of 'nerves'.

More of the same and he will be better than many keepers in the league, and certainly good enough to play for us. The likes of Courtois and Cech had shockers this weekend and people are criticising Romero's performance. Although I haven't read past page 4 of this thread, so the tone may well have changed to be fair.

275~~~
Gives the impression that it will go wrong. But then it doesn't.

276~~~
Terrific first performance, given he has been thrown in at the deep end a bit.  Fair play to him, he was getting slated before the match.  Guess he will be playing for the rest of this month so hope he can carry on from that and continue to put in good performances.

277~~~
Solid game, I didn't think he did anything special, tho. This should do wonders for his confidence, good to see because it looks like we will be stuck with him on goal until the transfer window is over.

278~~~
the last person I would like to see doing something special is the GK

279~~~
When you take into consideration the circumstances that he played under, Ï thought he had a really fantastic debut!
The lad showed very good character and ability do deal with highly charged situation.
I'm positive, he'll only improve from this.

280~~~
The way some people talk about him, you'd think he's some rookie GK or teenager who's playing in Europe for the first time, this is Argentina's #1 GK, a world cup and Copa America finalist we're talking about here, he's not De Gea but he's a very competent GK.

281~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What i kept thinking.

282~~~
He was my MOTM. Considering the fact that he hasn't played a single proper preseason game with his team mates. Doesn't speak English. Didn't know that he was playing until a couple of days before. Making his PL debut at OT with lots of pressure and focus on him. He did really well all things considered. Performance will definitely give him (and his team mates) confidence. He'll have bigger tests ahead but it was a solid start.

Also, do adidas do a short-sleeved version of the GK shirt? We can't have him wearing that improvised version which looked like he's been hacking at the sleeves with a blunt knife every week can we?

283~~~
I don't like the way he parries all his saves back into dangerous areas.

284~~~
You're just afraid to live life on the edge.

285~~~
I thought the same thing. I commented during the game that he looks like he's just having a kick about with his mates down the park.

He was getting closed down by attackers and looked carefree.

286~~~
Agree with all of this. I wouldn't buy Cillessen if De Gea goes.

287~~~
The biggest concerning thing with him might be his temperament. I don't think he has been tested for an entire season. Even though he is a first choice NT keeper he is yet to be tested temperamentally for the course of 9-10 months given that he was second choice at his last 2 clubs.

288~~~
He plays like me at the goal when attackers close in on me. In my head I panic but then I make a cool pass to a teammate like there's nothing to it. And people sometimes say - wov how cool headed that pass was. And they dont know what went in my head.

289~~~
That's ok, actions matter more <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

290~~~
I thought he was decent with his feet. From watching him at the WC my main worry was his habit of palming saves back into dangerous areas. He kind of did it once against Spurs but he also held onto the ball when he really needed to. Which was reassuring.

291~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

292~~~
He was mine too. Given the occasion I thought he did really well when you consider the other points that you mention. Hopefully it will be a sign of things to come.

293~~~
I hope Romero doesn't lose his place when the transfer window is over if he continues doing well! He's still relatively young for a goalkeeper.

294~~~
2 games, 2 clean sheets <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

295~~~
Wasn't really tested but did everything needed of him, good performance.

296~~~
Every time the ball comes over, he collects. Which is what I thought he'd have trouble with, coming to a new league where you have to be on alert with all the balls being whipped in. Cant slag him off at all.

297~~~
He makes Dave look nervous on the ball. He must be high or something

298~~~
Looks calm enough on the ball and his height reassures me on high balls. I like him.

299~~~
Hes actually exceptional with the ball at his feet and distribution in general. I feel like a dick head for worrying about him in the side

300~~~
Doesn't look overly bothered does he? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Nothing in terms of difficult saves but doing what he needs to do right now. Defence is making his life piss easy.

301~~~
Relaxed and good performance. Didnt have much to do but what he had to do he did good.

302~~~
He does all his mistakes in the warm up. Good tactic.

303~~~
Hes doing okay so far but we need to wait to see how he does under a lot of pressure. continuous shots on goal, continuous crosses, continuous 1 on 1 situations etc. we'll see.

304~~~
He looks massive. Huge presence at set piece. Better than coming off his line than De Gea. Not seen enough of his shot stopping to judge that, but he did well at that against Spurs.

305~~~
Nothing to do, but everything he's doing is right.

306~~~
Agree. I like his calm nature, and starting position is excellent

307~~~
Lets be honest, he's been a lot better than we expected him to be. Pleasantly surprised with him so far. Yes he's not had that much to do (particularly tonight) but he can play the ball around well, if a bit too risky at times, and has kept concentration well. Mainly though he's impressed from crosses, I expected him to be a bit of a flapper.

308~~~
Leading for golden glove <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

309~~~
Good on crosses so far.

310~~~
With our back 4 now, I think we have reduced the continuos flow of shots

311~~~
Cool as feck. Almost like he's taking the piss.

We will need to see him more to finally judge but the early signs are really promising.

312~~~
Could have sat on the goal line playing command and conquer on his iphone tonight.

313~~~
His nonchalance makes him look like the Berbatov of goalkeepers.

314~~~
He's not a flapper, which is satisfying as this is what worried me the most upon arrival.

He gives the impression that he's going to make an arse of every kick but that's probably just his style.

315~~~
This place is going to implode once he concedes a goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

316~~~
You shouldn't feel bad, I saw him play a fair amount of time and couldn't tell how good he was on the ball, I knew he wasn't bad but I didn't realized how good he was. The one thing I remember is that he is good at starting counter attacks.

317~~~
Dave hasn't had 2 clean sheets in his first 2 games of the season since being with us, get rid of Dave!

In all seriousness, looks good so far. Will reserve the true judgement when he starts getting some real pressure on a regular basis (some parts of the Tottenham game saw him face this, and he dealt well with it in fairness).

318~~~
He did face a bit of pressure here, but seemed to keep his cool.
I want to see how he does in the CL game.

319~~~
There was a backpass in that game where he was daydreaming and reacted really late. It feels like hes a disaster waiting to happen but he does have good starting positions and looks really secure on crosses.

320~~~
So far so good. He can only get better and if DDG leaves, it's ok if he takes over. He could be a bit lees laid-back imo though

321~~~
He hasn't been tested yet in either games. Still want this De Gea situation sorted either way asap.

322~~~
If you go pick every minor mistakes, you will find one for even neuer.

323~~~
He's seems to mouth off more than Dave and he's been here about 3 weeks. Good lad.

324~~~
In fairness to him, he's played in a World Cup final, so he has no right to be overwhelmed by the Premiership. And Van Gaal believes in him. He looks like he's cool as feck. The likes of away to Villa are the games you should be making mistakes in. But he's done great.

325~~~
I hope we continue to not give him anything to do and never have to find out how much of a weaklink he might be. He's done well so far though.

326~~~
Have to give him credit for his handling so far, I know he hasn't been tested but I was worried about him on the basics.

327~~~
From the reactions when we signed him from the experts on here, they had me slightly concerned he was going to be a calamity to be honest. He's not been tested greatly but a nervous keeper can make even the most basic stuff look difficult - De Gea used to hesitate coming off his line to collect through balls that were clearly there to be collected for example. There's none of that, he looks composed and confident in everything he's doing - he's got a good frame to deal with aerial balls as well.

328~~~
Since getting through those shaky first 20 minutes on his debut, hes looked solid when called upon. Kept it simple, nothing crazy, and it helps when he has a solid defence ahead of him.

329~~~
Where are the experts now?

330~~~
Didn't have much to do last night.

331~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/DIUFslt.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/DIUFslt.jpg"/> 
Literally his only expression                                                                                                                                                        <span style="color: #ffffff"> (in the figurative sense)</span>

332~~~
Two games, two clean sheets. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Should have put him in my fantasy team.

333~~~
When I saw that, feck me. Just as I was telling my mate he's really good at the basics. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

334~~~
Made a horror pass to Carrick that could have led to a goal. Other than that was fine, but had nothing serious to do.

The long-term evidence is that he's a number 2 in terms of quality. No shame in that; Reina, Ter Stegen/Bravo, Cech, Cudicini, Lopez and others have had or look likely to have better careers than Romero and have all been backups for big teams lately.

335~~~
It seems he was told not play those chip passes and try to find a player. Played lot of long balls compared to most of our games in recent times (from a GK).

336~~~
Looks very composed imo, good off the line, catches crosses without problem, so far so good.

337~~~
Not much to do but another clean sheet and distribution as improved.Tougher tests await.

338~~~
He looked like a deer in the headlights for the first 10 or 20 minutes against Spurs, but he's not put a foot wrong since. If we do lose DDG I wont be against giving him a shot at the Number 1 spot. 

He's also massively helping our negotiating position with DDG.

339~~~
I think he's used to making such passes while playing for Argentina. He plays running passes to Mascherano, who then is at better angle to pass the ball forward with him facing forward. Our forwards were a little guilty of not making runs to keeping the midfielders occupied which allowed Villa to press Carrick and almost led to the disastrous condition. With better movement from forward, such type of passing can have its advantages for much quicker transition.

340~~~
So far so good.

Not heavily tested yet and that's a credit to our midfield and defense.

Anyway he looks cool as feck in goal.

341~~~
All these people saying Romero is yet to be tested at the big games, this guy is an Olympic gold medalist and played all the way to the Finals of the World Cup and Copa America.  I would argue he is more well tested in the big times, "when it really matters", than he is on the normal week-to-week games.

And I finally found a picture of him being happy <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s.ndtvimg.com/images/content/2014/jul/806/sergio-romero.jpg" src="http://s.ndtvimg.com/images/content/2014/jul/806/sergio-romero.jpg"/>

342~~~
He smiles less then valencia.

Thats saying something

343~~~
He seems to really admire Van Gaal:


<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/sergio-romero-owe-louis-van-6257502" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mirror</a>

344~~~
His positioning has been superb so far. And as far as I remember from his games for Argentina, he has a very good reflex also.

Also, he's so calm and imposing on the goal. Never thought I've seen that when playing for his NT.

345~~~
Looks like a fat guy that lost weight.

346~~~
So far he's had little to do, but when he has been called upon to catch crosses or come for balls his handling has been without fault. Saying that I think the fact many of us were so nervous about his inclusion with his reputation of having a lack of concentration may be influencing our perception of his performances.

There are times when he needs to act more as a sweeper keeper with Smalling expecting him to be rushing out, but we saw the same with De Gea and the understanding will come with time. However, I still wouldn't be comfortable with him being the number 1 for the entire season. I still feel he has a mistake in him. This was exemplified in the pre-match warm-up against villa where a tame shot to his feet was spilled into the net Taibi style. His real test will obviously come when we face an attack minded team, but so far you can't really fault him. Some of the abuse he was getting on this board prior to kicking a ball was shameful.

347~~~
His handling on crosses has been good. I get that he's not been tested 100% yet, but other "new" keepers to the league have flapped at the simplest of crosses in their starts in this league. He's done good so far.

348~~~
^^ agreed. That 'new' Arsenal Gk, for example...

349~~~
I felt his understanding with our defence has been great..  He looks calm and composed and the defence picks that up.  Hasn't been tested much but looks in command and when called upon to save, catch or kick he's been great..

350~~~
Doesnt he look like he has exceptionally long arms/reach? Great attribute to have in a basketball player and a goalie I guess.

351~~~
I feel sorry for Romero after reading that interview. He didn't have any other offers even though he played 2 of the biggest international offers. LvG knows him and gave him a chance and I'm sure he will give his 200% every game. 

I felt the kind of abuse he got here when he signed was unparliamentary. It wasn't his fault that we signed him and he wasn't going to refuse us especially when he had no club. He may not be the best keeper in the world but no way is he a incompetent buffoon like was being made out here. And I'm happy that LvG is getting his rewards for trusting him. Hope he continues this.

352~~~
He's just very calm by the looks of it.

Doesn't seem like he gets flustered much, it can give me a semi heart attack at times, but that's his nature. Seems very confident, which is good.

353~~~
Why would Maradona want to have a conversation with the devil?

354~~~
Yeah he's actually frighteningly too cool. Almost have to wonder what goes on in his head.

355~~~
If he wasn't a professional, I'd say he was high as feck. He's motionless <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

356~~~
I'm still convinced hes a coke head from off the street that we cleaned up and put in goal.

357~~~
He'll end up being our #1 for a while I reckon.  DDG is going this summer or next, and this guy I think will prove himself.  As someone said he's an 'Olympic gold medalist and played all the way to the Finals of the World Cup and Copa America.'  Everyone has a shaky start here because how big the club is, but I feel he's going to settle well.

358~~~
It seems like LVG has a human side after all. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

359~~~
He makes me nervous. Maybe when the window shuts and all eyes come off him a bit i can stop changing my undies at half time.

360~~~
From wikipedia
A little loco but that defence record is something even in a below-par league esp the one which focuses on attack so much.
Tbh, I have seen the recent Argentina side to be a solid defensive unit and that is unlikely to happen without a quality goal keeper. A bad goal keeper (or an uncertain) one makes the entire defense nervous.

Every goalkeeper makes mistake and there is a few mistakes even in the best of keeper. Romero looks a good goalkeeper and he is not as mistake prone as we make out him to be from the youtube blooper videos. Plus he has the attributes to play in a high line.

361~~~
Are you sure that's to do with Romero?

362~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

363~~~
All these people being made to feel 'nervous' at Romero is just because, in my opinion, because the media have told everyone that he is supposed to make us nervous. He has been nothing but calmness personified in his two games so far in my opinion, and I have been pleasantly surprised with how he has played.

From what I've seen, he controls his area, is confident with his kicking, even if he doesn't have 100% pass accuracy as some seem to demand. When he has been called upon to make actual saves, he has done that well enough.

He may not be as good as De Gea, but it seems that, much to the disappointment of everyone looking in, there is no calamity to see here - at least on first viewings.

364~~~
I agree, lots of scare mongering about him, and he has done a good job and looked calm. Not fussed about him tbh, also we seems to have a more solid team infront of him too which helps.

365~~~
This 100%. I don't feel nervous with him in goal at all. I'll admit the most I've ever seen of him at any one stretch were international tournaments. Don't think he's in De Gea's class but he's above anyone else we have as back up.

366~~~
I'm still a bit nervous, we'll have to wait and see until we face a real attacking team. He did well after a bit of uneasiness against Spurs and was barely tested against Villa.

367~~~
I'll be honest... My concerns came solely from the media telling us he was a mistake waiting to happen. I've never seen him play and of course YouTube videos can always be made to make a player look good or bad. 

It didn't help that he wasn't first choice for Monaco so you wonder how can he be good enough to potentially be our number one.

However from the last two appearances I've been very impressed. He looks calm and like he feels he belongs in the shirt. In fact from crosses and long balls he looks more comfortable that De Gea still. De Gea still doesn't fill me with complete confidence at crosses.

By the way I'm not saying Romero is the better keeper because he's not. But he looks more physically imposing.

368~~~
He has this way of standing over the ball that's so... I don't know, nonchalant? The way he kicks the ball is even more so <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

369~~~
He was a sub at Monaco cause Subašić is a very very good keeper. 
And I'm not saying that cause he's Croatian. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

370~~~
Bit of an idiot.

371~~~
Looked a very soft goal to concede. Not a massive amount of pace on the ball and deflection was far out. Big brain fart as well where they almost scored. Pretty inexplicable that one - could see all of the play in front of him, must've literally not have been paying attention.

372~~~
..likes to daydream it seems !!

373~~~
He isn't good enough.

374~~~
There is a costly mistake coming somewhere.

375~~~
He seems to have the Mangala's or the Blackett's if you like, the lack of urgency at an inappropriate time.

376~~~
Bad reflexes for the first goal, dodgy positioning and a brainfart almost made it 2:2

377~~~
How could anyone blame him for the 1st goal..?

378~~~
Think deep down we all know it.

379~~~
No way, that was all on Carrick. And the second chance was the midfielder (who was it?) who made a shite back pass.

380~~~
He's far too casual.

That said, anyone blaming him for the first goal needs to book an appointment with their doctor. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

381~~~
They tried to blame him for the goal, WTF <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

382~~~
It wasn't particularly fast ball. A keeper with better reflexes would have kept it out. 

Schneiderlin made the pass, however instead of running towards the ball he was stepping backwards and made the whole situation.

383~~~
Not at fault for first. All on Carrick. 

The brainfart was criminal though. At first I thought Schneiderlin had given him a hospital pass, but he just didn't react to a perfectly ok back-pass. 

Hopefully goes back to boring confidence inspiring solidity against Newcastle.

384~~~
Schneiderlin. The pass was a bit short but he could've handled it without a problem, had he not made a few steps backwards, waiting for the ball. It was stupid. I don't blame him for the 1st goal though.

385~~~
There were two deflections iirc for the first goal, first from Adnan and then Carrick. How the feck can you blame him for the goal? Yea, there was a brainfart from him in the second half, not sure whether it was due to lack of communication or whatever but that's it.

Not to mention that Carrick was testing him today before as well with that shit backpass he's made.

386~~~
You guys are seriously criticizing him undeservedly.

Their goal came from a double deflection. No keeper would have stopped that.

His mistake in the second half is a mistake few keepers can avoid. It's the mistake of not being too involved in the match and suddenly being called into action.

It is a concentration issue, even De Gea had it in his first season. Top clubs often work on the concentration of their keepers because usually they have nothing to do for 15 to 20 minutes before suddenly being called into action. This can be worked on. It also isn't his fault because most of the clubs he's been at don't have the luxury of complete control for 15-20 minute periods so he isn't used to this much static from the goalkeeper perspective.

387~~~
Thought he did fine. Can't blame him for Carrick's brainfart nor Schneiderlin's backpass.

388~~~
Agree that the goal was Carrick's fault not Romero's. The crazy back-pass situation was more Romero than Schneiderlin but neither did well in that particular situation. Very lucky he got fouled otherwise we could easily have conceded another after his poor clearance.

389~~~
Apart from going to sleep for that back pass, he was OK.

That goal wasn't his fault. He was in the middle of the goal for the free kick, which is normal and suffered two deflections.

390~~~
Terrible positioning for the free kick that led to the first. Cover the near post is basics as a keeper that said Carrick was also positioned poorly and lost his footing when attempting to correct it.  The pass back.... Wow! That was Sunday league stuff, come out and meet the ball, was he clocking somebody in the crowd or something!? Ridiculous.

391~~~
feck off to anyone who blames him for the first goal. I was at a bar and as soon as Michael Owen initially criticised him, the outcries of "feck off Owen" rightly came. Glad he eventually changed his mind. Whoever blames Romero for that is a bitter idiot. 

He escaped it massively for feigning an injury half way through the second half. Got himself out of that one. Still thought he was solid apart from that mishap and was surprised how good his distribution was today. Handled well too.

392~~~
Replays showed he was actually stamped on to be fair.

393~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Very true

394~~~
The first goal was never his fault. Though that moment where he got stamped on was a bit worrying for me, he took a step back for some reason?

395~~~

396~~~
Only one mistake and it wasn't the goal !!

397~~~
Maybe, it looked very tame though. Was after he hit the ball to their player anyway. Horrid clearance. Nevertheless, good game apart from that moment.

398~~~
He's been fine and looks a very useful backup but if we go into the season with him as first choice we'll be throwing away any chance of winning the title.

399~~~
I wouldn't blame him for the first goal but I think he could have done better, he seems to be day dreaming when ball is played back to him and was lucky to get away with it today. Its still too early to judge him but I still don't see him as being anywhere near good enough to be our number one.

400~~~
Still not convinced by him, he's done ok better than expected but there is a complete brain fart coming from him sometime soon.

401~~~
This

402~~~
My biggest concern going into this season.

403~~~
Some of you couldn't wait for that..

Blaming him for the goal even..

404~~~
I can't blame him for the goal but the bold <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

405~~~
Disaster waiting to happen.

His concentration levels are awful.

We need this De Gea situation sorted asap.

406~~~
Makes me so nervy

407~~~
Long term he is not the answer and I think van Gaal knows that. From what I have seen of him so far he is solid enough but unspectacular.

His positioning for the goal we conceded tonight definitely has to be questioned, there was a huge gap left there and Club Brugge capitalised on that albeit with a hint of good fortune.

408~~~
I'm very, very worried that he'll be Van Gaal's first choice keeper if De Gea goes, until January at least. He's extremely dodgy. What the feck was he doing today when Darmian passed it back?

If De Gea goes even this week, it's too late. We won't find a good replacement with less than 2 weeks til the window shuts, and be stuck with this guy in net. It's so important for our season that we keep De Gea.

409~~~
Did anyone else notice De Gea and Valdes giggling and chatting amongst themselves after Romero stalled when Darmian passed it back. Found it quite annoying actually.

410~~~
I've been happy with him so far. I don't blame him for the goal. The only dodgy point was when he waited too long to boot it out and got fouled. Some of you are a bit OTT with the criticism.

411~~~
Yeh I noticed that, it probably was completely unrelated but just gave me a bad feeling.

412~~~
Hopefully that was the wake-up call he needed to stop his dithering. Other than that, quite hard to judge his performance. I think he did alright.

413~~~
He did okay. One shaky moment.

He does in general take an age to kick the ball as an opposing forward closes him down. Makes me nervous every time.

414~~~
We can go overboard both with criticising and defending him. Can't we just agree that he's an okay keeper but no world-beater? It's hard after watching DDG, but we've survived with worse.

415~~~
Suspect positioning and reflexes on the goal and lack of anticipation on the Darmian backpass that should have led to a second for Brugge, but he's only ever supposed to be a #2 so long term it's hopefully not an issue.

416~~~
I'm not convinced he's good enough to be second choice, personally.

417~~~
Really? I'd argue he was well positioned given where the danger was expected to come from, i.e. not Michael Carrick!

418~~~
He was at no fault for the goal.

The backpass hesitancy was poor though. Could've cost us.

419~~~
His positioning was fine for the goal and the double deflection made it almost impossible to stop.

420~~~
Exactly, even world class keepers can get done in a situation like that. Do people on this board not realise that it's quite hard to shift momentum from side to side that quickly?

421~~~
Yeah he was positioned to where the ball was played, had it covered perfectly. 2 deflections' so 100% not at fault for the goal, but some on here only post when they have something to complain about, even if they have to make shit up....

422~~~
Pass back aside he was fine! Owen blaming him for the goal was laughable!

423~~~
He was ok bar his odd decision making from the back pass from Darmian. He certainly doesn't instil any confidence in me though and he's obviously a massive downgrade on DDG.

424~~~
I don't know enough about him to judge in the longer term but feck, he's making me nervous at the moment.

I wish he just wouldn't dally on the ball so much when it's at his feet.

425~~~
He got blamed for Carrick school boy mistake which is understandable since the English media and fans tend to love wanking at their own players

426~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Cheers devilish, you're so much more intelligent than all the English fans who love the English players. Look how much this English forum hypes up Wayne Rooney and Phil Jones as further proof of this.

427~~~
I hope he's not our Keeper all season. The way he was slow to react to the back pass was scary. If it's the premier league, they wouldn't have blow for that incident and those guys would have equalize.

428~~~
There's nothing wrong in loving players. The trouble begins when you hype them and close an eye to their mistakes. That certainly doesn't help them. Just take the Italian side. Players are criticised throughout their career and criticism hasn't spare the legends either (Del Piero, Cannavaro, Baggio and Totti had all being criticised at one point of their career). Guess what, Italy won 4 WC titles, the last two came just after 2 major football scandals which placed every one under question and forced the players to prove themselves. What had England achieved with their white Pele, the new Duncan Edwards, Captain Fantastic, Mr Chelsea and the HurryKane? You know the answer.

Ironically the only Italian player I can think off who avoided criticism, at least in his early stages of his career was.......Balotelli. As they say spare the rod...

429~~~
That's fantastic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

430~~~
Michael Owen made a right wanker of himself last night.

You sense that any goal we concede is going to be blamed on Romero regardless of the circumstances. The goal was a freak, and his positioning was fine.

431~~~
Was he the same guy who kept wanking at Carrick's pass while nearly ignoring Depay's wonder goal?

432~~~
And ignoring Shaw's run and just going on about Rooney's flick to Memphis.

433~~~
Terrified he's going to cost us soon. I was supporting him on here but concentration as a goalkeeper is paramount and he simply does not have it. He's way too relaxed, even his passing to me looks lackadaisical in style. VDS used to say it was even more important as a United keeper as you've often have nothing to do for long periods.

434~~~
If de gea goes navas will be our first choice keeper

435~~~
Needs to stop smoking a massive joint before coming out to play professional football.

436~~~
I don't agree that it wasnt the keepers fault. Freak deflection but he left far too much of his near post open - and it took him an age to get down to the ball. 

Looks lethargic, and frankly that isnt going to inspire confidence in the players in front. That's the key issue for a keeper for me. If the centre-backs can rely on him the defence overall looks much more solid.

437~~~
But imho he was a bit slow to react. 
You cant blame him for that goal but i have a feeling a better keeper would have saved that.

438~~~
I thought the the ball in back pass got held up somehow. It seemed good weght, then just freakishly turned into a slug.

439~~~
Not really tested tbh apart from Michael. He does some good things, other times he will be the death of me. Worry when he actually comes up against a team that is actually good. Swansea might be a watch from behind the sofa game.

440~~~
I wouldn't be too worried about the back pass incident in fact I'd nearly look at it in a positive light. He got himself into a rut and the type of a rut that's liable to happen the best in the business, but he managed to get himself out of it just as fast as he got into it, and for me that's the main thing.

441~~~
What the feck is this thing where he takes half an hour to boot the ball, whilst the opposition are chasing him down?!

442~~~
Complaining for the sake of it...

If he's being faulted for the goal, well this forum is taking nonsense to a whole new level. The ball changed directions twice, with the second change being quite big. Some also need to understand it takes time, as it did with De Gea. This is a keeper who's hardly played club football over the past few seasons, and is now playing for one of the biggest teams on the planet. I mean, he must be as shocked as some of us, gone from the bench at Sampdoria to replacing one of the best keepers in the world at Man United.

443~~~
He can't win, can he? People will complain about lack of composure if he panics and hoofs the ball instantly at every opportunity. On the flip side people criticise him for being too casual and calm with the ball. Personally, bar that incident yesterday I think he has been great with the ball at his feet. I love how calm he is and he mostly picks a great pass and we keep possession. But he's not De Gea so there'll be a mass call for him to go the first time we concede because of a mistake he makes

444~~~
Nah, if he was covering the near post to any great extent it would have been a mistake. 99.9% of the time that free kick is being floated central or towards the back post and he needs to position himself for that. The freak deflections just make it impossible for him.

The only problem I've had with him in the three games so far is his dawdling on that one back pass last night. I'm sure most keepers have had a dodgy moment or two in that time so I can't say I've seen too much to worry me yet. It just seems like wibbling for the the sake of wibbling at times.

445~~~
Maybe he just needs more games to build up his confidence. I'm willing to give him more time despite some dodgy issues

446~~~
Needs that communication with the back four ironed out.

447~~~
I disagree. Its not a fatal mistake but a mistake nonetheless. And as I said - he seemed to take an age to actually realise what was happening and get down.

Overall he's clearly a decent keeper, but he looks very much like he's ponderous on the ball and has a mistake in him and as I said, that doesn't breed confidence in front. The trust between a keeper and the back four is key to having a solid defence.

448~~~
Its a huge step back from De Gea when we've taken so long to find a decent keeper who can be relied upon.

If Van Gaal goes into the season with Romero as number one - which is looking likely given that De Gea is likely to leave, then its another example of him trying to be too clever. There are better keepers out there than him not least Lloris who would jump at the chance to be playing for a top side and has the talent and experience to do it.

449~~~
It's not so easy. On one hand, we have no idea if we keep DDG or not. To deal with Spurs is tricky. And there are not that many class goalkeepers around. So why not play a decent one and spend big next year when we know for sure that DDG is off...

450~~~
If you think there's any chance that de Gea won't be moving to Real either this summer or on a free next year (with a giant signing on fee) then you're mad. There's been no chance of him signing a new contract for ages. You can assume "for sure" that he's off.

And it would have been easy had this all been resolved earlier in the summer. As it stands we've arsed about regarding Ramos which was likely never going to happen and will still lose De Gea anyway. Selling him now we might get a bigger fee - but lose a quality keeper with an uphill task of replacing him and being left with a bloke who couldn't get a regualr spot at Sampdoria and who'll be pointed out as a weak link by every team we face.

It seems De Gea will get to move to Real by all accounts. The club should have set a deadline to get the deal done, failing which he has to stay. That gives time to get our house in order before the season starts.

451~~~
I honestly don`t understand why he is even in the club. He looks about as good as Taibi did and we could honestly play Sam or Anders before him which probably was/is on a lower paied contract, is already in the team/know the squad and is just overall better!  Even if we should lose DDG and be left with "only" those two + juniors it would honestly not be a disastrous situation especially Lindegaard could and probably would do a good (enaugh) job and as mentioned, he already know the players which in itself is a great advantage. And he loves the club wholeheartedly (United supporter).

452~~~
Who would have stopped that double deflection then?

453~~~
He's already got himself in to a bad spot with the media, the criticism from them is going to be unbearable all season no matter how he performs (a bit like the first couple of years for DDG). The announcers last night mentioned how dodgy he was with the ball at his feet absolutely every time it was dropped to him.

454~~~
Sorry, but it's not a mistake at all. He was positioned correctly for the free-kick and was left helpless when the ball took two deflections moving it in opposition directions. Not even De Gea would have been able to do anything about it.

455~~~
Pretty much. The narrative has been set and everyone is just waiting for something so they can pile on. It's all a bit unseemly, especially when our own fans are willing to lap it up as well.

456~~~
Again, I disagree. And as I said twice - it wasnt just that, which you're entitled to your opinion on, but how slow he was in reacting.

457~~~
You are forgetting one minor obstacle

458~~~
That's how it is at United - especially if you've come in to repalce a quality keeper. We saw it with everyone who came in after Schmeichel until Van Der Sar, and as you said, De Gea had it as well. Being able to handle that is a big issue playing in goal for a top club becuase you're always under scrutiny.

The problem here is that he's got no pedigree to speak of, nor is he a young lad with bags of potential like De Gea was. He was signed because Van Gaal knew him and he was on a free.

459~~~
There's been talk of him having an agreement with Spurs that if a Champions League club come in for him then he can go for a set fee although I obviously don't know if that's right.

As it is a top keeper would be worth more to us than he'd probably cost to buy from Spurs anyway. There's a tipping point for any player and the tipping point for a keeper - especially one who wants to go is likely to be less than outfield players. What would he go for - £25 million? Its worth every penny if you're filling a gap you need to fill.

And the big issue is this could all have been done by now anyway.

460~~~
He wasnt at fault for the goal, but his lazyness and general coolness will cost us eventually. It was coming, he will never be good enough to be No1 here. 

Surprised at the overreaction on here, thats what is to expect from Romero every few games. His lapses of concentration are well known, decent keeper on the line, but he has problems with the easy things everyone expects a GK to handle easily.

461~~~
Obviously I meant this summer. Hence I said we can wait until next summer when he will be off the latest

462~~~
If we had him in goals for a year the amount of errors he would make would have us dropping like flies with heart attacks and rage.

463~~~
He looks like Beria on a bad day.

464~~~
Clearly that's why LvG bought him - to make loads of errors and sabotage our chances of success.

465~~~
It was completely fine. Its actually disgusting that anyone would insinuate that he was at fault for the goal.

466~~~
He has good qualities that would make a number 2 but as our number 1 he is such a downgrade on De Gea.

467~~~
I doubt he was bought to be a #1 although if De Gea leaves, who ever replaces him will have to fight Romero for the job.

468~~~
Now I've heard it all.

469~~~
Who did that then? He was covering the left of his goal and there was no way he could have saved Carrick's deflection. I thought he did all right. Bit slow at coming for the odd back pass but coaching can fix that.

470~~~
Complete nonsense.

471~~~
Jesus, the guy has taken Argentina to consecutive Copa America finals as well as a World Cup final in between and he´s about as good as Taibi? Ffs . . .

472~~~
Might be no harm to keep him in goals for a year so. Get rid of all the clowns that are fond of making mountains out of molehills.

473~~~
Heh. I like you thinking.

Didnt really agree with goal-keeping analyst extraordinaire, Michael fecking Owen, putting that rick all on Romero's shoulders last night. Morgan sold him short, badly. Romero was caught on his heels but if I was the keeper I'd chew the ear off the player that underhit the back-pass after the game.

474~~~
To be honest most GKs will be a downgrade on DDG. Most likely anyone we buy won't be as good and any GK that is close will cost a LOT, especially as most teams are aware we need a keeper and the fact that Ed looks making it rain with notes. 

Don't get me wrong, I would love a solid GK but realistically, there aren't that many options out there.

475~~~
I wouldn't ave been surprised to see De Gea save it. I didn't expect Romero to save it but I would hardly call it unstoppable.

476~~~
Of course it was an exaggeration, but it was to make a point out of the fact that in my honest opinion he has looked both shaky and unable to communicate sufficiently with the defence.

477~~~
Think it was Darmian, unless we're talking about different backpasses. It wasn't really underhit, Romero had plenty of time - time that he wasted standing still, waiting for the ball to come to him. That's not being caught on your heels, that's just completely misreading the situation.

478~~~
I thought it was Schneiderlin. Could be wrong about that. Was definitely underhit though.

479~~~
For a guy who was twiddling his thumbs in a different country a mere few weeks ago, he's looked pretty stable.

480~~~
I have no issues with Romero.
In fact, now that we are playing without DDG (who IMO is the best GK in the World), I think we will be fine without him.
The first goal he leaked in 270 minutes, wasn't his fault - it was a double deflection.
DDG would be proud to let in only 1 goal in 270 minutes.

I'd like to see us either keep DDG or we use Romero in goal for the remainder of the year.

481~~~
Do you think Lloris is not error prone? The guy had so many errors last season that I lost count. He isn't all that what is being made out at all. At least Romero was free.

482~~~
Most of the criticism he gets is unreasonable. No he is no De Gea and no he may not be on the level of Lloris. But blaming him for a double deflection makes zero fecking sense. That is just taking the piss for the sake of it. 

He may seem to be somewhat shaky at times, but he has made good saves and little mistakes. Ofcourse his distribution could be better, but it isnt a disaster either. If DDG had the exact same performances the past 3 games as Romero had nobody would have been on the he is playing awful bandwagon. On top of that, he needs some time to adjust and gain confidence or have we already forgotten the first two seasons of David? 

Also the communication between our defenders will and must get better. We have an entirely new defense, which is also rather young. I have the utmost faith in them, they deserved it with how they have been playing the past games.

483~~~
He doesn't even look shaky. All he does is look for a pass and then try and play it instead of lumping it out. I can pretty much guarantee that if it was De Gea putting in the exact same performances there would be nothing said about our goalkeeper. He can't win no matter what at the minute due to the situation he was brought into.

484~~~
He has done pretty good so far. 
yesterday's goal is hardly his fault.

485~~~
iirc, the speed of the ball changed drastically, I think that the grass was higher, close to the goals.

486~~~
Exactly. I know it's only a couple of games but if he carries on in the same form then he could save us a boatload of cash.

487~~~
I'll take a free Romero over a 30M Lloris (who's not even world class) anytime

488~~~
Valdes is a far better keeper than Romero and it's absurd to me why he isn't playing.

489~~~
He's impressed me when I've seen him. He's one of the best keepers in the league for me.

And you're entitiled to your opinion. Whether he's "world class" - whatever that actually means - He's miles better than Romero.

Seems clear that Romero is going to have lapses in concentration, hence why he's not been a regular for a while. In watching United for years it seems that we win things with quality keepers and don't with dodgy keepers. Just like most good sides.

As I said above the relationship between the keeper and back four is based on trust and without it the defensive unit doesn't work half as well.

And if Lloris isn't what you want, what about Cech moving for a song earlier in the summer? My point was that this could have been solved months ago one way or another. The fact that it hasn't is another example of the club's inability to be decisive when it's needed.

It's so frustrating as a fan. It took years to get a decent reliable keeper in Van Der Sar. Then we get De Gea and make progress - and now we're lumbered with a cast off from a mid table side in Italy. United should be better than that frankly. It's one step forward two back.

491~~~
Romero was bought as a replacement for Valdes, we can't make our new number one signing until the DDG situation is resolved. This is the only reason Romero is playing, but props where they are due, he's done very well. I'd still rather have him as number one for a season than spend a fortune on a soon to be 29 year old and overrated Lloris. Im pretty sure Romero won't be our number one unless he really impresses. He's not as bad as people like you make him.

492~~~
Lloris is not overrated. He's excellent.

493~~~
I strongly disagree. Is he worth 25-30M? Excellent is what DDG, Courtois and Neuer are. Lloris is not even close

494~~~
Yes.

495~~~
Lloris was better than Courtois last season.

About Romero, he has been very good for us since his arrival. Very happy with his performances.

496~~~
We're not signing him

497~~~
I never said we were.

498~~~
Last season.

There are more mistakes. Vs city for the aguero goal , another goal vs Stoke where he got beaten when the guy was 2 inches from him or so. He isn't all that world class at all.

499~~~
Looked to me like he was just daydreaming there.  He initially took a step backwards when the ball was played back to him.  If that had led to a goal, I'd be much more upset with Romero than Darmian.  Bit ironic as the reason he's in there is due to DDG's supposed inability to focus and concentrate 100%.

500~~~
he has been more than okay imo.

still hoping de gea will stay though.

501~~~
Another huge howler against Stoke last game but he was lucky it wasn't punished. I'll be very annoyed if we replace DDG with feckin' Lloris.

502~~~
Yeah Lloris is dodgy. Comes off his life when he really shouldn't and ends up in no mans land.

503~~~
Lloris is overrated, he fancies himself as a sweeper keeper yet can't play that role at all, not to mention he has far too many mistakes in him.

504~~~
One day he'll scuff a back pass and it'll roll into the net. Like an 80% chance.

505~~~
And that's fine - he's a perfectly able number 2. But as it stands De Gea has been frozen out along with Valdes, leaving him the only viable option with a couple of weeks left in the window. 

If you'd rather have the money in the bank than a better number 1 then fair enough. I personally think relying on a substandard keeper is asking for trouble. Teams will identify the weak link and go after it. And we'll make no progress from where we were last year. 

The bottom line for me is that it's been obvious since last year that De Gea wanted away and wouldn't sign a new deal. The club needed to set a deadline past which he wouldn't be allowed to go - instead it looks like he'll go even if we can't find a replacement leaving us short in a key position yet again.

506~~~
With each passing day it's looking increasingly likely that De Gea will stay beyond the transfer window, but LVG is being careful and giving Romero some experience in case De Gea does leave. Im pretty sure that after September 1 DDG will reclaim his place in the team, but Romero will be given more chances too during the season

You hope it happens too don't you? Just so you can tell us 'I told you so'.

507~~~
Depends what you believe in the press. It seems he can go if United's demands are met. Do you think the club will turn down £25 million and watch him walk for free? I personally doubt it. 

My point is that it shouldn't be getting to this stage. If it's too late to find a replacement then it's too late to sell him and that should be that.

508~~~
It would be madness to sell DDG at this point.

509~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33986096" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33986096</a>

So basically he wants to sit on the bench for the year?

510~~~
How so?

511~~~
Well that's probably the wrong way to look at what he said. He's hardly going to come out and say he hopes De Gea leaves is he?

512~~~
He should probably just not have said anything?

513~~~
Although Romero hasnt put a foot wrong till now I think we should get another nr. 1 or he shouldnt be one to put it differently. DDG is still our nr. 1, Madrid doesnt want to pay what we ask for and even if they do it now it's too late for us to buy another keeper.

514~~~
I think DDG is on his way out, i don't see him getting back into the team, and I'm not too bothered about it anymore - he has served the club well and we should be able to cash in on him.

Romero has been shaky in every match and i expect him to make a couple of blunders this season, he isn't perfect but he will do for now, we still have a young Johnstone, an experienced Lindergaard and Valdes (yes,Valdes), Valdes and Romero would look so much better if he can just come to an understanding with LVG, he really hasn't done anything to suggest is he not good enough.

Signing Lloris is still an option too.

515~~~
Valdes didnt get a number and he's practically out of the club although he's still on our books. 
You think we could sign Lloris this late in the TW?

516~~~
I'm sorry, but what?

517~~~
People imagine and predict he's shaky, so he must be shaky, regardless of what actually happens in real life.

Makes sense.

518~~~
He probably blames him for the Carrick OG. 

Michael Owen was giving him the majority of the blame, this should tell you all you need to know about that situation.

519~~~
Shaky not bad, and no I haven't blamed him for anything don't put words in my mouth.

He has been good but at certain moments in all our games he has been shaky, which is perfectly normal but it doesn't mean I won't mention it, I was actually happy with the signing and I have no problem with him starting for us.

520~~~
I don't think we can get Lloris this late,still a possibility though.

As for Valdes, I guess he is truly on his way out of the club, want him to stay though.

521~~~
Well I disagree. I think is has looked extremely competent, especially dealing with crosses, which is what I expected him to struggle with the most.

The only negative I can think of is him lingering on that pass from Carrick(?).

522~~~
He has, but he has also had a couple of shaky moments (which is normal for someone in his situation), he also hasn't come up against a really good attacking side that isn't  still on holiday (yes, this is a shot at spurs).

I am confident in his abilities as our number 1 for now though.

523~~~
Darmian.

524~~~
<a class="username" data-user="70257, @Kylar Stern" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/70257/">@Kylar Stern</a>

Brought the discussion here not to derail the twitter thread.

He hasn't much to do in all honestly, yet came very close against Brugge to costing us a second goal from nothing. A very costly goal it could have turned out to have been. This guy will be up against the likes of Aguero and Hazard later in the season it will surely turn out to be a disaster.

All keepers make mistakes, maybe it was a one off. We will see. I just don't rate him.

525~~~
If you're talking about the back pass that caused confusion, it was from Schneiderlin.

526~~~
Why is the prevailing narrative here to laugh at anyone who doesn't think he's every bit as good as de Gea?

He's played well in his first three games- nobody is denying that. However, many of us have watched him regularly in the past and have reasonably come to the conclusion that he's not good enough to be United's number 1. A few good performances doesn't change that one bit.

527~~~
No, I'm pretty sure it was Darmian.

528~~~
Can't find a clip, so this will have to do:

"Then it was squeeky bum time as Schneiderlin played a suicidal back pass to Romero, who was clipped by Oulare as he tried a rushed clearance."

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.trulyreds.com/20150819/memphis-lights-up-old-trafford-with-dazzling-performance/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.trulyreds.com/20150819/memphis-lights-up-old-trafford-with-dazzling-performance/</a>

529~~~
From BBC live stream: "What is Sergio Romero doing there? Matteo Darmian's back pass seemed harmless enough but the United goalkeeper dallied and dallied and striker Obbi Oulare almost stole in to steal the ball. The keeper is awarded a free-kick, fortunately for him."

530~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fullmatchesandshows.com/2015/08/18/manchester-united-vs-club-brugge-highlights-full-match/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fullmatchesandshows.com/...-united-vs-club-brugge-highlights-full-match/</a>

Go to 2H Bt, and around 17 minutes, you'll see Schneiderlin's back pass.

531~~~
I'm it was Schneiderlin too. Been reported incorrectly on a few MBM online reports. It stuck in my head because it cam immediately after he similarly underhit a pass to BFS.

532~~~
From Matchday thread,
Here's the gif of Romero's terrible moment of madness. It is Morgan who passed back to him. He takes a step back to create better angle to pass to Blind or Shaw. The ball slowed down a lot though, it looks. Plus we play from the back and Romero is perhaps under instruction not to hoof the ball.
It doesn't look like a mistake to me.

533~~~
Fair enough it is Morgan. It looked it was Darmian to me.

534~~~
He looks like he hasn't got a clue about how to command his area today.

535~~~
Why? Only one iffy moment when he went charging at Obertan.

536~~~
Based on what?

537~~~
I don't think anyone could do anything regarding the header. As for that obertan incident he clearly saw that they were offside and thought that they would leave the ball alone (colback mitrovic and all made no attempt to get the ball when they were offside)and obertan kicked the ball only so that Newcastle don't get caught in the counter when Romero collects and throws it back

538~~~
This place is like Pravda when it comes to Romero.

539~~~
I thought that at first (the offside thing) until he started charging at him.

540~~~
I've heard it all now.

541~~~
I don`t think anyone can judge Romero yet , he hasn`t had much to do as the teams we`ve played haven`t really threatened him and the defense has pretty much controlled the game in front of him . Not complaining though , long may it continue , just hope we don`t find out he is crap after the window closes .

542~~~
Was fine except for that time he came ridiculously far out of his box and was bypassed by a simple pass - thank God they were offside! Also didn't look close to stopping that header that hit the bar. Made a great catch later on, but had little to do.

543~~~
Going for the Golden Glove. Hart won it last season with 14 clean sheets.

544~~~
We've been fairly lucky in that he's hardly been tested so far.  All the clean sheets are semi-deceiving cos he's mostly had feck all to do, thanks in large part to the defense and the quality of the teams we've played.  One annoying habit of his I've found is that he rarely seems to feel any urgency in clearing the ball while it's at his feet and the opposition is nearby.  Seems too lackadaisical in that regard.

545~~~
He seems so slow to get down for low shots, he seems to take an extra little step before falling over rather than diving. Kind of lumbering. Unfair to compare him to DDG in that respect, but that is the standard we've all come to expect and love seeing.

546~~~
Let Frans Hoek work his magic <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> He'll get better

547~~~
How hard do you reckon it is unlearn that bad habit? I'm not so sure it can be done.

548~~~
Agree, he actually looks like Blackett at times when under pressure.  You need to have some composure but it's like he's oblivious.

Still, we wouldn't have won the Spurs match without his play late in the game so he's made an important contribution.

549~~~
He did a really good, dominant catch off one of their corners, that was nice.

550~~~
Yea just distribution seems to be a bit gung ho for me.

I like a simple short pass out ..

551~~~
His distribution is good I think...he generally finds a man with his long passes...

But I agree that he sometimes looks a little bit too laid back in his kicking...

I'm nervous having him in net, but with no real reason, other than that brain fart he had against Brugge in the first leg...

552~~~
Anyone else getting a sense of Foster from Romero?

Seems to quite frequently make the wrong decision when being pressed with the ball at his feet. Hasn't had a Tevez-level howler yet, but he seems increasingly due. Almost got caught out twice tonight so far.

553~~~
Great goalkeeping at the end of that half

554~~~
What a man.

555~~~
Lo lo lo lo lo lo lo, lo lo lo lo lo lo, Sergio Romeroooooo

556~~~
Can't believe he saved that

557~~~
How that did not go in I will never know, what a save.

Starting to feel less concerned, 3 clean sheets out of 4 is promising.

558~~~
He's taken the Falcao song <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That was brilliant goalkeeping btw.

559~~~
He reminds me of H Gomes. He's not done anything wrong yet, but he doesn't have the sense of aura of calmness required. I can't imagine having him as our main man for the season.

560~~~
He tends to take his time when it's passed back to him, but I've taken it as a sign he's calm and doesn't feel he needs to nervously rush his clearance.

That one on one keeping was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

561~~~
Did DDG have an aura of calmness in his first four games for us? Or his first twenty? Pretty sure it took him a long time to get to that. Romero has been way as good as we could have hoped for so far.

562~~~
He's brave... too brave sometimes but this enthusiasm really helps the team and himself obviously.

If he can keep his brain a bit cooler for the 2nd half and few matches more then you never know what might happen with LvG having a last word on who's the 1st choice.

563~~~
Did well so far for us. His size really gives him the advantage in those one on one situation.

564~~~
Strange post after this half.

565~~~
Seems calmer when the balls played to him. He's been lucky at times but you'd rather a lucky goalkeeper then an unlucky one. Very well done at the end. Stayed big and just about did enough  - which allowed players to get a block in.

566~~~
Maybe I'm being overly critical (in fact, probably) but I think he was very lucky that he wasn't scored past/lobbed when their striker was in on goal. He did well to narrow the angle once 'beaten' but IMO he shouldn't have been that far off his line - most more technically gifted players could just lob it over him.

Then again, I'm no Hoek.

567~~~
It's the feeling I get. I'm not sure what he's done which was so praiseworthy in that half. The goal was a miss more than a save.

568~~~
Strange post indeed. 

Did fantastically well for their 1v1 chance. If DDG had done that, people would be boasting in his performance thread "BEST GK IN THE WORLD", "HE IS AMAZING". 

By no means am I saying Romero is as good as DDG - not even close. Just it's unfair how DDG would have received a lot more praise after that half than Romero.

569~~~
Maybe that one on one he saved?

570~~~
Agreed.

571~~~
frans hoek can make any goalie look like de gea <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

572~~~
Terrific keeping. Well dome Romero.

573~~~
The save from the one-on-one was great, patient goalkeeping. Gave himself what chance he possibly could've to save it, and did it. Amazing GK work.

Also, how has his performance today not epitomized calm? He seems the coolest customer in Bruges judging on that.

Now he might not be good enough ultimately, but he's done nothing but proving his doubters wrong so far in his United career.

574~~~
Halves don't wipe out performances spread over many games over many games to be fair.

575~~~
Well, over 5 matches the only player that's beaten him is Carrick.

I rated him after the WC, Argentina won most of their matches by a slim margin and he was a big factor in their run to the final.

I can't comment on his time in Serie A but it seems like one of those circumstances where he was out of favor with the manager for whatever reason.  Obviously LvG rates him high enough to make him our No. 1 immediately upon signing without any time to adapt.

576~~~
He is so calm when we get ourselves into crap situations. Tonight with the 1 v 1 - never took his eyes off the ball. No rushing out and panicking. Really he's not bad. Be interesting to see how he performs against Swansea where he'll definitely be tested.

Pleased for the lad - and fingers crossed he stays calm on Sunday.

577~~~
Has to be the most underrated player ever to play a World Cup final

578~~~
Only Carrick knows the feeling of what it is like to score past him this season.

579~~~
He's calm, I get the feeling the issues will come from a lack of concentration rather than anything else.

580~~~
Didn't have much to do apart from the shot straight at him and then he did well with the double save on the 1 on 1 chance. I was expecting them to score that

581~~~
I think he's great. Happy to have him as #1.

582~~~
He's been really good. Could hurry up with his kicking a tad.

583~~~
yeah, he seems a fearless kind of guy. Concentrating for long periods of doing nothing and then needing to pull off a great save is the kind of thing that separates keepers for top sides from the average. Maybe he's not quite that level.
He'l never be a DDG, but he was a solid signing, in keeping with all United's signings this summer.

584~~~
I even like that. Shows his own confidence in his abilities (now watch him make a hash of it against Swansea).

585~~~
Never had much to do , But when called upon did very well

586~~~
Sometimes this is the most difficult skill to demonstrate.

587~~~
I don't think he did that well in the 1 v 1? He grabs at the ball, but doesn't actually have it in his grasp. However, by this time players are back. Carrick prevented a shot at goal. It was hardly convincing goalkeeping.

I don't get how anybody can be happy with him being our first choice goalkeeper. For me, I'm not confident with him in goal whatsoever. Swansea is the first real test of his credentials I would say.

588~~~
That's what seperates the goalkeepers who failed and those who succeeded at this club, I hope he can continue to produce moments like this.

589~~~
It was a 1 on 1 and he was out of position because he didn't expect the ball to get through. The striker didn't score, you have to give him credit for that. He will make mistakes, but he's done fine so far, much like Blind at CB.

590~~~
Have a weird feeling that there is always one or two feck ups in him during game,strange.

591~~~
Oddly enough he's not had any in 5. The perception is probably down to people brushing him off as unqualified and Taibi mk II etc on here.

592~~~
I really like him. If DDG goes, i'd be happy enough if we were to give him this season as #1 and then see whether he'd need replacing after that (though I have faith in him proving himself worthy, even if I didn't rate him before). That interview about LVG is quite touching, when he mentions how proud his kids and wife are of him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

593~~~
I don't know if he's No. 1 quality for a club like United, but he's played perfectly well so far bar that strange incident in the first leg against Brugge.  Genuinely seems to be very happy to be here and comfortable with LVG.

594~~~
Always nervous when he is kicking the ball. Done well with his saves though

595~~~
Great save against Brugge. I'm still nervous about him coming up against the likes of Aguero, Hazard and Sanchez though.

I mainly don't like him though because he insists on having his first initial on the back of his shirt.

596~~~
Has worked well so far. Doesn't mean that he is the answer to the number one position for us. 

Decent second choice.

597~~~
He's done perfectly so far, 1 deflected own goal in 5 games says "something" about his ability to be a consistent no.1 and his save in the 1 on 1 was brilliant the other night.

That said, i think he's still got some ways to go to prove he's the long term solution. I just want De Gea gone now to be honest so all parties can move forward, what is the point of not selling, and having him in the stands.

598~~~
I don't think he's nervous with the ball at his feet, if anything he's too relaxed and waits too long with kicking it sometimes.

599~~~
Excellent at the goalkeeping, but distribution still leaves much to be desired. That kick straight to a Brugges player inside our own half, for example. However, Smalling and Blind seem to handle most of the distribution from the back, so it's not such a big deal. Be interesting to see how those three cope against someone who presses our back line a lot.

600~~~
Yea,think you are right.

601~~~
That scuffed kick to the Brugge player was nothing we don't see with De Gea, every now and then. Even last season.

602~~~
He's done much better than I thought he would. All the signing that the club has made have done well so far.

603~~~
This. DDG's distribution is certainly massively better than Romero's, but the mistakes we've seen from Romero so far is the same ones we see from DDG. 

He's been fine. When he's been called upon, he's done the business and there's nothing more we could ask of him so far. 1 goal conceded all season, with help from the solid defence in front of him.

604~~~
with the possession football we still stick to it's easier for him to keep clean sheets, tougher games will come, more shots on the goal, much better quality of finishing, at that time we will need top class saves like from DDG but we will see, let him play until he makes mistake or two or doesn't provide some world class saves when he could..

605~~~
In terms of quality (and necessity) this has been one of the best windows. We bought an excellent RB, 2 brilliant midfielders, a great attacking talent and a solid goalkeeper who could be more than stop gap

606~~~
Yeah, it's been very good tbh. When that many new players arrive at a club, there is always one or two who take time to settle in but so far that hasn't been that needed. They will only get better too.

607~~~

608~~~
Nor am I.

609~~~
Apart from his delayed kicking I've no other problems with him, he's been solid and even made a few good saves. Also feel safe on crosses, he's absolutely huge.

610~~~
That shits me up, balls in mouth moments. 
<span style="color: #ffffff">(They are my balls figuratively)</span>
<span style="color: #000000">He's not in the same league as DDG but very few are. Our defense is performing so much better than last season, it really isn't going to make THAT much difference. </span>

611~~~
I wouldn't have been surprised had I not read redcafe around the time he signed and saw posts of 'experts' who were judging he is bad.

612~~~
Some of the comments on page 1 were so dramatic it's funny. I mean he isn't world class now but people made out as if we were playing a conference keeper

My favourite comment from page 1( remind me to not get investment tips from him)

613~~~
Pretty much proves that football fans are mostly idiots.

614~~~
he will make a mistake later this season, just like every GK there is. want to see how he handles it when pressure is on him (from the media, opposition having more shots and pressure on us, etc.) before I fully judge him, because it will soon or later.

been doing better than I expected from him so far though.

615~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So far i look like an idiot. But the season still isnt over.

616~~~
I think Romero has a problem that he is much better than how others have been treating him. At the moment he seems to carry that conflict with the world with him. Anyone who has been underrated to the extend he has been would have such a problem I think.

It would do him a lot of good if he was selected ahead of DDG by LVG and Hoek for some time to come, have some massive games under pressure and gain wider appreciation. He might improve a lot from that (total player philosophy). If so, he could be awesome for years to come.

If LVG and Hoek see even higher potential for the coming years they should keep playing him ahead of DDG for a month or so. Will give his confidence and outlook an enormous boost. See what he brings then.

617~~~
DDG will be gone anyway

618~~~
What he is doing very well at the moment is maintaining concentration when he has very little to do. Thats almost as big a challenge as actually making outstanding saves.

We can speculate what he may or may not become as the season progresses, but so far he has been the perfect GK in not conceding a single goal (other than a fluke OG).

619~~~
I think that is getting a bit carried away, he would have to have been pretty useless to have made a mess of things given how little he has been tested. Other than his save against Brugge everything he has done has been no more than what he should have done, the big tests are still to come.

He was brought into be the number two and that is where he will end up long term unless we make a real mess of replacing de gea, I am sure even LVG has no intention of making him our long term number one.

620~~~
apparently he is the smallest of his brothers.  After these opening matches I don't have any worries about him with aerial balls, his judgment on them so far has been excellent.  I can't escape the feeling that he has a lot of the skills you would want in a top GK, but that the whole is less than the sum of its parts at this point.

621~~~
It was an embarrassing post to make about a United player.

622~~~
Nothing to be proud of, but i have read worse comments this summer about the club, Ed and generally our past players/not so popular players.

623~~~
Hasn't put a step wrong imo, one of my hugest rated players so far.

624~~~
never bought into all the nonsense some of our lads posted when we got him.

has looked steady enough.

625~~~
People seem to be drawing judgements about him which is unbelievable 

Hes played a few times and has barely been tested 

How could anyone make their mind up on him?

626~~~
sack him

627~~~
Still think this useless clown is good enough?

628~~~
At least he's getting exposed while the window is open

629~~~
he's not good enough, simple as that.

630~~~
Nope.

631~~~
Moved his foot out of the way of the ball.

632~~~
Never taught he was good enough. We should have landed Cech or Begovic, if De Gea was going to leave. As these two were available. Even Valdes is an improvement as he has Barca-proven distribution.

633~~~
Only took him 6 games to add to his YouTube comp...

634~~~
He's garbage

635~~~
He's crap, it's been obvious all season he had mistakes in him. De Gea would have saved both goals today.

636~~~
I did warn you all. . .

637~~~
Sorry but he should not be starting. I just knew he'd feck up once he's up against a real test.

638~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

639~~~
It was always a matter of when. You don't have a club career like his if you're a top rate keeper.

640~~~
He's having a shocker today but we have got bigger problems at the moment. His distribution is fecking shite though.

641~~~
What a mess of a goalkeeping situation.  Not good enough to be number 1 at his last club, but probably our number 1 for the season.

642~~~
He's absolute gash has cost us 1 if not 3 points today, fumbling crosses awful distribution and what the feck was he doing with that goal???? Honestly don't know what Van Gaal sees in him i'd rate him our 5th best keeper and thats only because i haven't seen the youngsters in action.

643~~~
Get a grip.  He has conceded one goal that was actually saveable in 6 games, and both today were after the defense completely switched off.

644~~~
Do you think he's good enough to be our no. 1?

645~~~
The first one was saveable and De Gea would have had it.

646~~~
Too early to tell.

647~~~
I don't think he will be. I wouldn't bet my house on it but I still think either we keep and play De Gea or we overpay at the last minute for a replacement.

648~~~
Bullshit. De Gea could have well conceded it as well.

649~~~
To those of us who have watched him his whole career, it's always been painfully obvious that he's not good enough.

650~~~
We've spent so much money and still need to buy a striker and a centreback.  How far can LVG convince the board in spending big when he's already done so and we're still barely in any better shape.  The free signing of Romero is convenient for LVG.

651~~~
No it's not
He's not some youngster trying to make his name. 

He's been dodgy as hell throughout his career

652~~~
We do. I think it's more likely we buy a keeper than either of those, though, personally.

653~~~
So we deliberately bought a dodgy keeper to sabotage our club. Brilliant logic.

654~~~
Where the hell have I said that?

655~~~
Was only a matter of time until his luck ran out, didn't even need to play against a top team to look pure average.

656~~~
Is it though? There's a lot of evidence throughout his career that he isn't a top class or reliable keeper. We aim to be a top European club and it isn't a good idea to give keepers who aren't good enough too much time to prove themselves.

657~~~
He's a shite keeper really. Decent #2, should never be first choice

658~~~
He is a sub keeper. That's all he has ever been. DDG and Valdes in the stands for the last 2 weeks. It's a ridiculous state of affairs for which I totally blame LVG.

659~~~
Considering Sampdoria got rid and he was Monaco's second choice keeper, it really isn't. He's a complete disaster waiting to happen. And it will continue happening.

660~~~
Surprise, surprise. He's shit.

661~~~
He makes me shit myself whenever someone passes the ball to him.

662~~~
No. LvG let this complete mess to happen after the crap with Valdes and the situation with DDG as well as not buying a #1 keeper.

Romero is crap and always has been throughout his career. He's been #2 in all clubs in his club career only now, at 28, he's #1 at United. And yes, he has cost us 3 points today.

663~~~
Cost us the game. Should have saved both those goals. We knew this would happen sooner or later though.

664~~~
He's absolutely wank, mistake waiting to happen.

665~~~
He's wank, as we knew before.

666~~~
The accident waiting to happen...

The GK situation we've got ourselves into is less then enviable

667~~~
I suppose this is what happens when you sign the second choice GK of smaller clubs like Sampdoria and Monaco and use him as your first choice GK at one of the biggest clubs in the world....

668~~~
this was always going to happen. never liked him. very very average keeper

669~~~
Getting dropped in the morning.

670~~~
Felt sorry for him. He had a poor game but the rest of the team were making mistake after mistake so he wasn't the only one out there having a shocking match.

671~~~
Why are you so reluctant to admit that the general consensus that he's a bit rubbish is indeed true, and these opinions were actually based on watching him play rather than just a bunch of sheep toeing the line?

672~~~
That's why he's 2nd choice. Should be that regardless Of what happens with De Gea

673~~~
Most of us saw the writing on the wall as the signs were all there.  Was just a matter of time.  Simply not good enough to be our #1 keeper.

674~~~
He is not rubbish. But he does need to do better.

675~~~
Exactly. He's not just being judged on 6 games for United here.

676~~~
It can only get worse tho. This game didn't have one of his shocking mistakes, which he usually had in his last stint in Sampdoria.

677~~~
Said this before. At least one stupid error every game. We got quite a few today and were punished.

678~~~
Hate to state the obvious but the 2nd goal should never have happened. Absolutely poor. A keeper like de gea saves the first too fwiw.

679~~~
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt for the first goal. Shit marking, left hand side wide open, and Ayew heads it right into the ground, which makes it incredible difficult to anticipate. And we needlessly gave the ball away which led to the counter. Romero is a few places down the list of blame for that.

2nd goal, he steps away from the shot, dives back at it, and it rolls under him. It looked like he was reacting in slow motion. He does the same whenver the ball is played back to him. It's unbelievable how close he allows the opposition to get to him before clearing it.

De Gea with his head in Madrid is a better option. I hope he's back for the Liverpool game.

680~~~
De gea could have gotten both those goals. Already dropping points bc of out failure to sort out the goalkeeper situation.

681~~~
He was wank for the second goal but we should never allow Bony (and Ayew for the first goal) to get into these positions.

682~~~
Lindegaard is twice the keeper and he doesn't get a look in. It's baffling how we've ended up with Romero, De Gea drama or not.

683~~~
This might seem a tad knee jerk, but any pro keeper should have saved the second goal and The Snake would probably have stopped the first one as well.

684~~~
Not good enough. Never has been. Genuinely think he's the fourth best keeper at United.

685~~~
at least this is 2 days before the end of the window, not 2 days after.

but that second goal was the first time everyone's fears came to light.
a near post pee roller.

very reminiscent game to last year, nothing in the game, and an almost freak goal winning them it

686~~~
Only positive is that it may force our hand to keep De Gea for an extra year.

687~~~
If nothing else this will make Van Gaal insist De Gea stays or we'll be signing another keeper tomorrow.

688~~~
I've praised him so far but it's evident he's probably not a United keeper. His kicking is poor and he just looks a slightly dodgy keeper. And at the end of the day, this was coming. Yes, de gea could also have made a mistake in these first 4 games as he's shown in the past, but Romero doesn't quite look like the keeper to rely on long-term.

689~~~
If he stands still for the second he stops it. The standing swan dive over the ball was the equivalent of "it was easier to score" chances like Hernandez's during the week.

690~~~
i know,  ive seen those mistakes and im worried everytime he has the ball at his feet. he actually dived over the ball for the second goal.

691~~~
I genuinely think our attack suffers from having him in goal.

I mean a whole unit cannot attack with a peace of mind when there is a goalkeeper like him;especially woth all the passbacks and passforwards we get up to. 

Put de gea back &  im sure we will attack with a greater force.

692~~~
come up against proper team and he's exposed.

Said this from day one but was called a negative moaner when it's obvious.

It's the premier league, you can't sign <a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Sampdoria" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UC Sampdoria</a>'s number two and expect it to all just work out.

693~~~
Agreed.

694~~~
Not many people want Cillessen but after today I'd imagine people would be happy with the middle-aged Brad Friedel if it meant not playing Romero.

695~~~
Cillesen isn't much better.

696~~~
This is just who he is, poor agility and reflexes are part of the problem with him.

697~~~
You don't know that. De Gea has made miracle saves and this could have been one of them. Most goalkeepers wouldnt have stopped that first one so blaming Romero for that one (i blame Rooney for it) isnt really fair but we all know de Gea is capable of saving certain goals.

698~~~
His long kicks were dire today. But then again we have no one that is going to win the ball up front anyway.

He was so slow getting to the ground on that goal.

699~~~
Honeymoon period is over for him.

We really need to keep De Gea or break a record fee for a goalkeeper tomorrow.

700~~~
I can only have admiration for anyone trying to stick up for him. He would be a fine backup, maybe. But as a first choice, not a fecking chance. He lost his place at Sampdoria and couldn't get a game at Monaco. He hasn't played much club football over the past few years and I can see why. He's just not very good.

701~~~
Because I don't think he is. He is merely a scapegoat for a general nervyness we have about how our squad is performing.

702~~~
I'd be happier with Lindegaard and I do not rate Lindegaard at all. I think Romero's got away with kicking errors in every game so far and we've also seen a few instances of some bizarre feet first charges from the line. Add in the second goal today and the picture's not good.

703~~~
Yea he's not going to be good enough. I don't even know what he's trying to do with the second goal it's not even a hard shot and it rolls right past his foot. Just fecking use your feet!

704~~~
Haven't seen that much of Cliessen, but doesn't strike me of that better keeper. I think more appropriate example would be that he's Howard level and not many wanted Howard back in the days when he made that blunder against Porto.

705~~~
OK so what it is about him that has impressed you in contrast to, say, Lindegaard or Johnstone?

706~~~
He wasn't rated before he came here so I don't see how that argument holds. Before our team had even played and the nerviness spread you had a huge number of people expressing very reasonable concerns, and all that was met with was people being dismissive at the time and then gleefully throwing sarcastic jibes when he had nothing to do. I don't get stuff like this at all.

707~~~
I haven't been blown away by him at all - he's done the things all good keepers should do. He was clearly at fault for their disgusting 2nd goal, but those things do happen. De Gea has made his share of mistakes over the years. I just feel like the kneejerking on certain players is to reduce the pain we feel about losing. The real culprit here is LvG. He is currently underachieving in his role as manager, which I've written about in the LvG thread.

708~~~
Don't disagree at all on Van Gaal, after all he's the reason Romero is there in the first place. De Gea always deserved the benefit of the doubt for his mistakes because his ability was so obvious. This guy is a proven journeyman, and we're seeing why.

709~~~
That was a joke aimed at those who claimed he couldn't play here. I'm less inclined to blame him because our defense was horrible. Blind was out of his depth against Gomis who was going passed him like a rag doll. There was also a general lack of focus from us on their counters.

710~~~
That was cowardly, should have come flying out but didn't want to get clattered by Gomis. 

He has ability but can't be relied in to be first choice here.

711~~~
With DDG between the sticks we win the Swansea away match...instead we lose.  That is the difference.

712~~~
How the hell is Raoul a mod. Total bollocks from all angles

713~~~
Horrible stuff for the second goal. De Gea's frame of mind is costing us points now. What a mess

714~~~
Now you can finally understand why he was on the bench at Sampdoria, Monaco etc

715~~~
One of the worst in the league for me.

Honestly go down the number 1 from each team, there aren't many you wouldn't take.

716~~~
He hasn't had much to do in the 4 league games. He's not that good tbh

717~~~
my thoughts too.

Blind is not a CB. We need Jones back fast.

718~~~
Now LVG can use this mistake as an excuse to bench him and get De Gea back in to the fold if he is not sold. If he is sold then we are going to be a bit light in this department. Going to be a long season.

719~~~
Based on the fact that he hasn't had much to do. Very interesting.

720~~~
He has a reputation of being dodgy which he has shown today. I really don't know where you have found this faith in Romero

721~~~
We defended shockingly at times, but it will happen time and time again and thats where De Gea shined, bailing us out and winning points for us. Romero just isnt that keeper, and his little mistakes here and there make the whole team nervous. The standard is high and De Gea was as good as we could hope, which Romero just isnt.

722~~~
I don't think Romero is a good long term solution for United's number 1 but chris this thread made me think that I was in goal today.Players do have bad games.

That saying if he carries on this kind of performance for the next 1-2 games he will surely be dropped for whoever that remains at our club.

723~~~
He's not a United quality #1. Simple as.

724~~~
That really was terrible for the second goal. That should not be going past a premiership goalkeeper.

725~~~
Feck the reputation. Judge him by his performances and those of the players around him, who today were quite poor.

726~~~
Spurs and Villa I don't think he had much to do. Newcastle had zero shots on target and I remembering him rushing out to the ball once and being caught in no mans land. Today he made a massive mistake.  

De Gea did well even when his surrounding players were playing poor so Romero can't have that excuse imo

727~~~
No he had a bit to do v Spurs. They had some decent shots on goal towards the end. DDG was widely mocked when he first got here, so a player being nervous or conceding a goal he shouldn't have should be expected from time to time. Stop being so fecking judgemental and look at the big picture, which is LvG is not doing his job properly.

728~~~
Ok but Romero is 28 and has been to a world cup final...you would hope he would be less nervous than a weak 20 year old De Gea. 

Yeah I agree about LVG but I just don't see what you're seeing in Romero and I can't just ignore his rep tbh. He's really not good enough to be our number 1 if De Gea goes

729~~~
Properly shite from him. Get DDG in i dont care if he leaves he will win us points.

730~~~
Romero is ticking time bomb with DDG had a wonderfully past season and any drop in quality by Romero would be getting a stick.He don't have same quality as DDG , simple has that and mistakes are bound to happen and better to start leaving with it.

731~~~
We've actually been fortunate he's not had to do anything in his previous games. Lindegard or Johnstone should be starting games.

732~~~
Romero is sketchy as hell but he at least has the ability on the ball. That said,Johnstone is decent with the ball at his feet too.

733~~~
He's let in a goal sell him quick he's clearly shit.

734~~~
That's it for him. Looked shaky as feck today.

735~~~
For some reason Lindegaard is also in doghouse along with Dave and Valdes.

736~~~
I really hope we keep DDG or we will be fecked with Romero in goal all season.

737~~~
first big test and he failed it.....

doesn't mean he's an awful keeper but we could probably do better even with 2 days left....

you have to question the decision to not play De Gea

738~~~
If looking for inevitable scapegoat you can also blame De Gea for his 'professionalism'.

Romero was signed as a backup but the thing is he somehow miraculously wants to play for this club. Rare thing these days ?

739~~~
Club want to get rid of him long ago.Why do people surprise?

740~~~
Why though? Is he worse than Romero?

What is this new trend of getting new keepers and putting the old ones in the stands?

Did we need Valdes? Did we need Romero? Why is the De Gea situation, still a situation?

741~~~
think of the four goals conceded by us last season vs Swansea And then see the goals conceded today. We conceded soft goals last time too. 

No one said he is de gea but other than 3 keepers(ddg courtois and neuer) in the world today, everyone makes mistakes. Lloris makes enough mistakes to write a book, Cech makes mistakes (the first 2 games for arsenal for instance), every one of the PL keepers make mistakes. hell even de gea made some mistakes end of last season.

No one is saying he is de gea including LvG but the bashing by all the people who seem to have come out of hiding to say 'I always knew he was useless. I have been watching him since he was born' is cringeworthy.

742~~~
Back up keeper !

743~~~
We wanted to get rid of him since last year but nobody want him.Hardly an indication of a good keeper isn't it?Playing Lindegaard won't solve any problem.He's now falling behind Johnstone in the pecking order, simple as that.A number 3 GK is not gonna make a matchday squad.

744~~~
Did you watch the game? Did you feel comfortable anytime when he had the ball? Did you see any of his clearances? He is a liability. He might be one of the worst goalkeepers in the league. Atrocious for him to be starting for United. LVG is taking the piss.

745~~~
Why though? He has the reputation for a reason- it's not as if he'll suddenly transform into a world beater. Realistically, what we've seen from Romero so far during his career (a few solid performances, poor kicking/distribution, and a few absolute horror shows) is what we can expect to continue to see from him at United.

746~~~
Muppets create reputations and reinforce them by discussing them. I'm more interested in how he performs on the pitch. I'm more than happy to criticize him for their 2nd goal and also criticize the likes of Shaw and Blind for allowing Gomis to boss them around as if they were pub players.

747~~~
Against Spurs, he rushed when Kane made that lob pass in the first half, I think it was Erikssen that nearly lobbed him when he was at no mans land. Villa, Newcastle didn't have much to do and as noted he has the knack of rushing out and being caught. In the first game against Brugge he wasn't good IMO and if that was DDG he cold possibly saved their goal. Today he was really up to his Samp level - crap distribution, crap reflexes and again lack of positional sense.

We should probably kept Taibi as well?

748~~~
Fair enough.

I don't see a method to this madness. Too many keepers in the squad and we still don't have a keeper good enough; the one who is, isn't allowed. 
It's a joke.

749~~~
I thought we signed this guy because he matched the so called philosophy. He looks mediocre on the ball and his kicking is dodgy.

750~~~
Yep sell him. LVG is shit. Instead we can play that Spanish guy who doesn't want to play for us or maybe Sam, he's proven quality, or maybe one of that long line of top class keepers who want to come and play for us and are available right now.

751~~~
Loss of the game wasn't down to him, maybe could have done better with second. The issue is of our own making. DDG wants to go, should have been sold and new player in ages ago. Any player we now sign gonna cost us 10m more cause they know we are desperate....

752~~~
Yes I agree his distribution is clearly not on par with De Gea, but then again that's down to LvG for not playing the latter. I'm more concerned about the manager's decision making than blaming a keeper who was twiddling his thumbs in a foreign country just over a month ago.

753~~~
So we can't use his career as an indication that he probably isn't very good?

754~~~
Have you been consistently watching him in Italy ?

755~~~
Maybe <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

756~~~
No, but 13 league appearances in the last 2 seasons says to me that something clearly isn't right.

757~~~
I have and he has been crap for large part when he was an actual first teamer. He hasn't started with his blunders yet, but so far in his career he has had a fair share of those.

And afterwards Viviano has been a lot better especially at positional sense and crosses. It's no wonder that he couldn't displace him.

He shouldn't be brought in at first place, so yeah it's all down to LvG for our GK situation right now. Valdes is a better GK than him. LvG handled that poorly as well. If you aren't going to play DDG due to the transfer stuff, then at least play your second best keeper, not send him into the reserves. Then we played Johnstone in pre-season where he actually looked good. Romero was never good enough. 

So yeah, it's a bit Taibi situation with this guy. We fecked him after 4 games, can't see a reason why not do the same.

758~~~
Yep cause it's not a science.

759~~~
He was <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2014/09/09/romero-frozen-out-at-sampdoria-after-manchester-city-rejection/" target="_blank">frozen out over a wage issue</a>, not because of his form apparently.

760~~~
Are you freaking kidding me? Did we not know DDG's stance since beginning of the year? We had Valdes who is better than Romero but that bridge has been burnt (not entirely LVG's fault) We got an absolute joke of a keeper thinking we have solved the goalkeeping issues. If we were not planning to sell DDG for less money then we should have made sure of that since the beginning for summer and made him ready for the start of the season.

Talking about DDG's frame of mind in the press is not going to make things ok. It's pathetic the way this has been handled. Plus a half-hearted DDG would be better than Romero right now.

761~~~
Hats off to you for consistently dedicating your weekends to follow Romero at Sampdoria, who apparently didn't play for them more than 10 times.

762~~~
Well, today, he was definitely to blame for the 2nd goal.
At this point, I don't know what to make of him.
I'd prefer DDG, though.

763~~~
I can't believe the same people are still trying to claim this guy is good enough, he's not, it's not a debate or an opinion exchange, he just isn't, bloody hell.

764~~~
He conceded one goal, big deal. We have bigger problems in Van Gaal's inability to get our players to play as a cohesive squad than going after a brand new keeper each time we concede.

765~~~
He was frozen and sent on loan after 2 games against Udinese where he conceded 6 in those 2 games with half of them were saveable or blunders by him. So no it was not a coincidence. Of course Samp wouldn't want to hold onto a GK that is on such a high salary and a second choice.

Have a friend who is a huge Samp fan and I occasionally watch games with him, so yeah I know this guy.

766~~~
Sergio, Thanks for the memories but it's time to say goodbye.

767~~~
He conceded a piss easy goal because he has poor agility and sluggish reflexes. We have problems and most of them stem from the arrogance of the manager, the guy that lumbered us with this guy in the first place.

768~~~
So he was frozen out and not playing much. That doesn't seem to reveal much about his ability other than the fact they were upset he wouldn't renegotiate his wages.

769~~~
That was last summer. The season prior to that he was the second keeper of Monaco (on loan) cause he was displaced from Viviano.

770~~~
The goal was his fault, but also a complete lapse in defense and failure of Shaw and Blind to track back and prevent the shot from ever taking place. It was a team effort.

771~~~
Not blaming him as such because he is what he is, but DDG would have saved both those shots, the second one DDG would have thrown his hat on and had it dispatched up front in the blink of an eye, hopefully his last game for while.

772~~~
If united we decent in attack, and Memphis was playing well then Shaw would not need to bomb forward at every opportunity. Blind is not a center back. Was tested by a strong forward and got found out. Hope this experiment end here.

773~~~
I agree there was too much bombing forward going on, which contributed to Blind and Shaw having to scamper back. Also, Gomis was ravaging Blind with his physicality. Rojo may have fared better in that case.

774~~~
Knew that this would happen eventually. Whether he fecked up or not, the relative lack of confidence in him from the fans would result in these arguments. I didn't see the game so I can't tell whether he was at fault or not.

775~~~
His memory will be 3 clean sheets <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

776~~~
Happens to Blind as well. Fans are nervy about them and therefore rush off to bump their threads each time they make a mistake. The problem isn't these two particular players, its LvG and his inability to get us playing as a cohesive team.

777~~~
It's normal to want him to come good, if you haven't seen him all that much, although he had his fair share of blunders at national level as well. I fully expect him to make even bigger mistakes after he's put to pressure by some of the top teams in Prem. 

Next week we play against Pool and after that against Soton. I fully expect him to do something stupid in one of those games.

778~~~
When he does, make sure you gleefully scamper back in here and let us know about it.

779~~~
Well you can add the whole Blind at CB because he's left footed and can pass to the list of LvG knows best. In a game like this Shaw was trying to get us on the front foot, the fact he's got to babysit Blind against pace and power is stupid, we had Evra who spent half his time up field but we didn't need to worry about Vida or Edwin fecking simple stuff up, nor should we expect that at a club like United where money has flowed like water for the last 2 years and we still look as far off as we were after SAF retired. 

The bottom line is today was the first time Romero had a proper save to make and he confirmed what those of us who had actually seen him play already knew, no agility and slow reflexes. You are right it's a team game, for the last 5 games the back 4 have protected Romero and even bailed out some of his dodgy kicking, today it was his turn to help out the defense when it was breached and he couldn't hold his end up because he's not good enough.

780~~~
I don't think LvG had much of an option as far as Blind goes - Rojo would've been more appropriate to fend of Gomis, but he wasn't fully ready yet.

781~~~
So we just ignore the fact that LvG keeps putting a liability between the sticks? Or we should look at other opportunities to excuse him of not being good enough?

782~~~
He's not a liability, you're just pissed because we lost. If we won, this thread would barely be active. Get a grip and move on.

783~~~
Not at all, I've commented on his performances while he was keeping clean sheets or we have been winning and while he was linked with us.

784~~~
Or he could have forgot this left footed stupidity and went and bought an actual CB suited to the PL. I mean we've loaned Blackett out and sold Evans, there was room for a CB to be added, and in truth we are likely to need Blind in midfield at some point as Carrick and Schweinsteiger look as old as the hills. The fact is Blind has done well, no argument from me there, and I love his crisp passing into the midfield, but I always felt it was a valid concern that his physical weaknesses would end up negating his on the ball quality.

785~~~
Very slow getting to the first goal, it was a very savable height and wasn't <i>that </i>fast. Haven't seen the replay of the second.

786~~~
Christ, people really think of him as the next PIG ? He's a backup keeper for us who happens to be Argentina's number 1.

This guy didn't even had a feckin pre season while De Gea looked very careless against Barca at times with having loads of time to make up his mind about the contract issue.

787~~~
He's like a pensioner the speed he gets to low balls. Looked woefully short today, especially the second goal.

788~~~
Keep in mind, DDG made nearly the same mistake against West Brom away in his Prem debut. Our defenders also arent really game smart are they? The dude is struggling with his kicking in the first half then you have the likes of Smalling and Blind facing their goal, but instead decide to turn around and lay it off to the keeper to boot it up field with an on rushing swansea attacker. Why do defenders do that?

Im not saying drop him cos of that however. Yes he made the mistake for the winner (think it was the indecision of whether to stay back or come out which done him), but we still have bigger problems to deal with. (And yes, I still think hes not a long term number one for us).

It's bizarre. He's a career backup and because Argentina can't produce a damn keeper some people think he's a starter. 

Look at the other top 10 teams (apologies to Dortmund) in Europe's backup:

Ter Stegen
Navas (Once De Ge signs)
Starke
Moya
Neto
Begovic
Willy Caballero
Ospina
Sirigu

I haven't seen much of Starke or Neto (started for Fiorentina last few years) but the others are all very respectable keepers and Bayern had Reina instead of Starke for the last couple of seasons. Romero would probably be picked between 7th-9th from this group, never mind the starters.

790~~~
We lost partly because he conceded a very soft winner. The first goal would have required a fine save, but that's what we need in net.

791~~~
I don't rate Romero but calling Lindegaard "twice the keeper" is hyperbole at its finest.

792~~~
It probably is, to be fair.

793~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Lindegaard is a bang average keeper and I've never rated him at all. Romero would be a grand back up but feck me, why is he número uno!

794~~~
Romero is awful it's not a nice feeling knowing we are starting of the worst keepers in the league. Nothing he has done so far for us had filled me with confidence hopefully ddg returns or we get a real keeper.

795~~~
Especially since Lindegaard is shite himself, and has barely played in about 3 years, under 3 different managers. And has just 5 caps at the age of 31.

796~~~
Just seen a reply of the second goal...horrible keeping. Just jumped over it.

DDG would have saved both.

797~~~
He was utter gash for the second goal. Comical I would say.

798~~~
If Gomis had hit it any slower it might have gone backwards <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

799~~~
Awful keeping today

800~~~
The Argentine Barthez.

801~~~
Seems a bit harsh to slate the guy. We all knew this thread bump was coming. 

It's the club that needs looking at for faffing about on this all summer. There's 3 better keepers sat next to each other watching our games from the stands. Ridiculous that this hasn't been sorted sooner.

802~~~
Johnstone is better than him, should play from now on.

803~~~
This is not the solution. Romero was brought in as our number 2 and he has a wealth of experience. The DDG bullshit needs to be sorted and I guess it will be by the passage of time. September 1 is almost upon us. DDG should be given back his position

804~~~
Yeah the second goal was a bit of a cock up.

Of course, no one should be surprised that he's not the keeper De Gea is. We're not going to get bailed out as frequently as DDG did for us, simple matter of fact.

805~~~
He'll cost is goals, and points all season. 

Not good enough - simple as that.

806~~~
Please get De Gea back in goals soon.

807~~~
Never mind De Gea, I personally don't think he's as good as the 4 goalkeepers we have in reserves.

808~~~
Don't see need to criticise him, he is and always has been a backup expecting anything more was always stupid. at the end of the day he was a reserve at a midtable serie a side and by his own admission no one wanted him even on a free transfer.

We meter should have got to stage where he was our number one.

809~~~
I certainly think he's better than, say, Lindegaard for example, and he's not an awful keeper by any means, but yeah, he's not good enough to be our number 1 and certainly is a massive downgrade on De Gea.

Providing DDG hangs around for another season, he'll likely be in goal in a few weeks and will be back to being our main goalkeeper for the season. Romero will get some games here and there, but if De Gea's here then he'll be playing ahead of him.

810~~~
2 weeks. September 12

811~~~
That's pretty heavy. I'm not saying you're wrong, but do consider that Romero is a seasoned international who represented Argentina at the last World Cup.

812~~~
Kleberson represented Brazil in two World Cups, winning one of them and starting in the final. He was nowhere near good enough for United.

813~~~
Still waiting for your response Raoul....

I never said that at all and it makes me look a tit because I never said that!!

I said once we signed him, along with other people on here, he wasn't good enough to be number 1........And we gave examples.

Anyone who has seen him elsewhere knows he wasn't good enough to be our number 1...Number 2, maybe but not a number one.

As per your original post, I never even suggested that

Seriously, for a man of your knowledge, how can you even type that?

And for the record, I have watched him long before the 2014 WC....He was shit on a stick!
I ain't judging him on his United career, I judged him before and was shocked when he became number one

For someone of your intellect of the game, that was an abysmal post and I'm quite surprised

814~~~
today against a competent opposition has proven to a degree that we really can't afford head into the season with this guy as our no.1.

815~~~
We've seen his dilly-dallying on the ball (every. single. time.), dodgy positioning, and baffling decision-making in every game. By some miracle, it hasn't cost us until today. It looks like his reputation is well deserved.

816~~~
This so called reputation is a self-reinforcing narrative. He has by all accounts had a good start to his United career and will likely be our #2. Constant moaning about every miskick or positioning error is not going to help anything.

817~~~
He's clearly shit. We've done well to get three matches in without him conceding but there are always errors in him, just like there is for most #2 or #3 'keepers. I won't be too harsh on the first goal (although I genuinely think De Gea would save it because he is world class), but he was all over the place for their second.

This De Gea situation needs to be sorted ASAP.

818~~~
I'd tolerate him if he can be solid keeper, even if he makes me nervous when the ball is at his feet, but that second goal we conceded was terrible.

819~~~
If we can all admit that DDG had a bad start to his United career, let's not mince words with Romero.

Moaning about his mistakes doesn't help anything except forming an accurate assessment of his performances.

820~~~
Moaning doesn't even help form an accurate assessment, it merely reinforces neverending negativity.

821~~~
Meh. This guy is our sub goalkeeper, how much were ye really expecting from him? 

Everything we knew about him before he ever signed indicated that he wasn't good enough to be our first choice goalkeeper, so it's hardly surprising if he turns out to be a big downgrade on DDG. This is a temporary situation though, if DDG goes then we will almost certainly sign someone better, in which case it's hardly a major worry.

822~~~
It needs remembering that De Gea cost us a number of goals in his first season. I dont think Romero is really good enough to be our number 1 but a lot of people have been waiting for this thread bump. If it becomes a weekly occurrence then we have real cause for concern, but until then he's the best option we have.

823~~~
Our number 2?

And when De Gea goes tomorrow or on Tuesday, and we've only got him and Paint, what then?!

It's a football forum mate. It's for discussions based on what we've seen.
What are we supposed to say?! "Oh he cost us a goal and cost us the match but he wore those short sleeves well. That's a plus!"

Myself and others have seen him prior to the WC in 2014.....He's always been dodgy. And that's being polite. Unless LvG signed him for a number 2 basis, which is clearly not the case, I've no idea what he's doing here!

Take today out of it, and we won 1-0, I'd still say he's not good enough! Myself and others were baffled by this signing before he'd even had a scarf shot my friend

And it's not a "sage" post or a patronising post (Sorry if it comes across like that) but I've no idea what's he doing here, unless he's a number 2, which he's clearly not

824~~~
While this is true, De Gea was just a teenager moving to one of the biggest clubs in the world. He was one of the most promising young keepers in the world but had a long road ahead of him. 

Romero is 28 with dodgy record, a lot of games for Argentina which is baffling for many football fans since they deserve a much better keeper. His blunders and comical plays are nothing new and I see no reason to expect him to improve greatly. He will be decent as long as our defenders are solid.

825~~~
That 2nd goal was attrocious, you can't concede a goal in your angle. 
Keep DDG and play him.

826~~~
I think he should have done better for the first too, but obviously I'm used to DDG saving those kind of shots and have now come to expect those standards. That second goal though.....wow.

827~~~
I hate myself when I concede in my angle, can't imagine what professional keepers think.

828~~~
He just doesn't look like a keeper, looks all awkward and shit. Slow tortoise like foot movement, slow motion reflexes and shite kicking. Heck he even looks awkward for a footballer let alone be a first choice for United.

829~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

830~~~
He has done something weird or questionable in every game so far


Seriously though his effort on their 2nd was hilarious. I never see the funny side of utd losing but when I watched the replays of that goal I did find myself laughing

831~~~
I know nothing at all about him, never seen him play before he joined. 

Up to yesterday the only thing he had to do was kick the ball out, and I thought he looked decent with the ball at his feet and his distribution looked good. 

Had a mare yesterday though, dodgy kicking and the second goal was a howler from a keepers perspective. 

Can't see us letting DDG go and reyling on him. I'd imagine someone will come in should DDG go.

832~~~
He's not that bad, had a howler yesterday on the second and isn't using his feet enough. Obviously not at DDG's level but he's basically had a season out, will improve.

833~~~
Plays the game in slow mo. Always seems to take an age to make up his mind. I have my heart in my mouth whenever he's closed down quickly.

834~~~
The second goal was fairly bad, no respectable keeper should be getting beat at his near post. De Gea would have slapped it away with his pimp leg and feline reflexes.

835~~~
All accounts?

Praising him unconditionally on an internet forum doesn't accomplish anything either. I never got the whole 'what does this accomplish?' thing when we're all basically guys talking about football on the internet.

836~~~
This is why the shit guy was 3rd fecking choice at Sampdoria. Those at club the club responsible for this signing are absolute buffoons for getting this fraud of a player

837~~~
We don't have time to let him improve, we need a world class goalkeeper not an average journeyman.

838~~~
Gomis' goal should have been saved, but I think he's done very well in his time with us. 

Tbh, I wouldn't have a huge problem with him being our #1 for the season.

839~~~
He's had almost nothing to do.

When he has had something to do he has looked shaky. Shocking on the ball for a start.

Look up that youtube video which is a magnificent collection of his many clangers over the years.

840~~~
I've watched pretty much every game so far in the season, and from my viewings I haven't felt jittery at all with him between the sticks.

He could have done better with both goals against Swansea, but I'd say the defence was to blame more than anything. Gomis' shot was tame, but if he had connected properly it would have been a goal regardless, so blaming him for that goal isn't fair. 

I haven't seen the video but will watch it at home. 

Also, he played well v Spurs, and had a great 1 on 1 save recently (was it against Brugge?). He's not as bad as people are making out.

841~~~
I suffer him in the selección Argentina. He is not good enough for Argentina nor for United, case closed.

842~~~
Have my heart in my mouth everytime he receives a backpass - why does he wait until an opposition player is 3 inches away before he hoofs it???

843~~~
This is my worry too. I assumed he would be good with the ball at his feet because Van Gaal signed him, but if anything he is probably the worst at the club?

844~~~
He's decent with the ball at his feet in all honesty

845~~~
Why is he the most capped goalkeeper in Argentina history? The country must have shit goalies. Who's better than him in Argentina? World cup and Copa America finalist. Haters will hate

846~~~
Well I haven't seen it if he is. That one he basically passed to Shelvey almost cost us another goal against Swansea.

847~~~
Its easy to highlight one or two mistakes and use them as a sweeping statement. Don't tell me De Gea hasn't done the same before because he has. De Gea's distribution looked very shaky in the early games of last season

848~~~
Hopefully we won't see him in goal for a little while now, need to get de gea back in ASAP. Romero is fine as a Backup but as a starter he is probably amongst the worst 3 keepers in the league.

849~~~
He has done OK , but we do need DDG back in goal.

850~~~
Did he play at all against Mexico?

851~~~
Haha hyperbole at its finest. He is better than most keepers save the top 4 ones and maybe lloris. Frankly he is even a little better than mignolet from what I've seen of both

852~~~
Not at all, it's a simple fact he is not a good goalkeeper and would struggle to get a game at pretty much every premier league team. Just because we signed him there is no need to pretend he is much better than he actually is, he has been a backup in inferior leagues for the last three seasons and he his last spell as a number one was in serie b.

He couldn't make the step up to serie A and was released on a free transfer and struggling to find a club. Like out or not mignolet has proven himself at a higher level, laughable you are trying to suggest Romero is one of top keepers in the league. No doubt you have watched about two games and decided that overrules years of a very average career.

853~~~
He was cast away as a second or third choice because of his wages. Not because he was a bad keeper. He was first choice at sampdoria till they shunted him to Monaco because they couldn't pay his wages. He didn't play much in Monaco but ended up having a good World Cup that year. He refused to terminate his contract upon return to sampdoria because of which he was frozen out and wasn't given a chance.

He is someone who is #1 for Argentina and once held a record for minutes without conceding with AZ. He is not a stupid keeper by any margin. He will start at all of the bottom 10 clubs and can definitely be equal to mignolet. Mignolet hasn't proven anything at top level and is error prone just as much as Romero is. He has been part of teams that effectively finished lower to mid table in the PL except one year and he will never make it to the Belgian team without injuries to courtois. 

No team expecting to win the World Cup will wantedly keep a goalkeeper who isn't good especially when speroni was #1 for crystal palace and caballero was #2 for city and by your own logic, 'superior keepers'.

You seem to know absolutely nothing at all and make judgements based on what you think is write reading his stats on Wikipedia page probably. Just because you don't like him doesn't make him a bad keeper. I never said he was a top keeper. I said he is in the list after the top keepers. With fabianski Mignolet vorm and all.

854~~~
Worst 3 keepers in the league? Wow. Talk about going overboard.

855~~~
No point making stuff up he was dropped at sampdoria and that's why they moved him on, just because you like him doesn't make him a good keeper. He couldn't get a game at sampdoria or Monaco because he isn't a particularly good keeper simple as that. In the one game he has been tested here he came up short and that will happen more and more if we rely on him.

He was lucky to be picked by Argentina most teams would have dropped because they did have keepers playing at a higher level but international football isn't really the best way a to judge players so I think it means very little. I think there are very few teams in the league who would swap their number one for someone who made lots of errors and was dropped by a mid table italian team.

Romero said it best himself no one else wanted him.

856~~~
Nope, Guzman was the keeper for the whole game while Romero was on the bench.

857~~~
He was frozen out of the team. It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not. It's the truth.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2014/09/09/romero-frozen-out-at-sampdoria-after-manchester-city-rejection/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2014/09/09/romero-frozen-out-at-sampdoria-after-manchester-city-rejection/</a>

most of the keepers in the PL are themselves the same as what you described.

He made lot of saves in the games vs Spurs, Brugge and even against Swansea including the 1v1 against Brugge that he saved when the score was at 1-0. In the Swansea game he made a mistake. Mignolet also let in a goal after being beaten on his near post (west ham's third goal). The point is that besides de gea it's very common that keepers make mistakes.

He said he didn't have any offers yet, as it was just mid July when we contacted him. About 15 days into the window. His wages were the main reason which was the deterrent for many clubs anyway. No one signed valdes in the window does that mean he is not good too?

You don't like him. thats fine. But don't assume things. You say he is lucky for Argentina. Lucky that about 3 different managers chose him over the others? Do you think a team with winning aspirations will chose a keeper based on nothing? At least 4 managers including lvg thought that he is a very good keeper. And as for the PL, as I said he is around Mignolet level. Good but not great. Same as Mignolet. He would definitely  start at most of the bottom 10 or so. Whether they will take him (mainly because Of his wages. Not because he isn't good enough)is not the issue. He is easily better than the starting keepers there.

858~~~
I remember reading on the Argentina WC 2014 page on this forum about how it was shocking that Romero was chosen over Cabellaro and that most Argie fans and followers thought it was a shocking decision so I don't get the whole he plays for Argentina argument as to his ability. 

I don't think he's a terrible keeper but he's not someone you win the league with in nets, he looks like a mistake waiting to happen and the Swansea game was a bad performance. His distribution has put us in a few tight spots already, and he seems hesitant.

859~~~
Not true. I know a lot of Argentinians who were fine with his selection and only questioned his match time for his club, which was also a concern for the less experienced 2nd choice Andujar. Third choice Orion was a Boca regular but deemed not good enough mostly because he played in the domestic league. You must be having a laugh when it comes to Cabellaro, you're better even mentioning German Lux or Ustari.

Were Argie fans  shocked before WC 2014 whenever Romero played? Where they shocked when he was selected as number 1 at the 2010 WC? He's been highly rated in his homeland since he won the 2007 U-20 world cup and the 2008 gold cup at the Olympics. Matter of fact he won the Dutch title in 09 as well as the Dutch Supercup and he took this amazing run of wins into the WC 2010. He's simply the best out of an average bunch of Argentinian goalies. Cabellaro...you made me laugh, he's never even featured for the senior team. CAF members play too much FM

860~~~
Cabellaro had just had his best season for Malaga and he was very impressive. There was no doubt that most were surprised when he wasn't called up and cited it as a bad decision. 

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/argentina-at-the-wc.390716/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/argentina-at-the-wc.390716/</a> 

Quite a lot mentioning of posters mentioning the goalkeeping situation.

861~~~
Romero is terrible, best news for United is the possibility of De Gea renewing and benching this rental

862~~~
Caballero is a far better goalkeeper than Romero. Not even close.

863~~~
Caballero played an incredible season that year with Malaga and almost singlehandedly got them past Dortmund and into the semi finals of the CL. Romero on the other hand didn't even feature for his team. He was also already shaky at the 2010 WC. Look up the 1st goal in Argentina's 4-0 quarter final loss to Germany.

Not meaning to talk down the current Romero here but I'm pretty sure the majority of people wanted to see Caballero in Argentina's goal in 2014.

864~~~
Over to you, Sergio...

865~~~
We don´t have good goal keepers, we only make forwards like Aguero, Dybala, Correa, Lavezzi and Gaitan. SO if Romero isn´t our best goalie he is close to be.

866~~~
He's probably not going to play again this season, but he is still at a much better place than before his transfer.

867~~~
So long, and thanks for all the fish!

868~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

869~~~
Thank god De gea is back wont miss Romero one bit he's destined for some team like West Brom can't belive he was compared to Begovic on here yesterday.

870~~~
Why hasn't he ever played for the senior Argentina NT? I considered Lux and Ustari to be better goalies. <a class="username" data-user="20843, @Pocho" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20843/">@Pocho</a> what is your opinion on this?

871~~~
Caballero is better but he never was considered by any trainer. Maybe because he gave his best being almost 30 years.

872~~~
Considering he wasn't playing first team football yes I think he was lucky but like it's stupid to use international football as evidence of him being a good keeper, Casillas was preferred to de Gea after all.

I haven't assumed anything but you clearly have by deciding being Argentina number one means he is better than most of the keepers in the league. He wasn't good enough for sampdoria, wasn't good enough for Monaco and like I said he wouldn't start for most premier league sides. He is viewed as a backup and that's about it, we will never be able to prove it external way because he will sit on the bench now and that won't change even if de gea does go to madrid.

Unfortunately for Romero the first time he was really tested he came up short, other than one good save against Brugge he showed nothing of any note. His career shows he is error prone, slow and doesn't have the best reflexes, that was the case against Swansea and I don't see that changing.

I actually don't dislike him I just don't see need to pretend he is any good just because we signed him and I don't see why anyone would expect a backup to suddenly be good enough to start.

873~~~

Good man.

874~~~
He'd been playing second choice at Sampdoria and Monaco, of course he's happy with being second choice at Manchester United.

875~~~
Exactly, there are mediocre keepers all over the world that would be happy to pick up a good wage sitting on our bench.

876~~~
He's in!

877~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

878~~~
fecking hell!

879~~~
He was supposed to be number 1 if De Gea went.....

880~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

881~~~
Well, he's not playing again this season.

882~~~
I actually had a bad feeling for a split secound as he was making the back pass 

A feeling something crazy was gonna happen. It was a mini premonition

883~~~
Christ.

884~~~
I called it once we signed him and yet, people actually got offended by it <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

He's always been rubbish!

885~~~
He's a good shot stopper, but has a bad case of Ter Stegenitis.

886~~~
But not according to David James.

887~~~
I can't imagine how many United fans would die of a heart attack if he was in goal for a Champions League final.

888~~~
No he wasn't.. LVG wanted Keylor Navas as a part of the swap.. Maybe the Swansea game changed his mind,but from what we know he definitely wasn't going to be number 1..

889~~~
Yeah but he's an even bigger idiot than me so his opinion doesn't count

890~~~
Same.

I thought it was going in, he was lucky Blind passed it wide.

891~~~
Now you can understand why he never played at Sampdoria, Monaco...

892~~~
Surely Navas though?

893~~~
That last save from the stift was good, let's give him some credit.

894~~~
He's a good shot stopped with a knack for crazy mistakes.

895~~~
He was so lucky with that chip, he should have stayed on line not coming out so early.

But he's made some decent saves overall tbf.

896~~~
Made some good saves today.

897~~~
He would have been getting my first 1 rating if it wasn't for those last 5 minutes.

898~~~
Great shot stopper. If this goes to penalties he could win it for us. He's so not a good fit for us, though. The great United keepers generally do the small things good and the big things very good.

899~~~
Made some solid saves. Made up for that bit of madness.

900~~~
Completely insane to come that far off his line when Leadbitter had so much time to pick his shot. Can't believe he missed it.

901~~~
He's a very good shot stopper with a touch of the calamities about him. Okay for a reserve keeper really.

902~~~
Anyone got a gif or vine of what he did?

903~~~
Is he any good at penalties?

904~~~
I'm actually confident with him in goal for this. He's a mistake waiting to happen but he's a great shot stopper

905~~~
To be fair, he got close on a few of those penalties, expected him to save 1 though.

906~~~
Every game he has played he has done something ranging from a little crazy to total insanity

But he is a fine shot stopper

I can never feel comfortable with him though. He is officially one of those crazy keepers

907~~~
For the love of god we need a gif of that moment <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

908~~~
He's piss

909~~~
Looks like Willie from Ghost

910~~~
There is a clanger in him and you simply can't play a GK that has that hanging over him. It must be unnerving for the other players.

911~~~
Lets just say we can't afford De Gea to get injured at all.

912~~~
Very hit and miss, one minute he can pull of a good save then the next he can't even control a simple pass back. I always feel whenever he plays that there's a mistake waiting to happen

913~~~
He is a good number 2. He actually reminds me of mignolet who is appalling in everything else other than shot stopping too.

914~~~
how is he good no2, surely there are better no2s who don't look like having mistake in them.. Johnstone is great goalkeeper with big potential, so far we acquired two former spanish speaking goalkeepers, who were made our no2s while they have been massively overrated and never good enough being no2. This is the end of us if deGea's injured and Romero in the goal again.

Just give the chance to Johnstone, he looked great in preseaon and before on loan but Van Gaal stil opts for his friends...

915~~~
We signed a dodgy keeper, no surprises here

916~~~
Overreaction much. He's conceded 2 goals in 7 games. A lot of that has been thanks to himself. He's done well. Nothing wrong with him as a nr. 2.

917~~~
Generally no.2s are supposed to be very good shot stoppers. Nobody has a first choice like de gea and second choice like neuer. This is what every team has. 

Frans Hoek is probably the one who is judging the keepers and if he feels Johnstone isn't ready, he isn't. The whole he plays his friends thing sounds made up nonsense. If that was the case, we would play Romero often.

918~~~
Yeah, he's a very good shot stopper and his positional sense is excellent. It's just his concentration is not the best and there's always one huge mistake around the corner

919~~~
he plays his friends unless they are not much worse than other options, that's my view even though it's only half serious.. I agree with you with the first part but Johnstone is in my view more reliable goalkeeper, you can see Romero messed up in his last league game and this game did also horribl emistake, how you can paly such goalkeeper? apart one shot, that chip, it wsn't really big saves which average goalkeepers souldn't make... you just need reliable goalkeeper and I think young Johnstone should get a hance, it's not like he palys first team football for the first time, he played in championship... if franc hoek things, he looked very pleased with Johnstone in preseason, genuinely happy reading from his face. it's just a big risk for Van Gaal I guess, he coaches keepers not picking them to play. Van Gaal also thinks that Rooney should play all games and be a captain so if he feels he isn't ready to be dropped just yet he isn't?

920~~~
A nervous wreck with the ball at his feet but a fine shot stopper. Made about 4/5 quality saves in that match.

921~~~
No, not an overreaction, he's an accident waiting to happen, if De Gea missed a dozen games we'd be in huge trouble with him in goal.

922~~~
A touch of Barthez mixed with latter day David Seaman and a slight pinch of Roy Carroll to finish it off.

923~~~
Johnstone should definitely be ahead of him.

924~~~
So 99% of professional football teams are in huge trouble then?

925~~~
I'm disappointed no-one has posted a vine of his little error from Blind's back-pass <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

926~~~
I know. I keep wondering why it's such a problem to move the lad higher in the pecking order.

927~~~

928~~~
I don't trust this guy to be our back up. No2 imo should be solid guys who do the basics well. The way our defense is playing having a solid keeper behind them is enough, but even the best shot stopper in the world, if he has so many problems with concentration and ready to drop a clanger every game, won't be any good.

That said, he was out of action for 2 months. Lindegaard once had the horror show against Reading too iirc, when he was playing regularly. So can't be too tough on him.

929~~~
No, just the ones with a walking disaster as a back up keeper.

930~~~
I'm not sure you follow other keepers well. He's done well so far in his United career and he did well in the WC. He's by no means a class act but as a nr. 2 you couldn't have asked for better performances. Just think about Amos and Lindegaard. Fairly recent keeper, neither as good as Romero.

931~~~
He's very careless and nonchalant playing in a position where you can't really afford to be.  Seems to think that he's got more time and space than he actually does.  And although his brain farts haven't come to bite us yet, feels like it'd only be a matter of time if he was getting regular games.

932~~~
No he hasn't done well, he's looked dodgy in practically every game, it cost us against Swansea and we got away with it tonight but his concentration and grasp of the basics is crap, he can pull off a decent reflex save but so can most keepers. Any remote shot at winning the PL would be done with him in goal for any length of time. We'd be better off giving his spot to Johnstone.

933~~~
it did against swansea

934~~~
I missed the game but FFS this is schoolboy stuff.

935~~~
I'm rather appalled that he managed to get the Argies to the WC final but couldn't replicate it against Boro.

936~~~
I stand corrected.  My memory is for shite. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>  I was quite surprised many on here were fine with him starting over DDG in the beginning of the season even with De Gea having visions of Madrid in his head.

937~~~
probably because he hadn't made any major blips that cost us points and kept clean sheets until that point.

though like you said, many here including myself were resigned to losing de gea so were willing to accept decent performances and romero's provided that until that awful swansea game.

938~~~
he dropped his 'friend' van Persie often last season and even sold him. He doesn't give a shit about 'friends'. 

So going by what you said he stopped all the shots that he was supposed to stop. Which is what a reliable keeper is. He has his deficiencies but he is a keeper that can be a good no.2. And some of those shots were difficult and needed real concentration to make. It's not like all of them were easy. 

The point of a no.2 is to be good shot stoppers with decent amount of experience. Most no.2s make mistakes. Ospina Caballero vorm etc. Johnstone has never played at this level. The only way he would play is if Hoek thinks he is ready, which clearly he doesn't. He performed well in preseason but playing a competitive game for united is very different. And plus Romero is way better than lindegard and kusczak who were second choice for Vds and DDG. Nobody complained when they were no.2s. Because nobody can have a world class no.2.

939~~~
The rightful heir to Fabien Barthez.

940~~~
That's exactly who he reminded me of, although for some reason I liked Barthez, despite him being dross. Romero is just unlikable.

941~~~
After the mistake, he was very good but we need to take those lapses of concentration out of his game. He's a day dreamer and on his wages, I can't say I blame him. Half the time it looks like he's robbing a living.

942~~~
Barthez doesn't hold a candle to Romero's escaped convict look.

943~~~
Calamity waiting to happen. Seems a decent shot-stopper but his mind just goes wandering at the wrong time.

Would have liked to have seen Johnstone yesterday, thought he was looking solid pre-season.

944~~~
The back pass thing was obviously a shocker, but he produced some good saves. 

I think he'd be better in a team constantly under attack rather than having the opportunity to lose concentration.

945~~~
It's incredible he has 5 clean sheets <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

946~~~
He's a good keeper with added brainfarts, like most keepers.

So far he's done very well and bar Swansea he hasn't made any mistakes that have cost us. He's actually had a couple of very good matches.

947~~~
The backpass was a really crap backpass, which put him under a lot of pressure. Still dealt with it very poorly though.  Some good saves, mind you. Once again, our goalkeeper was the busiest of the two.

948~~~
It really wasn't. It was bouncing as Blind played it there's not much else he could do, De Gea would have dealt with it no problem and no one would have given the pass a second thought.

949~~~
It really was. Blind could have taken the bounce out of the ball when he passed it back. Romero should have dealt with it better but it was a crap pass.

950~~~
I don't know about you but I can't stand when people disagree with you with "it really wasn't". Arrogance.

951~~~
You know what... it actually did happen. And we were ok.

952~~~
Indeed

953~~~
Right.

954~~~
Not with this guy, he has played 4 PL games and we lost 1 of them through him.

955~~~
This proves nothing at all, it's the typical stats without context pointlessness. None of the games Romero played were against top sides, in fact 3 of them were against second level opposition.

956~~~
It's a goalkeeper's job to deal with iffy back passes. It's why distribution is such a sought after trait in a goalkeeper. 

That aside, Romero made some very good saves.

957~~~
He saved us from complete and utter humiliation yesterday (if possible). As he did late on against Tottenham. His 5 clean sheets are completely warranted, as he has made some wonderful saves.

I don't see how his start is any different from De Gea's. He, too, was shaky and made a number of horrible mistakes, including that clanger that cost us a League final last year. We quite easily could have lost 3-0 had it not been for Romero. Conversely, I don't remember us even testing their goalkeeper.

958~~~

959~~~
Kuszczak-esque. Nothing to see here.

960~~~
I know, which is why I said he should have dealt with it better. Twice.

961~~~
He was great yesterdy. Yep, he made a mistake which could have cost us, but it didn't. On the other hand, he made some fantastic saves that kept us in match.

962~~~
A recurring fecking theme. Gone are the days when we could have a good old moan about opposition keepers having the game of their lives against us. I'd probably be able to list off every half-decent opposition keeper save in the whole season so far, all on the fingers of one hand.

963~~~
What a save. Been good tonight

964~~~
David who?

965~~~
Been better for us than Valdes had been.

966~~~
Superb save.

Would DDG have saved the goal though? That is the question.

967~~~
Romero playing like De Gea atm.

968~~~
Think we'll make him our #1 next season when Dave inevitably leaves?

969~~~
It's irrelevant tbh. David is miles better than most keepers on the planet so there's a good chance he would have saved. But he is injured. It's not like we benched de gea and played Romero.

970~~~
He's a very good shot stopper. It's just his tendency for brain farts that lets him down.

971~~~
My point is that it's difficult to truly appreciate how many points DDG earns us. If we lose him we'll never know how many goals he would have prevented.

972~~~
Unbelievable save. Looking forward to that save convincing people he can be DDGs replacement. He can't. He's shite.

973~~~
No, that would be a stupid thing to do. Played well tonight, made a few brilliant saves, still not good enough to be our #1.

974~~~
Terrible player, not a regular starter in the italian serie b

975~~~
Well done lad.

976~~~
Stepped up and put a classic ddg performance. Some ridiculous good saves, but nothing to do for the goals. First one deflected on smalling, and for the second credit to the tall guy, placed it perfectly and romero had his view blocked. Good game.

977~~~
I wouldn't trust him not to miss-kick a simple backpass or drop an easy catch but he made a couple of excellent reflex saves tonight, kept us from being fully humiliated.

978~~~
Great performance. A shame he was on the losing side, after making two or three superb saves.

979~~~
I think that is the thing with Romero. Some great reaction saves, great with the ball at his feet but an absolute howler is never far away.

980~~~
He didn't deserve to be on the losing side. His third save was world class, he had no right to make that save. If it wasn't for him the tie would be over already.

981~~~
Some superb saves today. MOTM easily.

982~~~
I'm honestly surprised how good he was.

983~~~
Pulled off some good saves and his kicking was good too. Same again from him hopefully against Shrewsbury

984~~~
he reminds me of heurelho gomes a bit. capable of making some excellent saves but also makes jaw dropping mistakes too often to be considered quality.

that said he was great, only reason why we're still in this tie.

985~~~
Probably get it in the neck for this, but although he made two great saves, I think he should have done better for their goals. I actually think DDG would have saved them.

986~~~
A good back up, hopefully he's not the ambitious type.

987~~~
Gomes has actually been one of the best goalkeepers in the league this season. But I understand your point, when he was at tottenham, he wasn't as consistent.

988~~~
agree that he's been great at watford so far. was brilliant at psv a long time ago as well.

989~~~
Really slow for their goal today and his kicking was giving me scares throughout. Hit the charging player once too and was lucky to get away.

He's just not that good.

990~~~
Should have done better for their goal but so should the defence for that matter.

Not many better #2's than him.

991~~~
Let's be honest, he did well last night. Especially punching out the few aerial balls they had, as we had a short defense

992~~~
I love how positive he is on the ball, never hoofs the ball when its possible

993~~~
There is a huge difference between him and Dave but for a no.2 he's alright. I thought Dave would have saved the goal though

994~~~
He's basically Barthez but not quite as good isn't he? Talented, inconsistent, mental and a bit of a flapper. I'd take Johnstone over him any day myself but I do think his kicking is pretty good which is I expect what Van Gaal likes about him.

995~~~
Big Serge reckons he can oust De Gea out of the #1 spot.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/news/sergio-romero-i-can-be-man-utd-no-1-under-mourinho" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.teamtalk.com/news/sergio-romero-i-can-be-man-utd-no-1-under-mourinho</a>


Bless.

996~~~
He can't say 'I know he is better so I'm happy to sit on the bench' 

Seems like a normal response

997~~~
Maybe he know's Dave still wants to leave and Madrid have replaced the toner in their fax machine.

998~~~
He's the worst United keeper of the last 15 years, and one of the worst at any club in the league.

999~~~
He is comfortably better than kusczak Lindegard and all. He is also one of the most decent backups in any club (other than begovic)

1000~~~
Nah. He's shite.

1001~~~
Well I just don't like this post one bit.

1002~~~
Not even close.

1003~~~
C'mon hes better than Lindergard

1004~~~
I always feel he is an accident waiting to happen. wouldn't be missed

1005~~~
He is just speaking in a way I would expect a professional to speak. He's not going to say he's happy on the bench.

1006~~~
Riccardo and Carroll say hi ! But yeah he's shit, we must have a couple of decent goalkeeping talents in the academy.

1007~~~
What exactly has he done wrong to be named the worse keeper we've had for 15 years + worst in the league? Ridiculous statement. 

His kicking isn't the best, but I think he's a fine backup goalkeeper. I'm more confident with him than I was with PIG or Lindegaard (even though i liked him)

1008~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1009~~~
Yeah that is the problem of goalkeepers......he has made 2-3 fantastic saves during the match too but only that big mistake counts.

1010~~~
He did make a good save from Alexis on 1-1 situation. Just not consistent enough.

1011~~~
Romero is fine as back-up, his experience of the pressures of starting for Argentina are vital when he has to step in for De Gea.

Too error prone to be first choice, but as close to the best reserve GK that you can get.

Also importantly, seems to be reasonably happy as second choice.

1012~~~
Current goalies below. Whoscored don't rate Romero either, giving him just 6.4.  Valdés contract expires on 30 June, but it may not be worth resigning him. He's not played much over 2-3 years and the English PL is notorious for its general penalty area mayhem at set pieces. I doubt Valdes has seen this in the Spanish league. Also, Mourinho once had a huge <i>Barca vs. Real row</i> with him. I'm happy with Sam Johnstone, Dean Henderson, Joel Castro Pereira filling in on those once in a blue moon occasions when DdG is unavailable. Each have their good qualities, inspire confidence and all deserve a chance to show what they have. I think they've all done well on loan too.

------------------------- Age --- Height ------ WS Rating
David de Gea ----------- 25 --- 6` 3½" ----- 6.9
Sergio Romero --------- 29 --- 6` 3½" ----- 6.4
Víctor Valdés ----------- 34 --- 6` 0" ------- 6.9
Sam Johnstone --------- 23 --- 6` 4"
Dean Henderson ------- 19 --- 6` 3"
Joel Castro Pereira ----- 19 --- 6` 2"
Kieran O'Hara ---------- 20 --- 6` 1"
Ilias Moutha Sebtaoui -- 17

1013~~~
On £50k/week he better be. It's double what many first team goalies get.

1014~~~
Never been convinced he's good enough to be our backup keeper. Really don't think he's better than the names mentioned above who've previously done it. Think he's quite a bit worse.

1015~~~
Id get rid of him and Valdes and promote that Johnstone chap to number 2.

1016~~~
he looked good in what I saw of him in the Copa match.

But I would like to see Johnstone as the back up too. Think he has a great future with us.

1017~~~
It was a piece on the Norwegian supporter site about Romero thinking that the GK spot is now up for grabs after a change in managers. Good to know that he's the same ol, bit thick Sergio we've all come to love.

1018~~~
Perhaps he's holding out hope that David James will be recruited to Mourinho's coaching staff.

1019~~~
The strangest thing is that he's still Argentina's #1 despite hardly ever playing at club level.

1020~~~
Was thinking the same... Is their GK situation so dire that they have to use a keeper who has barely played any games whole season?

1021~~~
Oh. I see. He is still with us. Why don't standard liege buy him?

1022~~~
Yep. Assuming Johnstone is happy with a year or two as such.

1023~~~
Because he could earn more money at 100 other clubs.

1024~~~
I agree.  I thought Johnstone looked good enough last pre-season to have a place in the team.  Hopefully Mourinho will give him a look this summer.

1025~~~
Was pretty good for Argentina yesterday.

1026~~~
he has been good for Argentina. I hope he gets some cup games and some League matches too.

1027~~~
Blows hot and cold tbh. He can make good saves and also incredible blunders. I see him staying as our second keeper though for now.
