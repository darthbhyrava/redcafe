1~~~
Can he have an even greater moment than last season? How can he one-up taking corners and planking mid-game?

2~~~
Scoring a penalty by running up and heading it into the net should do the trick.

3~~~
How many injuries will he cause to our players this season? *Sweepstake*

I'm going for 6.

4~~~
Yep, that would do.

5~~~
I thought he was decent. He has this tendency to follow his man into the midfield though, and it leaves a lot of space in behind. I think it cost us a goal against West Brom last season where he did the same thing. Probably just needs to communicate better with whoever the CM is that is playing in front of him.

I know he gets injured a lot but this is a bit much

7~~~
For every good thing he does I feel he's just as likely to gift the opposition a chance. He has time on his side but shouldn't be starting ahead of Smalling yet.

8~~~
He's quite a defender for his age, hope he partners with Smalling coming season. (Of we dont sign a new CB).

9~~~
He looks so uncomfortable in possession. Seemed to be forever getting us into trouble.

10~~~
Did fairly well today.

11~~~
Van Gaal will always encourage his defenders to come out with the strikers when they drop. Just needs to just stand instead of always trying to win it when he gets there, but apart from that, I thought he was fine.

12~~~
Still has that tendency to try and win the un-winnable when he just needs to hold his position and shadow the player, but overall I thought he was decent today.

13~~~
I thought he was going to get sent off for a bit but he was fairly good.

14~~~
I liked it every time he barged into Suarez and sent the cannibal toppling. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 
Players like Fellaini and Jones make me happy that way - they might get cards and injure people and play horrible football at times, but all teams need enforcers to deal with cnuts from time to time.

That said, don't want either of them to start for us. We have sorted the midfield out, now time for a new CB. With his clumsiness on the ball, poor positioning, rash behaviour and frequent injuries, no way Jones can be counted upon as a regular starter.

15~~~
having a mare against psg atm

16~~~
If he played for one of our rivals he'd be a laughing stock on here.

17~~~
Blind not yet being aware he's playing as CB today isn't helping much either though.

18~~~
He's very bad today, in fact he has been quite bad for a while now. Really needs to step it up if he wants to stay here. Smalling on another level at the moment and will be very disappointed if Smalling does not start on the 8th of August.

19~~~
He gets caught out far too much by long balls for my liking.

20~~~
I know it's only pre season, but Smalling is just better.

21~~~
It was the Aguero goal from last season all over again. He needs to be switched on at the near post.

Though schweinsteiger should have also tracked properly.

22~~~
I'll shit in my trousers if he becomes our first choice centre back....

Better yet, I'll shit in someone else's trousers.

23~~~
Well you can forget me, because there's already shit in my trousers after the first goal.

24~~~
Yep, I've said the same many times on here.

Donkey brained defender who becomes a semi-cult figure because of his unfortunate face and clumsiness. Next one after Evans who needs to be phased out.

25~~~
Smalling is contemplating eating a bullet from Hank Voight in Chicago right now, Jones positioning and concentration just are not up to it against any forwards with good movement.

26~~~
He's definitely not been good this pre-season.

27~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Oh Jonesy, Jonesy... what was that, mate ?

28~~~
At fault for both goals today. Hes got all the attributes to be a great player but he just does not use his brain. I started to think a year or two ago he wasn't going to make it here and after games like today I might be right.

29~~~
The footballing brain is the most important aspect for any aspiring talent and Jones footballing brain isn't good enough for him to ever be a top centre half.

30~~~
This.

The higher-ups at United should have thrown the towel on Phil Jones a long time ago when it became clear that he has zero brains.

31~~~
At the risk of being quoted in the mental posts thread, sell him right now. I know it's preseason but he is not and will never be good enough.

32~~~
I wouldn't sell him, however FFS add some quality competition at CB. We need it

33~~~
Has the IQ of dusty bin on the football pitch.

34~~~
I don't see how he can be first choice ahead of Smalling. He doesn't own his area like Smalling, isn't as strong and isn't as natural a defender.

35~~~
He's got to start the game better if he is going to improve.  I'm repeating myself with this, but he is too often having to belatedly react.  

Salling made this changeand look at the improvement.  Without Jones' athleticism he looked like he just wasn't good enough.  Starts reading the game and dealing with matters when they're manageable and bam, class center half.  

Jones is caught in the same rut.  Sometimes he can scramble and make it work, but sometimes--like tonight--he just can't.  It simply de-pants the defense.

It's a total lack of thought and instinct.  He's like a lab chasing a thrown tenis ball: no thought on how it will bounce or where it will go, just chase it.  Well, no, Phil.  'Fraid your gonna have to start thinkin' here, bud.

He let Ibrahimović go right by and split him and Blind.  He assumed Blind would cover, but he was nowhere near.  He simply didn't know where his partner was.  It's fair to say they are a new pairing, but look if you don't know.  He has to have the instinct to defend from the inside out.  Lock down the deep inside defense and expand from there.

36~~~
At the start of the summer if we had bought two new centre backs nobody would have been surprised. To not buy any and find ourselves in a situation where this klutz has somehow manouvered himself into a position where he looks first choice is absolutely criminal from LVG. My only hope is LVG has given him a run, a final chance, just to prove he is not good enough.

37~~~
He did say after the game he hasnt decided on RCB.

38~~~
I've said it for ages, he's a liability but compared to Smalling, Evans, Blind, everyone else he gets the benefit of the doubt and you get called mad for questioning him. He needs to up his concentration.

39~~~
Ditto.

40~~~
He's really not very good. Too often a liability and has he improved at all since we signed him? I don't think so. I have hope for Smalling but don't see Jones being anything other than a rash O'Shea.

41~~~
Pity we didn't have the current John O'Shea cause even today he'd still get the nod over Jones.

42~~~
If LVG plays him ahead of Mike I'll go livid

43~~~

44~~~
Been saying this for a while. He will never become a top defender. How long do we give the guy? to give him a new deal was crazy IMO.

45~~~
I thought he'd be an incredible defender when we first bought him, he had so much potential it seemed.  

He's still young so there's still time for him to improve but it doesn't look good at the minute. Madness to be playing Jones before Smalling though, why is Van Gaal doing it?

46~~~
Very poor game for him against PSG. Got out muscled easy by Matuidi which resulted the first goal and was unaware of his surrounding which presented Ibra with an easy tap in for the second. Just not good enough... first goal Jones poor positioning as he was on the wrong side of Matuidi which resulted him chasing and then just had no chance shrugging him off the ball, and the second goal... Jones just stopped running as the ball was put in and assumed keeper would get there but was unaware of his surroundings as Ibra came in between defenders and tapped it in. Watch the highlights and you see Jones didnt look around once when he was inside his own box and as the ball was put in, just immediately stopped.

Mostly the cause of these silly goals is a result of poor leadership from the backline. 0 commanding player in that defense that game. Need a leader in that defense. Jones isnt it as he cant sort himself out, so how can you expect him to do the same with that backline. I got high hopes for Smalling, but Jones just looks to be a squad player. Like another O'Shea. I'm not condemning him completely considering he has signed a new contract and he's only 23, but at this moment with chances and experiences he has had. I'd expect better.

47~~~
It's really funny if you look at him for the second goal, he absolutely had no idea where Ibrahimovic was, and he was the only player he could mark.

It wasn't entirely his fault IMO, but it just goes to show how unaware he always his in the defence, he was surprised that Ibrahimovic came behind him. Someone argued the other day that he is very intelligent, and yet he does this similar stuff all the time.

IMO, it's really worrying if van Gaal sees him as starter.

48~~~
I haven't watched the game yet but it sounds like the usual complaints about him being rash and out of position. Smalling/Jones is not strong enough in my opinion, though we might be better at the back if van Gaal actually played our best centre back.

49~~~
LVG did say he hasnt decided on RCB, maybe this game was the decider, LVG sensed Jones shouldnt be a starter.

50~~~
Was quite average against PSG, especially shocking for Zlatan's goal I thought. Doesn't really change my mind either way, for me Smalling has been much better for a while now.

51~~~
It's always been the case for me. They're both extremely athletic defenders but Smalling's just bigger, stronger, quicker and generally more athletic in every sense. That's just ignoring their defensive instincts/decision making where Smalling wins hands down.

52~~~
Looks like he is going to be jumped on for every mistake this season, this seasons scapegoat has been found it seems, and before a ball has even been kicked. New record?

53~~~
It's mainly this for me, Smalling really looks like a natural defender and has the right instincts in the position. Jones much less so, though his athletic qualities will enable him to have some very good performances at times.

54~~~
Well, looks like that he'll undeservedly become starter ahead our best defender last year so if he doesn't deliver it's expected.

55~~~
Well it's not like he has been fantastic every game up until now is it? He has been up and down like a Yo-Yo for 18 months now with little to no progression. Isn't good enough for a club challenging for the league \ CL.

56~~~
Why's it expected? Players make mistakes, why should he he over criticised for an error when Smalling gets away Scott free.

57~~~
As has Smalling, however you wouldn't think so by the  posts in here.

58~~~
I think it's more of a case that Smalling has been better out of the 2, although he seems much higher rated on here then he should be, my friends who support other teams laugh at the fact that Jones \ Smalling are our options. I'm still unconvinced by the pair of them to be honest, although if I had to keep one it would be Smalling.

59~~~
Didn't watch the game, but judging by the comments, he wasn't great. I will have to watch the goals myself though, beacuse I know Jones is one of the main scapegoats on the Caf.

Overall, I do think he's had a good pre season, though, and we shouldn't make out that he hasn't.

60~~~
When did Smalling get away with mistake? Every player gets criticised here for mistake he makes, it's simple as that. Jones is pretty much the main culprit for both goals last night, so he will be blamed.

61~~~
Last year, Darren Fletcher was amazing in pre season, but he couldn't hack it at turf moor, a few weeks later.

Pre season means eff all. Regardless of whether a player performs well or not. Let the folk here say what they want about Jones, however, what we've seen over the last two weeks means nothing.

62~~~
Possibly. Obviously that's a matter of opinion, however it seems like the manager has shown as much, if not more faith in Jones than he has Smalling. If Jones plays ahead of Smalling this season he will be criticised by many on here for little kid no reason, simply because they prefer Smalling, kinda childish when you think about it.

63~~~
Think it all depends on Evans mate if Jonny stays he will retain the title. If he goes then they have narrowed it down to Jones or Blind with Phil looking the favourite. 

Remember the days when pre-season games weren't televised and if they were bad performances weren't really looked into too much because well they are just warm up matches to get the players fit?

I miss those days.

64~~~
OK then <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

65~~~
Indeed.

66~~~
Agree totally, but he's not going to work in a possession oriented team where you have to pass out from the back. For all his entertaining gifs, Jones is a better footballer. LVG would rather include a player who is less talented defensively but can function in his system. Jones still has the higher upside in my opinion.

67~~~
At the moment,  we can only judge him on the pre season games though, because thats the only games he's had. Its the same reason people are going mad from Darmians performances in pre season. 

Jones, in my opinion, had a very good end to last season. I see no reason why he can't pick up where he left off.

68~~~
His defending (or lack of) for PSG's second goal was brutal. It's the sort of thing that isn't taught either. He should instinctively know where Ibrahimovic is yet manages to wander out of position, completely unaware of the only man he has to mark. It's inherent, this sort of thing, and Jones just doesn't have the required brains and nous. We've seen it too many times now.

69~~~
If this guy is ever going to be a starter for our team in the future, we are in deep trouble. He is 23 and has been doing the same crap for the last 3 years now, there has been no progression in him as a player. The next Duncan Edwards my arse, please lets just get Smalling in and a left footed CB for the season...

70~~~
No, you're spot on. We watched him doing the same mistakes over and over again since he arrived, and I just don't see any hope for improvement when he has not shown any form of increasing footballing IQ at the very least.

71~~~
He also has trouble dealing with long balls. It's criminal. I remember him defending against Basel with Rio in 2011. They ripped him to shreds. He still makes the same mistakes as he did back then. 

And the amount of time he comes rushing out to the fullback area is silly. When did Rio ever do that? There is literally no communication in our defence. 

If we go in with our defence, we are not challenging for nothing. It will be a fight for 4th place.

72~~~
Generally there is a clear correlation of the 'scapegoat' tag and being a bit awful. I mean, the last two scapegoats were Evans and Cleverley who were just genuinely terrible.

No-one is making Jones scapegoat for yesterday games. Just that people are saying that he was at fault for both goals yesterday, which he was.

73~~~
He isn't cut out t be a footballer full stop. If he's not tearing around the place running into and flattening lads he's tripping himself upside down and all as a result of him being not to clued in as into whats going on around him, that's why he's always 10 or 11 yards behind the pace.  There's a breed of a donkey in him I'd say. If I was him I'd seriously start thinking about giving Rugby a shot now. Ring St. Helens or something Woodard.

74~~~
People tend to pick out all he faults in a player they dislike, especially if that player is starting ahead of their preferred choice. This is clearly the case with Jones.

75~~~
Rio Ferdinand used to regularly go to sleep and lose his man up until the age of 24/25. He was far more talented than Jones admittedly but whingeing about a 23 year old defender occasionally switching off...after a meaningless friendly...following several other meaningless friendlies where he was decent...no comment.

76~~~
I'll be more concerned if he plays like that in a meaningful game. He didn't perform like that in the second half of last season where at times, he looked at home in the LCB slot. I'm not saying he was magnificent and completely clear of errors, but we were a lot more solid with him there and Smalling next to him.

77~~~
Rio Ferdinand could actually defend inbetween those concentration lapses, though.

78~~~
What you've just said has been known for at least two years now. He isn't a footballer.

He would be fine for a mid-table side but I have very strong doubts he'll ever be good enough for a team in Europe.

As you said, what he lacks is footballing intelligence and quite frankly (and rather embarrassingly) basic awareness of his man and even what he's doing himself. 

As other players with that limitation have proven, it's unlikely to come with age.

79~~~
Right, so Jones can't defend but has played for Man Utd since he was 19. OK.

80~~~
The Jones hatred is becoming tiresome and the season hasn’t even kicked off yet.

81~~~

82~~~
It is really funny how people fail to understand that this is pre season and all center backs are going to make mistakes at some point. Has anyone considered that maybe Schweinstiger being the world class CDM/CM he is, should have fully tracked zlatan back I stead of stopping at half way and failing to communicate with Phil Jones to keep heads up? No.Phil should have tried to be more aware but the lack of perspective is astonishing. I will laugh very much when the cafe goes crazy if we get a center back and he makes some mistakes during games.

83~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

84~~~
Absolutely. Every CB is likely to make these odd mistakes from time to time. Also these late running players are very difficult to track. Michael Owen scored a lot of goals from that position when he played for Newcastle under Keegan with Viduka and Martins ahead of him. Lampard was also very good at making these runs. It is very difficult for CB to track these late runs. I think we tend to over analyze at times and emphasize more on negatives rather than positives. He looks a decent player.

85~~~
Absolutely. He should have kept his head up once, but Schweinstiger is at fault for failing to track back his man and failing to communicate with Phil Jones. All defenders make mistakes during games, that is how chances are created and goals are scored. It is the frequency of the mistake being made, being able to recover from it, and learning from it that plays a factor in what makes a good defender or a bad one.

86~~~
Not even on bench. Is he injured?

87~~~
Yep

88~~~
<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> 

Cheers.

89~~~
Woah! Get well soon.

90~~~
That's a bit serious? Hope he recovers well. Need to get Rojo up to fitness in case we have an injury then.

91~~~
Yikes! It always puzzles me how athletes can be unlucky enough to get thrombosis. The only other times I ever heard of that in athletes was with a few ice hockey players.

92~~~
He cant catch a break. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Get well soon Phil!

93~~~
Gutted. Hopefully he's fine sooner.

94~~~
Nice to see rational opinions in this thread.
There is nothing he could have done to prevent this. 

Hope he gets well soon. It's a shame for him as it seemed he was first choice.

95~~~
If it means Smalling starts, then I'm not that fussed. Sorry if that sounds incredibly blunt and harsh.

I mean obviously, they should be starting together, but Van Gaal and his hipster ways.

96~~~

97~~~
<insert Joke about Phil Jones being so reckless he even bumps into people in car-parks here>

98~~~
So he's been back in training for a week ? 

Need him back now ASAP with Shaw's injury.

99~~~
I want this man back and Blind to go to left back

We might finally get my dream of the smalling and Jones partnership

100~~~
Back in the squad for the Sunderland match?

101~~~
That's about the only positive about Shaw being out, it forces LvG to move Blind, which makes room for Jones and Rojo.

I wouldn't be too surprised if we get to see McNair in there for a few games as well.

102~~~
Nice to see Jonesy back, especially at a time when we're struggling with injuries in defence.

103~~~
While I don't really rate him it was good to see him get 30 minutes under his belt given our current defensive injuries.

104~~~
Jones-Blind becomes a reality during the season <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

105~~~
So, why exactly did he play right CB today with Smalling moving to the left when van Gaal and people here who apparently know van Gaal's stuff spent pre-season explaining to everyone that Smalling can't play on the left? Just van Gaal changing his philosophy again or Smalling becoming left CB in the meantime?

Btw, glad that he is finally back, at least we have some back up now.

106~~~
A part of the philosophy I guess. When you make a substitution you must feck with at least 2 players positions.

Doesn't make any sense apart from that. Jones played LCB last season with Smalling, and Smalling has rarely ever played LCB. The last time I remember him playing there was in the FA cup tie vs Arsenal - where he was again moved from RCB after a substitution.

107~~~
Surprised he was moved to RCB as when him and Smalling played together last season he played as the LCB.

108~~~
Yep.

But people and van Gaal will keep on convincing other people on van Gaal's rules only for van Gaal to ignore them completely and do something completely different. It's not big thing in general, but discussions about van Gaal's rules have became so boring that I feel the need to criticise it when he breaks them(and that happens often).

109~~~
I assume that since our ball-playing CB went off, he wanted Jones on his stronger foot since he's better at passing the ball out from the back than Smalling is. I'm not sure what else it could possibly be.

110~~~
He obviously wants Jones to get ready for his RCB spot when fully fit, because Blind will play LCB.

111~~~
He is a good back-up option but I do not rate him highly enough to be a key player for us. He has time on his side of course but he really needs to sort out his injury problems.

112~~~
Going out on a limb here but i'm looking forward to seeing Jones starting for us. Smalling's marauding runs are great to watch and I think Jones is a better footballer than him. With the newfound midfield solidity this season his ability to join the attack could cause the opposition real problems. Jones & Blind against weaker teams could be great to watch.

113~~~
Smalling has been a rock at the back for us and been our best defender so far. I am not sure changing our CB partnership for the sake of it is a good idea. We should keep our back 5 as similar as possible so that they can form a good understanding with each other. It would make no sense to drop Smalling for Jones against any team at the moment.

114~~~
Yeah, I'm not sure I'd drop Smalling. Just saying I'm looking forward to Jones playing again. He might add something a bit different. Not that it's worth breaking up the Blind-Smalling partnership though.

115~~~
Even if Jones is better footballer than Smalling (debatable IMO as Smalling has improved a lot), he isn't a good enough footballer to make much difference to our attack. He can be reasonably relied upon to pass to teammates close to him but doesn't have ability to hurt opponents with his passing. Nor do his runs from deep cause the opponents much problems (neither do Smallings, btw) - I don't remember the last time Jones made a significant contribution for us to score goal from open play. (Edit: Disclaimer: Apart from his first season at United, which was terrific but he hasn't replicated that since).

Having said that, I too am looking forward to Jones playing again as I think LVG can develop as an excellent defender in a similar way to Smalling.

116~~~
See I would disagree with this. This was discussed on MOTD recently actually. We're very one-paced when it comes to passing it round. Which is a problem. However the two ways we do manage inject a bit of urgency is either Blind picking out a ripper of a pass or Smalling using his pace to charge forward. He has improved a lot but I just think Jones could add a little more if it was him making the marauding runs. Which we've seen glimpses of in the past when he was picked in midfield but only very rarely as a defender because he's never had the luxury of Carrick and Schneiderlin plugging gaps when he leaves his post.

117~~~
Tbh I am not a big Jones fan. Think he is too rash and he still has those rough edges to his game. I know he will get his chances soon but right now we are leading the table and I think it is better not to tinker too much with a formula which is providing results and put some serious pressure on the chasing pack over the next few weeks.

118~~~
Hopefully he starts against Arsenal with Smalling allowing Blind to go to LB and Darmian to go to RB.

119~~~
Good to have him back. Did well today late on.

120~~~
Doesn't seem likely.

Seems he isn't fit for a full game yet plus LVG has that left foot fetish still.

121~~~
He needs to be reintroduced very slowly imo. Otherwise he'll inevitably injure himself for another few months.

122~~~
Three sub appearances is not being reintroduced slowly?

123~~~
<b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline">Very</span></i></b> slowly!

124~~~
very happy he is back.

125~~~
In his element at the end under heavy fire.

126~~~
Missed the game, what position did he play?

127~~~
Thought he did fine when he came on, plugged things up better than Blind had been doing as Wolfsburg piled the pressure on.

128~~~
LCB, Blind moved into midfield.

129~~~
RCB, Smalling shifted to the left just like the weekend.

130~~~
PHIL JONES comes back and suddenly Herrera, Rojo, Carrick, and McNair are injured. SMH.

131~~~
He knows what he's doing, the sneaky bastard

132~~~
Called up by Hodgson. Ridiculous decision.

133~~~
Thought he did really well when he come on yesterday. Made some crucial blocks/interceptions and was good aerially. Still don't understand why Van Gaal puts him as a right sided centre back when Smalling is on the pitch, though. Despite being right footed, I think he's arguably better on the left then he is on the right.

134~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> His face in the Match Day Ratings. 

Thought he was very good today beside Smalling. We should be developing them as the core pairing.

135~~~
Glad to see him back. One of my favourite players. Was really good today. Him and Smalling, despite Van Gaal wanted a left footed centre back, should be our centre back partnership.

136~~~
Why is this thread so quiet? Did the 'Phil Jones is shit'  brigade miss the game?

137~~~
Thought he played well, looked slightly rusty but that's to be expected as he hasn't played many minutes.

It looked like Smalling took care of Lukaku after Jones didn't keep tight to him in the beginning of the match - I could be wrong, my stream was very dodgy in the first 10 mins or so

138~~~
They're too busy wanking to Smalling.

139~~~
I was thinking that. Guess all the attention is with Smalling, but Jones was also very good, especially when you consider this was his first start.

140~~~
Phil Jones is always like that ugly English bloke at an Californian party...he's ok, you talk to him...but not about him.

141~~~
Deservedly so. Jones was good though.

142~~~
He survived today despite the bleeding nose. Hopefully the sign of future Vidic factor. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

143~~~
Didn't feck anything up and made a couple of dece4nt tackles.

144~~~
Was very good today especially considering that it's his first start of the season. If he steers clear of those little knocks we could find ourselves with a very solid back four this season and that will be crucial if we want to challenge for things this season.

145~~~
Thought he did well considering the lack of game time he's had. Smalling is playing so well that hopefully Jones will get some confidence along side him and work his way back into contention as first choice because although he needs to improve, Rojo doesn't convince me and with Blind we have an immediate physical weakness in the back line for the opposition striker(s) to target.

146~~~
Barely noticed him actually which is not a bad thing for a defender!

147~~~
Had a really good game.

Him and Smalling are a partnership I want to see more of.

148~~~
He's actually a good player, people make fun of him because he's clumsy and makes funny faces but I have no doubt he can make a Smalling-esque rise if he stays fit and gets games.

149~~~
Impressive performance from him today considering it was his first start for the season. I think he will be considered a automatic starter in a season or two if he can get over his injury problems still only 23 which is no age for a defender

150~~~
Good performance today . Best header of the ball while lying down in the league <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> .

151~~~
I love him but I don't want to praise him because he will get injured again soon <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

152~~~
Agreed. He was very good last season as it was and should only get better if he can get a run of games.

153~~~
Not that's it's the be all end all, but Phil Jones was WhoScored's highest rated defender last season.

He's a very good defender. 

If he could stay fit he'd be at Smalling's level.

154~~~
So Blind on the bench and Rojo at LB puts paid to this stuff about Van Gaal only ever playing a right and left-footer as a central pairing, right?  IMO he picked our best two central defenders today. More of the same please.

155~~~
Took all of 40 mins for calamity jones to see blood. I hope he stays fit, we are a totally different side with the foot speed of him and smalling in defense.

156~~~
indeed. Jones Smalling partnership if not broken, will even stop all this talk of Stones. Think he is off to Chelsea in the Summer anyways.

As for Blind, I see him as a straight replacement for Carrick next season.

157~~~
Had a great game today, him and Smalling hardly put a foot wrong against a very tough opponent.

158~~~
Impressed with his performance. Looked very composed and mature in the way he went about things. Good to see.

159~~~
He's said himself that he always wants to play with symmetrical centre backs, and it seemed like he was serious about it given that Blind partnered Smalling in almost every game, ahead of actual centre backs.

I think he would definitely prefer to do so, but needed to give rests to a few players. I predict he still sees Smalling and Blind as the #1 pair. 

I hope I'm wrong though. I like Blind and he's done well, but actual centre backs playing centre back just sounds crazy enough to work. Like it did today.

160~~~
Really happy with his performance. I really want Smalling - Jones partnership to grow. Something Fergie had in mind when he bought Jones and Smalling. Hoping he gets back to full fitness.

161~~~
Good today but, do not trust the guy at all. 

You watch, he'll injure the retina in his eye reading the paper during the week

162~~~
This is the problem though - I don't think we'll ever get to find this out as he is both injury prone and too often hits the self destruct button with regards to tackles that get him injured unnecessarily.  He's been around too long now for me too think he just can't change that element of his game

163~~~
Loved the little headed flick he did when lying on the ground from DDG's foot save. The kind of improvised nuttiness that only Phil Jones delivers.

164~~~
It was ever thus for Smalling at the same age though, some young players bodies react differently when being thrust into professional football at 18 years of age when the growing process still isn't really done with. It can have longer effects than just those immediate years as well. Luckily we are in a position where he didn't have to get rushed back and we are being rightly cautious with him. 

I don't see him starting in the week, we will probably see Blind there and then Jones back and ready for another physical test Vs. Wilfreid Bony.

165~~~
It was good to see Jonesey put in a solid shift yesterday.  I can't think of a single blunder or even bizarre facial expression.  Did we ever learn what caused the nose bleed?

166~~~
Great performance, didn't put foot or head wrong. Fighted with Lukaku very well when needed. I hope he can stay injury free and we will se a defender i believe he can become.

And I must say i hate that we have that picture of him on the forum. Maybe it is funny to some people but i think it is stupid.

167~~~
I agree with Jerch, I'd like that pic removed...  I quite like Jones and think he's a very suitable CB as a 2nd/3rd CB rotation in our potentially world class club.  18 months ago I was making the argument on the newbies forum that Phil could become world class himself but it was Mike that took that step!

168~~~
Saw a lot of criticism of Jones but apart from the penalty moment were he seemed to hesitate after it came off DDGs legs I thought him and Smalling looked good again

169~~~
Haven't seen clearly but quite possible that even in the penalty moment Doumbia was encroaching. The whole team seemed behind him so rough to blame him.

170~~~
I miss Blind. Jones is trash. Utter, utter, trash.

171~~~
Jones hasn't been great but to be fair blind hasn't been able to cope in away games like this when the opposition attack with intent, I think we should all be relieved he isn't playing.

172~~~
No, he isn't.

173~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

174~~~
He had that other dodgy moment where he completely missed a header which almost let a striker through and then after being bailed out by Smalling immediately sold Valencia way short on a pass and almost gave it to their striker again. Along with falling asleep at the penalty he's not covered himself in glory. Our attacking play has been a much bigger concern though.

175~~~
He's either injured and not playing or not good enough when he's in the team.

176~~~
That situation when Valencia was fouled in our half Jones messed it up twice in space of 20 seconds. First he creates dangerous situations for them out of nothing just because he is stupid and Valencia saves him and after that he messes up simple pass to Valencia but thanks to Valencia's pace again he got away with it.

177~~~
He played a lot better as the game went on. Musa had isolated him constantly but he managed almost every time, with very little reliance on Smalling too. Impressive signs.

178~~~
Looks like falling down any time. Had a decent game though.

179~~~
Did well today.

Him and Smalling our the best CB pairing we have defensively.

180~~~
He was slow to react on the penalty and had a couple of trademark brain farts in the first half, but was better in the second.

181~~~
His understanding with Smalling is very good. I don't trust him as much, but he is also excellent one on one. Good pace and very strong.

182~~~
Much better in the second half, he doesn't offer blinds range of passing but he is much ore proactive defensively and he can actually cope defensively against pace.

183~~~
Harsh to criticise him for the penalty incident. It was completely unexpected and it just happened that doumbia reacted first. Could have very easily gone the other way.

184~~~
Did OK I thought.

Still doing some stupid shit like passing the ball with his head to a marked teammate 5 yards away, when he has time to take control of the situation. His lack intelligence and composure stands out in this side.

185~~~
Erm... Do coaches ever teach players at elementary school level to try getting to the ball first after a penalty is kicked? That is a weak excuse for stopping in his tracks like he did. Anything can happen on a penalty as much as in normal gameplay.

186~~~
Lots of quality, stand out individual defending, most notably the way he stood up to Musa in the second half, but there's just some stupid streak inside of him that doesn't seem to want to rid itself.

That mix up with Valencia in the first half could have very well lead to a goal. It's basic things, things he's more than capable of dealing with and completing without fuss. 

He's got to concentrate and eliminate these brain farts because they will cost us against better sides.

187~~~
He was alright. Unfortunately he had two or three iffy moments that might overshadow everything else he did.

188~~~
Has the footballing IQ of a lamppost

189~~~
1. It wasn't <i>that</i> unexpected. De Gea was facing a penalty kick, not a firing squad.

2. Yeah it could have gone the other way, if Jones was better at football.

190~~~
How was it completely unexpected? It's a penalty, rebounds happen.

191~~~
He's been out for ages. Excels in an adrenaline-fuelled comeback then ropey in his second game back. Happens all the time. Had some good moments too tbf.

192~~~
He had a decent game. Hope he keeps improving...

193~~~
I thought he was OK and improved as the game went on but there was a few nervy moments in the first half where he was caught out positionally and Valencia got him out of trouble. Will hopefully now know not to wander lazily to a follow up shot if the keeper saves.

194~~~
He was out for nearly two months. A few iffy moments in a tough away game, which we didn't lose, and people are jumping on his back already? Some of our fans are so agenda  driven it's pathetic.

Go watch Rio at 23 and see how he did week in week out. It's like young players aren't given a chance to mature anymore.

195~~~
play him , play him and play him, he will come good if he doesn't get injured. I feel actually quite comfortable when he plays and we don't have ball, more comfortable than having Blind there. The situation is inverse when we have ball but solid difference is basics.

196~~~
He was alright, but I think he will stay at this level, just doesn't seem to read the game well, like other top defenders do. Relies on his pace and physical advantage to bail himself out.

197~~~
Not to derail the thread, but there is a lot of revisionism about what Rio was like at 23. Fact is he starred at the world cup finals and Fergie bought him for big money straight after instead of following up on Nesta. Jones is nowhere near that level so far.

198~~~
It's not revisionism. He was unquestionably the CB with highest potential in the world back then, and already a very good player, but he had his fair share of iffy performances especially after the ban, which lead to Keane calling him out in that infamous interview.

It's only when we bought Vidic and Evra, by which point he had a settled defence to play in, that he truly excelled and became the best CB in the world.

199~~~
The ball changed direction after the save. Doumbia got lucky. He needs a run of games. Smacking was the same and written off continually. Once he finally gets fit and plays a string of matches we see how good he is. Jones deserves the same chance if he can stay fit for a while.

200~~~
Comes down to "do you pick a CB for when you have the ball or when you don't" and it's a no-brainer. Jones is superior to Blind in most aspects and certainly deserves to start.

201~~~
Really needs to work on his weight of passing. Does a lot of nervy pass backs but I think we're better with him in the defence.

Darmian Jones Smalling Shaw would have been nice to witness.

If we could combine his physical strengths with Blind's on the ball ability we'd have one incredible defender.

202~~~
They are 3rd and 4th CBs for a team looking to win the title and join Barca/Bayern/Madrid at the top of Europe. If we sign a clear starter at LCB and sell Rojo to cover about 1/3rd to a half of the money required, then we have this:

Shaw-LCB-Smalling-Darmian
backed up by
Blind-McNair-Jones-Valencia

which looks really strong to me. Blind can play instead of McNair if he beats him out (and provide cover at DM once Carrick moves on) and maybe in the summer of 2017 Valencia moves on and we sign a top RB if Darmian hasn't become one.

203~~~
Smalling wouldn't have let Doumbia past him

204~~~
I think a lot of his critics in this thread are the ones who lack footballing intelligence.

205~~~
Smalling was even further away from the ball than Jones when the follow up came in.

As a striker, you take chances. As a defender, you have to react. Jones could have done better, but if he'd made an instinctive run he could have just as easily ended up leaving an even bigger gap. It's difficult to criticise a defending player for not following a ricocheting ball in the penalty area.

206~~~
Cost us on the penalty, but was solid defensively otherwise. His passing, however, was pretty bad. Normally you pick defenders by their ability to defend first and foremost, but when our strategy is based on building up from the back we are really hampered by the Smalling-Jones pairing. Blind is less defensively solid, but does an excellent job of complementing Smalling and driving our attacking play from deep. It's a dilemma.

207~~~
He's a squad player. We should bring in a quality CB to partner Smalling

208~~~
If we're going on last nights performances we need to replace Smalling too. He was gash as well.

209~~~
It's easy to criticise him. Defending a penalty your one and only responsibility is to beat your man to a potential rebound. They literally have no other responsibility.

210~~~
Fitness issues haven't allowed him to kick on as he should have but against decent teams he has to play because in spite of his limitations he is still a much better defender than Blind when we need to defend well. Last night his passing was disappointing at times, should have done better at times but I think overally he was good, especially in the second half.

211~~~
We need at least 1 world class CB. We've been having too many players whose on decent for a short period of time

212~~~
Just seen another replay. He definitely should have done better. Other than Schweinsteiger, none of our players were sharp enough.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/anigift9juz.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/anigift9juz.gif"/>

213~~~
Wasn't particularly impressed.

214~~~
Awful. Just switched off entirely.

215~~~
He scares the feck out of me. 

Not good enough.

216~~~
You are easily scared/
He is doing fine

217~~~
He's been...eh, shaky.

218~~~
Defended very well. One shaky moment but he might not have got a shout from De Gea.

219~~~
He only scares me when he's on the ball and under pressure.

220~~~
Fortunately you guys being scared has no actual effects on the game.

221~~~
People watching a different game to me, he has been good

Had an awkward moment which was not his fault when maybe DDG should have given a Shout but he did the right thing and cleared it

222~~~
Been spoiled with Blind at CB. Blind is such a good passer whilst Jones is probably the worst passer on the pitch. Every time he gets the ball City stop pressing and get organized. If he brings up the ball he's playing into their hands.

223~~~
Yep. Defended well. I would have been more concerned had he let that ball bounce when De Gea didn't give him a shout. He had to clear it.

224~~~
Think he's done pretty good to be honest, offered support to Valencia a lot when dealing with Sterling.

225~~~
Impressed me much more in the second half. Loved his interceptions this half.

226~~~
He's had a good half, to be fair. Looking a bit better.

227~~~
Made some minor mistakes in the first half but has been really good in the second.

228~~~
He's a bit of a disaster waiting to happen. He's not a bad player but he lacks composure and his passing is a bit meah

229~~~
Few dodgy mistakes but he's played well overall

230~~~
Defense was the least of our worries.

231~~~
He was fantastic in the second half. He didn't let Bony touch the ball and was on the end of every single one of their clearances. He was a big part of our dominance in the first 20 minutes of the second half. He simply didn't let them have the ball. Was great today.

232~~~
Well played today at City.

233~~~
The way some people go on every half like he's had about 5 moments where he's looked dodgy, you'd think we would concede a lot more goals than we do.

234~~~
Played well. Him and Smalling do look a decent combination.

235~~~
Thought he was dodgy.

236~~~
Dodgy? He had a great game IMO.

237~~~
What? Jones is far better on the ball than Smalling, and he brings it out with confidence. I thought Jones had an excellent game, his pace is a great asset and he's strong too. I can see the merits of Blind when playing against weaker opposition but the Jones-Smalling partnership is one that really excites me. We look very solid these days, and Valancia continues to improve defensively. 

Man of the match today for me.

238~~~
Yeah but you should check the alternate looking like you are going to mess up league table. We've lost every game he has played in this alternate league due to all of his looking like messing up but not actually messing up.

239~~~
Yup he did very well

His 3rd game of the season and him and Smalling are going. To form a good partnership assuming they stay fit

240~~~
He was mostly very solid, but he has some terrifying moments. Still often feels like he's just a minute away from an error much of the time.

241~~~
He was very good today, especially in the second half. 

Neither him nor Smalling can pass the ball though, which is very evident when compared to Blind's quality on the ball.

242~~~
Good game from him. Stood up to any challenge and didn't get injured which is a good thing.

243~~~
Our second best CB and with him, Smalling and Schneiderlin on the field defending is the least of our problems.

244~~~
He's been good since he's been back, good partnership with smalling developing too.

245~~~
Typical Jones performance, couple of shocking passes and other nervy moments when defendigng but brilliant second half. Stay conistent Phil ffs!

246~~~
He has moments where his power and pace are great assets but he always feels like an error waiting to happen in his head.

247~~~
I've been critical of him but he was better today.

Still made some bad calls with regards to his passing and positioning.

248~~~
Jones has played 3 games this season. He has won 72% of defensive duels, has a passing accuracy of 89%, performs an average of 9 defensive actions per game and has made 0 defensive errors.

That compares to Smalling, who has the consistency of playing 10 games, winning 53% of duels, 86% passing average, 9 defensive actions per game, and 0 defensive errors.

249~~~
Yeah but what are his stats in regards to looking like making an error, and scaring people. They are probably through the roof.

250~~~
Excellent today. He should be there to stay; I'd love to see this partnership develop (I thought Blind was fine, but I think he can be more useful for us at left back or even spelling one of our midfielders.)

251~~~
He still does really stupid things. He needs to cut it out, and quickly.

252~~~
His second half performance was pretty strong. I sure hope he can stay fit for the whole season, a partnership of him and Smalling could see us end the season with the fewest goals conceded, I reckon.

253~~~
I don't really get how people still say that he's a liability or accident waiting to happen when the only goal he's been responsible for in the past year has been stepping up to play Berahino offside in the 2-2 last season and people still saying that he injures himself by going in for stupid challenges when none of his injuries in the past 2 years have been caused by him making a an unnecessary challenge. Lazy stereotypes used by people who prefer to see the negatives rather than the large number of positives he's shown in the past year. In yesterdays game he cleaned up a number of times when Smalling was caught out of position or got caught too far forward yet if it was the other way round people would be slating him. People say he cant pass yet he consistently has higher pass completion than most defenders in the league and people say he cant read the game yet he consistently has higher interception stats than most defenders along with having more clearances and duels won than most defenders. But yeah he must be shit because it looks as though something bad might happen despite the fact that it very rarely actually does happen. People really do see what they want when it comes to certain players and judge certain players on a different scale to others.

254~~~
Spot on.

255~~~
That moment in the second half when he came forward quickly to pinch the ball just before the City player could get it was brilliant, Rojo did something similar a couple of minutes before that and it is fantastic that even our defenders are now trying to win the ball high up the field

256~~~
If Jones maintains his fitness he will have a breakout season, simple and straight forward. He and Smalling suffered immensely from having a GOAT defensive duo ahead of them which led them to being thrown around positionally but now they are showing their true mettle. It's just fitness that is holding Jones back now.

257~~~
Had a solid game yesterday. 

Still kinda feels like some people try to pit him and Smalling against each other as though we need to prefer 1 to the other and point out every little mistake made.

Just sit back and enjoy us beginning to build the foundations of a strong CB partnershp for the next ~7 years or so.

258~~~
I thought he was excellent yesterday.

259~~~
Fantastic post. Utterly true.

260~~~
<a class="username" data-user="29933, @jb8521" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/29933/">@jb8521</a> Great post, hit the nail on the head there.

261~~~
Spot on.

I was particularly impressed by his covering of Valencia, Valencia (who I also felt had a very good game) was up the pitch with Mata and Lingard like a wingback and it was ultimately down to Jones which allowed us to use Valencia as another attacking outlet.

262~~~
I think he's a decent to very good man-to-man defender but he has problems in those transitional plays, which are often due to his positioning/lack of concentration and I do think he has dodgy passing decision/intellect. There was one incident in the CSKA game where late in the game, Jones looked up very briefly and just chipped a loft ball into the direction of Fellani, when CSKA were already camped at the edge of their box, who were waiting for the counter and indeed it happened. 1) It was never going to be a good pass or even one that Fellani could have done anything with 2) he didn't realise the danger of that ball/position and Fellani had to track back and commit a tactical foul (I recall people were having a go at him in the match day thread), which he got booked for iirc.

Those are things he can improve on, just look at Smalling but that 'sense' of dread is definitely not bias. There are rational explanations like the reasons I've given to explain it but that might be over analysing a player, who can't get a decent run of consistent games so it's equally unfair. Once he has had that then we can judge him more fairly but my gut instinct is that he simply isn't good enough on the ball atm.

263~~~
Let's give this post some more love.

264~~~
Spot fecking on. If Jones can keep fit then I'm convinced that he can become a top CB for us, the lad is only 23 ffs! 

It might be a bit optimistic but I really think that Jones may have turned a corner this time. Just look at Smalling; he's been pretty much fit since last Christmas right? And Jones have been fit since the end of last season? Getting a blood cloth in your calf doesn't count as being injured.

265~~~
Super post.

266~~~
Where was he yesterday?Could have give Smalling a rest.

267~~~
After being out for so long, it's probably for the best he didn't play three games in quick succession until he's fully up to speed. Smalling is already match fit.

I also don't think central defenders need to be rested in the same way that other positions do. They cover a lot less ground.

268~~~
injured again!? after a full 2 games in a row?

269~~~
What's this about "red zone" Gray was on about following gaal interview. I missed that part

270~~~
He's a crock. He must be a terrible athlete to keep picking up these knocks, especially with his other rumoured talent of injurying others. Would suggest he lacks control over his own body.

Why's he fecking wrecked from playing two games?!

271~~~
He's not injured. He needs a rest because he's at a point where he's statistically more likely to get injured if he plays (the red zone thing). Basically LVG is carefully managing his fitness.

272~~~
Yeah, he's 'fatigued' after two games.

Think we can do better than that.

273~~~
So, apparently he is in the red zone. What is he, 41?

Commentator was actually on point when he said he is in red zone during his whole career so far. 

Not that we miss him that much be he is obviously still unreliable as always.

274~~~
Hopefully it's only a matter of easing him in after his latest injury. Playing three games in a row on this level right after injury isn't that good for him.

275~~~
Is he out of the red zone yet.

276~~~
As someone else said, he is the Red Zone.

277~~~
He did some light training. So maybe in the 'orange zone'.

278~~~
A player who had just returned from injury, and has had injury issues in the past gets rested after 2 back to back games and we're moaning? I'm not sure whether to take you guys seriously or not. You can never tell with the cafe these days.

279~~~
So, nothing new in Jonah's world - he is injured again.

Van Gaal first said he is in the red zone - meaning he is tired, but he is injured after all considering the latest reports are that he is "back on training pitch".

So, basically, he was fit just for few games since start of the season and we will have people again telling us how he is not injured all the time and asking how he is not first choice ahead of Blind.

He is simply not reliable.

I think this season will be probably a proof that he is even less reliable than someone like Rafael who got so much criticism for his injuries unlike Jones.
Btw, I don't think either of them deserves criticism for being injured all the time, they are obviously both very good professionals, they are just unlucky. Maybe they'll come good later in their careers and overcome injuries, at least I hope so because both of them have potential to be top players, I just can't understand how someone like Rafael got so much hate(yes, hate, some people actually wish him to fail) because he wasn't reliable due to his injuries, yet someone like Jones escapes criticism while being pretty much the same.

280~~~
That's a real shame thought he played well in the games he featured in, i prefer him over Blind anyday. Might be wise to get rid as he just seems to get injury after injury.

281~~~
Where did you read that he was injured?

282~~~
I prefer him over Blind in some games, but think that sometimes having Blind is better because of his distribution since we have Smalling playing alongside him. 

But we are in situation where we can't rest Smalling at all because Jones is injured all the time, so we have to play Smalling for full 120 minutes in fecking cup game because Jones is injured again. 

Tomorrow is another game where we could give Smalling a rest before the busy schedule but Jones is probably not ready yet. 

Basically he isn't reliable to be a squad option, let alone first choice.

283~~~
He missed last three games, van Gaal said on Monday that he was "doing bit of running" before the CSKA game and he didn't get any minutes against CSKA, I think it's fair to assume that he was injured. 

Even though, you can call it however you want, injury or whatever, the thing is that he missed three games again and he probably isn't ready to start tomorrow again.

284~~~
I would prefer Jones against West Brom. Pulls has come to score from set pieces.

285~~~
If Jones can shake off his injury problems like Smalling seemingly has, then we've got by far the best central defence in the league. They are both sensational players.

286~~~
Hope he makes it for tomorrow. The partnership with Smalling in 2015 when he's been fit has been excellent.

You might lose Blind's occasional pick out pass, but actually being able to handle himself when faced by a player at 6ft and over...it weighs out.

287~~~
I know lvg likes players who can adapt but this is a bit too much imo.

288~~~
Looked a little unsure at RB but I guess the main goal was just to get minutes under his belt.

289~~~
Played him on the right for solidity but in no way a long-term solution.  Not good enough on the ball to play there.

290~~~
I give up....

It's an absolute joke

291~~~
Played very, very well today. Can't keep fit.

292~~~
He's a crock. Think I've said that 10 times at least now. 

He's not even that good anyway for christ sake. Time to move him on.

293~~~
If these injury problems are going to continue then there's not much point keeping him. Especially as there are quite a few talented CBs around.

294~~~
I don't think he is badly injured. It looked precautionary to me, given his record with injuries.

295~~~
He is obviously still the most unreliable player in our squad. 

There were people who said at start of the season that he should be starter ahead of Smalling. Also, I remember the reactions to one post month or two ago that praised him a lot saying he isn't injury prone at all and blaming everyone who says that, loads of people agreed with that. Incredible.

Yep. 

As I said earlier this season, we got rid of Rafael even though our RB position is still a mess, and he has showed more than Jones in his United career, but rewarded Jones with new contract.

296~~~
Frustrating because he was very good today. Infact, his defending all season has been largely improved.

297~~~
Can't rely in him.

298~~~
Built like an OX but seemingly made of glass. He played pretty well before his injury though, his headed interception in the first half and the chase back against Ighalo were the highlights.

299~~~
Despite the injuries, we should still believe in him. He's only 23, and in my opinion, a really good defender. Smalling, up until this season, was like Jones with injuries, now look at him. 

Hopefully nothing too serious.

300~~~
That post you refer to didn't say he isn't injury prone, it said that his injuries don't come from him jumping into reckless challenges and injuring himself because of that.

And Rafael wasn't just sold because he was injury prone, it's clear van Gaal just didn't rate him. Which doesn't seem to be the case with Jones as he usually starts when fit.

301~~~
He was very good all game. Unfortunate about the injury. I am willing to persist though because he is playing well when he does play.

302~~~
Excellent player. Just needs to be given some time to get his injury problems sorted. Amazing how many people just want to give up on him at 23. So stupid.

303~~~
Exactly, the same people would have got rid of Smalling at 23 too but you can probably find them firmly up his ass now.

304~~~
Van Gaal played Rafael at the start until he got injured few times in a row and then he completely gave up on him, with many people here saying that Valencia should play mostly because you can count on him in every game, even if he isn't better than Rafael.

I think that post said otherwise, I'll try to find it later.

However, he is unreliable and shouldn't be trusted to be a starter for us.

305~~~
Smalling was nothing like him before, I don't know why people make that out. Smalling was always very good defender who had problems with injuries, and very rarely he was poor defensively. Jones didn't have single season where you could say he was very good defensively, he is player with lot of potential but he was always prone to mistakes and shit games every once in a while all while being injury prone.

306~~~
I got into a brief converse with a few on the match thread when I asked (rhetorically) why we keep Jones.  For all of his strengths, Jones AFAIC is just taking up payroll when he's on the physio bench most of the time.  We can draw comparisons to Smalling but in my own view Jones has never looked to really have the potential of Smalling and he's out of the lineup so often that we can't really tell what his potential is at this point.

307~~~
Aye but we had Rio and Vidic ahead of Smalling at that age, didn't we? Whereas Jones is probably one of our first choice CBs right now. Big difference.

308~~~
Not really as they were also injured half the time and had turned to shit while Smalling was 23. How is having less options an excuse for writing him off and wanting him sold?

309~~~
Just saw this and the main thing is he makes needless challenges at needless times. Last year against Newcastle at OT we were leading 3-0 and he trips colback who was going nowhere just inside the box. Then against Arsenal away last season, he was all over the place. He screwed up many passes and graciously made mistakes notably the header on the ground and the awkward pass to DDG which de gea had no idea how he cleared. He can recover most times but the fact is that he gets into these situations. Not to mention he went and kicked out at Henderson at anfield which may have been red on another day (he had banged also into lallana recklessly early on) as he kicked him in the knees. This is what scares me. He may be faster and burlier than blind but blind is more assured and doesn't put in reckless and needless challenges frequently. Jones is fully capable of a moment of madness. 

Personally I ike Jones. But the fact is he is always on the edge.

310~~~
He didn't play in the away game against Arsenal last year so fair play to him for managing to be all over the place. From what I remember of the penalty against Newcastle he pulled away his leg and Colback went down. He didn't kick out against Henderson he mistimed a tackle on the touch line and rightly got booked for it and the 1 with Lallana was a ball in the air which was there to be contested which he actually got his head to which looked bad because rather than go for the header Lallana just moved his body across Jones and planted himself. As for the header on the ground he slipped, it happens but he reacted to that and improvised to deny Giroud a goalscoring chance.

311~~~
love the lad. 100% commitment. And he is a damn good player.

312~~~
The Arsenal home sorry. 

In that game he was all over the place. He recovered well to improvise regarding that particular  incident after initially screwing dealing what was a very simple air ball to deal with. He mistimed his jump, panicked and then slipped and recovered. That's not even the only incident in that match where he panicked and almost screwed up. There was an incident I remember where a loose ball was chased by him followed by giroud and de gea was coming forward. Panicking, he kicked the ball which could have caught DDG off guard. Thankfully DDG's reflexes made him stretch his leg and the ball went out for a throw.

At anfield he didn't kick out Costa style but that mistimed tackle hit Henderson in the knee. That's reckless tbf mistimed or not. Which again was a result of him panicking after blind was dispossessed in our left flank. 

That is his problem imo. Panicky. Unlike blind and Smalling who rarely panic under pressure. This is why Jones seem to have more of these accidents. But don't mistake me, I like defenders like him but he needs to be more calm. So does Rojo. Though as you said, he is young and LvG can coach it out of him if he stays fit.

PS- hope I didn't offend you or anything. Cheers

313~~~
Am I the only one who is delighted to have him and Smalling as our CB partnership for the coming years, injuries permitting? I don't want us to sign a Jones replacement if he can stay fit. Physical monster and a fine defender.

314~~~
Nah, I agree with you.

315~~~
No, they're great together. Always have been.

316~~~
I agree as well. Just need to get them consistently fit at the same time. They always do well together

317~~~
His improvements are nearly as impressive as Smalling's for me, although probably heavily influenced by having Smalling alongside him. At 23 he's worth persevering with.

318~~~
Please stay fit. He's improved so damn much.

319~~~
He could be a very good defender if he actually played regularly.

320~~~
this , in a nutshell.

321~~~
He's going under the radar because Smalling's rise has been astronomical, but he's doing great.

Hope it was just a precautionary sub yesterday.

LvG seems to have his head screwed on about injuries, and 'red zones', so hopefully that helps Jones going forward.

322~~~
Yeah that's fair enough. No offence taken at all

323~~~
Yup, I've never really rated him much at all but this season his defending has actually been pretty impressive.

324~~~
I was a big Rafeal fan but let's be honest, his problem was not just injuries. Rafael was overrated by many after that one really good season he had. His final ball later on became crap since Moyes took over and even though it was a myth for the most part, he was a bit rash in some of his challenges.

EDIT: This might make it sound as I didn't like Rafael. Don't get me wrong, he was very talented and when on form could silence the best wingers in the game. However, I believe (and I'm sure many on here would agree with me) that Jones has the potential to be way better than Rafael. If he could overcome this injury nonsense he can be one of the worlds best - that is why people tend to give him more time.

325~~~
Completely agree.

LvG said that Jones is likely to miss PSV due to a twisted ankle, but I'm interpreting that as he'll be back for Leicester. Apart from his blood cloth, which doesn't really count, he's been fit for a decent amount of time now, right?

326~~~
Nice to see most comments are positive 

It's a shame he is so injury prone, I think he can reach Smalling levels if he can get a run of games going.

Important the club stick with him and find a way to keep him fit

327~~~
van Gaal rates him.

IF he stays injury free Smalling Jones partnership will be very important for us.

328~~~
Trade him for Stones

329~~~
We would still need another CB.

330~~~
Wut?

He is our just 17th most featured player this season in PL and 16th in CL, and after next game or two he will fall even more behind. Lingard has played just 25ish minutes less than him in PL, and is ahead of him in CL and he just "started" his season.

I have no idea how can anyone be happy with his fitness this year and say he is doing fine. Just after the blood cloth thing he played few games and apparently was tired after just few games which led to him missing few games again. He was back yesterday for first full game since that "tiredness" and didn't complete it because he injured himself, once again.

It will turn out that I hate Jones, but I really don't, I hope he can become great player for us and I agree that he has the potential, but I just can't understand how people have different standards on him in comparision with other players when it comes to injuries. I am not saying that we should sell him, I just can't stand people being ignorant when it comes to him. 

How exactly starting just three games out of 13 is something that is considered decent for a player who was considered(still is) as our first choice when the season started, who is almost 24 and is here for years now?

331~~~
I think that Jones has more potential too, but the difference is that Rafael actually showed that potential, for few periods his form was terrific(not just that year) and many thought of him as the best right fullback in league at times. Whether that was true or not it's not even important, the thing is that he was at least considered by many as one of the best in league(Fergie also said in his last season around January/Februarythat Rafael was one of our best players that year), Jones never managed that. I am not sure Jones ever played more than 3 or 4 games in a row at CB for us in his entire United career, so I really don't understand why he gets so much praise for nothing. People basically praise him just because he has the potential, not because he is showing that potential every week.

Edit: As for the being rash part, you can say all that about Jones too. Both of them are rash in their play, and both have the same problem of being caught out of position.

332~~~
There's plenty here who have always rated Smalling, despite the doubters, and not Jones and I'm happy to say I'm one of them. I'm a fecking Chinaman if Phil Jones is Man United quality but even if he could be he's out of action far too often to warrant being kept. Season 12/13 - 25 games missed, 13/14 - 8 games, 14/15 - 15 games, 15/16 - 11 games to date. It's simply not sustainable to carry players like this especially if there are also lingering doubts about whether they're even good enough. Last chance saloon this season as far as I'm concerned and I've long predicted that he'll be gone by next season.

333~~~
Good player, but always injured, useless like Woodgate, King, Rafael.

Let him continue his career away, in clubs like wba, everton, villa.

334~~~
Agreed sadly.

335~~~
El Crockerinho, we just can't carry him.

336~~~
made of glass

337~~~
Phil is our very own Daniel Sturridge - sadly

338~~~
Calamity Jones has returned! I wonder if he came on because McNair was injured or because LvG thought near death by 95 cuts was enough for the young lad.

339~~~
would have been a mad sub in the 90th min if McNair wasn't injured, and we were losing!

340~~~
Did he manage to make it through his 5 minutes on the pitch without getting injured?

341~~~
Glad he's back.

342~~~
Fingers and toes crossed he stays fit long enough to partner Smalling for a reasonable period. We're so, so much better when those two play together.

343~~~
Probably our MotM yesterday so fair fecks to him.

344~~~
or just a normal van gaal substitution?!

345~~~
A fine attempt at a tackle for Norwich's goal.

346~~~
Such a nervy player. He looks constantly stressed and he seems to infect the entire backline. Passing isn't good enough either for a top side. 

Tired of seeing this guy playing for United. The quality just isn't there whatsoever.

347~~~
He's like a crash test dummy, charging all over the place.

348~~~
He's not a very good defender is he?

349~~~
Liability at times. Poor judgement to press for both goals.

350~~~
Still got lots of improving left in him, see Smaliing, but right now we are always going to have a weakness if he is first choice centre half.

351~~~
This unfortunately.

352~~~
He looks like he hasn't got composure and often panicked when under pressure.

353~~~
Very average, hasn't improved at all since he signed.

354~~~
He's really stagnated, if we get a new manager in it could be make or break for his career at the club.

355~~~
Every game he plays, there seems to be at least one occurrence of him running past the ball, like he did for that goal. He's like a boxer (dog). Gormless, lumbering feck.

356~~~
Fine in individual work but somehow our line is a mess far more often when he is in at CB. Just seems to be more runners getting in behind. I'm not sure if it's chemistry with Smalling or positional cluelessness (my guess) but it's been a few years now.

357~~~
He is what epitomizes the fact that Fergie was slowly losing it as well and retired at just the right time. He thought he might go on to become United's best ever player, reminded him of Duncan Edwards. Add that to the slew of workhorse crap he bought in his last five or so years and the time he afforded dead wood such as Cleverley... 

His football wasn't getting any prettier either.

358~~~
The fact is that Ferguson won his last season 11 points clear, and you are still talking bs.

359~~~
I thought Jones started the match well but that didn't last long. Probably some rustiness after being out for a long time. Still think he can turn into a very good CB. Bad game though.

360~~~
He's the stupidest player I've ever seen in my life. He must have the same IQ as a potato.

361~~~
Can see him going the same way as Evans. Tremendous potential but stagnated by injuries.

362~~~
I still think he can come good as well; the injuries are the real problem though, as they rob him of any chance to find consistency.

363~~~
I like Jones but it's increasingly looking like he is not going to make the grade here.  He was appalling yesterday.  The thing that's worrying about him is that he plays out of control.  This perhaps explains his propensity to get hurt and more importantly, his poor awareness and positioning.

364~~~
Sell him.

365~~~
After we get someone in this time!

366~~~
It's pointless calling him "amazing potential" because he gets stuck in and has physical attributes. He's always been thick as pig shit and footballing intelligence is key for a defender. 


He's never going to make it here and constantly injuring himself will only delay the inevitable a la Anderson.

367~~~
Not Utd quality but a good squad player. Could equally still improve but just like Johnny needs to find his level elsewhere

368~~~
Good squad players are players that are dependable, not players that replace an injured player in the 60th minute and go off injured themselves in the 70th minute.

369~~~
The CB version of Anderson is exactly what he is.

370~~~
Evans has ability that Jones can only dream of.

371~~~
Good squad players are lots of things. Not sure he intensionally sets out to get injured and very good players get injured too....

372~~~
It's the other way around.

373~~~
He needs a Smalling type of metamorphosis, otherwise he is gone.

374~~~
If he had half a brain he wouldn't get injured so much. He dives into the most ridiculous situations.

375~~~
Its really not.

Evans is a good footballer, at his best a cerebral player, and a good defender.

Jones is thick, a bit of a clogger, and physical.

376~~~
We haven't seen much of that tremendous potential  in the last 2 years though. In fact, I don't think he ever has shown us anything extraordinary. We were all a bit influenced by SAF's Jones praise but in truth he is bang average and very injury prone. Lacks the intelligence to make it as a top defender, we should be looking at Stones next summer.

377~~~
I remember when he first joined he would go on these crazy rampaging runs from CB, often beating 2-3 players at a time. Was our most exciting young player since Rooney/Ronaldo.

378~~~
Wasn't it from right back?
I remember the Bolton game, he was insane.

379~~~
He needs a Jesus style resurrection if you ask me he's that far gone

380~~~
Yeah! That was a ridiculous game, the 5-0 I think. He set up Rooney's second with one of those runs and a shot that left Wayne with a tap-in.

381~~~
I still think he has a lot to give, he needs a season where he isn't injured for stretches, see what it did to smallings form.

He's still only 23, versatile and has a hell of a lot of experience, he's not a Buttner to just cast off for 4m.

382~~~
Jones smash! Recovery tackles are his bag, I know there's some stat about him and Smalling but I think Chris' game drops when paired with him.

383~~~
Terrible. Today and every day.
When Jones plays, we concede, its that simple.

384~~~
He's rubbish, if Evans had to go then so does he.

385~~~
He is rash and goes charging in without worrying about his position. The new Duncan Edwards my arse!

386~~~
Quite unbelievable how much worse than Smalling he is currently.

387~~~
Smallng suffers massively because Jones doesn't defend (well) on the front foot OR back foot and he doesn't pass well/comfortable in possession (with any opposition within a 10m vicinity). It basically means Smalling has to cover many different facets of the defensive + possession game himself. At least with Blind, he could rely on him doing the passing brunt work and know his positioning gives him time to come across. 

Jones 'the more talented' than Smalling, NEVER ever got that.

388~~~
Bumbling idiot. Another shocking example of low standards currently at this club. Wouldn't start for at least 17 of the 20 PL sides.

389~~~
Really disappointed with him recently. He's better than this.

390~~~
I don't get it. He's always a lot better when he's the covering defender and let's Smalling be the aggressor and make all the decisions, but they've completely abandoned that for the last 2 games.

391~~~
Old news but it is safe to say SAF got that one horribly wrong,Jones has been a big let down.

392~~~
Joke of a player who would be nowhere near the England squad but for the name of the club he plays for.

393~~~
Hes a walking brain-fart. He has potential but really needs to work on his focus and being more disciplined.

394~~~
He's too reckless! What is with the brainless runs into midfield to try and win the ball? If he fails to win it (which he often does) then we are just so exposed. He needs to cut that out. He still has time but if he can't turn it around then he could be gone.

395~~~
This guy is stealing a living. He's just got worse and worse as his career has gone on. No brain either.

396~~~
Ive been trying to explain this to my brother for years, but everytime we play fifa he constantly does a Phil Jones with a CB.

397~~~
He was fine against Stoke. People badmouthing him seem to be brainless.

398~~~
I've never ever seen the talent in this guy and I've wanted him out from the start. He has pretty much been getting progressively worse and this doesn't even take into account the ridiculous number of injuries that he has been having over the last few years

399~~~
I'm not sure, I can understand he was ok vs Stoke but overall he has a footballing IQ of dusty bin.

400~~~
If you swapped him with Shawcross, Stoke fans would feel they're being downgraded.

401~~~
He as potential when we signed him. How many years has been a United player? You'd think he'd have learned those skills by now.

402~~~
Yep. It really does not look at this stage as though any potential is going to be realised

Maybe he'll come good elsewhere but we have seen enough of him at United

403~~~
He needs a partner. I suggest Oliver Hardy.

404~~~
Injured again? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

405~~~
What's even the point of this player?

406~~~
No point to him even when he is fit. The fact he can't stay fit just makes it laughable he's still on the payroll.

407~~~
Useless sack of shit.

408~~~
He's in the wrong kind of sport.

409~~~
Incredible

410~~~
I tell you what, we need to put him out to pasture and replace him with Stones.

411~~~
I still have high hopes for him but hopes are all I'm hanging onto but the reality is getting clearer and clearer. His potential has dropped IMO.

412~~~
Needs to be sold, sure we can get a decent fee out of him.

413~~~
Poor sod. But he was a bit cack anyway. Not sure he'll really make it here.

414~~~
Injured again, probably a blessing in disguise. Not convinced that he can form a formidable partnership with smalling.

415~~~
Will be shot just like Rafael this summer.

416~~~
So is Shaw.

417~~~
Yeah comparing a leg break to the amount of injuries Jones has had in the last 5 years. Well done.

418~~~
What was his injury? I honestly didnt see him hobble off, at first I thought it was tactical but then Darmian stayed centre and the commentator said he came off due to an injury.

419~~~
No one is surprised. It's the main reason we should of got that CB in the summer, as so many said through the entire summer.

420~~~
He just can't get a run of games can he

421~~~
Poor Phil.  Perhaps he needs a change of scenery.  Or physios.

Just not working out here for him.  Maybe should have kept Evans instead.

422~~~
Calling someone a useless sack of shit because he gets injured for the United cause. Well done.

423~~~
His body isn't designed for football or sport. 
It's unfortunate for him and not really his fault.
He needs to either change career or move to a league which is less physical.

424~~~
To be honest I had forgotten he had been on until I saw the thread bumped, he didn't really stand out for better or worse in the first half, the fact he's injured again is no big surprise.

425~~~
He can't even complete a single game.

426~~~
Hopefully it was precautionary. You would have thought they'd be more inclined to wrap him in cotton wool given his injury record.

427~~~
Plenty of other players in world football manage to "do things for the cause" without injuring themselves twice a week.

428~~~
That doesn't make them 'useless sacks of shit'.

429~~~
Yeah agreed, since he just came back from one. But I still dont know what he went off for, shoulder? knee? Hammy? Thigh? Face stuck in a weird position? Not much was said about it at the time.

430~~~
"Useless squad member" is probably more acurate.

431~~~
Except he's actually quite good.

432~~~
Was he definitely injured or was it tactical? I thought he just wanted Blind to play CB but then he stayed on the left, was quite odd.

433~~~
He might be useful to get a few million off the Stones price in the summer. Apart from that, he really has failed miserable <i>so far</i> to improve himself since joining the club.

434~~~
Except.... he's really very average and is available about once ever 3 games. For 60 minutes.

435~~~
No word of a lie I would rip his contract up in front of his face tonight. Absolute waste of time, always injured and when he does play he is crap. We pay him around 60k a week for this luxury to.

436~~~
Missed the game. What injury has he got now? He has to be sold in the summer, there's no point keeping him here.

SAF's comments about him potentially being our greatest player ever just get more laughable each game Jones plays

437~~~
What an utterly stupid post.

438~~~
I thought it was tactical. Darmian and Jones both need games and we have no reserve matches coming up so they were both given 45. Seemed a sensible enough plan before all the injury talk at least.

439~~~
So is yours.

440~~~
If someone offers decent money, I would sell.

441~~~
In 3 games a season.

442~~~
Squad player nothing more. Blind is the same.

443~~~
Maybe we should loan him out. He's young enough to get over the injuries and his contract runs long enough.

444~~~
Shame we can't sell some of our "fans" who slate a guy for getting injured!

It's frustrating, but don't you think it is for him too?!

445~~~
Doubt an England international would be very chuffed with being loaned out.

446~~~
I'm usually one who defends him, but if he can't stay fit, he shouldn't be surprised if we are looking for different solutions.

447~~~
I agree we need to get someone else. I think unfortunately Phil should be sold. He is not even an option on the bench as he is capable of getting injured running from there to the touchline.

448~~~
Good at getting injured? Yes. Good as a first team player for Manchester United? No. Squad player at the very best, hate seeing him on the field if I'm honest.

449~~~
You hate him seeing even when he's not injured? Ridiculous.

450~~~
wouldn't trust him with sharp scissors

451~~~
I haven't been this annoyed with some of our players being constantly injured since Saha.
Jones is unreliable at this stage and hopefully we get a replacement.

452~~~
Yes, because I don't think he's good enough to play for us. Go watch Norwich first goal a few weeks back, look at his half assed challenge, how easily he's beaten. Then, watch the second goal, and look at how easily he's beaten there too. He's regularly caught out of position. His passing isn't good enough, and to top it all off, he's injury prone. So yes, I generally hate seeing him on the pitch as it means we have injuries. He should not be first choice.

453~~~
Not a good CB, DM or RB. Always Injured.

454~~~
He had a bad game that day, true. But he's generally one of the best one-on-one defenders in the country and that's not the kind of mistake you'd usually associate with him. The fact you think he's regularly caught out of position speaks volumes about the bias you must watch him with. 

He's been a first choice pick under Allardyce, Fergie, Capello and now LvG. When he's fit he ALWAYS plays, because he's a top defender.

455~~~

456~~~
True enough, none of those managers ever make mistakes. I don't think I'm remotely biased to be honest, he's regularly caught out of position, causing him to make those last ditch lunging challenges that have spawned a thousand memes, due to the looks on his face as he dives in. 

We'll just have to agree to differ. He's not even close to Smalling, let alone to the level of the likes of Rio, Vida, Pally, Bruce etc. We should be striving for far better than Phil Jones.

457~~~
“Phil Jones is injured, and it's more or less the same injury as before," van Gaal said.

458~~~
But it's highly unlikely they'd all make the same mistake, over and over, in every single game.

The memes are the reason people underrate him, imo. He has a reputation for being stupid that's totally undeserved. It's like something out of a high school popularity contest.

Blind gets caught out of position far more, but is seen as footballing genius for some reason.
So the management team brought him back to quickly. Let's all hang Jones for their mistake.

459~~~
<i>Phil Jones has signed a spokesmanship deal with NHS, seeing that he's always there.

- </i>BBC

460~~~
Blind isn't good enough either. I don't know who thinks he's a footballing genius. He shouldn't be more than a squad player either.

461~~~
People laud Blind's 'footballing intelligence' but rarely mention the fact that Jones makes far fewer mistakes overall. He's anything but a stupid player.

462~~~
While I agree that Blind makes a lot of mistakes ... I definitely don't think Jones makes a lot less. Similar number of mistakes in my opinion, Jones physicality gets him out of a lot whereas Blind has to resort to tugging people back etc when he's beaten easily.

You're literally the only one defending him. He's been poor for a long while. 

Even when Smalling was getting injured or played out of position, there was a lot of posters on here that could recognise his qualities. The same can't be said of Jones.

464~~~
Always like this - Phil Jones:A  professional hospital patient whose career has been blighted by appearances for Manchester United.

465~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

466~~~
Look at the posts over the last couple of pages. He's got pilloried for having a error-free game against Stoke and an injury due to being brought back too quickly against Swansea. That's the level of prejudice I'm trying to redress.

467~~~
If he ever gets over his injury problems he'll be a fantastic defender. Big if though.

468~~~
Thank you. I can handle people being annoyed by his injury record but I don't get this idea that he's a crap defender. It's simply not the case. His performance level has generally been good. No idea why people can't see this

469~~~
That's literally not true. Jones is a hugely talented young defender. Every manager that's worked with him has recognised that. The only thing stopping him is the injuries.

470~~~
He will

Up to the medical team to find a solution for him. Which I am sure they are trying To do.

Only 23 and would be gutted if Utd gave up on him.

471~~~
He's on a very similar path to Chris Smalling. I still remember this criticism he was getting after the sending off against City, last season. I thought both were pretty average, and with the injuries, I didn't have much faith in either. However, Mike has been brilliant this year and the key has been... playing, consistently, as a centre back. We should allow Jones the same belief, patience and time.

472~~~
Go to his thread. It's page upon page of waffle about him being the cleverest player in the history of the world and a better passer that Pirlo. It's fecking weird. I genuinely can't fault the lad. He hasn't really let us down but you can see a mile away that he's a limited player scraping by by the skin of his teeth

473~~~
What is it now, his 5th season here? And we're still pretty much saying the same things!
Still hope for a Smalling esque emergence

474~~~
Absolutely. He's a good player. Just needs a bit of luck with injuries.

It would be madness. Too much talent to give up on, especially at only 23 years of age

475~~~
Nope, he won't. He will become an average premier league defender at best.

476~~~
Solution for what? Ankle Injury? Thigh? Calf? Knee? Shin? Concussion? 

The only cure is a brain transplant.

477~~~
Isn't anywhere close to Smalling talent wise.

478~~~
This is dumb. How many average PL defenders have 20 England caps by the age of 23. He just needs to get over the injuries.

479~~~
No one deserves that pic though.

480~~~
Can someone change it actually? Why make fun of our own?

481~~~
Must be hundreds of Phil Jones photos floating around and surely on of them decent.

482~~~
Ok. Google imaged it. The man is actually pretty fcked up looking but yes there are pictures where he isn't gurning at least. So yes, I'd prefer we used one of them. I fully believe he will earn it in time. Good player

483~~~
Given that Smalling was very alike a sicknote to Jones and he managed to fix his problems with injuries you have to ask questions whether Jones trully is doing everything in his power to stay fit. No matter what the answer is, we should probably sell him as he's simply too unreliable.

484~~~
It would be good to see him succeed at United but it's just not going to happen. If anyone was willing to give something near 10m, would be stupid not to take it in my opinion (if we have a CB coming in).

485~~~
Not going to happen. How the fck do you know??? To sell him for 10 million would be extremely stupid

486~~~
Jones and Jack Wilshere need to form an athlete insurance agency once they are done pretending to be footballers.

487~~~
It's my opinion that he won't go on and become a good long term option at CB. I think Smalling is superior and we will always be looking to bring in better players, so I think Jones will struggle to progress at United, so if it became an option to sell, I think it would be best for both parties like Jonny Evans.

If he was to be sold, how much would you expect?

488~~~
His value right now depends on his fitness. 25m if fit. 10 if a permacrock. You've clearly decided he won't be fit anymore. Which is something you can't possibly predict

489~~~
One of my favourite players. So pissed he's constantly injured. Despite all the negativity, I still believe he can be a top centre back for us, providing he can stay fit, but it seems to be a big ask at the moment. Hope the club will continue to be patient with him. He's still only 23.

490~~~
I can't predict that, I'm making a calculated guess. I can predict though that he won't be sold for 25m. It's not football manager, name one club that would pay that for Phil Jones?

491~~~
No-one would spend anywhere near that 25m on Jones. 

We'd be lucky to get 10. He's too injury prone. He also needs to keep his head up when he has the ball at his feet.

492~~~
Regardless of his injuries, when is he going to stop being so reckless? Hes still running out of defence like a lunatic. He's been doing it since he was 18, when the feck is he going to stop? Get rid in the summer or throw him in for Stones if Everton are thick enough.

493~~~
How did he even get injured?! He hardly had to do anything!

494~~~
Fitness isn't his only issue but I imagine we'll persevere for now, just hopefully not at the expense of bringing in Stones.

495~~~
An injury free Jones will be a solid English CB, there's not many good ones around but at this moment in time we need someone more reliable. If we could get Stones in swap deal + cash we should do it. That way if Jones does get over his injuries he could still be worth a fair bit to Everton.

496~~~
He needs to be or 4th choice centre back, as he simply can't be relied on. He has one more season at most IMO to establish himself.

497~~~
If he was at a mid table team he wouldn't have 20 caps. Ask Ryan Shawcross about that. Manchester United do wonders for your profile where England are concerned.

498~~~
Who the feck would pay 25mil for Jones?

499~~~
Why? They have a bigger prospect who rarely gets injured. Why would perma-crocked Jones be worth a lot to them? He'd expect big wages as well.

500~~~
Death, taxes and Phil Jones being injured.

501~~~
Shawcross started at United but didn't make the grade

502~~~
Another one that got away too young. Maybe if we had persisted with him, we wouldn't have had to buy Phil Jones.

503~~~
My point is if he was regularly fit he could be that good. Right now he's had a horrible time with injuries so his current market value is lower. It's not a true reflection of the players talent

504~~~
Jones is comfortably better than Shawcross. If Shawcross was that good a bigger club would have signed him at this stage

505~~~
At what exactly? Think they're both great athletes and that's where it ends really, he's hardly comfortably better especially given that Jones is always injured then it takes weeks for him to recover, get back into match rhythm just to get injured two weeks later.

506~~~
Better at football. Shawcross is better at not being injured.

507~~~
It isn't dumb. I highly doubt he will ever become more than a bog standard premier league defender. He cannot stay fit and isn't intelligent enough to be a top player.

England caps mean nothing anymore, have you seen the state of the squad.

508~~~
Isn't being injury free a part of being good or bad at football though? As I've said, every time a player is out he needs time to get back to his best and prior to the peak of his form he's usually underperforming, just like Jones has shown in last matches. Staying fit gives you stability in form thus your performances are around the same level, even if it's average for Shawcross it's still better than Jones' level which is consistently hampered by injuries-caused setbacks.

509~~~
I agree it's a problem. At 23 years old I think there's reason to be patient. Buy another CB to poartner Smalling. Keep Jones and let him fight for a spot once he gets his fitness sorted. Simple

510~~~
Yes Jones is made of glass, but I don't agree with the calls to sell him. He can be a solid squad player for us, or even more. He has time on his hands to iron out his injury problems/ brain farts.

In the meantime we need to buy a more dependable CB in his prime.

511~~~
10 mil for a highly-rated young English CB? We will be ripped off if that is the case. No way should we let go of him at this point. We need all the CBs we can get. He is still only 21-22. Very young for a CB and although he is rash, he still has some very good physical attributes which will stand him in good stead in any PL team.

512~~~
....at absolutely nothing.

513~~~
I don't know about "Talent" wise, but Smalling certainly has more natural resources, with his pace and height. He always had all the raw materials to be quality, but took his sweet time to show it

514~~~
We'll give him 2 more years, then sell him for £2.3m to Everton or Sunderland knowing us

515~~~
If we have no other CBs coming in. Keep him 100%, I truly would love to see him make it at United but if Smalling keeps his spot nailed down, we will continue to look at who we can bring in and if Jones' career continues in this way, I think it would be best for both to move on. I understand that he is still very young and yes he should be afforded time but I just can't see it happening for him anymore.

516~~~
If someone offers a half eaten Pot Noodle for him, we should take it.

Fecking waste of space is all he is.

517~~~
Play a couple of games, come off injured, out 5-6games, come back, play a couple of games, come off injured, out 5-6 games.

Must do his head in as much as anyone elses.

He's lucky he's "made it" on 60k a week, and that he's not in League 2 relying on being able to play to pay bills.

518~~~
I feel bad for him but I wouldn't mind seeing him move on. I seem to remember him looking fantastic in his first few games, but he's been injured on and off constantly and used as a utility player for two years by Fergie. His development has been massively stunted.

519~~~
Athletes? They're good at playing football. I can't imagine they'd be any good at most athletic events

520~~~
I don't think he's ever getting over these injuries unfortunately, he has probably regressed as a player since he joined. If Van Gaal stays i reckon Jones will be sold in the summer.

I wouldn't be fussed with him staying another year or two personally but he should definitely be replaced in the squad as he's just not reliable enough. He must be our most frequently injured player since Saha.

521~~~
He needs to leave. I'm fed up hearing of how he will be one of our future CB's, been saying that for 3-4 years now. What's his longest run of games staying fit apart from his first season. He's a walking injury and even when fit, he's not all that. He's rash and prone to silly mistakes.

522~~~
If Rafael had to go because he couldn't stay fit then Jones needs to go too. 

Remember when he was touted as the new Duncan Edwards and a future England captain?

523~~~
Many years ago a man connected to United told me this :-
"Natural balance is the key to remaining fit to play, Look at George, (Best) when he went to ground he landed softly, landing on his load bearing bones in a relaxed state of mind. When you see Bryan (Robson) he is tense and lands like a sack of potatoes."
Moving down the years you can say the same for Giggs and Wes Brown, and now Martial and Jones. It's basically the same as falling when drunk, you rarely injure yourself because you are relaxed. A tensed state of mind also tightens the muscles causing strains and tears.
Watch Martial walk, and you see a natural athlete, with a cat like poise. Jones looks like a flat footed farm labourer lumbering towards the milking shed.

524~~~
Caf is a scary place. Some posters genuinely read like they're his family or something. Psychos. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Let's be objective:
<ul>
<li>He can't stay fit - problem.</li>
<li>Even when he's fit, he's prone to blunders (I would rather we didn't have a comedy act protecting our goalkeeper) - problem.</li>
<li>Even when he's fit, his positioning is suspect at best - problem.</li>
<li>Even when he's fit, his tackling is WILD and DANGEROUS to both himself and others - problem.</li>
</ul>Sorry but I just don't get <span style="text-decoration: underline">the need to persist with him</span>. I don't see a top centre-back in him and I never have. He also doesn't look like an athlete (a bit like Rooney) and doesn't have the ability on the ball to make up for it.

The fact that members of this forum also have the cheek to harshly criticise the likes of Blind and McNair at times makes this 'hope' for Jones all the more inconsistent with reality. If you're going to have a go at Blind for not being good enough...then Jones <i>must</i> be shite? Because Blind doesn't balls up anywhere near the amount Jones does.

525~~~
Glad to see there's a growing consensus that he needs to go

526~~~
Glue factory.

527~~~
Any update on how long he's expected to be out?

528~~~
Sell Jones, buy Stones

529~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

530~~~
It's the same ankle injury as before. I have had dodgy ankles (torn ligaments >8 times), and they can be a career ending injury. Just ask Wiltshire. 
Ankle injuries also make you less prone to jump in and stretch that extra inch. 
That said, no, I don't know how serious it is.

531~~~
Have to get rid, he's always injured.

532~~~
The next Woodgate/King

533~~~
Compared to this most posts on here seem balanced and considered. But yeah, they're all psycho's and the caf is a scary place <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

534~~~
Van Gaal said it's the same injury again, so I am guessing 2 or 3 weeks. But at this point it doesn't even matter anymore, because he hardly improves us when he plays, and he'll get injured after game and a half again.

535~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> baaahahaha

simply not good enough, not even close.
decent mid-table player

536~~~
He'd probably injure himself by breathing. Such a shame, has/had great potential, but needs to get that consistent period of games to develop.

537~~~
So much potential wasted by all these injuries. Think his time at United is up, we just can't count on him.

538~~~
Is it the same injury or different ones? We have not been told too much about it. Or maybe he is just injured so much that it's boring listing all of his injuries at once

539~~~
He looked very much the part when he first joined. Many surprising runs with the ball over a long distance. Had pace, strength and belief about him. Now he can't get a run in the side going, is always injured and frankly sometimes he looks like a bull in a china shop. Rushing out of defence to make challenges that are unnecessary and dangerous to both him and other players, and leaving a lot of space behind him. 
I don't know if we should give up quite yet, he's still only 23, but we shouldn't count on him. I still like the Blind Smalling partnership but we're very light in defence and need another centerback.

540~~~
<b><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> </b>So true, the man is such an archetypical example of a brainless unsophisticated hoofballer, he is a neanderthaeler.

Oh and Rooney is waiting for him in his bib and brace overall in that shed, been shoveling cow dung and squeezing those milky teets for the past few years.

541~~~
Sure LvG said it was the same injury.

542~~~
Funny, but not a very apt comparison imo.

Both Woodgate and King were much better in their prime and King actually manged to get games. He didnt train with squad though.

543~~~
It's been so long since he's had a good consistent run in the team, I've almost forgotten how talented he looked when he initially broke through. And yes he did look a fantastic prospect even if it's fashionable these days to assume that he's a lumbering English buffoon who was always shite and good for nothing. And those abusing him for repeatedly getting injured...<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

He's still only 23 and a player who's started almost every game when fit under three different managers at the club. Hopefully, he can regain full fitness and have a good long run in the team and show his talent.

544~~~
Agreed, Woodgate and King were class

545~~~
Nothing will beat Woodgates debut for Madrid though. What was that? A red, a peno and an injury? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

546~~~
Henry has stated that King was the best defender he's played against. It is a shame that he was perennially injured and had no cartilage in his knee(s?) as he would have been something else.

'He will take the ball off you without you even noticing.'

I don't think Jones has ever had that kind of potential.

547~~~
I think we'd all take Jones being the next King. Didn't he use to train like once a week during his latter days then play on a Saturday? I recall him barely training yet still putting in great performances.

548~~~
King's reputation increased the less he played. By the time he retired, some people were calling him the most talented English CB only to be let down by injuries. Nothing like a good tragic story I suppose.

549~~~
A brainless defender wouldn't have the second most interceptions per game last season, would he? Sure, he looks like an idiot, he's about as graceless as they come and frequently puts himself -- and others -- in harms way. But the characterisation of him as a brainless buffoon who is only at United because of his physical qualities is incredibly lazy and biased. He can read the game well and he is a decent passer (when he is not rusty, which is often cos he is always fecking injured), on top of being an excellent, uncouth, athlete.
For what it's worth, I'm getting fed up with him too after having defended him on here a lot. But I think we should give him one more season to sort his injuries out. This doesn't mean I don't think we should invest in Stones though. Jones, obviously, can't be relied on at the moment.

550~~~
He is an headless chicken definitely

551~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> can we get a vid of Phil going mental? Was hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

552~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Someone get a gif of him jumping about in the away end after Rooney's goal.

553~~~
I love this guy! Please get fit and fulfil your potential Phil.

554~~~
We can keep him as cheerleader.

555~~~
Think he did really well today. Had a great partnership with the guy beside him for the first time this season and was very vocal.

All good signs.

556~~~
At least he didn't injured himself jumping up and down like that

557~~~
Rojo as well! They'd make one mental center defense pairing

558~~~
Was great from both!
*******s
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

559~~~

560~~~
Even though our players in the stands reeks of a Woodwardian-PR stunt, I couldn't help but smile seeing Jones jumping up and down like that (and yes, worry for a moment that he might injure himself.)

561~~~
Our players generally go in the stand for the atmosphere. Rio and O'Shea were suspended at Anfield a few years back and sat in stands. Darren Fletcher and Ashley Young did for Newcastle a few years back. Unless you have your family with you, players tend to prefer getting in the chaos of the match day fans, because that's what they grew up with. Nobody is telling them to do it.

562~~~
ffs he was jumping up and down <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

563~~~
Probably got injured in the celebrations..

564~~~
MOM for me today

565~~~

566~~~
Player of the season for that surely.

567~~~
Nah he looks fine.

Probably did a number on those around him though.

568~~~
I know its him, but if somebody said that was a photoshop gif i'd believe that aswell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

569~~~
What a charmer.

570~~~
Someone change the title name to 'Performances in the stands'.

571~~~
I'm not convinced, but don't really care either way. Can't wait until all three are back on the pitch.

572~~~
He was in the red zone today.

573~~~
His best performance of the season!

574~~~
best moment of the game, also thumbs up to Rojo and Carras as well!

575~~~
There is a lad behind/to the right of him with long ish hair that seems to get swallowed into an abyss in the middle of all of that.

576~~~
Is that Carrick to the left of him?

577~~~
Not sure if serious?

578~~~
Serious.

579~~~
PR stunt? To what end?

Hey guys, get in there and jump up and down and then people will love me.

Nah. I doubt woodie gives a feck what we think, and this certainly doesn't reflect on him.

580~~~
Players always go in the away end. I remember Young being there away to Newcastle and I'm sure Carrick's done it before too.

581~~~
Is he fine? I fear injuries. I mean all that mad jumping up and down

582~~~
So Phil Jones 4 is a brand now? Who knew...

583~~~
i will never tire seeing this, its mint

584~~~
Atleast we get some use out of him in the stands.

585~~~
I do agree... 3 players, separately get tickets to an away game rather than sit with the club entourage?

586~~~
Jonesy 1 Gerrard nil.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-iufVB5cB8c?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Repeat ad infinitum.

587~~~
Seriously?

588~~~
Yes. 

I've seen Young and Fletch in the crowd together at Old Trafford watching us play and I've seen others but it's rare. 

Then you have 3 players going to one away game separately with their own friends? Don't they usually just go with the squad? What was different yesterday that made 3 players decide to go sit in with the fans?

589~~~
Maybe they just they just wanted to experience the biggest fixture in English football like a fan?

It's a fairly rare opportunity if you think about it, Jones & Carrick have featured in all of our games at Anfield since they've been here I believe (bench or starting line up). Rojo was on the bench last season. I'm pretty sure it's the first time any of them have got a chance, due to being injured for the game.

590~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

591~~~
Even if the club asked them to go, it's great.

592~~~
Surprised some bastard hasn't said he's found his best position <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

593~~~
Set to feature for the U21s tonight against Norwich.

594~~~
I hope this doesn't mean van Gaal will give him his obligatory sub appearance on the weekend and further disrupt the defence.

595~~~
I hope we replace him in the summer. Waste of space.

596~~~
Would keep him in the squad in hope he'd do a 'Smalling.' Still 23 afterall..

But we do need a stable upgrade of a center back partner for Smalling whilst we conduct this <i>experiment</i>, I like Blind but there'll always be one or two defensive lapses per game as a CB. I don't see him as our long term CB solution.

597~~~
Sadly I agree. I'd rather keep Rojo, who is also injury prone but seems to possess the better skill-set to become a great defender one day (He probably won't though).

598~~~
I don't mind sticking with some injury hit players because they can overcome their problems. Giggs' for example, they spotted that his hamstring issues could be linked to the clutch in his Ferrari and he made the decision to sell it or at least not use it which apparently helped a lot.

Jones on the other hand:
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/dXGVRDA.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/dXGVRDA.png"/> 
That's 76 games missed in 5 years. He's missed about 25% of the available games. 

That 25% doesn't count the time he spends making bench appearances while he gets up to fitness. 


That's 10 different injuries of varying types. The only way to stop him getting these injuries is a lobotomy.

599~~~
I'm thinking, if we get Mourinho, Jones could very well be a player to his liking and he could help him ironing out some foolishness.

If he could just stay fit, Jones that is.

Smalling, Jones and Shaw has the potential to be frightenly good. Darmian is also showing some nice stuff lately.

600~~~
The issue isn't his defending. It's the fact he can't keep fit. Hes actually a very good defender when he's on the pitch.

601~~~
It's annoying. How must the scousers feel with Sturridge who is borderline world class when fit, which is never.

602~~~

603~~~
Surprise Surprise..

604~~~
I have CBJ on my fantasy team so this is brilliant news for me.

605~~~
Sell him.

606~~~
It's not his fault he's injured but it does seem like his time at the club is coming to an end. It's a shame because he could have been a real long-term solution for us.

607~~~
Think he needs to go this summer

608~~~
He needs to get in on that hat business with Daniel Sturridge.

609~~~
Wants taking out the back, Sorry but with TFM, Roshaun Williams and Tuanzebe behind him he shouldn't have a sniff here long term, try and get rid to someone like Everton in the summer.

610~~~
What the actual feck? Did he get injured again while playing for the U21 yesterday?

611~~~
Stones for 60m, or Jones plus 100m (have to factor in compensation for Jones injuring 50% of their players on the training ground).

612~~~
Should've been shipped out long ago.

613~~~
Guy has been stealing a living for too long. Get rid.

614~~~
It's time to get rid. Not his fault he's getting injured, but even when he fit, he's never really struck me as top class.

615~~~
Didn't play yesterday, only played 60 mins against Norwich too. Bizarre!

616~~~
We should have offered him "pay as you play" contract. Not that I care about money though, but I seriously don't see the point of him this season. He injured himself even though he wasn't fit anyway, and what's frustrating is that everyone expected something like that.

617~~~
Thing is, he'd probably stay fit for a midtable club... less rigorous demands in training combined with less pressure in general will probably be a better enviornment for his body.

Expect Stoke to stump up a decent fee for him in the summer.

618~~~
He's not even that good when healthy so it would be best to sell him in the summer.

620~~~
Feel sorry for him.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

621~~~
Flog him to China

622~~~
So do I, but he is not much use to us if he is always injured.

623~~~
He's made of china.

624~~~
He actually is very good, or very talented for that matter, and this might be what saves him.

Though it's hard to imagine him ever getting fit for a good period of time and his reckless style might be a big factor in his injuries, who knows what will happen.

Smalling was injured quite a lot until he was 23 years of age, he has now finally managed to be fit for 25 out of 38 league games three seasons in row. That's only 65% of our league matches though, hardly an impressive number.

Talented as they might be, TFM, Williams and Tuanzebe are babies, normally it would take them at least two more years before you can expect them to play a good part in a team that challenges for the Premier League.

625~~~
For a long time I thought he was a better bet than Smalling, seems I was very wrong.

Still not sure we'll sell him though.

626~~~
With the tale tend youngsters we have coming up and another CB I think we will buy, there's no place for him here. Needs to go.

627~~~
Exactly this, I fail to see why we should keep him. He's been very average for two years now, with the odd good game as an exception. 

Is he though? He did well in his first season for us, ever since then he has been bang average.

628~~~
This is the thing.

If we were talking about a Maldini level player then the injuries would be worth putting up with. But Jones is rather rubbish anyway. I don't see the point in him staying

629~~~
Bang avarage my ass. Just last year he was going from perma-crock to looking truly excellent next to Smalling in crucial games (like in the only half decent spell we've had under Van Gaal near the end of last season), after which he has gone back into perma-crock mode. For me that's not average, it's a talented player struggling with injuries.

630~~~
Smalling vs. Jones making the match-day squad (league only):

Smalling
10/11 - 11 starts, 5 subbed in, 17 remained on the bench (33/38)
11/12 - 14 starts, 5 subbed in, 3 remained on the bench (22/38)
12/13 - 10 starts, 5 subbed in, 4 remained on the bench (19/38)
13/14 - 21 starts, 4 subbed in, 5 remained on the bench (30/38)
14/15 - 21 starts, 4 subbed in, 5 remained on the bench (30/38)
15/16 - 24 starts, 0 subbed in, 0 remained on the bench (24/25)

158/215 - 73.48%

Jones
11/12 - 25 starts, 4 subbed in, 2 remained on the bench (31/38)
12/13 - 13 starts, 4 subbed in, 2 remained on the bench (19/38)
13/14 - 26 starts, 0 subbed in, 0 remained on the bench (26/38)
14/15 - 22 starts, 0 subbed in, 2 remained on the bench (24/38)
15/16 - 6 starts, 4 subbed in, 1 remained on the bench (11/25)

111/177 - 62.71%

631~~~
Let's be honest, none of us actually factored him playing for us for the rest of the season anyway.

<i>"When is Jones due back?"</i> Said no one ever.

632~~~
He's giving Saha a run for his money. Though run is probably a poor choice to describe it.

633~~~
I trust the Club to make the decision wether to keep him or not.
Smalling has not been injury free before this season either and look how important he is to us now.

634~~~
If we get a top centre back in during the summer then he should be let go. What we shouldn't do is sell him because of his injuries irrespective of transfers and screw ourselves over with a thin squad.

This generation of English players seem to be constantly injured.

635~~~
Sorry to say but I'm afraid a lot of people disagree with that statement. He never looked truly excellent at any stage over the last two years. The whole team was playing better at that time and we placed ourselves into a better position throughout the game by scoring early and keeping the ball for the rest of the game. I certainly seem to recall Jones was often caught making silly mistakes, forcing other players to cover him (Which was usually Smalling). Blind has looked more impressive and suits Smalling a lot better than Jones and he is not even a natural CB, this speaks terms really. Even if Jones would be fit, I would expect Blind to keep his place next to Smalling since CBJ is playing excellent, which gives O reason for Blind to move to that LB spot as long as CBJ is fit/playing well.

If he somehow manages to stay fit, hopefully he will prove me wrong. His constant injuries are very worrying  though and his average form when he does decide to stay fit for more than two games, does not strike me with confidence this lad will make it here. The problem we've had at United for a longtime is the reluctance of moving players on when it is so bloody obvious they are either past it or simply not up to "United standard". I believe this to be one of the main mistakes SAF made in his last few years of his career which has only made it more difficult for the last two managers to try and sort this mess. I am not going to praise LVG for many things but he has moved on players who did not seem to be up to standard very quickly here since his arrival. So far, it seems he got most of them right with the exception of Hernandez. Most players who have left united have been bang average at their new clubs, which only goes on to show many of these were rightfully let go.

636~~~
Problem here is that while the club has him on the books, we are not all that keen on really making a push for another very good CB. Really wish for him and us he'd find a solution to this constant being on the sidelines or at least then just say, the club deserves better after sticking with me for so long that he asks to move on his own.

637~~~
I was convinced when we signed him that he is going to be one of the best in the world, but he's been here for almost 5 years now and he hasn't really improved much.

638~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

639~~~
Very much in the camp of 'he's not a good defender even when fit'. The fact he can't get fit or stay fit just makes the idea of him staying around even more ridiculous to me.

640~~~
This.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

I feel bad for him having a stop/start career, but unfortunately we need people in the team we can depend on. Can't be injured for more than three quarters of a season earning ridiculous money.

641~~~
He's not particularly good anyway.

642~~~
Phil Jones will be back stronger and better than ever.

His bad luck with injuries can't last for ever.

People forget that with him starting games, its when we have had our best results in the last seasons. No Philip, no fun.

643~~~
When you get injured as often as him it's not bad luck anymore.

He is still a good rotation/backup player, but you cannot be as injury prone as him if you are to have that role.

644~~~
We need to be more ruthless with moving players on. He's a prime candidate.

However, that should be supplemented by actually getting proper replacements in.

645~~~
I hold out hope he'll improve with injuries like Smalling did. Time is fast running out for him though.

646~~~
Always defended him, but it's getting to a point similar to Rafael. I think he's talented and will probably be better later, but we don't have the luxury to wait on him any longer.

647~~~
Need to put him down, sadly.

648~~~
Keep him, he will come good eventually. Surely the yoga classes will have a positive impact in the future.

649~~~
I hope so too. Smalling's injury issue is a little bizarre though Smalling's injuries just seemed to disappear miraculously this season. Even as recent as last season he was in and out. This season he's missed only one game in all competitions.

Maybe Jones will one day just stop getting injured. It can't be ruled out, as I never imagined Smalling to be as sturdy and reliable as he has been this season, but with Jones it does seem a bit less likely.

650~~~
As I posted a couple pages ago, it's not anything reoccurring. He's just a fecking meat head that is unfortunate enough to also be also made of glass. Absolutely zero sense of self preservation. 

It might look heroic to jump in head first into a tackle or stretch out and pile into a striker but when it means he's out for 3 weeks and we're counting on a kid instead it's just not commendable.

651~~~
Smalling has never been the type of a defender Jones is though, reckless, rash in tackle, he'll always injure himself at some point or due to his rashness his joints, whatever will be under constant threat, red zone if you will.

652~~~
Smalling's propensity to injury was never as severe as say Jones or Rafael. I just think he was a bit unlucky over the years.

653~~~
He's completely pointless. We've been lucky that Smalling and Blind have stayed fit for most of the season.

654~~~
Smalling and Jones are both big, athletic lads and that can sometimes mean injury spells as you grow into your body, I remember that being said about Welbeck (Yes I know he's been out al season). The problem with Jones is that it's beyond the point of growing up, he's naturally rash and lacks any common sense, often making errors that he tries to correct with lunges and stretches the bring about moire injuries.

Have they said what this new injury is? I seem too recall a post in the match thread on Monday saying he'd had a collision with another player and looked dazed, maybe it's a precaution rather than another spell out.

655~~~
You can't have any role if you're injured all the time. Without the injuries he'd have had a chance of improving and becoming a first choice player.

656~~~
Going China next summer?

657~~~
Laporte in.... Jones out.

658~~~
He's nowhere near talented as Rafael was

659~~~
I didn't compare their talent. Just said that Jones is talented. And Rafael has done feck all with his talent for years.

660~~~
He should stay just for that incident where he slipped over and ran on his knees towards the ball and headed the ball away from Giroud

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d78wwGee5IA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

661~~~
Simple as this.

662~~~
24 already…

Reports are circulating Preston town about Phil's super Sunday celebrations at Mrs Jones’ house in Preston yesterday and information suggests that when Phillip was carrying the cake he slipped on a Banana skin, skidded across the kitchen, knocked over the buffet table and ended up with his head squarely in the cake. All 24 candles remained lit on top of his dopey bonce, however he has managed to break both his legs, his mother’s Royal Doulton collection and Mr Jones’ ‘World’s Best Dad’ Whisky glass. The Pugs have also had to be fully body casted after they each bore the brunt of big Phil’s clown shoes as he hit the quarry tiled floor.

The cake was salvaged but had to be eaten by spoon from a communal bowl. One onlooker described the Jones family’s cake gorging as <i>‘‘The best impression of the Hungry Hippos this side of the River Ribble’’</i> while another commented <i>‘‘Not even Phil’s inverted knee could stop him from munching his fair share of Victoria Sponge… there was Marzipan flying everywhere’’. </i>Further reports suggest the frolics culminated in Phil dropping the bowl on his foot and breaking his third metatarsal just as the Ambulance arrived on scene.

Anyway….Happy Birthday for yesterday Phil! Get well soon x365

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

664~~~
how the actual heck did he pick this latest injury up whatever it is?

he was only just getting back in!

665~~~
Under 21s game where he was supposed to gain match fitness.

666~~~
We definitely will bring a centre back in if a new manager comes in.
It's long past the time we can even pretend to see Jones as a mainstay

667~~~
Regardless of Jones, we need to bring someone in. If the new manager decides, Jones isn't in his plans or can't be relied upon, then I'd prefer 2 coming in. Jones couldn't have any complaints.

668~~~
Jones needs to go, 24 years old, forever injured and a calamity when he does play.

669~~~
Had high hopes for this lad.  Sadly he's made of bad decisions and glass..  Has to be moved on this summer.

670~~~
He's really fecking me off today for some reason. I'm doing my team prediction for tonight and if he wasn't such a sick note he'd make life a lot easier. Can't imagine how much it must be frustrating Van Gaal.

If he was even available for half the matches he has missed we'd have <b>????? - Smalling - Jones - Blind</b> which is an acceptable defence. Injury after injury and he's a complete waste of space.

I really hope we sell him this summer, another year or two of this nonsense and he'll be a 26 year old at the end of his contract with no value. Or worse, we'll look to secure that value with an extension and have to put up with him taking up a squad place for the foreseeable. 

Just feck off already, or at least man up and grow another braincell.

671~~~
I have it from a reliable source that his injury recurrences have their origin in his head and neck being three times too heavy for his body to support.

Also his repeated voluntary dislocation of his own jaw, a trick he copied from Helen Daniels from Neighbours, often results in him accidentally inhaling other players.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://aerobicsozstyleisnotasport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/philjones.jpg" src="http://aerobicsozstyleisnotasport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/philjones.jpg"/>

You have to feel for the useless tw&t.

672~~~
Where is Phil Jones this time? Van Gaal never mentions him anymore. Has he died and we're trying to cover it up?

673~~~
Time to move him on, surely?

674~~~
When you think Laporte has made 37 appearances for Bilbao this season and he is still 21.

675~~~
I saw the bump and thought he was back <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He must be dead.

676~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I had honestly forgot he even existed.

677~~~
I usually forget he's a United player until I see his thread bumped.

678~~~
The new Duncan Edwards

679~~~
To think that Van Gaal's preferred CB in preseason and the season ahead was actually Blind and Jones.

Then Jones got injured just before the Spurs game and has basically been out for the season with various ailments..including shingles.

680~~~
Should be his last season with the club really. Been saying it a while but I am not a fan of Jones, he's constantly injured and when he plays he looks dodgy to me.

681~~~
His injuries have injuries.

682~~~
sick to death of this lumbering crock

683~~~
Future England Captain.

684~~~
That's the thing, he isn't even worth the wait because when he does play he is average anyways. It's a shame but he needs to go in Summer.

685~~~
Same old Devilish.

686~~~
I wasn't the one who came out with that

687~~~
Sir Alex wasn't it? Got that a bit wrong.

688~~~
I think so

689~~~
Can't be carrying players who are injured for 3/4 of every season they've been at the club.  As a one off injury, sure, but not given his injury list

plus i genuinely don't think he's improved that much in the 4 1/2 years or so he's been at the club.  Still out of position and throws himself around way too much.

shame though as seems a decent lad and had high hopes like a lot of us might have had when we signed him

690~~~
I've been saying this for years now. We get attached to players too much. Players who are constantly injured/crap are kept in the hope that they will one day return to their former best (Jones, Evans, the crocked twins), players who are not really good/good anymore are moved around (Fellaini, Valencia etc) for the same reason. That's not how a big club works. We need a serious clear out and some quality players need to be brought in. A player who for one reason or another had underperformed for 2 consecutive years shouldn't expect to remain a regular first teamer anymore and he should be sold if he fails in his third year.

691~~~
Swap him for Sturridge <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

692~~~
Do you think stones would reject being our 3rd choice CB? Ie what Jones is?

693~~~
When you think Jones made 41 appearances in a season when he was still 19/20.
When you think Jones made 39 appearances in a season when he was still 21/22.

694~~~
So what happened?

695~~~
I think that's fair. We did it with Anderson and our CM in general as well.

Posters here often mock Madrid for their fickleness and envy the squads they and Barcelona have, but it sure as hell doesn't happen through accepting low standards. Under SAF we had the added advantage of his man management and motivation dragging us forward a lot of the times, but being satisfied with less than the best will you, unsurprisingly, give you less than the best.

696~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

697~~~
Laporte
13/14: 38 apps 3214 minutes
14/15: 49 apps 4310 minutes
15/16: 43 apps 3744 minutes


Jones
11/12: 41 apps 2986 minutes
12/13: 24 apps 1878 minutes
13/14: 39 apps 3099 minutes
14/15: 24 apps 2013 minutes
15/16: 13 apps 656 minutes

So even when Jones made around 40 apps in those seasons you mentioned, it's still far less than what Laporte has played in the last season and the 3/4 of this one.

698~~~
He really is having a horrible time with injuries. I can't remember the last time he was for for a decent spell. Still think he's a very good player but that's not of much use when he's never fit. 

That said I'd definitely keep him for another season to see if he can turn it around. He's still very young and there's no point in selling him now when we wouldn't get much for him.

699~~~
No, it was only Sir Bobby and Sir Alex. What would they know about Duncan Edwards? They probably never even saw him play unlike you.

Anyway, that wasn't the point. You don't have to shout Duncan Edwards each time someone brings up Phil Jones. It's utterly tiresom.

700~~~
I have only watched Edwards play on videos. However I bet he was more than a teent weeny better than jones..

701~~~
Probably. However, given that you've never seen him play, you should understand that your opinion is inconsequential next to people (Sir Bobby and Wilf Mcguinness) who have actually played with him never mind watched him. Might have also escaped your attention that no one ever said he was better than Duncan Edwards. Just that there were striking similarities between the two.

702~~~
Well maybe some of the veterans here can tell us if Jones is as good as Duncan Edwards then. Also what striking similarities could Jones have to a great defender? I was blessed to watch many great defenders in my life, some on the pitch (Maldini, Bergomi, Stam, Rio, Vidic and Baresi) and none of them where known for their facial expressions and their constant brain farts which also include headbutting the pitch. I bet if it was the case then they wouldn't be considered great defenders at all.

Could it be the case that both Sir Bobby and Sir Alex got this wrong? I mean they did get it wrong when they suggested the Scottish scarecrow to succeed SAF didn't they?

703~~~
Thats been the thinking for the last 4 years with Jones. He hasn't turned it around yet.

It's time we cut our losses on him. See if he can get fit for a few games towards the end of the season to put himself in the shop window and then tout him about the premier league. Someone will take a chance on him for a decent fee.

We can't afford to go into another season counting on him as an option at CB when he just can't stay fit.

704~~~
Phil Jones hasn't been very good for the last 3 seasons mainly down to injuries and his inability to play a long run of games at a stretch. But all these comparisons were made in his first two season where he did look very impressive. And no amount of revisionism will change my view on that. Jones can have no complaints if we get rid in the summer but he looked like he had seriously good potential in his first season.

What does picking a manager have to do with judging a player he actually played with? I'm not sure Duncan Edwards was even a defender. He played all over the place, probably part of the reason Jones is compared to him. Regardless, I have no idea what is it about the comparison made ages ago, about a player you've never even watched, offends you so much that you feel the need to constantly bring it up. Let it go.

705~~~
The problem is it means we don't sign a replacement so we end up short when he's never available. We just have too many crocks on our books and Jones is the worst offender.

706~~~
When is he out of contract? Absolute waste of time being on the books as he takes half a dozen games to get back up to speed - then he gets injured again.
Such a shame as he showed great promise when he joined.

707~~~
I think he just signed a new 4 year deal.

708~~~
He had spirit and was quite committed in making it at the highest level but he was never a great defender. He lack the physique and the composure of a Stam or a Vidic or the sheer talent of a Baresi, Maldini or Rio.

OShit and Phil played all over the place (literally). Would you compare them to Edwards too? Let us call it a day and say that SAF/Sir Bob got that incredibly wrong as they did with Moyes and the new Steve Bruce 'Ronnie Wallwork'

Did you watch Duncan Edwards play life btw?

709~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You're ridiculous. You've never watched hin nor do you know which position he plays and yet take offense at people who've watched and played with the said player. Get a fecking grip. 

Again with the Oshit nonsense...

710~~~
He was all action when he first joined us. Blood and thunder tackles and bulldozing solo runs from the back. He looked like he had the potential to be a complete footballer. I think that's what prompted the Edwards comparisons.

711~~~
Have you watched him play? Don't you think it was a mistake to compare an accident waiting to happen like Jones with a legend?

And I assure you, it takes much more to offend me.

712~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

713~~~
sorry mate. Its a reflex. I just think of John and bumm I type...

714~~~
I am not sure anyone ever said Jones is good as Duncan Edwards, but that he can <i>become</i> as good. Still probably wrong, but you never know. Not his biggest fan because I always thought he lacked football intelligence to become a top player even if he wasn't crooked, but you can't argue that he was bit different than your average young talented player when he arrived here. There was something special with him, that's for sure. Haven't seen much of it since his first or second year though.

He is really frustrating with his injuries, but I still feel sorry for him, it's not like he is developing intentionally. His development has stagnated a lot because of it, but one thing's for sure, we shouldn't rely on him, he is neither first choice material yet, and you can't rely on him as a squad player either.

715~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

716~~~
I agree with all that. I never thought he would be a great defender let alone believed he could become as good as someone like Edwards would be however I did believed at one time he would one day become useful to have around. Not everyone is born to become a Rio. Very few are. 

TBF its very difficult to assess a young defender. I watch the Serie A closely and I lost count of how many 'new Maldinis' there were only to fizzle out. Having said that I still find it hilarious to mention them every now and then. Unfortunately some people take the internet too seriously

717~~~
No and I don't particularly care either. I'm not the one who made the comparison. 

What I do know is that he looked fantastic in his first season and parts of the 2nd season. He looked good no matter where he played. Read the game well, was excellent at breaking into spaces, fast, strong and very good defensively. 

Hasn't worked out since then but it's hardly his fault.

718~~~
Well SAF did and I find it hilarious. Jeez we're still commenting on a 4 word sentence. Dont you have anything nicer to do like for example watching tv, go to the gym, watch some cartoons or wank at some porn etc? This is redcafe and not court

And no he wasn't good. He was very committed and he had great attitude (some may say he was promising) which channeled to the right direction could turn him into a United first team defender (Bruce type of defender) but he was never world class

719~~~
You find it hilarious despite never having seen the player in question? You really are clueless. 

And no, he looked very good. Then again you think Oshea was shit so clearly judging players isn't your forte.

720~~~
Who?

721~~~
you still prefer keeping on discussing a four phrase sentence don't you?

Internet serious business

722~~~
I've never seen Edwards either but the way people talk about him it was baffling to see Jones get compared to him. And the other stuff about him 'being one of our greatest players ever' was very strange stuff from Fergie

Did he not once say Dong Fangzhoa was the new Gabriel Batistuta? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

723~~~
I suppose so.

724~~~
It was Sir Bobby who made the comparison along with Crerand and Mcguinness. And it was the style of play that was compared not their ability.

725~~~
I watched batigol play and dong was nowhere to him.

726~~~
where the heck is he, he'd just got back from the last injury then disappeared again. Is farcical.

727~~~
Good to know.

728~~~
Still hoping he pulls a Smalling next season and stays fit.

729~~~
I still think he will be FWIW.

There's still a good chance of that happening anyway.

He's a good player when he's 'fit'.

730~~~
No matter how good he becomes, he'll never be a captain anywhere until he proves that he can stay fit.

731~~~
There always has to be a question mark over a player who would probably play exactly the same as they do if they were drunk.

732~~~
Was on the fantasy footy site, and checking some United defender stats, and checked Jones's record out.

Think I clocked two 90mins in the league and something like 500mins all in.

That's out of 29 league games.

An incredible record. Always seems to put himself out for 7-8 weeks every 2 or 3 appearances

733~~~
His time is up. We need to buy an established CB and make TFM a regular in the first team squad.

Jones needs to go to a mid-table club like Everton, prove his fitness and the fact he is actually a decent player for 3-4 seasons before earning a big move again.

He's done nothing in 5 seasons at United apart from regress.

I'm done with players who've been sitting around for years and have been given a pass in the name of potential. My club is being destroyed and we need to ship out all the dross. LVG, Jones, Fellaini, Rooney, Mata, Carrick can all feck off. Nothing would make me happier than never seeing these guys put on a United shirt again.

734~~~

735~~~
That was posted yesterday was it an April fools joke.

736~~~
Forget U21s. Play him in the first team.

737~~~
Just keep him away from the training pitch. We don't need anymore injuries.

738~~~
He's probably played the same amount of games as Shaw this season, which is a real shocker, as that was such a terrible injury.

Still hope he can achieve his potential here, but we undoubtedly need to buy a quality centre back for next year. No way is Mourinho playing Blind there.

739~~~
Bubble football might be the best thing we have to keep him fit.

740~~~
fully expect another injury before the season ends

741~~~
He needs to be shown the exit door this summer or accept a squad player role on a reduced salary.

742~~~
He needs to be moved on.

743~~~
He really, really does. Hasn't lived up to his early potential as many players fail to do. He seems to be absolutely cursed with injuries too which has played it's part. I personally never got the hype around him but he started well for us.

744~~~
This.

745~~~
How much could we get for him? He is still young,and if he can get past his injuries he still has talent

746~~~
I think he needs to be moved on too but I can't see it happening this summer.We're not going to sign 2 CBS to replace him and Rojo and Tojo deserves to go more.

747~~~
£4 mil by our past 'deals'. We only got £7 million for Hernandez in the same summer Sunderland are buying Borini for £10 mil.

748~~~
That is ridiculous! 10m for Borini and 7 for Hernandez.

749~~~
door

750~~~
Back in the squad for tonight's u-21 game. 

I hope he stays far far away from the senior squad for a very long time.

751~~~
7-9m (whatever it was) for Hernandez was ridiculous.  I hate how much we get mugged off in the transfer market, even if we're alright financially.

I'd say Jones is worth about 6 or 7m.  I think it's time he made a move.  He's not even useful as backup with how often he's injured.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

752~~~
A combination of injuries and him being used as a utility player has completely wrecked his progression. I feel he could have been top class centre half otherwise.

753~~~
We should be able to fetch £15m for him easily

754~~~
In fully reformed, extended squad with greater depth he may have a slight chance in upcoming season but we could really take title race a bit more seriously. Not looking good for him. Needs a special training program or a football brain but mostly a titanium skeleton.

I'm guessing a little heartbreak for Fergie as he saw unlimited potential for a defender in this lad.

Fingers crossed he'll return to consistent football. Not much we can do for him if he can't go through short term physical pressure without a damage.

755~~~
I'd like to think so, but no chance.  5m at most.    

I wouldn't mind Jones as a squad man under Jose, who can put his arm around Jones and show him how to protect himself.  He's still only 24.  With TFM looking the real deal and Blind having done a very decent job, if Jones can turn the corner on fitness we can take a pass on purchasing a CB this summer and focus our transfer cash elsewhere.

The thing about Jones is that when he's fit enough to play 3-4 matches straight he's been fantastic.  Do you we really want to give that away before we bring in Jose?

756~~~
I don't know what kind of wages he is on but there is no point in selling him for a paltry 5-7m. Use him as a squad player and maybe invest in a top class CB. If that fails still Blind and TFM.

757~~~
The contract he sign d last year is rumoured to be £80k a week.

758~~~
Get him on a pay as you play contract.  I think we should have done that with Rafael, this guy is no different. He's won trophies with us. He's played over 100 times for us. He's 24 years of age. Our squad is really small. If he can get over his injuries, he is a good squad member. What would be the point in giving him away for cheap? We were mugs regarding Hernandez and Rafael. These clubs don't do us any favors. We don't have the squad currently for him to be a problem and he's at an age where he can overcome these things. Smalling went through something very similar but touch wood, got over it. Jones is sometimes his own worst enemy but once he calms down, hopefully he will go on a run. I imagine many would have sold Robson for a fiver because he got lots of knocks too. 

Not comparing them as players but Jones has had more then a few good games under his belt. Let's not be rash.

759~~~
If a top class CB can be had, absolutely do it.  I'd like to get Blind back into midfield, where his passing range in a 4231 can be used brilliantly.

760~~~
Maybe when Mourinho comes in he can bring his skill at selling players you don't want for whopping fees with him!
As otherwise, in 1-2 years I could very easily see us selling Jones for £3m to Everton or Sunderland, as seems standard.
Then he'd go on to have 10 decent years for them

761~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Jesus wept.

762~~~
Well you just answered your own question really mate. He has recently just signed a new 4 year contract where he gets paid whether he plays or not, so why would he then sign a new contract that would see him only get paid the 10-15 weeks a year when he is actually fit?

As it stands with him being constantly injured we are going into seasons counting him as a CB option yet he is rarely fit, and every year we are having to play midfielders back there to compensate.

And you know he's on a decent contract and getting paid millions to sit on his arse most of the season.

763~~~
Look how long it took us to broom Anderson, I don't see Calamity Jones going anywhere anytime soon.

764~~~
I can see us getting a decent fee for him. Young, English and represents the characteristics of a typical english player/defender. Would be surprised if we dont get 10-15m for him. A club like Everton, West Ham, Stoke or Leicester would stump that up easily.

765~~~
He's English.

766~~~
Arsenal will take him for £6m if Wenger is still there.

767~~~
Cue injuries to Janujaz and Pereira...

768~~~
Always been a fan of Jones. I understand some of the criticism but I like the way he plays. However for the U21's tonight he's looked miles off. I hope it's just rust and these injuries haven't left some permanent mark on him.

769~~~
Palmer did him like a Kipper more than once but RoShaun Williams mopped up for him, looked really rusty and went straight down the tunnel with the physios when he came off.

770~~~
Rather we put time and energy into the likes of TFM and CBJ.

771~~~
Bingo this all day long..

772~~~
Mourinho would probably sell him quick if he got his hands on Laporte or Stones

773~~~
Was outclassed by  few young Chelsea forwards tonight. Looked badly off match pace and his distribution was well below average.
I could see him being an injury or two away from slipping into lower league obscurity if he can't get a decent season together without the physios table.
Not good enough for Utd, has had his time and not shown enough progress for me. Seems to bring Smalling down 10-15% when he's playing beside him too.

774~~~
I think he should train to become a physio.
Without any training in physiotherapy, I think many would class him as an expert in identifying and treating injuries. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

775~~~
we have so many good centerbacks coming through now that I wouldn't be afraid to sell him but if he gets on track and stays fit he still can be a great player, would rather ditch Rojo first and McNair who is just not good enough. Regan Poole is the new Jones for me even though it's still long way to go

776~~~
I just caught a glimpse of the footage of his recent outing.  Effin hell stuff.

LVG needs to keep him away from the first team for the rest of the season.  Let him train with the younger players to regain some kind of form going into the summer, where he can continue to work on his fitness and get a fresh start with the first team in July.

I'd still have Jones in the rotation at CB but no way should Jose crown him Smalling's partner.  Make the proper buy at CB, tap TFM as first option off the bench and give Phil a chance to work his way up the ladder.

777~~~
He should start every game from now on. Get him ready for the Euros.

778~~~
Presuming this is a wum

779~~~
Jones CB and Smalling RB like the good old days <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

780~~~
Another shocker from him for the U21s tonight

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-u21-phil-jones-11241482#rlabs=2%20rt$category%20p$3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...1-phil-jones-11241482#rlabs=2 rt$category p$3</a>

Jones, who has made six <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Premier League</a> starts this season, was lining up for the Under-21s for the third time in the last month and was humiliated by Southampton's prolific 20-year-old Sam Gallagher in the build-up to the hosts' winner.

781~~~
Would be surprised if he's here in September.

782~~~
As long as he has time left on his contract, he's not going to want to leave. He's only been back a month, let's give him time to build up his fitness over the summer, get a good preseason it and see where he's at.

783~~~
Phil "Scotty Scot Parker" Jones

784~~~
Not sure about that plan, sounds like something he would get injured doing.

785~~~
If its true that Mourinho wants Stones then he's in trouble. It will be hard to get rid of him though.

786~~~
The decision to stay shouldn't be his. We need to be more ruthless. That's why we've ended up with so much deadwood over the years.

787~~~
Even when he's fit, he's terrible. Showed a few matches of some promise when he first signed and drastically went downhill thereafter. 
Utd isn't a club for players to cut their teeth. He's 24, being burned by 20 year olds. 
Not good enough, sick note, get rid.

788~~~
With the quality of the kids we have coming through, he doesn't stand a chance here. 


He's the caricature English 'talent'. Developed early physically, plays with heart, soul, blood and thunder and limited technical ability. Considered 'potential' because he can hold his own as a young player and we ignore the deficiencies in his game, assuming he will iron them out. Naturally he gets older but never actually kicks on. 

I'd bite someones hand off if they offered £10m to £15m this summer and force them to sign a disclaimer saying that they are sober and in control of their own actions.

789~~~
"Duncan Edwards". Fergie was sometimes guilty of going overboard with praise.

790~~~
Has this joker really made 13 appearances this season? I genuinely can't remember a single one of those or what position he was playing. My last memory of him was this:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://45.media.tumblr.com/97d74666bd099d435c621955c57cb11b/tumblr_noi34oCAb91shaydvo1_500.gif" src="https://45.media.tumblr.com/97d74666bd099d435c621955c57cb11b/tumblr_noi34oCAb91shaydvo1_500.gif"/>

791~~~
Time for him to go. He's poor and injury prone. Never rated him.

792~~~
Nah. I'm by no means a huge fan of Jones; his positioning is erratic and he's prone to mistakes. But he's a good defender on the whole. If we make him available then a lot of Premier League clubs will take an interest.

793~~~
He slipped. Players slip. It happens.

But Jones made the tackle and stopped a certain goal. Great defending. I can't think of many players in the league who could have stopped a Giroud goal in that circumstance.

794~~~
And Capello compared him to Baresi. 

It's almost like two of the greatest coaches in history know something we don't.

795~~~
I still like him though physically he's looked way off since his last injury.

I'd give him one more season.

796~~~
To be fair Vidic did something similar to put it out for a throw in and everyone thought it was great. That was a bit of good improvisation by Jones.

Maybe he should use his head to make every tackle lol

797~~~
He's far more commited to Manchester United than Rojo but he's 24 and still can't fulfill that potential spotted by Fergie in a slightest part. His football brain also could use some calibration and without at least few regular seasons it will only get difficult for him to even sustain Premier League level.

798~~~
How do you know that? Isn't Rojo a big United fan?

799~~~
It's the kind of never-say-die defending that Mourinho will love. If he can regain his sharpness, Jones will be one of the first names on the teamsheet again. 

Let's not forget that Fergie played him whenever he was fit, whether that be in midfield, central defence or right-back. He's an intelligent player and a physical beast. Take away the memes and people on here would have a different opinion of him.

800~~~
Watching them both playing works pretty well to draw a conclusion that Jones gives more on the pitch than Rojo who's technically still is a better footballer but unfortunately doesn't use that fully to his advantage.

801~~~
They probably went overboard but I have to admit that I was really impressed by his early appearances for us. He slotted in at right back and was terrific.

802~~~
I like Jones. One of my favourite players. At 24, despite being 'injury prone' at the moment, he's bound to have a break out season soon. I mean, prior to this season, Smalling never had a full season for us and he's 26. Look at him now. Arguably the best defender in the league. 

People will talk about him being 'ruined' by U21's, but it happens. If your up against a skilful player, regardless of age, he will give you trouble. Look at what Rashford and Martial have done to opposition players. 

I think if Jones can stay fit, which is a big if, then he'll do well. I just get the feeling the staff are running out of patience. To add to that, we have Mensah, Williams and Tuanzebe coming through.

803~~~
If Mourinho comes to United, Jones will be his Ivanovic, in my opinion.

804~~~
The thing is he just signed a long term contract worth I believe upwards of 80k a week. Who's going to take him on those wages? Not many teams outside the top 6 and those teams might not need him.

805~~~
That would save us lot time on scouting and transfer funds and if Jose could perform a miracle like LvG did on Young then maybe, who knows... Still far for Jones to even returning to simple match rhythm and perhaps it would be better to secure a talented defender in the summer but in the same time keep Jones and see what a change of manager can do for him.

806~~~
Ay, he'd have to take a drop in wages. Agree with that.

807~~~
I think he's a better defender than Stones but if his injuries have rendered him useless, its best to move on at that point. Weirdly enough his injuries have reached Owen Hargreaves territory right now and even Hargo stayed fit for most of his early 20s.

808~~~
Ye. Personally, I don't think we should get rid of Jones until he has his break out season. Thing is, we could be waiting for quite a while.

809~~~
We've waited long enough for Smalling but as soon he had some time without injuries his progress is slowly reaching the world class level now.

Not saying Jones will do the same but sometimes it's really easy to be wrong with assessments. Perhaps Jose's arrival could impact Rojo in a positive way too.

810~~~
Agreed.

811~~~
Smalling was fit for most of last season, and the season before that. People often overstate his injury problems for some reason. 

Jones by contrast seems to get injured more and more every season. He's been lucky to survive previous culls but will surely be shipped out in the summer.

812~~~
Yep. Fitness wise, Jones has fallen off a cliff. Over the last three seasons Smalling has made 117 appearances for the club, Jones only 76.

813~~~
Jones has had one injury this season, but LvG has kept bringing him back too early and aggravating it.

814~~~
Minus, you know, all that playing - because he can't stay fit. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

815~~~
A fair point tbh

816~~~
I'm not really sure how you come to this conclusion without being privy to the workings of our medical department.

817~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

818~~~
He's suffered recurrences of a right ankle injury almost immediately after playing for the first team on each return. He lasted a couple of games in December, and one half of one game in February. If his ankle had been allowed to fully heal, that wouldn't happen.

You can tell LvG is doing things differently this time by easing him in slowly.

819~~~
And that whole difference comes from this season. In Jones' 4 seasons before this one he made 128 appearances while Smalling made 119 in the same period. They've made roughly the same amount of appearances every season bar this one where Smalling has remained fit and played a huge amount while Jones has been injured the whole time.

Even further, in that 4 year period Jones played 9885 minutes and Smalling played 8974 minutes.

820~~~
That was more down to the fact Smalling that was competing with Ferdinand, Vidic, Evans and Rafael as well as Jones for a spot while Jones was getting games in midfield too. 

Smalling was on the bench a lot, Jones has just been absent due to injuries. A lot of which come from having no idea  about self preservation.

821~~~
Or maybe he has chronic problems.

822~~~
True. His constant praise of Johnny Evans was also mind boggling. He once said Evans would be a future Manchester United captain with the team built around him and on another occasion said he was fantastic and the best defender in England (2012). I couldn't believe what I was reading. Funny how the one who he didn't really single out with such lavish praise, Smalling, is the one who's really doing the business at OT

823~~~
Jonny Evans was our best CB in the 12-13 season.

824~~~

825~~~
Why post that now? He played 90 minutes so it was clearly nothing..

826~~~
Because it's an update? Whether it turns out to be an injury or not remains to be seen. If he played through it and it's nothing all the better.

827~~~
Turns out it was in the 90th min after the subs were made..
Oh well. Hope its nothing. Nothing mentioned in the match report..

828~~~
Agreed.

829~~~
Any sign of him actually not getting injured, and getting involved no?
Excuse my skepticism, I don't mean to tarnish the boy but, how long does one wait?

He's not some young prodigy coming through...He was bought for near 20 million and has been utter shite. And that is a kind way of putting it.
He was/is like Scot Parker....Disappear from your role and attempt to make a last ditch "brave" tackle like Scot "Scotty" Parker

I feel for the guy. I hope he becomes an England regular and has a good club career. I have nowt against the guy...But, he's shown himself not to be up to it here

The idea of him and Rojo in the same defence is laughable

830~~~
GNev said a similar thing about PJ a few years back.  Essentially GNev questioned PJ's footballing intelligence as a CB but thought he would make an awesome RB because of his skillset.

831~~~
Sounds like self-deprecating humour from Nev,  as a former right back himself.

832~~~
I don't remember him ever being particularly good at right back. He would sometimes make big runs forward as he has the pace and power to do so, but he doesn't have very good technique. He could potentially make a good defensive fullback but I can't see him linking play and putting in good crosses. We should be aiming higher.

833~~~
I think GNev's main point was that PJ couldn't be trusted to play CB because of his general lack of awareness and footballing intelligence.  TBH I thought PJ has regressed tremendously.  Hope he really does turn it around physically but not holding my breath.

As far as putting in crosses, VG clearly disagrees with you b/c he had PJ taking corners in a couple of games remember?  <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

834~~~
Thought Jones played really well last night against your man Abrahams? He was a handful, at least size and strength wise. Hope that little injury he seemed to pick up isn't too bad.

835~~~
What a disappointing season behind him, he can't start even in a pointless game now, even though he was supposed to be a starter at the start of the season.

836~~~
Only LvG would play Blind over Jones, so im not worried. I just want Phil to be 100% fit for when Mou takes over.

837~~~
Much prefer him at right back than centre mid. That was a mad few years where we seemed to have been under a ban from buying players for that position, so had to pish about with all manner of mad options.
Playing players until they were 40, playing Rafael there, Rooney, anything bar buying a good centre mid player.

Although this was meant to be the summer that changed that!

838~~~
That can apply for any player on the bench tonight.

839~~~
I'm genuinely struggling to think of a game he's played in this season.

A waste of a season, really.

840~~~
Hell be gone in the summer hopefully.

841~~~
Everton is the only one i can remember.

842~~~
Yes, but at least majority of them played much more than him though.

843~~~
This thread sure does get Random bumps.

Injuries is his biggest issue. Needs to get over that.

Probably deserves another year atleast. Should get him on a new deal regardless if it's expiring soon.

844~~~
Gotta stick with him given what Smalling has produced this season. He just needs that run of games.

845~~~
Van Gaal played what he felt was his strongest team, and didn't deem it as a 'pointless game'.

846~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

847~~~
Has he had one good season for us since joining the club? First season, he was good for a few months then got injured and couldn't get back in the team if I remember rightly. Since then, it's been a few good games here and there, and now it's not even that. He's a waste of space and we need to get rid. 

He's not a natural defender, doesn't read the game well and is poor in the air. He's tenacious and powerful which can also be a hindrance in his game with the way he throws himself into tackles and gets injured.

848~~~
So Jackson, who hs been excellent for us, is dropped from the squad for the final.....

Meanwhile, this unreliable oaf, who can't keep himself fit, has played next to feck all games all season, is in the squad.....

I despair at times

849~~~
TFM is injured.

850~~~
He'll probably pull a hamstring in the buffet line and CBJ will be drafted in.

851~~~
Thanks. Edited accordingly

852~~~
I still believe he can make it, of course he needs to sort his injuries out, the CB that gets injured as much is just not a viable option. This is a least injured position. Apart form GK of course, lets say "outfield position". Players who are 34-35 play there the whole season without a sub.
Given his injury problems i am not against letting him go and taking someone much more reliant, like Dragovic for example.

853~~~
Hopefully he will be on the bench and never have to get off of it.  He's an automatic sub due to an injury and we're going to need all 3 tomorrow.

854~~~
Without injuries, Jones could be very good, in my opinion. 

Prior to this season, people weren't sure about Smalling, who, like Jones, also struggled with injured. This season, he's arguably been the best centre back in the EPL.

855~~~
To nothing like the extent Jones has. Smalling has missed a total of 32 games with injury in his United career according to Transfermarkt, Jones has missed 84 and has been here one season fewer. In my opinion Smalling had more potential and didn't make many errors, it was his passing and distribution that let him down. Jones always feels like he's capable of making some sort of horror mistake at any given moment to me, I'm hoping we buy a new centre back or two and cut our losses.

856~~~
Someone brought up the other day that in pre-season it looked odds on that Jones was actually the intended partner for Blind. He'd played 4 friendlies in a row, and then Smalling was in from game 1.

Incredible to look at that now

857~~~
From what I remember over the past few years, Jones is a lot more injury prone.  But I agree, without injuries he's a very good defender. 
Needs to learn to calm down and probably spend more time conditioning.

858~~~
I'm just glad he's relatively fit to play. At this point it may be another matter of counting how many days before new injury but maybe it's just a matter of giving him more time before he'll start playing regularly like in Smalling's case.

Mike also needed time.

859~~~
He'll probably be our plan B option. If the game goes to extra time Louis will bring him on as our set piece expert

860~~~
Smalling is so overrated. His form has dipped since December. And most people would agree the Alderweireld has been the best CB in the EPL throughout the season.

861~~~
Doesn't deserve to be involved tomorrow in my opinion, he has contributed the square root of f*ck all this season... 

Not a fan.

862~~~
Yep it is totally unacceptable that he is in the squad.

863~~~
Really can't believe CBJ was dropped for him. Jones misses essentially the entire season and gets to waltz back in for a cup final at the expense of someone who actually contributed.

864~~~
I still can't understand why Ferguson said that " he could go on to be one of the best players this club has ever had "

Like .... What was he seeing ?? It's so baffling that my lexicon actually has to resort to saying like .....

865~~~
Can't believe Phil Jones is a footballer. 

Him being a footballer is as ridiculous as saying I'm a good poster

866~~~
Wasn't Smalling coming back from injury during those first few pre-season games?

Nah. He's hardly overrated. Been excellent in a makeshift back 4 that has no consistency. The improvement he's shown, granted there was a bit of a dip in form following his injury (but it was also collective), is remarkable. 

Reg. Jones, like many I doubt he'll blossom into what we once hoped, but it would be quite foolish to write him off. He may benefit from a new manager too.

867~~~
The thing people tend to forget is that Smalling had already shown what he could do if he got a good run of games. He had a period in his first season with us where he was utterly brilliant, almost as good as what he was in the first half of this season. It got to the point where I often found myself hoping that the opposition would get past our midfield just so I could watch Smalling destroy everything they threw at him. In the following seasons he was either used at rightback, injured, or just stuck behind Rio and Vidic, but it was always obvious that he 'should' go on to be one of our dominant centre backs.

Jones has never shown anything like that. Yes he's had good games where he's looked good, but he's always been inconsistent and had plenty of mistakes in him.

868~~~
During his last season Ferguson had a period where Jones was the only player to start 8 matches in a row and then started the last 9 matches of the season. Those runs lead to him making that infamous comment about him after his last match. Plus Jones was great during our exciting start in the 11-12 season.

869~~~
I wouldn't say Jones was great back then. We were conceding goals for fun then. I remember the Chelsea and Basle games where we were a mess in defence. Thankfully our attack bailed us out.

It's best if we moved him on. Funny how he was fit last season just before his contract extension. Since he has signed his new contract he's back as a sicknote.

870~~~
One of those whos potential is ruined by injuries. Could have been a legend but instead he has become the butt of our inury-curse

871~~~
In the season Sir Alex said <a class="externalLink" href="https://youtu.be/4O0MlOIAJqw?t=235" target="_blank">this</a> I'd say he had a pretty good season. Injury-hit, as always, but a good season. Last year he had a good half-season.

872~~~
Even Anderson has had a better career than Jones for us. Hoping that in summer we get rid of him. Injured most of the time, and a total liability when he is not injured.

873~~~
Probably as well, but I remember Van Gaal making comments that Darmian, Blind and Shaw would be his first choice with R CB to be decided. Got a lot of concern at the time

874~~~
Appearances in all comps for Man Utd:

*Could be 14 if he makes an appearance in the FA Cup final.

I'd say only 2 decent seasons of appearances out of 5, including the last 2 which have been shocking. At 24 years old he really needs to be putting in 40+apps a season to continue progressing. One more season like the previous 2 and I'd say his United career is over.

875~~~
He's lucky considering what happened to Rafael. Let's not be rash - he's a whole hearted player who needs to protect his body better. I don't think he should be on the bench because Rojo can also play CB if needed. He's still 23/24 and I think these types of players should be on pay as you play contracts. He's won titles with United and that experience is still vital in our squad. They need to look at how the injuries are occurring (i'm sure they do) and just avoid these situations. If that means, changing his game to being more of a reader then a whole hearted tackler then so be it.

876~~~
I've seen this name in a few threads already but know nothing about him. What type of CB is he?

877~~~
They couldn't find out how he injures himself for the last 4 seasons so why would they do it next season? Also, to be a reader of the game you actually need some football intelligence and Jones was never a player that would have it in abundance, he's your 'out of position just to make a last ditch tackle' defender.

878~~~
I might get ridiculoued to death for this but I do think if Jones could have a none injury hit season he'd be significantly better than Smalling. Smalling is a good centre back but Jones when fit is better for me. 
The only problem of course is he can't seem to get fit for a whole season which as a centre back being able to be relied upon is the most important thing.

879~~~
SAF saw similar potential in both and didn't hesitate to sign them as they were scouted by our rivals back then. He didn't overpay that much as we would now for Stones and to be honest I have no regrets Jones joined us. He seems to be more versatile than Smalling but physically & purely defensively Mike in beast mode is currently getting closer to a world class level.

It's gonna be hard for Jones to copy that but his success right now will be slowly getting back to being fit which isn't impossible. Just needs more time but the worst case scenario at this point is also on the menu.

880~~~
I think the one big advantage he has is the ball at his feet. I think hes a better passer than Smalling and can join into midfield driving forward.

881~~~
I honestly don't care if Jones stays or goes. But either way he needs to be replaced within the squad. We can't go into another season relying on him as cover at CB.

He's been here 5 years now so next year has to be his last if he can't sort his injuries out.

882~~~
He has to give the FA Cup medal to someone else who deserve it more. Probably Memphis?

883~~~
should go with a good player coming in

884~~~
So much for the player dubbed by SAF as the next Duncan Edwards.

885~~~
I think he'll do well under Jose. Just needs to keep fit.

886~~~
But his problem is not the manager but the fitness. Some players are just like that i.e. cant's stay fit. I think he's done anyways.

887~~~
Mourinho's teams usually have an excellent fitness record. Maybe, just maybe he can sort this one out.

888~~~
Phil Jones would actually fit what Mourinho usually wants in a RB.

889~~~
Valencia even more so.

890~~~
Smalling was injured a lot till last season too.
I think Jones will turn his fitness around. He'll be great. 
All we need to do.. is Bo...

891~~~
I think he is very talented. I still have hope that he'll do a Smalling at some stage and stay fit enough to fulfill his talent. It's needs to happen fast, though. 

Anyway, our central defense isn't essentially our strongest suite. Rojo is trash and I do not see Blind as a regular CB under Jose. That leaves us with only him and Smalling as regular starters. 

I would buy a top CB, let Rojo leave, use Blind as a back up for various positions and then either buy another young prospect or use someone from our academy. That would leave is with Smalling, Jones, New Top CB, New young CB - as our top four choices.

892~~~
Well, basically a Vidic, a no-nonsense, tough-tackling, strong. Only of course not as skillful, although he still can develop, he is 25 or something. His league experience is not top, as was Vidic's, he plays in Ukraine for Dynamo Kiev, but on international stage for Austria he looks really settled. Austria actually had a very tough group for them with Russia, Montenegro, Sweden. You don;t really expect them to win it, but they did and mostly thanks to their defence.
It's a bit reminiscent of like before his transfer here Vidic had a great campaign with Serbia.
Given how things are in Ukraine it will be easier to get him.

893~~~
Thanks!

894~~~
What do you think the main reason for Jones not getting much game time this year? 
<ul>
<li>Valencia's speed, power and work rate made him unconsidered for RB, and BWJ was always the better backup?</li>
<li>Hadn't a clue about the philosophy and LVG never felt he was suitable for the RB position, or the CB position?</li>
<li>Couldn't keep himself to a fit enough level required?</li>
<li>Couldn't keep the ball as required?</li>
<li>Other reason?</li>
</ul>

895~~~
Injured and wtf is a BWJ? Is that the same as CBJ? CBJ is a LB so that would have no bearing on the RB position.

896~~~
BWJ as in Borthwick jackson yeah. His first name escaped.  Did CBJ not play right back too?

897~~~
Injuries, and it's been a major blessing in disguise. I'm certain LVG would have gone into the season with Jones and Blind as first choice CBs if he hadn't been injured for the first game.

898~~~
Nah, he has only played on the left. We had so many options at RB that I don't think Jones was seen as really an option there anyway. Jones played 4 u21 matches toward the end of the season and looked quite rusty and off the pace and with Blind and Smalling both playing quite well, van Gaal probably didn't feel the need to try rush him back. He got injured in his first u21 game back in February so they were probably just easing him back with the hope of him being ready for next season.

899~~~
His corners weren't very good. The ultimate besmirching of the philosophy. Ask Adnan and Andreas.

900~~~
Just spat my tea out laughing at Phil Jones' face in the graphic at the top of this page. True story. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

901~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Have you only just seen that?

902~~~
So, how long do we stick by Phil? I'd absolutely hate to see him leave, have an injury free season and perform to Smalling's level this campaign.

903~~~
Needs to be sold.

904~~~
How many games has he started or played in at least over the last two seasons?

905~~~
He'd probably be less hassle at right back than giving me heart attacks at centre back but I still think he's unlikely to progress to the player we need. I just feel like he has far too much ground to catch up in terms of the mental attributes required for a top defender. That and he can barely go 5 games without breaking.

Valencia's a much better full-back anyway.

906~~~
I hate to say it, but I agree with you.  I long thought he was going to become a top defender, year in year out among the best couple/few in the league.

Even with all the injuries, he has more than enough of the physical tools to get to that level.  It's between the ears where he's just not making those steps forward. 

He just doesn't read the game well enough.  He's always reacting in some hero mode effort.  It's great that he can do that when required, but it's incredibly damming how often he has to.   The best center halves deal with issues before they become problems.  It's deciving to watch them.  It looks like they were well screened or the opposition attack had an off day.  In reality, it's the subtle things they do.  They take a couple of steps and choke a channel.  They see space before it can be exploited.  They keep an active eye on the rest of the backline and the screening element to avoid becoming isolated and vulnerable. 

Jones just doesn't do enough of that.  He's young and can't be expected to be even nearly the finished article, but he should have a solid, demonstrated command of those critical little things.  Yeah, fitness has been an massive issue for him.  You can improve on the training table.  If you can dress out to play, you probably aren't training at a serious level.  That doesn't whitewash just how bewildering poor he's been at the ins and outs of his chief position. 

He was so poor that Blind took his position just before the start of the season.  Whether van Gaal had been considering it or not, it was very much his position to lose.  If he couldn't hammer it down then, when will he?

I can't help but think this is the year to decide his future at United.  If he can gain Mourinho's trust and get on the proper trajectory, he may belately become that player we hoped he would.

Right now, Blind has done more and better at center half than he has--with far fewer physical tools.  Bailly is young and raw but may out develop Jones in this coming season alone.  It's coming down to it for Jones.

I don't like his chances at this point.

907~~~
This season he started 7 games, and came on as a sub in 6 in all comps. Pitiful

Bit better the season before, he started 23 and came on as sub in 1

908~~~
With Tim Mensah knocking on a first squad's door he got less and less time & chances to start competing for a place in a team. Today's signing of Bailly was a nail, another deal in that mood may be the end... and Maureen probably needs more quality depth there so safe to say it's not looking good.

He just needs to stop being injured. It's a lot to ask but we need start competing for a title. Soon.

909~~~
Been a massive letdown sadly. I remember thinking he was going to be a monster player after his first month or two here.

He could have no complaints if Jose got rid this Summer.

910~~~
Spot on.

Mensah is a threat to Jones' place in the squad not only as a dedicated center half but as a defensive utility player.  Blind already brings that.  Blind is better in midfield and so far much more reliable at center half (both availability and play).  From what I've seen, Mensah is also better in midfield and looking good at center half.

Before those two, Blind was the only one in the squad that could offer cover just about anywhere in the back half of the pitch.  That's not the case now.

It's going to be his ability to play as a dedicated center half that will be the decision point.

911~~~
Now we signed Bailly, I expect Jones to be ship out.
And now we have Blind or TFM who can play in different defensive or midfield position.
Such a shame...

912~~~
I genuinely thought Jones was going to be a beast of a CB for us. Remember his performance vs Madrid? What a shame, maybe Jose can work his magic on him.

913~~~
I thought the same.  Now, I don't see much of a future for Jones at OT.  One more season as a squad man then off to a midtable club.

914~~~
I agree. One more season to prove his worth, I think Smalling needs to have a word with Phil about overcoming injuries and proving your worth

915~~~
I've said from day one he wouldn't make it and it's frankly amazing he is still with us. <i>How on earth </i>he was rewarded with a new 4 year deal, at £120k/week, just last year is absolutely beyond me. For me Jones' has only survived here due to a culture of mismanagement and wholesale bad decision making by those in charge. We're not getting back amongst the elite giving squad places for 5 years to the likes of Phil fecking Jones and his exit, which I'm sure is imminent, will be another marker that we are back in business. 

He was never good enough, not in a million years, and the odd good game here and there isn't evidence of otherwise.

916~~~
I don't know where you're getting your figures from, but he's on 80k not 120.

917~~~
Fair enough. It's still £80k too much though and he needs fecking off. Then he can go ballooning around in away ends with a different set of fans.

918~~~
I agree. He hasn't shown any progress in his time at United whatsoever

919~~~
Bo.....Lieve? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> never thought I would see a Bo Dallas reference in a Phil Jones thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

On a serious note, had the potential but the somewhat minor issue of never actually being fit/uninjured means we cannot rely on him. I would be very surprised if Mourinho didn't ship him out somewhere very quickly.

920~~~
With Bailly here, logic tells you that one of the CBs is going.  I hope to hell that it's Jones and not Blind.

921~~~
One of the best posts I've seen for a few years on the Cafe.

922~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Jose Mourinho has given Phil Jones reassurances that he is part of his plans at Manchester United, according to reports.</b></span>
The Portuguese coach is currently in the process of revamping his squad at Old Trafford after being appointed as the club’s new manager on a three-year contract last month.

Mourinho has already set about bringing in some defensive reinforcements by signing Eric Bailly from Villarreal.

That move has cast doubt about the futures of the likes of Phil Jones and Daley Blind beyond the summer under Mourinho.

However, the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/phil-jones-assured-manchester-united-8219389" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Daily Mirror</a> is reporting that Mourinho has told Jones that he features as a big part in his plans at Old Trafford and wants the defender to become like John Terry was for the Portuguese boss at Chelsea.

923~~~
If any rumour this summer turns out to be true, I pray it's not this one.

924~~~
If Johnes stays out of injuries I can see Jose moulding him to a top defender

925~~~
It's a tough one. He had great promise on his arrival, but I personally don't think there's been enough (if any) improvement to warrant a place in the squad. Obviously injuries have plagued him and hampered his development, but it'll get to a point where we need to cut our losses.

Pivotal moment in his career really. He'll turn 25 next season, so won't really be a 'young' player anymore either. José will definitely give him the chance, but it's in Jones' hands to give us a reason to keep him. He seems like a nice chap also, so I do hope it works out for him.

926~~~
Zero chance of him avoiding injuries. We'll be in the same position this time next year - you can quote me. 

Anderson mkII. If if if if.
