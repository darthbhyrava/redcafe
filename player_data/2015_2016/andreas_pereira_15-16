1~~~
Very nice start to the pre-season for him. Very impressive in the second half. Much like Schneiderlin was in the first. Will be interesting to see how he gets on this season.

2~~~
Looked quality in that match. Hope to see plenty more of him on the tour.

3~~~
He has way more pace then i thought he had. Guess it just now shows because hes played as a winger instead of 10

4~~~
Player of the half for me. Weird for Van Gaal to play him wide and Januzaz inside. Thought he'd have been excellent as part of a midfield 3 with Herrera and Schweinsteiger.

5~~~
Really pleased to see him get a good half under his belt, he was our most dangerous player in that half and showed good close control and delivery.

6~~~
Was better than Young and Mata, and comfortably so.

7~~~
Yep, was the standout player for me too. Kept the ball very well, and it looks like his delivery is quite good.

8~~~
Was excellent.

9~~~
Would be a waste to play him in the u21's all year again.

10~~~
He will definitely start any cup games for now.

11~~~
Hope to see more of him this year.

12~~~
Our best player today he put some very good balls into the box and was unfortunate not to get any assists.

13~~~
He looked really good when he came on the pitch. Apart from his technical ability, he looks like a tough little bugger as well. Hopefully he can kick on from this and get some appearances during the season.

14~~~
Probably even better in the middle of the park, behind the striker?

Wonder if he will be able to break through. It might happen if we sell ADM and not bring anyone as a direct replacement.

15~~~
Really impressed by him.

16~~~
Very exciting talent.

17~~~
He seems to have made that step up, I thought he was the stand out performer in the world cup as well.  He came on as a sub in the final and almost single handedly rescue them again but unfortunately fell short, but still looked the best player on the pitch.  There had been some questions about his decision making in the past but it seems to be improving, he looks sharp with the ball and showed good vision to create chances.  Really hope there is room in the squad for him as I feel a loan move would be too risky and could slow his progression.  He is easily good enough to come on as a sub in the league, imo.

18~~~
The kid is talented for sure, I hope he breaks through this year. He looks like he'd be perfect in a 3 man midfield.

19~~~
Reminds me of Coutinho, tidy little player.

20~~~
Don't forget, he's had a lot more football this summer then the rest

21~~~
Januzaj and Memphis playing just behind the strikers. Interesting formation. Memphis with his trickery and long shots ability and Januzaj being a natural no 10 and he plays better on the final third. 

Will be interesting to see if this the formation to go with for this season. I would have thought Pereira to be playing there but he is doing well on the left, with his trickery and (most) crosses and passing. Almost scored too. Certainly another talent to look out for this season. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

22~~~
Would like to see him playing more centrally, same with Lingard but he did very well and showed Van Gaal he can be also a good option out wide. Really like him! We don't really need diMaria or anyone coming for him if he leaves..

23~~~
He played on the wing?

24~~~
left winger

25~~~
So reading this pages I reckon he was good?<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

26~~~
He was on the subs for a few games at the end of last season so the manager obviously rates him. I think he and Januzaj will get a decent chunk of game time this season now we have a more balanced midfield.

27~~~
was one of the best players, showed good feet keeping the ball, creative and should have had assist, also confident to take set pieces..

28~~~
He seems determined to make an impact which is a brilliant mentality to have. It's one thing doing that in the U21s but another thing doing it in the first team. His progression this season will be exciting.

29~~~
I just hope he'll get his fair share of chances this season.

30~~~
Really liked the amount of pace he injected into the game. Was always looking to be direct and make something happen.

31~~~
I haven't seen him play much but thought he was good. Bright and tried to create.

32~~~
Very impressive performance.

33~~~
Had a good half and looks like he might be getting some playing time this season if he carries on performing on the tour.

34~~~
Looks like he should be competing for that attacking midfielder spot with Herrera this season.

35~~~
I dont know if he is ready to compete for that spot, he will certainly give some back up. Went to all his games at the U20 WC and he was inconsistent all tournament. He wasnt a starter and he didnt deserve to be. Did some fantastic things, did some absolutely awful things.  I really like him, think he has the chance to become a decent player for us but doubt this season he will be challenging anyone for a 1st team spot.

36~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8WrOthmIkyU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

37~~~
Would like to see him kick on, but he was excellent against MK Dons last season yet LVG still didn't play him again, give or take a few minutes against Spurs 6 months later. 

Hope he gets to feature because he has what it takes I believe.

38~~~
He really impressed me. I'm sure that performance will lead to us seeing more of him. Hopefully he'll get a reasonable number of sub appearances in the league and cup games.

39~~~
Seems a handful.  I thought he looked more dangerous than some of the bigger names tonight.  Really hope he get his chances.  Could be one for the future.

40~~~
I echo what everyone's been sayin about his performance - i thought he was superb.

He's got great balance & ball control in tight spaces. His distribution & body-movement / trickery, was excellent too.

Adnan really has to get the finger out this season, because this kid looks even more of a player than when Adnan broke into the team & that's not just goin by last nights game & gettin way ahead of myself, its from his U-21's & Brazilian U-20 team performances too.

Massive potential to be a quality player for us & he's very grounded also..

41~~~
I feel he should play Iniesta's role. Advanced to the left in 4-3-3 where he has freedom to either go out wide or influence play through the middle.

42~~~
I remember I said towards the end of last season that he's too good to be playing in the U21s and that showed even more so earlier today. 

He is so talented. He can play central midfield, number 10 or out wide. He's got great ability. I really hope he stays and gets minutes.

43~~~
Based on the first pre-season game of the season? I agree he was good but let us jot get too carried away. I will be glad if he gets the chances in the cup competitions and minutes off the bench in the league.

44~~~
Totally agree man..

45~~~
Didn't watch the game but just saw the video posted of his performance. He looks very good. I know he lost the ball a few times but the way he dribbles with the ball seems effortless and he seems to always know what he wants to do whites better than someone who just runs and hopes for the best.

Biggest plus point for me was the tracking back, liked seeing that

46~~~
Can't say I've seen him play much on the left, looked fantastic!

47~~~
Very good game from him, I really hope he gets some good chances with the team.

48~~~
We & the media all got carried away about Adnan & that was way too premature considering his general play last season. 

In saying that, i've more confidence in Pereira realising his potential than Adnan tbh..

49~~~
Add all his qualities goin forward with his tracking back & we've got a gem on our hands no doubt. He's pretty fast also..

50~~~
Very lucky he signed a new contract. Looks very talented.

51~~~
Strange conclusion to make, considering Adnan proved himself in big games when nobody else was performing while Pereira had just one impressive pre season game.

52~~~
I have hope for Adnan, but he's been average far more than he has been brilliant. If you take away the handful of games where he performed brilliantly in Moyes' year, a vast majority of his performances have been indicative of a talented youth player who is clearly not ready for the next level yet.

53~~~
Really excited by this lads potential. Hope he gets plenty of chances this season.

54~~~
He's had to work with 3 different managers so far, who all had a very different approach. This is not the ideal platform for a young player to develop, the fact our team has been experiencing a transitional period ever since SAF left, surely does not contribute to that. What I remember seeing is a very uninspiring United team out there under Moyes, which consisted of some big names who all failed to step up when they were supposed to. He did. I saw some impressive performances from him under Moyes and he was consistent that year with the exception of 1 or two games. Januzaj wow'ed me at times and was showing some incredible skill and maturity at times. His talent is undeniable but so has been his set back under Van Gaal so far. This and next season will be interesting to see how he will react. He had a year to adapt and the team is getting stronger and seem to understand the famous "philosophy".

55~~~
Fair enough, but my point is if he was as good as that run of form two years ago, then he would've been able to evolve a bit since then irrespective of whether it was LvG or whoever.

56~~~
It's all about opinion of course Manos, but Adnan to me has been much more <i>miss than hit</i> when he's been given a chance. 

I've a much better feeling about Pereira than i do Adnan. Adnan really needs to harden up for starters - Pereira looks like he's already got that bit of devil / toughness in him, that Adnan seriously lacks. 

Adnan seems to get intimidated far too much (even plenty of times in the U-21's) - whereas Pereira looks like a player that doesnt give a shit about the opposition tryin to bully him, he's strong mentally. I've seen Pereira play plenty of times btw & not just one pre-season game..

57~~~
Absolutely mate. I still have high hopes for him of course, but he's really gonna have to raise his game..

58~~~
Completely agree. Ever since I first saw him in the 18s it stood out how brave he was. He was getting kicked all over the place but it never stopped him showing for the ball and holding onto it when he had it.

He's a creative player but he doesnt shy away from a physical battle either.

When he's 23/24 he's going to be something special im sure of it.

59~~~
Reminds me of sterling ironically.

60~~~
Happy for him. Did very well.

61~~~
Hope that was a typo & you meant the currency?!

62~~~
Hasn't he come straight from the U20 World Cup? No surprise he looked sharper than the rest of the squad.

I'd like to see him getting games wide right as well as in the centre next season.

63~~~
More to do with being a quick dribbler and small.

64~~~
I think he is a more mobile and combative version of Mata.

65~~~
yeah probs I am getting carried away a little bit too much but he didn't look out of place at all and I feel he's that kind of teenager who with good players around him can shine no matter how little experience he has, he's so confident, can keep possession well which is a good start for him, and is really creative little player who is not afraid of tackling or tracking back, part of the game he developed recently and that's always rated by someone like LVG. 

Apart him Herrera and Lingard we have no one else with such tenacity about him in midfield, so I feel he could get more than cup games this season. Anyway I agree that we should slowly give him minutes through cup games first and slowly start to rotate him perhaps when we have comfortable home fixtures..

66~~~
Agree with this. He's definitely got a Mata vibe about him.

67~~~
Hard to believe he isn't a first team regular. He looked so good out there. Very exciting. Feel like if we sell di Maria we should just replace him with one of the kids. Feck buying some superstar

68~~~
Could be a breakthrough season for him, even if competition is fierce. 

Didn't watch the game last night, but saw his personal highlights and he was very impressive. Not sure whether it was under instruction as he seemed to hug the byline for the most part, but I think I'd still prefer him centrally. He's got tidy technique and decent dribbling ability, but not sure he's good for a wide berth, as he doesn't look like he'll be isolating fullbacks 1v1 and he would be restricted to do that often in his current role.

69~~~
Thought he was probably our best player. It is only preseason but hopefully he can impress LVG. Will be hard for him to break into the side but hes always looked a step ahead in terms of talent when playing in the u21/youth teams.

70~~~
Probably our best player in the second half. Really glad he signed a new contract.

71~~~
Looks like he's got 'it'. Would be nice to see him break through over the next year or so.

72~~~
One of the most technically accomplished performances I've seen in ages. The only thing that'll stop him is how much he wants it.

73~~~
It's nice that he's getting the opportunity to catch the attention of United fans en masse, but when you've watched them play their way through the youth teams it does always feel a bit like sending your kid off to their first day at school. Lots of excellent posts here about his potential and how we should try to give him his shot this season, but one unimpressive pre-season game and the thread will be awash with:

'Way too soon for him'
'People were getting so carried away with this kid after a couple of friendlies, he's not Messi ffs! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>'
'He might have impressed at a lower level but I don't think he has what it takes to make the step up, we need world class <i>now</i>, just buy De Bruyne/Flashinthepaninho.'
'Why does our academy not create top players any more?'
'He's no <i>Pogba</i>'

Etc etc etc.

74~~~
He looked great. I'v seen him for our U-21 but I think maybe the recent experience with the Brazil team  has given him more drive. He looks determined. I really hope that he goes on a proper loan (eg PSV as mooted) OR we really give him some quality time in the cups and as a sub occasionally. Wouldn't want to lose him through neglect..

75~~~
yea I think the same, he looks much faster all of a sudden and Brazil experience gave him more confidence I guess too, always thought he's a bit wasted on that left wing but he seems totally playable there now

Dunno about the loan, I think he would benefit from watching Sweinsteiger/Mata/ Herrera even Depay play here, he will be a good sub option and in cup games too

76~~~
Yeah I get the feeling that he will be kept around the squad this season to see if he takes his chances.

77~~~
First touch and agility are special. No idea what kind of player he'll become.

78~~~
Someone said on here earlier that he had a bitta Iniesta about him & i tend to agree, but he also has other quality characteristics - especially not havin any fear of gettin stuck in & his pace. 

He got booked last night too & it was a bittuva dodgy tackle from memory, but it shows he's got that bit of devil in him also & is very determined. That's what we want, coupled with quality football ability of course..

79~~~
Will be interesting to monitor his and Januzaj's progress this season.  Wonder if either will go on loan.  Wouldn't be surprised to see him surpass Januzaj in the pecking order of best young talent at the club.

80~~~
My heart says we shouldnt let him go on loan either. Let him train with our top players & give him games. 

His determination last night was a message to LvG to give him a chance & that's what we should do over the course of the season. There'll be plenty of games for everyone & more for the better young players.

I personally think he's too good to let go for a season, but if the club think a loan is better for his development, i'd run with that no problem - they know better than us. 

It would just be a big shame not to see him in a United shirt for a year though!

81~~~
Adnan's lost a lot of momentum from a couple of seasons ago & he doesnt seem to have gathered any aggression / determination, either. 

He's a soft-touch for the opposition in the physicality stakes & he seems to get psyched out by it all - even in a football world that has ref's protecting the special players..

82~~~
The thing that impressed me most last night is that Blackett was diabolical going forward and Pereira still had a good performance.  It will be interesting to see how effective he is with a better player going forward behind him if he we continue playing him on the left.

83~~~
We should use Pereira as an alternate in the midfield three, and build an in-house succession plan for the future. Carrick is no spring chicken, and Bastian will likely leave at the end of his contract, so Andreas should get a lot of game-time as the latter's long term replacement as the prime mover of the team, especially when Carrick starts to fade. He has a lot of qualities that lend themselves to a midfield architect role, rather than a more attacking one further up the pitch (where the competition might prove to be even higher with the presence of Memphis, Mata, Di Maria, Januzaj + probable future additions). 

He already has a great eye for the defense splitting pass, knows when to keep the ball and when to play the one touch football, knows how to dribble effectively from deeper areas, likes to get stuck in and doesn't shy away from tackles; the touch and precision while good is still a bit inconsistent, but will develop further over time with experience and proper training. In some ways he's like a younger, less refined version of someone like Deco who could go either way. 

If we could train him under Schweinsteiger, bring him along at a slow pace considering his age, and teach him how to control the rhythm of the game (something Bastian learnt in greater detail under Van Gaal himself), then Pereira has all the talent to be a special central midfielder for the club, and will start coming into his own at age 22 by the time Bastian packs up his bags at United. Perhaps Louis could completely Schweinsteigrize him under the guidance of the prototype himself ?

84~~~
Was he? Didn't see that myself. Not sure I can think of a single memorable error or loss of the ball going forward. He linked up neatly enough with Pereira when he needed to... it's just that he didn't bother going forward much.

Agree that it'd be interesting to see Pereira in front of Shaw, who will always look to overlap at pace.

85~~~
He has great ability. He can play brilliant as a central midfielder, a number 10 and out-wide. I hope he stays in the first team and look forward to seeing him more on the tour.

86~~~
Played well, good to see him taking his chance now he's signed his contract

87~~~
How did he do? I read an awful lot of comments on other sites about him basically nailed on to be world class in the future.

88~~~
I'd love to see him loaned out in the prem. Him and Januzaj need games to improve and get some consistent games at a high level

With potentially Depay and Young on the left and Di Maria and Mata on the right, and depth in midfield, their game time could be limited.
A full year of playing would do them a world of good, prove they can do it, and then next year we shall see

89~~~
Nailed on no. Possible? yes.

90~~~
The only thing Blackett contributed was a passing outlet who would recycle possession when Pereira ran out of space.  He didn't do anything else to support Pereira.

91~~~
I haven't seen a lot of him but he isn't really a left winger is he? I was under the impression he was a CM/AM, interesting that LvG played him wider. Although could be similar to the way Mata plays the wide role.

92~~~
He's very versatile. Plays on the wing, as a number 10, as a central midfielder and performs all roles at an exceptional level for the U 21s.

93~~~
I get a bit of a Thiago vibe when I see Pereira. He even has all the cute flicks and tricks, and in the last 12 months has really learned when to utilise them.

94~~~
Yes, i do as well.

95~~~
Strange that he went (and maybe it's just me) kind of under the radar last season, bar some nice moments in the reserves and a few appearances for the first team. When I saw the goal he scored in the U20 World Cup final it reaffirmed that this is one of the biggest prospects in world football. Think he will get a lot more opportunities this season and I can't wait to see how he does.

96~~~
He should have chances to play, no reasons to sign someone like Pedro disappeard since 2011

97~~~
He certainly looked as comfortable as Young out there which is promising

98~~~
Anyone can score a wondergoal to be fair, but I do agree that it looks like he has very good potential. Was impressed with him in our friendly.

99~~~
I'm afraid the video evidence does not support your view. There are 3 instances of Blackett overlapping in Pereira's 5 mins highlights video: 1 min 26 secs, 1 min 58 secs, 2 mins 21 secs. Blackett with the ball attacking the edge of their box 3 mins 51 secs and a good combination move from Pereira and Blackett moving up the field 4 mins 33 secs. And that's just the highlights for Pereira !

Watching these clips again, Pereira doesn't seem particularly aware of the overlapping fullback option available to him, or at least prefers to link with Januzaj inside him, so I'm struggling to see what difference it would make having someone else at leftback.

Pereira's best moment, when he shoots narrowly wide, comes from an attack down the right, when the ball eventually comes to him, though it was intended for either Wilson or Herrera close to the penalty spot. Hardly a situation where you would expect his fullback to be in close attendance.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h1OMm_NvoDg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

100~~~
Certainly should be our deputy Hererra this season.

101~~~
Yeah, I'd like to think he's in the mix for the attacking midfielder position with Herrera and Fellaini.

102~~~
I was thinking more at the 8, where I hope herrera is used thoughoutt he season.

103~~~
I'd think 2/4 between Carrick, Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin and Blind will be up for 2 spots in the midfield 3 and 1/3 between Herrera, Fellaini, Pereira for the attacking mid role, which sits on top of the other 2 in a 4-3-3.

104~~~
Good post. Blackett's no wonderkid but that doesn't mean people should be able to get away with slagging him off regardless of the performance. He did well against Club America, and certainly offered Pereira plenty of attacking support.

105~~~
The only thing that Pereira should do to improve and probably get more opportunities is to calm down on the pitch a bit... Seemed to be sprinting into everything, though the talent was obvious and he was quite composed with his passing and final ball. Really looking forward to seeing how he does this season for us though, and where he plays. Ideally he should be Herrera's back up as the creative midfielder but he wasn't bad out wide at all either.

106~~~
I didn't really consider that as a negative, quite the opposite.
With young players, you always hope they do their utmost to take their chance. It's something I've been missing sometimes in Januzaj's sub appearances for example. If you're given 30 or 45 minutes as a young player, you should make sure you've done all you can in that time. Part of that is sprinting for everything. Imo, we saw the 2 types of that against Club America. Pereira tried very hard, but was composed in his passing and technical ability. Wilson (of whom I'm a big fan) on the other hand tried too hard and did everything too fast. He was sprinting all the time, but didn't slow down to get the accuracy of his passes and link-up play right.

107~~~
This kid is going to make it here.

108~~~
Really liking the look of this guy. Interested to see how he'll do with more of the first team players.

109~~~
A stand out again for me, so comfortable on the ball, great run for his goal and a couple of nice dribbles, LvG has to liking what he's seeing.

110~~~
Fittest player on the squad due to U20s WC involvement and it showed.

111~~~
He's a player, this one.

112~~~
This kid is pretty damn talented. Really impressed by him tonight.

113~~~

114~~~
Praise indeed.

115~~~
Starting to take games by the scruff of the neck which is what Paul McGuinness said he hoped he'd start to do more regularly when he gave him the captaincy at the Milk cup a couple of seasons ago.

116~~~
He isn't a pussy when it comes to taking in brutal challenges or tackles but instead wanted the ball more. He'll make it here based on that alone

117~~~
He played as a nr. 10 or on a wing?

118~~~
#10.

119~~~
As I see from the posts he was good? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

120~~~
10

121~~~
Thats an understatement

122~~~
Yes, the star of the second half. Granted it was a poor half but he looked so comfortable and skilful on the ball, plus he got a goal.

123~~~
Thanks guys for the replies. 

So glad about him and about the praise he got from LVG. So what do we reckon, he'll be a deputy for Mata or Herrera at nr. 10?

124~~~
I think he can get games as a #10 or on the left of the front 3, he looked equally at ease in either role and was the best attacker on the pitch in both positions.

125~~~
If he continues to develop at this rate there will be no reason why he cannot make it here. I'd say at this point he has as good a chance as Januzaj if not better.

126~~~
I share the sentiment. Never really got on the Januzaj bandwagon and although i do realise the legit concerns about rating/comparing players so young. Perriera > Januzaj <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

127~~~
Pereira seems the real deal.

128~~~
Good point and something we should take into consideration when assessing his performances.

129~~~
I hope this will be the season in which LVG will give him chances to shine and step up.

130~~~
This kid has clever off the ball movement and brilliant vision, haven't seen much of his technical game, but he definitely has something of Scholes/ Iniestas awareness in him, he looks built for the senior team

131~~~
Whats his contract situation? Is he on a long term deal or are we in danger of being held to ransom again?

132~~~
Believed he signed a 3 year deal this January right?

133~~~
He just signed a new contract not long ago. Of course in typical Man Utd fashion his contract was running down but luckily he renewed.

134~~~
Signed a new 3 year contract at the end of last season I believe after flirting with Juventus for a bit

135~~~
I think he signed a new contract this year.

136~~~
It seems like he's very much intent on forcing his way into the team this season.

137~~~
Very good to see him play well, great goal too. No reason why he can't feature this season.

138~~~
I very much see them in direct competition as there's no way they'll be room for both of them in the first eleven.  

One of them has to go out on loan

139~~~
Pereira is younger so in theory he should be the one going out on loan but then again Januzaj would probably be more likely to get minutes if he went somewhere now because of his extra experience and bigger name. I reckon Pereira could very well get 15-20 games under his belt if he stays and he's just 19 so it won't be a disaster if he doesn't play all that much this season.

140~~~
he's got almost everything, good to see him getting on a score sheet with his header. He will get games next season no doubt about that as he's capable of playing several positions. But god please no more freekicks like that one

141~~~
Sounds really promising. How annoying would it have been to see Juventus take Pogba and Perreira

142~~~
Impressed with him. I won't go over the top until he performs in competitive matches though.

143~~~
He's a lovely player to watch. Probably as technically gifted as Mata, but with more about him athletically. If the PL were a less physical league, I'd be tempted to throw him in at the deep end.

144~~~
If he keeps playing like that on tour, he will start our first game in August I reckon. Just like Jesse did last year.

145~~~
Probably been said numerous times already, but this kid has "it".  He has so much confidence and creativity that whenever he gets the ball, you expect him to make something happen.  When Januzaj broke through under Moyes, he was electric but he relied a lot on pace and beating defenders with his agility.  Pereira is a different beast, I haven't seen such composure and attacking instinct from a young player in a long long time.  Also very handy to have a player who looks comfortable on either side as well as up front behind the striker.

146~~~
Im starting to think the 44 shirt has magic powers.

147~~~
Yes agreed. He seems to have a football brain on him too, which leads me to suspect he will turn into a fantastic player for us.

148~~~
Januzaj didn't rely on pace. Did you forget his passing ability, technique, and vision? All you have to do is look at Januzaj's pass against Southampton and Spurs and those are passes I have never seen Pereira do. I think some of you guys are going overboard. Pereira played behind the striker in 2013/14 and he didn't do well at all. Last season he played a bit deeper and it paid off big time as he did really well.

Pereira has excellent footwork which helps him shake off defenders and a good passer, although not too adventurous. I really like him as a cm, but I don't rate him higher than Adnan in the 10 position.

149~~~
What has Januzaj done recently (as in over the past 18 months) that lead you to believe he is better than Perreira ?

Sweeeeet feck all mate

151~~~
It's more that I believe in his ability as a 10 over Pereira. Pereira has been really great for the reserves, but so was Januzaj last season. It's only in the first team that he struggled and we have yet to see Pereira really kick on at that level. I think Pereira has great ability, but more towards a deeper position than the 10 position. I think rating Pereira over Januzaj at this stage is premature.

152~~~
i agree with most of this, although to be clear, pereira has been miles better in this preseason than januzaj.

153~~~
In the first game I would...

"Lads, it's Spurs... "

154~~~
I really hope he makes it here and gets a real chance in the first team, especially if Di Maria does leave.

155~~~
He does look rather special

156~~~
I wasn't trashing Adnan, don't get me wrong, I'm still a huge fan of the boy.  He has the talent but right now he will need to put his head down and keep working hard.  Bad form, confidence, whatever issues he has, he needs to get over it because right now whenever he gets the ball, I tend to expect a brain fart, you can almost tell from his body language that he's panicking as the opposition closes down on him and he'll rush and make a bad decision.  Pereira does not show these traits at all, he takes the pressure in stride because he plays like he is in complete control of his body.  I know its just a friendly, but against San Jose there was a moment he was challenged by two players but he managed to flick the ball past them.  That is not just skill but it requires a certain x-factor from the person to be able to pull off these moves with no time to think.  Hopefully we will see Adnan at his best again this season.

157~~~
Wasn't all that impressed. Looked good on the ball but had lots of time where he was invisible. Want to see him at CM as that's where I believe we'd get the best out of him. The talent is there though, that's always been clear for everyone to see.

158~~~
Awful slide. Looked good otherwise.

159~~~
I got to watch him at the recent U20 WC here in NZ. Thought he had a pretty mixed tournament with some great stuff and some poor stuff. He didnt start most games but to be honest I didnt think he deserved to.
Found this video from the U20 WC on youtube and like all YT video compilations you end up thinking he must have been the best player at the tournament. However what does stick out is his ability, its there to see. I especially love how he can use either foot for corners and free kicks.  I just hope we let him develop at a pace that doesnt ruin him.

160~~~
agree with this stack....

I wonder if Januzaj's progress stalled in part by sticking him in the side on a regular basis too soon?

being shifted around last season and poor decision making on his part are obviously big factors too.

With midfielders like we have behind him there is no reason why Pereira can't get plenty of cameo's next season

161~~~
Was bright again today. He must be in and around the first team when it matters.

162~~~
Looked very good again.

163~~~
Needs to add more goals to be a 10 but been very bright and creative. Looks like he'll get more minutes this season.

164~~~
His ability to keep the ball under pressure is a joy to see.

165~~~
He's pretty fast too, very interesting talent.

166~~~
Some very good stuff from him. Second goal and once when he refused to give away the ball in particular.

167~~~
this is the last thing to worry about..

168~~~
It is long term if he wants to become a regular starter.

169~~~
had a great pirouette at the half way line

170~~~
He's going to be class for sure. So composed on the ball under pressure, and so talented. Hopefully he gets plenty of game time this season.

171~~~
He's scored enough in the reserves.

172~~~
He's never scored that heavily tbh (bar Belgium youth internationals) generally it's been the odd spectacular goal rather then consistent scoring.

173~~~
A talent, he needs minutes to progress even if its on loan.

174~~~
It bodes well that he played well tonight even with his touches so limited. In the past he's struggled to perform in the rare games for our youth sides where we haven't dominated possession.

EDIT: Was surprised by his pace today too. I must have watched 90% of his games at United and he's never looked that fast to me before.

175~~~
Played a vital part in the second goal and had a couple of other moments of slick close control in tight situations, I really hope we get him plenty of chances this season.

176~~~
I've always been waiting to get serious game chances and the kid has impressed. As part of the group that came on late, he was vital to our aggressive counter-attacks with his passing and vision.

177~~~
Really like him. Hope to see much for this season

178~~~
I have been telling my mate about pereira for at least 2 years when he started putting in those performances for the acadamy. Glad he's maintained his progression to the first team - makes it all the more sweeter!

179~~~
Very excited about him. Will surely get his chances in the league cup this season. REally hope he takes them.

180~~~
Around 1:17..

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0l0y7OP3fX4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

181~~~
Thought he has looked really good on the tour. He has clearly built his confidence from Brazil and carried it on. Looks very composed on the ball and wants to make things happen. The only problem is the amount of people in front him, will prevent his chances unfortunately.

182~~~
It's been a while since we really unearthed a top talent (and kept him). I have high hopes.

183~~~
That music! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

184~~~
Yeah was awesome, I think this guy can be a big suprise for us this season

185~~~
He can control the ball, is great in tight spaces and can play the game at a high pace, very dynamic. Surely something that our other midfielders cannot

186~~~
To be honest that sounds like a good description of Herrera.

187~~~
Perhaps players shouldn't just be 'in front of him'. He's looked better than any other midfielder on tour. If that continues,  he must play.

188~~~
I said some time back in an argument on here that found him more talented than Herrera and I stick by that. He specific techniques are well above his age. Ball striking, his passing, he just has the goods. There's a absolutely no reason he can't or shouldn't reach the heights that Modric has reached. He's our own Thiago.

189~~~
He looks ready to me to make a big step up. In every game in pre season he's looked one of the two/three footballers on the pitch to whom everything looked more natural. I'm hoping, like Januzaj, he gets opportunities this year. Give him a home game early in the season given he's in good form right now.

190~~~
I Feel like he's the next "Breakthrough" talent from our youth team, i can see him as a regular next season as part of the first team squad and hopefully he can establish himself.

It Seems as if he can play such a wide range of positions from the 8, both wings, and the 10. Obviously nowhere near the level yet and he has a lot to do, but he reminds me a lot of his fellow Brazilian Coutinho. and if he can get anywhere near that level of consistency and productivity, we have one hell of a player on our hands.

Last point, the way he dribbles and carrys the ball forward, he has that undefinable "Danger" factor where regardless of what he does with the ball it looks threatening.

191~~~

192~~~
He's ambidextrous to the point of it being confusing if what I'm hearing is correct?

193~~~
Isnt he a different player to Modrić though?

194~~~
I think he took corners with both feet at the U20s World Cup.

195~~~
Yeah, he sure did

196~~~
Nope.

197~~~
How come. Modrić is a deep lying playmaker, Pereira is a more a nr. 10 or so called advanced mid.

198~~~
Precisely where Modric started earlier on in his career.

199~~~
He can do both, he played a deeper role for the u21 at times last season. Think he also played there for the first team too.

200~~~
Indeed, infact I think the Modric comparison is quite a good one.

201~~~
Hm Modrić played as a left midfielder in 4-4-2 in Dinamo, not as nr. 10 but I get your point, he was closer to the goal and was gradually moved behind.

202~~~
modric is a modern day playmaker. not a deep lying one like pirlo/xavi.  maybe periera could develop into that. modirc also started on the wings for spurs when he first joined them and slowly moved infield to play in the middle. at the moment he just needs regular game time either in the middle or on the left. lets see what he eventually develops into

203~~~
Exactly and the deeper Modric has gone in his career, the better he's gotten till now where he's arguably the very fines player in his position, in the world. 

I compare them cause they have very similar qualities. Technically very good without necessarily being elite, can keep the ball extremely well under pressure, can drive the ball forward when needed, works hard for the team, has an outstanding passing range. Something Pereira is better than Modric at is shooting from range. While the choice of the centre mid position has always been whether to play a box to box or a playmaker I reckon any team that values the ball more than defensive contribution would love to have someone with his qualities running the system. Given we have a dutch manager who preaches looking after the ball, Pareira will be perfect for the role.

204~~~
Is developing nicely. He's only 19 so hopefully he remains calm. If he get's 10 or so games this season then he'd be doing pretty well. Hopefully we get some good cup runs and maybe even win one of them.

205~~~
I dont think his passing is similar to Modric. Modric is very good at keeping the ball, Pereira gives it away too often even though he has the vision to create something

Other than that I can see it, but he'd have to take to learning the defensive side of the game like Modric has over the past 3 years or so

206~~~
Surprised how young he is. Always thought he was 21/22. Great to see. Hopefully he can provide cover for a few positions this season, and maybe develop enough to find himself in the starting line up a few times!

207~~~
He played deeper than a 10 most times last season and he thrived just like he thrived in that position during the Milk Cup. He played as a 10 in the Moyes season and he struggled. I don't think he's that dangerous as a 10. I often feel like he doesn't threaten much with his passing in that position and often times finds ways for himself to shoot. Further back he's able to operate with a little more breathing room to combine with others.

Of course his position changed for the u21s last season as did most players because the u21s always has a wide variety of players from the 1st team and older reserve players.

208~~~
I've not been one to watch loads of U21 games etc...

But I don't see the Thiago in him, myself. I understand why some might, but he doesn't look like a dictator or tempo-setter like Thiago, and his technique simply isn't as perfect. Thiago is more of a smooth player, a glider - which I wouldn't say about Pereira.

I actually think Pereira's very very similar to Herrera.

209~~~
Modric comparisons - not a bad call, he certainly has all the skillset which modric had when he was young. Pereira can develop into almost anything I guess. If he works hard on his defensive contribution ie taklcing and reading of the game he could be class deep laying playmaker. He showed he can drive the ball like Scholes, spreading it wide, the only concern is if he can maintain that level of passing over 90mins, he tends to make one or two mistakes like Herrera sometimes does so the usage of him further up the pitch is currently better once he refines his passing. 

For me he's great attacking mid, left sided b2b player with the ability to float around making runs having a go at goal and dropping deep if needed, not sure if Van Gaal will ever give him that much space to express himself but he certainly have a lot of skills in himself to play more adventurous role in the team. Him and Januzaj are pretty much the same in this, Januzaj could work like that even further the pitch as his hold up play is good enough and he's tall enough to eventually became some sort of striker but we will see. For now I don't think Van Gaal will give a chance to both players at the same time, which is a shame imo

210~~~
I'd say he's more Sneijder than Modric, he's potentially more of a match winner than a controller of games though he has that in his locker too. 

He has exceptional flair and technique though which differentiates him from these European giants we are comparing him too.. This could be his downfall as well as strength as he might not be trusted due to the mistakes he might make as he is a very direct player but at the same time,  he is a very unique player.

I think I'd prefer him in an Iniestaesque role in a three man midfield, freedom to go where he likes but starts out more left sided.

211~~~
All these people he's being compared to have superior technique. It's the basis of what they've become. I guess he's busy, like a young Modric, but Modric's technique at 20/21 was superior, tighter and more consistent.

He's still very good technically, and he's got flair, but in a Herrera kind of way, in my opinion. Not the smoothest and cleanest, in terms of controlling the ball and getting weight on passes, but (like Herrera) he can do a flick or turn that other, more perfect technicians can't.

I don't see Sneijder or Thiago at all. They both let the ball do the work completely, except for when Thiago goes on one of his runs. And, again, I just don't think Pereira's touch is tight enough to develop into a player who lets the ball do the work - which is exactly what I'd say of Herrera too.

Whereas that Ødegaard kid, for example, or Oliver Torres both have that tight technique that could see them become that type of player.

212~~~
Great player that should get game time, fitting him in is going to be the challenge, but he is certainly good enough, naturally gifted creative player with goals in him

213~~~
Not replacing the guy but he is made to compete with herrera IMO; one day i expect him to overtake him too.

214~~~
this is all getting a little too over analytical and a little silly. Boffins and train spotters spouting nonsense.

215~~~
His technique is incredible.

216~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

217~~~

218~~~
What's a Boffin and a train spotter?

219~~~
Herreras touch is basically flawless, definitely not worse then the ones you mentioned, don't think that's a fair example... Maybe passing wise, but that's more with Herrera's long passing as his short passing is really good as well. Its more the way he moves with the ball, more direct and with a purpose, not really graceful calm like the ones you mentioned.

220~~~
Herrera's is great. But Modric's and especially Thiago's is even better. No shame in that, though. He's definitely got a looser touch/dribble/pass than both. 

In contrast, that Odegaard kid, has a touch/dribble closer to Thiago's level.

221~~~
Sorry we don't all just drink the kool-Aid about him being the next Modric, or United's 'own Thiago', when he's clearly nothing like them. Especially Thiago.

222~~~
Tend to agree with you on this but I feel that Pereira will be aiming for a higher goal and assist output than Modric and Thiago. I see his future role as being closer to a Mata type player.

223~~~
I agree about the output. He's less tidy than them (no, this doesn't mean he's completely untidy, before somebody goes off on one) but more direct, more of a risk taker, and stations himself higher up.

When I watch Pereira, I see the Arsenal version of Fabregas, and a bit of Herrera. Two of the more direct post-Xavi Spanish midfielder. I know he isn't Spanish, but they make a good reference point.

A bit like both, he doesn't show the same desire to let the ball do the work. He wants to be busy, and make things happen with each pass.
Mata's the best finisher in the squad. Is Pereira's finishing to a high standard?

224~~~
He is a dead ball specialist like Mata and likes to take free kicks and corners, he also scores spectacular goals like Mata. I am not sure if Mata is the best pure finisher in the squad though, he doesn't really get in those positions too often.

225~~~
I think he looks a superb prospect, and I hope to god he gets some game time this season.

226~~~
Reminds me of coutinho most. He's got that low centre of gravity coupled with the technical skill which allows him to navigate superbly in tight spaces.

227~~~
Dont worry about it, sometimes I forget this is exactly what these forums are for and I type shite.

228~~~
Me too. His best attribute is his agility, like Coutinho.

229~~~
His best attribute is the manner with which he receives the ball. He can receive it  comfortably with any part of his body, either foot be it inside or outside. He knows how, when and why to receive it under pressure and does a superb job of it. He is comfortable receiving the ball at pace and equally comfortable travelling with the ball at pace. He has quick feet and plays with his head up. These things help make agility look even better. He can use either foot in any situation and generally chooses well when to do this. Not many players can deliver quality corners and crosses with either foot consistently. Hopefully he is going to develop into a very good player for us.

230~~~
Yeah, <a class="username" data-user="22707, @Stack" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/22707/">@Stack</a>, I was writing quick, but I basically meant agility in receiving the ball and turning away from markers. The two-footed thing will come in handy for sure, too, though I expect him to be inconsistent with his shooting and passing, which is normal for young players anyways.

231~~~
I know this is jumping the gun and possibly unrealistic but it would be pretty cool if he ends up in a few years time meaning we all forget about Pogba.  Pereira also appears to me to have a pretty level headed sort of attitude.

232~~~
I get <a class="username" data-user="76831, @RooneyLegend" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/76831/">@RooneyLegend</a>'s comparisons with Luka, they are similar but he reminds me more of Kovačić. Well of Kovačić of old, before he got lost in wilderness.

233~~~
Reminds me of when we compare cleverley to Iniesta, Xavi and Scholes <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

234~~~
That happened?

235~~~
Well, not exactly like that. But there was a period, in here, where Tom Cleverley, was not considered complete dog shite. I know it's hard to believe, but he was really showing promise in his performances.

236~~~
He did and I remember that. I think with him it was his lack of confidence that prevented him to be a good player. Of course he wasnt as talented as first thought too.

237~~~
Certainly more Luka than Kovacic for me. Kovacic is made of the technical material that very few players are ever made of. The ball is 'one' with his body.

238~~~
He's similar to them. He appears busy because of how he's currently being used. Play him deeper and ask him to control our game he'll pass it about and make the ball do the work.

Technically he's not on thiago's level but I don't know a centre mid(no 8) who's on his level. Wouldn't say he's all that inferior to Modric in those stakes and imo is ahead of herrera.

239~~~
fs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

240~~~
Yep, to be fair it was only in relation to style.

241~~~
Yes.

242~~~
haven't seen a great deal of him until this pre-season and I must say I am impressed how athletic and quick he is.

very excited about him.

its a poor reflection on Moyes that (by all accounts) he tried to convert him into a number 6

243~~~
Schweinsteiger = DM
Herrera = AM/CM
Januzaj, Rooney, Depay = Striker x3

?

244~~~
No he didn't

245~~~
Sexy as £uck right there.

246~~~
Why would you say something like that when you clearly haven't got a clue? He's never really played as a #6 at any level. He dropped back into a more controlling #8 role in the U21's but I don't think he's ever been seen to be the base of a midfield.

247~~~
Never happened. Even if it had, Moyes wouldn't have had anything to do with it.

He did start playing a little deeper but only by merit of his starting to take responsibility for controlling the game. He was still very much a #8 or #10. And it worked, too.

EDIT: Or what Joemo said.

248~~~
Strange dig at Moyes.  It was probably one of the reserve coaches that made him play deeper, probably Joyce, to teach him responsibility and to better read the game.  He used to lose the ball a lot and made poor decisions, and I guess it worked.  I watched him last year and I watched him this year, I'm amazed at how much he has progressed.  I think he might have broken the invisible barrier.

249~~~
He actually played as a 10 during Moyes' year at United and he didn't do well at all.

250~~~
He consistently played better in a deeper role with the reserves.

251~~~
Well this is first time I've seen the lad. Nice tidy player.  He's VERY pretty too!  Beckham mkII?

252~~~
Great technical ability and would like to see him more central...

253~~~
Probably our best player in the second half.

254~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's shocking isn't it how the young ones have come on and got right in the opposition's faces. Deserves to start ahead of Young against Spurs.

255~~~
Feck experience.Let's start him vs. Spurs.

256~~~
Created more in his first 20 minutes than the two senior wide men did all game, but faded once Shaw was removed and that link was lost. Clearly he will need to play centrally to really flourish though,

257~~~
He's a star waiting to burst onto the scene. Can't wait to see more of him next season.

258~~~
I thought that was his worst performance on tour yet he still had some good moments. His crosses were good. Poor free-kick over-hit towards the end.

Probably the best performer on tour. No-one else managed to match his consistency.

259~~~
Darmian and Memphis probably the closest, but I'd agree. Between them 3 for our best player on tour. Memphis has looked good in every game so far whenever he's received the ball, albeit was quiet vs Barca. 

Hopefully Pereira gets plenty of game time though, would add a lot of creativity which we lack.

260~~~
We played a 10 in the 11, and an 11 in the 10 that second half. Really don't get the manager at times. Certainly at least try them in their preferred roles?

261~~~
We will have enough new players starting against Spurs. We need the core of the team that beat them last year.

262~~~
We would still have Mata who was the core to that win.

263~~~
If we want to play Darmian, Shaw, Depay Schneiderlin/Bastian, We need to have the rest on, too many changes would be risky.

264~~~
He looks great. Runs himself into trouble a bit at times but that will stop as he develops further. Glad we got him tied down long term.

265~~~
I'm no expert, but the more I see the more I like him.

266~~~
Have to say this sort of thing always baffles me. Fans are so restricted and blinkered in their thinking and with respect to players and positions, especially young players.

267~~~
Agree with this.  I dont mean anything against anyone but its this type of experimentation that made clubs like barcelona & bayern give up on van gaal; only to later praise him. 

As such,  i am willing to give him time to try things out because that not only keeps every match interesting but there is almost a recorded transcript of performances under different formations and tactics. 

I mean we have a winger/forward now in mata who cuts in on his left foot.  Thats a position that mata might not be the best at but it's all based on team work &  knowledge of one idea.  

Players in their strongest position doesn't nessaserily make us a stronger team.

268~~~
Excited to see such a young talent coming through! Makes me more happy to see him playing than watching a new "Galactico" coming in

269~~~
He needs to be involved this year.

270~~~
Nobody is saying he shouldn't try things on pre season. That said, you don't sign a top with German and not even look at him on the wing. 45 mins in the centre,  one game here, one game there - that's fine. But not even 10 mins in the only position Memphis has really ever played as a pro is wrong to me. Van Gaal seems too determined to try and reinvent football for my liking.

271~~~
Start him vs Spurs, I don't see any point in playing Young.

272~~~
Impressed me on this tour. He really wanted to show what he's got and most of the times, did it. Great technique, good crosses, confident, trying to make things happen. Definitely has to get some games this season. Great talent and exciting to watch.

273~~~
absolutely spot on. means far more to have a guy like pereira come through who clearly wants to be at united and fight for his spot than some mercenary like di maria or falcao.

274~~~
Is it fair to say LVG knows everything Memphis can do on the wing, he doesn't need to see it in pre season. He will now know if he is a valid option in the AM spot, or whether we cannot rely upon him. Same way I see it with blind really in the CB spot. If we do continue with it into the season that's when I will worry.

275~~~
Fair dues, although according to reports today he'll continue with Blind against Spurs.

276~~~
It's a tricky one but for all we know, LVG could be playing a massive curve ball and trying to trick Spurs. 

Knowing LVG though we will be sticking to his Crazy master plan <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

I wouldn't even mind if we played a 343 with blind carrying out the ball, but to use him as a CB mainly because he can pass well, it's pretty risky.

277~~~
That's true.

I do keep comforting myself in the knowledge that surely, LVG must know what he's doing more than I do? That is very likely to be the case in reality, although if it wasn't, it also wouldn't be the first time the pros got it wrong.

But yes, footy seems so simply from my red leather sofa. (my sofa is really fabric, but it is red <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>)

278~~~
Exactly how i see it.  Depay is playing centrally because thats where he is the weakest/ with ability to improve.  Its especially true since on the wing he cuts in to these positions he has been playing in.

279~~~
Like the look of him, hoping he can get some minutes this season.

280~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjTu3jjmgQs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

281~~~
His contract renewal may prove to be the signing of the year - huge talent. Hope he sees a lot of game-time this season, as he has massive potential. A future star in the making.

282~~~
another great performance, all of a sudden he looks more nailed to feature than Januzaj and Wilson.

283~~~
I would play him instead of Young in the LW position.

284~~~
I would probably start Young there for the beginning of the season, but would make it known that Pereira is very close to taking the spot. Should definitely get minutes off the bench in the first few matches anyway.

285~~~
Hope he gets more sub appearance to start up with.

286~~~
He will be more productive than Young over the course of a season, as would Lingard.

287~~~
I highly doubt that. So you think a very inexperienced Premier League player, playing in a position that is relatively new to him, is automatically going to be a better player than one of our best attacking players last season.  Quite stupid really.

288~~~
Young managed 2 goals, 5 assists in 23 starts and 3 sub appearances in the PL last season. His defensive work was far more impressive than his modest attacking productivity. If I could get Squawka to stop crashing, I could tell you how many chances per game Young created; from memory, it was nothing remotely special. It is not unrealistic to hope an alternative option could offer more than 7 g + a in 23 starts.

289~~~
Agreed, the consistency wouldn't be there for Perieira but 7 goals +assists in more than 20 starts is pretty poor. It would not be surprising if a talented kid could match those numbers or better them in the same amount of games.

290~~~
I agree Young didn't put in a special performance last season in terms of end product. But is Pereira going to be any improvement over Young in that position with our team lacking pace in general? When play is stretched, a winger need to cover a lot of area and while Pereira has good acceleration, he doesn't seem to possess winger kind of speed, wouldn't that be a bit of problem for a winger esp when Mata on other side is same? Wouldn't he be more suited to be tried out in position where Memphis played in pre-season where he played in second half against San Jose in pre-season and even got a goal? 

I am genuinely excited by his potential and am positive he's going to get lot of chances this season considering LvG played him in all games including PSG.

291~~~
On the contrary, it is 'stupid' of you, in typical caf fashion tbh, to read a post, and then answer the one that you would like to have seen as opposed to the one that is actually written. Ashley Young had a great influence on our play last season, something that the youngsters may not be able to replicate immediately. This is why I didn't say they would be 'better'. At the same time, one of our 'best attacking players last season' managed what, 3 goals. Yes, I believe that would be bettered by either Lingard or Pereira if they played the same amount of games, as they have a far greater goalscoring instinct. Ashley Young is not a goal threat, Lingard, particularly, is.

292~~~
It doesn't effect anything. I doubt peirera, playing a different role than he is used to and playing football at the highest level for the first time is going to produce more. It could be possible but I highly doubt it, Pereira does not stick out to me at all on the left wing against Psg because he has to facilitate plays rather than playing like an inside forward. If Pereira was playing in his favored CAM position or furtherst cm up the pitch then I would agree with you.

293~~~
I'm thinking he has earned coming off the bench against Spurs like he did last season.

294~~~
You don't think he'd beat 3 goals from the left all season? He'd probably score at least one free-kick for a start.

295~~~
If it was from the right I think he is more capable. When he played there against San Jose, his off the ball movements looked really good and he looked quite goal threatening. When he plays on the left, he is the one who has to put crosses in or put in some decent through balls, much like Ashley young does as well. It is just pre season. So hopefully we can see back centrally where he really produces imo.

296~~~
Disappointed we haven't seen him yet. Has he even been on the bench?

297~~~
Did you really expect him to play? We have very good options in midfield, will not be easy for him, especially now at the start.

298~~~
I am also quite disappointed he hasn't made it into the reckonings. Seemed to have caught LvG eyes over pre-season. 
But considering he haven't played many first team matches yet into his United career and the disastrous start we had last season, LvG is perhaps right to start with proven or at least some one with some experience at top level this season. I think he may play in the UCL qualifier this week though if we are able to wrap up the tie around mid-second half.

299~~~
Well he showed more in pre-season than Januzaj and he got an appearance so I guess I did expect to see him in some capacity. I am not even sure he has been on the bench though, which is even more surprising.

300~~~
He was on the bench vs Spurs

301~~~
Yeah but Lingard was promising too in pre season. Thats not how it works though. I am sure van Gaal would play him if he would think that he is the right guy for this or that game. 

Wasnt he on the bench against Spurs? I still think next season he could attack properly, for now his games will be limited, unless he can take his chance if given and establish himself.

302~~~
OK then, thanks.

He was more promising than Ligard I felt, plus he is the more highly rated player at the Club. He may still appear in the next few games anyway. I'm just disappointed he looked almost our best player in pre-season and didn't get a go before Januzaj.

303~~~
I'd like to see him too, but I don't think it would be wise to throw him on when we only have slim 1-0 leads against Spurs and away to Villa. If we're leading by two goals against Newcastle and he's on the bench I'd expect him to come on purely because he's earned it in pre-season (Obviously he could've been poor in training the last few weeks though). If we're comfortable after the first leg of the qualifier he could play a role in the return leg too.
When's the Capital One Cup starting?

304~~~
A bit late to reply but we have Ipswich in the 3rd round.  I expect that to be his first start.

305~~~
Hopefully with Adnan gone he gets a chance in the 10 role. Think he's ready to impact this season. Looks to have he hunger and appetite for it as well as the ability.

306~~~
So who are we loaning him to?

307~~~
Maybe LvG has singled him out as the one he's going to give chances to instead of Januzaj and Wilson.

308~~~
lvg doesnt like brazilians booom tchakalalakla

309~~~
He sits on bench for a year and then goes on loan.

310~~~
I think this will happen. Tbh so far so good these past few days in my opinion,  things are looking interesting squad wise.

311~~~
Ah but he has the Belguim card up his sleeve.

312~~~
Why is he not going on loan yet?

313~~~
I can't agree, I like Martial's potential but loaning/selling all these players and not getting in some much needed proven quality in attack, while also losing our world class keeper and replacing him with a flappy muppet keeper, is not good at all IMO.

314~~~
Personally I didn't think Wilson or Januzaj were going to add anything of great quality to our side, DDG needed to go and whilst I would loved to have done Martial deal earlier as well as bring in an experienced head, at least something has been attempted.. it might be a complete disaster but I would rather take a punt then just keep the squad as it was. I would love a last minute cheeky bid for Stones now.

315~~~
my nearly had a heart attack when I saw this bumped....thought he was off.

316~~~
Do you think Martial will add a tonne more than those 2? Given he is roughly the same age and will have to get used to the league. However regardless of that we need depth, we are threadbare in attack so I can't see why we'd get rid of more forwards. As for De Gea, he should have been either properly man managed or we should have done the deal 2 months ago and got a proper PL suited keeper in, this last minute stuff has left us with a keeper that is no good for the league we compete in. I'd rather a last minute move for Griezmann or Reus, we need another forward more than anything.

317~~~
I think he will yes based on the little I have seen from him. With Januzaj and Wilson I was not convinced, with this kid.. will he make it? I don't know but I'd be willing to take a gamble on someone who might come good than someone I was fairly certain isn't up to it. Agreed on the keeper issue and tbh I was not convinced with the Griezmann rumour, he doesn't strike me as the big fast striker we need.. he's another technical type who would exacerbate our possession obsessed problems. He's a souped up Mata and I think we need bit more pace and physicality. Reus would be fecking awesome.. maybe we can get him next summer?

318~~~
I like Martial as well I just don't think we needed to loan out Januzaj when we are short of options and in 4 competitions, unless we have another player coming in. Griezmann is faster and can beat a man, I think he'd play Mata's role with a lot of the zip he lacks. As for Reus, well we have 24 hours left, he's the kind of player that can change a seasons prospects.

319~~~
His time to shine this season?

320~~~
Or his turn to get shipped out the way things are going <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

321~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> Surely not.

322~~~
He been sold yet?

323~~~
Of course he'll go. Anybody who still thinks he, or any other youth player that isn't already Messi by the age of 18, has a chance is deluded. 
We get rid of them and buy replacements of the same age and level for £30m, that's how it works now.

324~~~
He'll be going out on loan, he hasn't been on the bench and it seems unlikely that will change.

325~~~
i hope we keep him, would be sad to see him go on loan.

326~~~
Get a grip.

327~~~
Hope he gets an opportunity soon.

328~~~
We'll see.

I'm just not bothering to get excited about youth products any more.  Those days are gone, for now at least.

329~~~
I hope at least he'll get some chances now after Januzaj was loaned out

330~~~
24 players in the first team squad now. Every chance I think we'll see him at some point.

331~~~
That would make me happy. Question is where he would play. Maybe Herrera goes to the right midfield with him behind Rooney or on the left

332~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Man alive.

333~~~
Probably in the #10 spot or out wide I would think.

334~~~
With our new streamlined squad, there should be, at the very least, opportunities for him to play in the domestic cups. He looked promising on tour. Hopefully he will take full advantage of the opportunities that he receives

335~~~
He looked a lot better than Januzaj from what I saw.

336~~~
Interesting a loan never seemed in the offing for him, maybe LvG rates him higher than Januzaj after all.

337~~~
In our current system Memphis-Herrera-Mata seem to be the 3 starters behind the 9. I'd say Young and probably Fellaini are the next 2 and then it's either Martial and Rooney both playing or Pereira. 

So, I would think he'll get a good few games, especially since Herrera may have to play deeper with Carrick and Schweinsteiger being old and oft-injured.

338~~~
Now we know why he signed his new contract. He knew. Looking forward to the next step into first team action.

339~~~
Hope he can get some chances this year.

340~~~
he looked not only promising but best and most consistent performer on tour. Surprised he didn't get a sniff in, one bench appearance is not enough for such talented young lad, couldn't do worse in one of those games when Memphis was near to shit (almost every EPL game)

341~~~
Hope and think he will get chances especially as Januzaj and Hernandez (in the past few games we've seen him come on and Rooney drop in to the number 10 so this frees up some competition also) have gone. Was impressed with him in preseason - I thought he was the best of a younger stars (Januzaj, Lingard, Pereira, Memphis e.t.c) in preseason.

342~~~
I guess with Pereira, there's also a believe that he can play with the first team on occassion but still develop a bit more with the under 21's.

343~~~
Out wide if Young struggles, I think. Or as the 10 when Herrera is out, now that Januzaj is gone.

344~~~
Really hope he starts making the bench, at least, now that Januzaj and Hernandez are gone.

345~~~
Apparently at that event LvG and Giggs did the other day LvG tipped Pereira to benefit from Januzaj's loan by getting more minutes, hopefully we see him soon.

346~~~

347~~~
Was really impressed with him in pre season and i honestly thought he'd have gotten a good few minutes by now but there's no hurry. Id like to see him on the bench though.

348~~~
Saw this as a possibility as soon as Adnan moved. We really have made the squad very light now, and it eminds me if when Fergie sold the likes of Ince and Kanchelskis and brought the kids through. There is certainly room for the young players, especially in attacking positions. They are not just there for Capital One Cup, the size of the squad is such that we are actually counting on them for a contribution, and I for one am very much looking forward to it.

The size and make up of the squad is nice and lean. From here on, you would like to think any gaps will only be filled by young players and genuine top class additions.

349~~~
Good.

350~~~
Really glad to hear that.

351~~~
basically best and most consistent player on tour, also surprised he made only one bench appearance for us since the beginning of the season but it will change I guess since Adnan's gone, wouldn't mind playing him from flanks either.. he can be basically a bit more pacey Mata, he doesn't rely on speed, he's got great footwork in him and wicked cross with both feet.. Hopefully Jesse will get a chance too, not writing him off yet

352~~~
Van Gaal actually mentioned that Lingard would get chances as well at the same event

353~~~
Great bit of news. Hope he takes his opportunity with both hands and feet and helps his development

354~~~
Just seen his little brother instagram and a picture of them two together with the caption "WITH THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD" Quite cute.

I think he has got potential to be a top player.

355~~~
So I see he's a serial killer...

356~~~
looks like a jihadi wife.

357~~~
he played a cameo with the olympic team against france this week and instantly made the team better, no idea why the coach started with basically 4 wingers and no organizers..

358~~~
Van Gaal said he got injured in International duty

359~~~
Yh heard he was very good during the week. Also heard F. Anderson impressed.

360~~~
Got injured at the wrong time.

361~~~
I was more impressed by the french striker and Rabiot.

362~~~
He's in the Olympic [U23] side? That's pretty impressive, looking at the Wiki some of the players are pretty good... Felipe Anderson, Rafinha, Fabinho etc. Looks like he's the youngest in the side too. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

363~~~
Van Gaal said only he returned with an injury, but I'm still hoping that doesn't mean he is injured for tomorrow. Real chance for the kids now.

364~~~
Does anyone know the extent of his injury and for how long he is out

365~~~
We really need to put him on the bench to improve our options. Hope he gets his chance against Ipswich.

366~~~
Is he back fit ?

367~~~
He was training and with the squad yesterday.

368~~~
he's going to be a starting 11 player in a few months. we need ideas. Mata let me down today.

369~~~
Could he play on the right? What's his pace like for that sort of position?

370~~~
he is good on the right, at least at reserve level. I didnt like him at AM position but when ever he played deeper or on the right he was very good.

371~~~
That's good, we are desperate on the right side really so he could well get his chance.

372~~~
he really should get his chance(along with Lingard), at least as sub as ours subs are even more depressing then our offensive game.

373~~~
I would be more excited watching a kid who's eager to make an impression rather than bring up someone who will be certain to bring almost nothing different to the table (Fellaini).

374~~~
I would like to see him given his chance.  Today instead off Fellaini would have been appropriate.

375~~~
would be a great option to bring off the bench and even start some matches

376~~~
Hopefully he will be fully fit soon and get some minutes. He's very good with the ball so once we take the lead he will help us keep the ball

377~~~
Given our other "options" a case could be made for him as a starter because honestly speaking he would offer more in, in an attacking sense, than what we have had from Mata, Fellaini and Herrera so far. We need something from that right side to ensure that the pressure on left will be lessened, at the very least. He is a young player so we shouldn't be expecting him to carry us but with even with the expected inconsistency he could still bring more to the table by simply being faster in his decision making and having the ability to go past a man. Same goes for Lingard and we do know that Lingard can score goals too. Surround Rooney with these young guns and if they sink rather than swim then go for a right sided attacker in January.

378~~~
I'd like to see him given a chance, if anything it will show the other players if they don't perform their place isn't guaranteed.

379~~~
If Riyad Mahrez continues his form through to January, I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if we went in for him, especially considering he would be able to play in Europe too.

380~~~
Agreed, Fellaini for example doesn't even play the same football than rest of the team, while Mata and Herrera don't really run with the ball or try to score.

381~~~
With the alarming lack of attacking options yesterday, you're left with the impression that Louis doesn't think the young players are ready. And I trust Louis on this.

382~~~
If he can't get a look in now, with such limited attacking options, then I do worry about his chances of making it.

I mean, surely he's a better option then Valencia? Surely?!

383~~~
Tony is a RB. So I don't think it's Tony keeping him off the bench. He should start against Ipswich.

384~~~
He came on as a winger yesterday....

385~~~
Relax. I know you're as melodramatic as it gets but there's a long, long time to go in the season and there is very little cover. If Mata/Young/Valencia continue to not perform when asked to, Andreas will get his opportunity soon enough. I can honestly see him having a mini patch of form like Ander did when he first properly made it into the squad last season.

386~~~
The boy starts, so happy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

387~~~
Very pleased to see him start! Hopefully he takes his chance so he'll get some serious minutes this season.

388~~~
Delighted to see him start!

389~~~
Delighted to finally see him start. Hope he takes his chance well.

390~~~
Disappointed to see him start.

<span style="color: #ffffff">too much positivity in here.</span>

391~~~
Basically needs to be MotM tonight, he won't get many chances to shine so now is his moment....good luck lad!

392~~~
Come on lad, take this chance with both hands.

393~~~
Gooooooooooooooooal!

394~~~
very nice free kick

395~~~
Super freekick around the wall into the corner. Keeper had no chance

396~~~
No chance for the keeper, thrilled for the lad!

397~~~
I really did not expect him to make that freekick. He used to be pretty good at them, but I felt that in the past year or so he wasn't scoring them as often.

398~~~
Knew he would score today!

399~~~
His goal:

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eP9Bdj1pM7U/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

400~~~
Beautiful free kick <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

401~~~
Yes boy!!

402~~~
Boy's a star

403~~~
Yeah just came in to post that. He's got it all it seems.

404~~~
I really like him. Such a positive player - always trying to play in forward and find advanced spaces.

405~~~
Had a shot saved towards the end.

406~~~
Fits right in with the philosophy too. More than Januzaj.

407~~~
He was impressive tonight. Hope that he will get some minutes in the next few matches. Wouldn't be against playing him instead of Memphis for a few matches and see how things go.

408~~~
Knew he'd make an impact today. Good stuff.

409~~~
Happy for the kid, hopefully he can get some burn in a league game here and there as well.

410~~~
He has it.

411~~~
Hope he gets a few minutes against Sunderland.

412~~~
If he could have scored where their goalkeeper made a fantastic save....shouldn't be too greedy though

413~~~
Players have different styles, they both have great potential in their footballing ability, no one is better or worse, the issue with Januzaj is he's at the right time to develop and sitting on the bench getting very limited game time will not help, U21 is not an option for him as he has out grown, Pereira on the other hand has got time to develop with limited game time with the first team but will be a regular with U21.

414~~~
Very pleased for Pereira. It was a beauty of a free kick. That goal, and that performance, will do his confidence the world of good.

415~~~
a bit wastefull in the first half but he tried things, we lacked the edge. Overall he was very promising, released two great shots, a couple of good crosses and scored a beauty from freekick while being tidy in possession when needed + one nice crossfield pass. He deserves at least from the bench appearance. Very pleased for him.

416~~~
Great performance and goal from Pereira tonight. Looked really sharp. Hoping he gets some minutes in the league soon.

417~~~
Or as impact sub instead of Fellaini!

418~~~
Played is way into the game and kept showing confidence on the ball even when a couple of things in the first half didn't quite come off for him, getting on the score sheet will be a big boost and he might have had a second if not for that cynical tug back.

419~~~
Expect to see him at least on the bench a lot more now.

420~~~
Played v well glad he got his goal. He is deadly with set pieces. Hopefully he will get more minutes as the season goes on.

421~~~
Where did he start?  I'm guessing on the left wing?

422~~~
LW, ended up as CAM after the third sub..

423~~~
Can't wait to see him on C5 highlight show later. Wanted to see him start but stuck with shit streams that wouldn't work!<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

Hoping he gets more minutes this season as well.

424~~~
Is it just me or is he a good crosser of the ball?

425~~~
We need to start including him in our regular matches. He's an impact player without a doubt.

426~~~
I've got far bigger hopes for this lad than I do for Januzaj (which is not a dig at him). I know it's early days but he just seems destined for big things. Hope he gets some more minutes against Sunderland.

427~~~
Hopefully he's included in match day squads now. It's annoying/strange that he hasn't been involved yet but maybe now he will be. Great goal and I will be massively disappointed if he doesn't make the bench vs Sunderland.

428~~~
Not bad for your first start lad.

429~~~
Of course he is. I would say that after Mata he might have the best ball technique in our team.

430~~~
He's been injured apparently.

431~~~
He's the best dribbler in our squad. Saw that from pre season.

432~~~
Van Gaal said there are no injuries.

433~~~
He got one small injury after the international break that's it. He was only injured for the Liverpool game.

434~~~
'It shall be difficult for him'. fecking Van Gaal.

435~~~
We should try him as a sub for Mata on the right wing, given that he can play there and in midfield he's a good bench option to have.

436~~~
Caught Ipswich by surprise with the free kick. The players in the wall thought Mata would take it and didn't jump.

437~~~
The feck does that mean?

438~~~
I'd like us to try him in the PL instead of Memphis. Memphis hasn't shown much in the league.

439~~~
I'd start him on the right with Memphis on the left and Mata behind Martial against Sunderland.

Zero chance that happens though.

440~~~
He is also better defensively than both Mata and Memphis.

441~~~
To be fair he said that in respect to competing against Depay, Mata and Young which is a fair comment as they haven't done much wrong. Don't think this means he won't get his sub cameos.

442~~~
From the start of the season I have wanted this kid to at least have a sub role this season he has the quality to change a game but LVG doesn't take any risks at all unfortunately.

443~~~
No way was he the man of the match tonight. Decent performance and a great goal but has a long way to go yet.

444~~~
LVG is fecking weird sometimes.

445~~~
More potential than Januzaj tbh. Excited to see him actually get some games from this point onward.

446~~~
No he's not.

If you watched the interview it made perfect sense.

It was classic dampening expectations by a manager, done to protect the player (as well as lay the gauntlet down to him), and also to respect the players in his position who haven't done a lot wrong to lose their places yet.

447~~~
I really think you'd find it hard to debate that LVG isn't weird. He's nuts.

In this instance though, it seemed weird to me without any context from that post. Was the interviewer hyping Pereira up? I doubt a guy who's been absolutely nowhere near the team is now expecting to be a regular. It seems unnecessary to immediately extinguish that hope with a seemingly negative comment.

448~~~
It does make sense, he's also made fairly similar comments when questioned about Memphis and Martial too. He's not one to praise individual players.

It was a brilliant free kick, it threw the goalkeeper off because I think everyone was expecting Mata to take it.

449~~~
Fergie used to do the same thing, it's pretty textbook. Praise players who are under fire, be noncommittal about players who are getting hype to avoid contributing to it.

450~~~
He's shown plenty. If you want to swap him for someone, Mata is the obvious candidate. He's not producing those creative moments like Memphis, and more importantly he and Pereira are similar in that they're specialist #10s playing out wide, without much in the way of pace (although Pereira isn't quite as glacial as Mata.) If you swap Memphis out for him that leaves <i>both</i> wings without any directness, wide play or pace.

451~~~
There's something about him. He just seems to have star quality.

452~~~
I've been saying that he needs more chances to play and I'm glad he didn't do anything to harm his chances for more playing time. I honestly believe that if he gets enough playing time this season, he'll perform well enough to start for us next season.

He's the sort of player that always raise his level of play and perform like he belongs no matter what stage he's on.

453~~~
What the feck is signing Martial and playing Blind at CB then.

454~~~
Check out the post match interviews. Answering a question about what's next for Andreas said he it will be difi competing against Mata, Memphis, Young and Fellaini for position.

455~~~
what does difi mean?

456~~~
difficult

457~~~
He will be competing and well it will be difficult, but I still hope he keeps getting a look in.
I love Pereira. I have been really looking forward to this game. I did not feel his performance was an 8. For me he was a 7 and that too cause of the goal. I see a lot of people raving about him here, was he that good?
Or, am I expecting too much?
I really want him to be the first backup for the 3 in our 4-2-3-1 formation.

458~~~
Januzaj is only a year older and I think his potential is still sky-high. 

But yes, fully agree that hope this leads to more match time for Pereira. The thought of him anchorong a side with our other bright young players...<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

459~~~
He was MOTM for me.  He did drop away for periods but the fact that he was propelling our attack with so many experienced players around him was impressive.

As much as I like Januzaj, Adnan has always looked green to me from when he first played with the senior squad.  Perrera gives me a different impression.  It will be interesting to see how all of this plays out because they are competing for the same role in the team.

460~~~
I kind of like when managers don't play younger players together with each other. Giving someone an opportunity within an experienced squad helps them show what they can bring to the team around other good players, otherwise the wholesale line up changes feel more like carnival atmosphere where a player might get lost.

That said, I'd be very surprised if both him and Wilson don't become first team regulars. If Welbeck and Cleverley could nail down places, these two are much better.

461~~~
Can we try him on the right?
I thought he was our best attacking player in the Ipswich match. Lots of movement, running with ball, passing and shooting. Our whole system looks better with this type of players on the attack 3. How about that:

That maybe unfair to Mata who has been doing well so far. But we seriously lack balance on the right side with Mata playing there. Pereira offers lot more movement and tempo to our overall attack play, which we lack.

462~~~
LVG has known Blind for many years so he knows him in and out and knew he would work at CB when we all thought he wouldn't may have been a risk to us but it obviously wasn't to him. And Martial was a future signing according to LVG.

463~~~
You're sure about that, mate?

464~~~
Think people are getting a little carried away. It was a good performance, but not a great one, especially in the first half. And it was Ipswich Town. I think he'll get some cameos in the league and should play every game in the Carling Cup. Long term, the jury is still very much out.

465~~~
Agreed, he looked very raw to me. Solid fundamentals and executed at a level you'd expect from a young guy trying to break into the team. A good basepoint to start on, man of the match.. Probably just a token gesture.
He looks quite undersized to play an inside forward role, I think his natural position is at 10 isn't it?

All in all a good little hit out for him and definitely put his hand up for some sub appearances.

466~~~
Yh I have seen the interview. It was a standard response.

467~~~
Van Gaal said in the post-match interview that Pereira practices on free-kicks every week. Pretty interesting, I hope we will see more of them this season.

Edit: Apparently he and Mata have practiced this exact set piece. Certainly seems LvG wants to slowly groom him into a first team player, I am sure they don't waste time practicing these kind of stuff for fun.

468~~~
No doubt, he has an amazing stop and turn and made space a few times, though that is just a 20 year old defender from Ipswich and he didn't look to try any other ways to beat him. Can only play who is infront of him though, hopefully he gets onto the bench for a few epl games and possibly make some cameos throughout the season

469~~~
Really? He has been quite bad in most of the matches.

I think that Pereira should get some chances if Depay continues playing like this. And Pereira looks far more threatening that Young who seems to have gone back to his previous form (not that of last season).

470~~~
Nothing weird about what he said.

471~~~
What he said is intelligent. It keeps Pereira grounded but also reminds me if he wants to play, he will have to our compete with these lads. Nothing wrong in saying that. With such a small squad, there will be plenty of rotation with only a handful of key players. Pereira is doing well. I like that we now how a number of players who can switch play. It's still early days though

We saw what happened to Adnan, and though he'l probably come back - you have to do it week in week out otherwise the team suffers

472~~~
This season Mata has 6 starts on the right, with two goals and two assists. Seems like hes producing plenty to me. He has sadly become a target on the caf. He's certainly played better overall than Memphis. Personally i'd be tempted to rest Memphis, hes young and has had an up and down start. A game on the bench would do him no harm at all.

473~~~
Was good seeing us end the match with Memphis left, Matial up top and Andreas in the 10. A glimpse into the future perhaps. I think that Martial, Memphis, Andreas and Adnan will share 3 of our 4 main attacking slots in the future, although I don't see them being the first choice 4. I still suspect that we will add one big money attacking player in the next year or two, who may be the one to take us up another level. I think one is all we need though, our young 4 are good enough to make it, then there is Wilson too, although I don't suspect he'll last here in the long run.

474~~~
He had a great game but in the first half he made some wrong decisions, on 2 or 3 occasions he shoot when he should pass the ball and I remember at least 1 occasion when it lead to opposition counterattack. This is not a criticism but just observation why he still needs time. But yeah he played great especially in the second half. It was the right match to introduce him and to learn about playing in the first team. It was clear that LVG talked to him during half time because he improved in the second half. I am sure that LVG will talk to him after the match what he did right and and more importantly what he did wrong so he will learn a lot from this experience.

And just a comment on LVG observation on his display. He said all the right words, he praised his display and also made sure that he will not be to disappointed if he is not picked in the next few matches. TBF LVG also said about Martial that he will need time, that he is one for the future, that he will have to compete, etc. Pereira has to compete with Mata who scored 2 and assisted 4 in 10 matches and with Depay who scored 3 and assisted 4 in 10 matches. This is a great output for a wingers even if their performances were not always the best.

475~~~
I love watching him play. He's so reminiscent of Coutinho right now with his drops of the shoulder and feints infield. A lovely, lovely player to watch. I still feel his best position is as a slightly deeper player though, as a 8/10 hybrid. Which would allow Mata (long term Januzaj) and Memphis on the wing positions and Martial/Rooney and eventually, Wilson to share the load as the 9.

I think the potential we carry in those front positions is very, very good indeed. It might take a little while for them all to bed in but that is a front four which is so adaptable and open to interchange that it'll be the best in the league. Better than City's even (with KDB and Silva preferring the same spaces, I can't see how they will not make City predictable - the fact they still need to play Navas, despite his shortcomings, to keep the width and provide the space to Silva/KDB says it all)

476~~~
Oh on. We already have Herrera and Fellaini for that position and we don't even play it in our system!

477~~~
He's extremely talented but he needs an identifiable position. He's been here for a few years now and I still can't really work out where he is best placed going forward.

Centrally, I would imagine. Like Herrera and Fellaini, however, I think he's an awkward cross between a central midfielder and an attacking one, which isn't a natural fit for this Van Gaal system.

478~~~
I think in the long-term we'll see that formation being played. Maybe not until one of Schweinsteiger or Carrick retire, but I definitely see it happening nonetheless.

479~~~
He has good pace over the first 10 yards which means he can do a job on the wing. He's very adaptable. I wouldn't be worried about finding him a position just yet.

480~~~
It is nothing wrong with that he don't already have his preferable position as long as we know where he can do the job. So far judging from pre-season matches and yesterday match he can do the job on the wing so I would keep him playing there especially when he has the best chances breaking Into first team in that position.

For example Sterling played for Liverpool on the wing, and in the number 10 and 9 position last season. It is nothing wrong with that as long as he play and develop.

481~~~
I disagree. He is a total footballer and a dead ball specialist, he can occupy all the similar sorts of positions to a Mata/Silva tpye players.

482~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

483~~~
He did scored 3 and assisted 4 in 10 appearances and decided our most important match so far. Yes he didn't always played as good as we expect but to say he is terrible is a step to far I think. You will have a hard time to find wingers who produced more this season. He is still young and adapting to a new team and new league but he showed so far that he have a lot of potential.

484~~~
Premier League stats?

485~~~
People are to obsessed at looking just Premier stats since the other games are usually just as important if not more. For example LVG will probably rather lose 2 in the Premier League then lose a tie against Brugge.
It only works for people who want to paint a biased opinion as a right opinion.

486~~~
Thought he had an average game apart from the free kick. Pretty sure Lingard could put on a better performance than that if played on the left. The talent though is clearly there. Techniclaly he's amazing and his specific techniques are also quality. Hopefully we don't spend to much time using him where we currently and actually play him in midfield so he can develop into one of the worlds best in the position.

487~~~
He should be dropped in the league IMO. He can't handle the pace and Pereira deserves his shot.

488~~~
As much as i agree that Pereira deserves the opportunity i really don't agree with your evaluation of Memphis.

489~~~
He looked mediocre to average apart from the free-kick on the left and anyone who thinks he should displace Memphis from the main team sheet has lost their minds.

Frankly I thought he should been featured on the right or his natural position as a number 10. His best performances I have seen have come their because it allows him to be a much more direct player instead of continuously trying to cut back and look for a cross. No doubt this guy is a talented player, I just want the LVG to stop putting him on the left, that is Lingard's best position not his.

490~~~
So because Pereira looked better against Ipswich in the League Cup he should displace Memphis in the Premiership because Memphis is only good against Brugge in the Champions League.

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

491~~~
Memphis needs to bulk down IMO. In the Premier League players get tight to you very quickly, he turns too slowly and is too slow off the mark and that is where the problem lies IMO. I bet you that he will be bulked down by the club.

492~~~
Am I the only one who want to see him as the number 8 instead?

493~~~
Yep, he seems to have taken the whole Akinfenwa style bodybuilding thing too far. Young players should be lithe and nimble, and slowly mature with age, all the excess bulk might inhibit his movement and flexibility in the long term. Doesn't need to be like Giggs or Robben in terms of lean mass per se, just a bit less bulbous.

494~~~
Still a risk at £35 million.

495~~~
I said it even before we signed him. He's not coping well in tight spaces cause his reactions are slower than you'd expect. Also for a player termed as quick, he's looked a little slow over the first ten yards. I am sure the club will be working on him.

496~~~
"Bulk down."

RedCafe has new terminology.

497~~~
He was great yesterday. 

But am I the only one who thought he looked better when he was slotted in the middle towards the end? Every time he got the ball he turned and looked for a positive ball upfield. Great to see from a player that young.

498~~~
Not in this system, I think he'd have the same inhibitions Ander is having playing there in it.

499~~~
That's certainly his natural position. Who knows if he'll ever get to play there though?

500~~~
Yes, he was much better in the No. 10 position.

501~~~
Was it No. 10 though? It looked like he was playing in a 3 next to Fellaini with BFS in behind.

502~~~
No. He does better in that position for the youth teams. I'm sure that would also be true for the first team.

503~~~
Van Gaal said in the post-game that he can play as a right-winger, left-winger, and #10, so I guess only time will tell. Personally I think he has looked best in a similar role as Mata but on the left, a deep-lying winger that drifts into the middle.

504~~~
I think anybody who watched him fairly regularly at youth level wants this. He's much better dictating it from deep than playing as a #10 and almost being forced to create something special every time he receives the ball.

505~~~
Well, I'm not sure. But it looked like Fellaini was playing next to Schweini to me. But to be honest, I wasn't paying too much attention to that.

506~~~
A Schweinsteiger/Carrick, Andreas and Ander midfield three would be lovely jubbly.

507~~~
I don't think that he is ready to play in our midfield just yet. In our system it is the most important position and this is why we decided to buy Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin both proven midfielders. If he get into the first team it will be on the wing or in the best case in the number 10 position with 2 holding midfielders. I know everybody want 4:3:3 from last season back but we moved on and i think it was the right decision.

508~~~
bulk down <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

509~~~
Great game for the lad. Looked confident, composed passing and touch and a very calmly taken free-kick. Hope this pushes some substitute appearances for him in the coming run-in.

510~~~
Should get a cameo against Sunderland as well, they're piss poor at the moment. If not him then at least Wilson should get some first team opportunity.

511~~~
With Young playing LB, I expect him to make a number of sub appearances over the next few weeks.

512~~~
Looks more like a central player to me. Don't think he's got the attributes of a winger. Probably a CM in the future, similar in style to Hearers.

513~~~
That's because he actually is a central player, he can play deep too.

514~~~
Nearly spat my coffee out reading that term. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<i>"You want to lose some weight?"

"Aye, bulking down."</i>

He possibly is carrying a little too much for a 'winger' but I don't think that's what he is.

His main issue is confidence in taking on his man. His speed and acceleration is fine.

Caf attracts some pseudo-experts from all over. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Pereira looks decent though and he should get some minutes.

515~~~

516~~~
He will have a great career here. His dribbling ability and pace over 10 yards makes it difficult for me to not see him being successful.

517~~~
I've put him to come on as a sub today. Will be great to see him. Hopefully we can kill the game off early, in order to bring him on with a good amount of time left.

518~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63CPCY8jOBc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

10:16 for his short spell centrally.

519~~~
Says it all that an individual highlights video is nearly 12 minutes long. They're usually about 5.

520~~~
Love it if he came on for Rooney right now. One can dream.

521~~~
Van Gaal doesn't seem to giving him chance, does he? Yes he played last game and was one of our best players but when you look at today's game. Memphis was calling for being subbed for Pereira at the half time, was easily a good time to give him the chance, also could get a chance to come on for Rooney who in the end had a very good half, but the game was over anyway..

522~~~
Ideal circumstances to give Pereira 30 mins but LVG would rather use experienced players instead. Could have started him in this match and made a change if it wasn't working out.

523~~~
Yeah didn't really get why he didn't come on instead of Young, we might not have as perfect a chance to give him some Premier League minutes for awhile.

524~~~
A bit sad he didn't even get a sub appearance today.

525~~~
Should have come on for Martial really, we need to protect our strongest asset. I can understand why he didn't though, he probably wanted that record.

526~~~
I thought he was a bit tentative but worked hard defensively and made a good run on one of our counters. He'll get confidence from getting the nod for the last 30 minutes in such a big game.

527~~~
Encouraging that LVG is willing to risk him when the stakes are so high. Pereira's actual performance was fairly ordinary, though we were playing very poorly in those last 30 mins.

528~~~
Deer in headlights stuff.

529~~~
Didn't really understand his defensive duties and was a weak link. Good lesson for him though.

530~~~
He seemed a bit out of his depth. I'd be playing him against the weaker sides in the league and in the cups, he's not ready for champions league football yet.

531~~~
Disappointing really, but everyone else on the pitch was utterly woeful in that last 20 minutes or so, so it would have been pretty tough for him.

532~~~
Pretty bad performance, but the whole team was all over the place at times in the second half so understandable.

533~~~
Poor sod couldn't have been brought on at a worse time this whole season so far. Best ignored, this one.

534~~~
He came in at an absolutely wrong time when we were defending deep. Well at least now we know he's not strong defensively.  I hope he gets to start a game or two soon in place of Depay/Young.  Depay needs a rest.

535~~~
Came on at a bad time but those 20 mins can be very helpful for mental development

536~~~
funnily enough i think he did a great job when defending. Personally i couldn't ask for more.

537~~~
Agreed. Some of the comments here are madness considering he was brought on when we were under the cosh.

538~~~
I have read what people are saying Perriera last night i have to say i disagree with critical opinions. He came on when Wolfbsurg started dominating possession and we sat back. Perreira offered a lot support to Darmian. I was very pleased with his performance.

539~~~
Worked hard defensively, didn't have a central midfield to support him once Bastian went off.

It will give him confidence playing over 30 minutes in a huge game for our season.

Still think the gap between him and Memphis is too big to consider starting him just yet.

540~~~
Agree. Pereira couldn't keep the ball for toffee last night. 

It didn't help that the rest of the side fell to pieces when he was introduced. Still, he showed he was green at this level. Nowhere near the sort of composure Martial has.

541~~~
Looked completely off pace when he came on

542~~~
To be fair not even most veterans have the composure of Martial.

Thought Pereira did his job alright, not the best we can expect from him but when we are breaking you can see that he is making runs into space and asking for the ball, which is always a good sign from a youngster.

543~~~
I'm not saying he did a bad job. He was on fresh legs and he ran hard for the cause, but he isn't as good defensively compared to Young (for example). It's just an observation, not a slight on his performance, since we all know he's much more of an attacking player than a defensive one anyway.

544~~~
Lost the ball a lot and put us under even more pressure. Did try to track back as much as he could but not to much effect. As long as it doesn't dent his confidence it will be a good learning experience.

545~~~
Well of course he isnt as good defensively as Young...... What he lacks is simply experience. Being as good as young defensively will come with experience. What he does have is all the basic building blocks of a very good player, all he lacks is experience. Some in here dont seem to understand that.

546~~~
He didn't look ready to be introduced into a high pressure situation like that. Especially one where our backs were to the wall and we weren't composed enough to be building up our normal possession based attacks.

547~~~
Let's have it written in cast iron that for the rest of his career, Andreas Pereira is poor defensively!

548~~~
He did himself no favours, unfortunately. Was presumably brought on to give us a bit more composure and accurate passing after Depay tired but ended up repeatedly giving the ball away. Which will have really pissed Van Gaal off.

549~~~
He did well, but unlike others I don't think that he has a futur as a #8, I prefer him as an attacking midfielder or inside forward.

550~~~
He was terrible. Poor decision to bring him on.

551~~~
Strange time to bring him on really. We was under pressure before, not sure what LvG though inexperienced 19 year old was going to do.

552~~~
I can't remember who else was on the bench? Fellaini? Might have been a decent option actually. We were hoofing the ball away a lot and he could at least have held it up in their half. That and win some defensive headers.

Feck it, though. I'm pleased he got a game. We can't moan about the kids not getting enough chances, then moan when one finally does get a chance. He'll learn from it. All good experience.

553~~~
we know what a inexperienced 19 year old can do (Martial), why shouldn't LvG give the lad a chance? He played well in his last game for us.

554~~~
You're probably right about van Gaal being pissed off, but he will hopefully take some responsibility for throwing Pereira into a game he wasn't ready for. Fellaini would have been a better option in that situation. 

At least he's giving the lad chances and showed a lot of trust to bring him on under those circumstances.

555~~~
Because of the way the game was on an edge. No way is he going to influence that game. We had much more experienced players struggling to get a foot hold in the game. To expect that of Pererira is a tad unfair I think, and it showed.

556~~~
Probably wanted to sub Memphis anyways and since Young was needed in defence Pereira was the only option for his position. And i disagree, football isn't always easy and the sooner a youngster learns it the better, good for his mentality.

557~~~
And you have to look at what LvG was seeing too. What was Depay doing to influence the game? Nothing and deserved to be replaced, Pereria is a great talent and there is no way LvG would have no idea he would be as ineffective as Depay, but at least he had the balls in such a big game to trust in youth. I'm not concerned about this swap at all, and if Schweinsteiger stayed on the pitch, perhaps Pereria would have been able to express himself better. As it happened the whole team went to shit and sat back defending, so it seems a little harsh to blame the lad for playing shite when no-one in the team could string two passes together at the point he came on.

558~~~
Thing is. Memphis had a mixed game but was still one of the most dangerous players on the pitch. I'm sure he'll learn from it as he'll be bollocked for being so sloppy.

559~~~
I thought Memphis was still one of our better players. No idea why Schweinsteiger was subbed either, another questionable substitution for me. I think the subs helped the opposition more than they helped us actually.

The point about the team going to shit is why I thought Pereira sub was a strange one. I don't think he's going to make a difference to that team at that time. I'm not blaming Pereira for anything, I'm blaming the manager! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

560~~~
I think Memphis was taken off to give him a break. He was one of the players that looked like he could need it.

561~~~
I thought Memphis had a terrible game if I'm honest, so I don't share the same opinion with you on that and I was happy to see him subbed.

562~~~
Why with Memphis is always polemic?

563~~~
Memphis was terrible IMO.

564~~~
Exactly.

565~~~
Admittedly, I have seen little of Perreira but he is defentivelly not a #8. #10 or a inside forward as you said, that much is obvious.

566~~~
he was, he has been for a while.

567~~~
I agree.

thought Pereira looked nervy.

568~~~
Coming on at a difficult time when the team was on the defensive. Unfair to judge him on this performance.

569~~~
I think it's unfair to to criticize him  for this performance. He did well.

570~~~
Kudos to lvg.... Had some balls to bring on the kid at that particular time. Much needed experience that for andreas

571~~~
I thought it was borderline stupidity in an important game like that to bring him on. Wasn't the time to give him much needed experience, we needed someone who already had the experience!

572~~~
Who else would have came on for a very tired Memphis. I don’t think it was stupid. I respect that he gives these kids a chance. Especially in this kind of manner. Gives them such  a boost of confidence I think

573~~~
LVG shows he rates him by putting him in a difficult period. Wolfsburg were going to hunt for a goal which meant he had to be ready on the defensive end but, also brought on to exploit the space they would likely leave. I think he was found wanting a little on both sides and no shame in that, there will be other games that's for sure and needs to be ready for the next one.

574~~~
Damn fine question, wish I knew where this came from. I was in the Memphis thread earlier today and you would think he went on a rampage and killed several fans family members. I came over here expecting the same lashing out on Pereira only to find that it was everyone else's fault he didn't play well. 

I think he did alright given the situation he was put in and am thrilled LVG made the call to put him on. I thought Wolfsburg targeted him (or at least that side) immediately, had a little success but he fought through it and eventually they gave up and tried AY to see what they could do there. I am sure the kid was shitting his pants and was more worried about making a mistake that cost the team a win than really focusing on trying to do something when on the ball. Just like Memphis, the more he is put in these situations the more it will help him grow as a player.

575~~~
Cpuld it be that when we first signed him so many in the transfer thread were acting like we had signed the next Messi?. From that we end up with some sort of backlash?.

576~~~
Well, I guess if the expectations were that he would come in and be our Messi then I can see where people come up with seeing him as, as one poster put it, a "clumsy brain dead cnut". Not sure that I feel that is fair to Memphis though, or any young player for that matter.

I think both Memphis and Pereira are going to be integral parts of this team for a long time but it's going to take some time/experiences to get there. And I hate to keep saying this because I feel like I might be alone with the thought, but the entire team is still getting their chops down, learning what the manager expects of them, learning what each other likes to do/not do and are showing glimpses of putting things together. But to expect to throw a bunch of guys on the pitch and have them perform flawlessly is unrealistic and to point at any one player and say they are the one that are holding things back is a bit rash imo.

577~~~
I'm bemused at this too. Some on here expecting instant success from all our players, and to be fair those who are on £250k/week and have years of experience playing at a top level I agree with, but knocking the kids? Does anybody remember how bad Ronaldo was in the first few months with us, and allot of people were calling for him to be dropped too, but SAF stuck with him.

578~~~
He'd have been a far more inspiring introduction than Fellaini or Valencia, I can promise you that.

579~~~
Yep. A pity he wasn't on the bench. Could have been a straight swap for Depay.

580~~~
Behind Lingard in the pecking order now?

581~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

582~~~
Van Gaal has just said Lingard is competition for Mata on the right. Andreas is more of a #10 (well, a #8, really) who when played has featured on the left.

583~~~
... i don't get it. i'm confused. not even on the bench?

584~~~
Hopefully has another solid impact on the match.

585~~~
Delighted he's got his chance, seems like he's playing in Herrera's #8 role.

586~~~
Our best player in the first half his passing in particular has been very impressive.

587~~~
Done pretty well today so far.

588~~~
He's class, should be seeing more of him in League fixtures.

589~~~
Which was his best role for the youth teams.

590~~~
Can we all agree he's been our best player so far?

591~~~
You can see why, his range of pass is great and he is really nimble on the ball. Reminds me a bit of Cazorla actually, who is very two footed.

592~~~
Yes, but that's not saying a lot. The standard has been gash.

593~~~
Only player that has turned up, we should give him more chances.

594~~~
Fellani for me.

595~~~
Blind edged him out. Marked really well apart from the one Kike chip attempt and damn near set up a goal with that long ball to Fellaini.

596~~~
Lingard has been on a similar level and Smalling has been as solid as ever.

597~~~
All I want is to see him together with Herrera on the pitch sometime. It's not much, is it?

598~~~
Lingard has been OK, not the most difficult game for our r defenders, Smalling hasn't done anything extraordinary. Poor game overall tbh.

599~~~
Definitely among our better players. Tracked back and did well on the left too.

Only one to score a penalty as well. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

600~~~
Hopefully we'll see a lot more of him this season. Brilliant talent.

601~~~
He will become a very good player.

602~~~
I really do like him. Hope he plays a lot more.

603~~~
He defo deserves more minutes with the the first team. Would like to see him playing alongside a settled first team.

604~~~
I really like him as a player. He is positive on the pitch, not afraid to take players on or play a more difficult pass to create something.

605~~~
Get him off the wing and have him playing centrally from here on out. Not even worth the effort to just give him minutes shunted out where he is least effective.

606~~~
His performance is pretty much the only positive I'm taking from that game.

607~~~
Should be ahead of both Carrick (on midfield) and Memphis (on the wing) ihmo and it's not just a knee-jerk reaction from this match.

608~~~
Ditto. 

Would like to see him given a chance on the left and Martial put back upfront.

609~~~
In my eyes he's just moved up the pecking order. Should be competing for the starting XI

610~~~
I thought he got better as the game went on, looked tired by the end understandably but I think he'll have went up again in LvG's estimation.

611~~~
also great penalty scored, showed vvery good composure and maturity taking it, unlike the three most experienced players who completely messed it up... He showed he can be a good back up for Herrera, his name almost sounds the same and he plays the same game most of the time...

on top of Herrera he's got a great shot and some neat dribbling skills but he's still overall weaker than Ander but it will come and he can get minutes in my view at expense of Roo and Memphis...

612~~~
He's gotta be above Memphis in the pecking order after tonight. Looked very composed out there and I was impressed with his fitness levels - he was still trying to make things happen right up to the last minute. For a young kid it's impressive that he didn't fade despite playng 120 minutes.

613~~~
Deserves the game-time Fellaini and Memphis are getting.

614~~~
He's class and seems to have a great attitude to boot. Gives his all on the pitch always, and has bags of ability. Not afraid to get stuck in. Honestly, think he might be our most promising player after Martial. Have followed him for a few years now and thought he'd make it big and he's only getting better. Considering our lack of creativity and underperforming players in the attack, he should probably get more game time now like lingard has been getting as well.

615~~~

616~~~
He should be rotated with Herrera. Deserves first team game time.

617~~~
Should Rooney get benched while Martial gets time up front as a result, he should be patrolling the left flank. Regardless, he deserves to have his playing time out there.

618~~~
My favourite thing about him is how hard he worked to get the ball back, he was busting a gut at times pressing and put in a few fantastic tackles. We all know how good he is on the ball but he can really get stuck in as well. Was probably our best player imo and he deserves more playing time.

619~~~
The way he picks up the ball and moves it around reminds me of Scholes. But the game has changed massively and it's rare to see kids break into the side these days.

Seems very talented but he must surely be getting concerned about his lack of game time - his 20th birthday is coming up and, unless I'm mistaken, he has made only one Premier League appearance in his entire United career?

620~~~
Very impressive last night. He has generally played well every time he's been involved with the first team.

621~~~
Don't see the Scholes in him. He reminds me a lot of Herrera actually. But with a bit of added attacking gloss.

622~~~
Pretty good comparison. But he also has incredible stamina.

623~~~
Needs to play more.

624~~~
Surely, the most logical thing would be to start him on the left against Palace, with Martial upfront? Looking at the current form, there's no one ahead of him in the pecking order. What are the chances though...

625~~~
Offers more than Rooney but LVG does not have the balls.

626~~~
I would start Young personally but if not Young I hope it's him or Lingard. Pereira was struggling toward the end of the match with cramp too so I think he'll probably be a bit knackered.

627~~~
I wasn't at all impressed with Young's cameo last night.

628~~~
I don't think he did anything wrong and he came on as a left-back.

629~~~
In a perfect world he would start the next game, but in Wayne's world he barely makes the bench.

630~~~
A fecking travesty of he isn't on the bench the next game.

631~~~
Thought he played a good game last night. It was a difficult game for him because the forwards were not playing well and it was a relatively disjointed display but he showed plenty of energy and enthusiasm, and actually tried to make things happen. Might be a little tired for Palace game though but should start some premier league games in the future.

632~~~
Even if it means he is in the starting 11 <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

633~~~
Think having young tracking back is going to be more important against Zaha. Their only threat really is down the wings, so if we can stop that supply we should be ok.

634~~~
I meant if he isn't in the squad at all.

635~~~
I know, it was a tounge in cheek comment

636~~~
He creates a lot of time on the ball for himself. Good quality to have.

637~~~
Pereira on the left, with Ander centrally and Martial up top would be very exciting to watch. Over the course of the season and the pre-season (not that it counts for much, but still), these three are the ones who have provided us with attacking impetus in an overall laborious setup. Andreas' sample size might be minimal, but he plays with hunger, and has shown more than enough to merit a start over some of our other attacking options. Same goes for Lingard, who has looked vibrant in recent weeks, even came close to scoring both yesterday, and against City. Start them all against Palace, atleast try to change things a bit, and make a deliberate attempt to play up tempo football.

638~~~
He has the Spanish-type controlled game that should thrive on van Gaal's possession philosophy, and he has a good shot on him. Could be our best 19 to 21 year old prospect after Shaw and Martial. Probably needs time for physical recovery and will not play at Palace.

639~~~
Lingard was our most positive player for me. Pereira it seems was instructed to cross the ball to Fellaini at all times but I think he did well otherwise

640~~~
Love to see him play, but im a little bit worried where he will end up. As we both have Januzaj and Pereira competing for #10. And both of them even tough capable, aren't good on the wings due lack of speed.

641~~~
Pereira is an #8 long-term.Despite his look he's quite tenacious defensively.

642~~~
One of the very few positives from last night. Thought he looked quality.

643~~~
I am pretty convinced that he needs more gametime and we should look to integrate him into the starting XI.  He was by far our best player last night and took full advantage of his chance.  I don't think we're winning any trophies this year, so I would rather we focus on getting the young players settled in the team.

645~~~
Thanks for the post.

646~~~
He reminds me of Thiago so much.

647~~~
I think the league is there to be won since nobody is great right now, but I agree we should be playing as much youth as possible. It's not like Pereira is going to do much worse than some of the more experienced options.

It's why dropping Rooney is so paramount. He's probably going to start another 30 something games and that could instead be starts for Wilson up front or Lingard, Pereira or Memphis out left or as the 10.

648~~~
A lot disagree but I see it too. I think it's the general ease he has on the ball - even when it's picked up deep or within the proximity of many opposing players. It's the sort of trait Thiago is excellent with.

649~~~
I hope van Gaal gives him some opportunities in the league now we're out the cup because based on those two performances he deserves it.

650~~~
He missed a few chances, overhit many crosses and was trying too hard to create something. But what a well taken penalty. He was quality and did much better than most of the senior players. Definitely needs more playing time. Really excited to see his progress

651~~~
Does he have any chance to get into the team during the next weeks? Did LvG say anything about him?

652~~~
In an ideal world he'd go on loan to a team that plays good football at a good level and come back ready to play regularly. I think he'd be brilliant in a midfield 3, he's creativeand technical. Have high hopes for him but I don't think he's ready to be playing on a regular basis for us yet.

653~~~
One of the few players at the club that can make something happen.

654~~~
I think we could do a lot worse than give him 1 or 2 starts over the next 5 fixtures.

655~~~
Might get some games during the Christmas period if the schedule is unforgiving. Otherwise if Herrera is clawing for game time I do not see any big minutes for him unless LvG does the sensible and rotates Rooney.

656~~~
Fellaini's out with an injury, I can see him coming on in the 60 minute mark and get Fellaini's slot.

657~~~
i thought we had no furhter injuries?

658~~~
Is he? I thought LVG said that there was no new injury news.

659~~~
Might not be injured but no Fellaini confirmed.

660~~~
Hopefully he can get some minutes today.

661~~~
Would like to see him come on for mata or lingard at some point today. One of the few in our squad with great dribbling andoads of creativity. Tends to look for a man when crossing as well, instead of just putting it in.

662~~~
Amazes me how he has not featured more this season.

663~~~
Maybe he's just not ready yet. LVG has given chances to the kids when he thinks they are ready so Pereira probably isn't ready yet.

664~~~
He's been good in both of the matches he's started.

665~~~
He's been inventive and skilful but careless. Under another manager I think he'd have played more because he has looked promising but LvG hates careless midfield play.

666~~~
No more careless than Lingard was against CSKA. The main difference was that Lingard posed much more of a threat.

667~~~
Agree with the edit. What Lingard and Memphis both have in their favour which gives them a bit of leeway on that front is goal threat and pace to stretch the opposition defence. They're more like attackers than midfielders. Pereira is very much a possession player and drifts towards the ball rather than stretching the play. Similar to Herrera I think his carelessness is punished more severely.

668~~~
I'm not sure your emphasis on how careless they are is fair. Lingard and Martial have both shown themselves to give the ball away a hell of a lot, yet Van Gaal sticks with them because they've looked likely to make things happen in the final third. 

If Pereira did the same (or Hererra) he'd be more likely to get a run of games. Hererra's most recent dropping has feck all to do with being too careless. If anything, the opposite. 

Van Gaal's definitely a conservative coach but seems more than willing to play attacking players who are a bit careless in possession, providing they make up for that by creating/scoring goals. I mean, look at Di Maria last season. Gave the ball away for fun, from day one, yet only got dropped after a longish run of games where he stopped creating.

669~~~
My take on Di Maria is completely different. He was moved away from his best position because of his carelessness in possession very early on - to the point where he played as a striker for the first time in his career. Then despite consistently being our most creative and dangerous player he was edged out by the less creative Young because he's much more disciplined and careful in possession.

670~~~
His "best position" involved him being incapable of most of the things you expect from someone in that position. He was then given a chance in multiple different positions where you can carry a player who won't make any defensive effort but when he played out wide and in a free role behind a striker (he never played up top fwiw) he just didn't do enough of anything.  

Anyway, this has been done to death (in more appropriate threads) and even discussing the lazy turd depresses me, so happy to agree to disagree.

671~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Nov/Andreas-pereira-hoping-for-a-chance-to-shine.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...eas-pereira-hoping-for-a-chance-to-shine.aspx</a>

I think LvG does rate him highly, it's just very hard to get gametime. Heck, even Ander and Memphis are struggling to get minutes in the last 3 games or so.

672~~~
If it was up to me, I'd be benching Rooney, Mata and Memphis until Christmas, and then taking a look at Lingard, Pereira, Wilson, Young and Fellaini to see if any of them can contribute more than the star names, if given an extended run of games. Our first choice attacking players (with the exception of Martial) really haven't done enough to justify being regular starters, never mind being in the team every game; only Memphis seems to have been dropped for his poor performances.

Pereira looked promising in the League Cup though not perfect by any means. Surely worth giving him some mins to show what he can do. We need more creativity.

On the pre-season tour, it was clear to anyone watching that our A team attack of Young, Mata, Memphis and Rooney, was no better, indeed possibly worse, than our B team attack of Lingard, Pereira, Januzaj and an out of form Wilson. Nothing has happened since the season started to change that view.

673~~~
Even though Watford got a penalty, I thought he changed the game. Good cameo.

674~~~
Made a good tackle and played a decent pass in to Memphis on a counter, not a bad 15 minutes under the belt as part of his learning curve.

675~~~
I dont think it was him who changed the game, after conceding goal like that every team would show up with a good finish to the game. 

Great to see Andreas getting game time though. I actually was angry he didnt get chance ahead of rojo and we wouldnt need to change to system in we struggle.. pereira doesn't seem like no2 option for herrera to lvg which is kinda weird as we didn't have a better option on the bench and their playstyle is similar..

676~~~
Should get a chance as Lingard is out.

677~~~
Expect him to get a few minutes but don't think he'll start.

678~~~
I want him to have as many minutes as possible. I rate him the highest out of our young players including januzaj.

679~~~
Really should be played more often.

680~~~
After seeing Fellaini's first touches yesterday, could not believe Pereira is not given a shot more often.

681~~~
So what happened with this kid? Everyone was hoping he's renew his contract, he's supposed to be a big talent, but he never gets a game even when our attack is poor and two number 10s are injured? I'd imagine sooner rather than later he's going to get fed up. Or is he not playing well for thr reserves?

682~~~
Winter is coming... He will get his chances during the frantic Dec-Jan period i think.  Since every player we currently play in the numer 10 spot is shit, if Pereira performs good he might be able to secure a starting spot

683~~~
He's playing very well for the reserves, assisted Fellainis goal and played a part in the other. The problem for him is even though he is extremely talented he doesn't posses alot of pace and outwide where at the moment he can get game time its not what's needed. Where I believe he will excel is at CM, ala Herrera role but were over stocked in this area and so he's having to be developed in a different area to get game time which is disappointing to see. It's the same issue with Sean Goss.

Were all frustrated with watching 2 defensive CM playing together acting as defenders that don't really support the attack, if we change it up a little, say put Morgan and Herrera at CM, we'd have a DM and CM, Morgan would sit back while Herrera would push forward, put Mata at #10 and we've found the solution to our creative problems (IMO). Sticking to the same system, if we didn't have the likes of Carrick, Bastian and Fellaini, we'd see Goss (DM), Pereira (CM) and Januzaj (#10) as back up. You could say that not enough experience for back up but I'd rather give them game time over (ATM) Carrick and Fellaini.

684~~~
If Basti is out for three games, he'll get some sort of a run out, right? Right...?

685~~~
I'd like to see a 4-3-3 with Schneiderlin, Carrick and Pereira. Mata hasn't been doing it for the last few games so have Lingard and Herrera out wide with Martial in the middle.

686~~~
A three man midfield would help a lot. Currently, we're so mechanical and rigid. Just get players like Herrera and Pereira making runs from deep and instigating play in the final third quicker. Sounds way too chaotic for van Gaal, though.

687~~~
Either Pereira or Powell are going to get a lot of minutes over the next few matches. It'll be interesting to see which one LvG goes for. If I had to guess, I think it's gonna be the latter since van Gaal prefers his #10s to be strong on the ball. If Pereira's gonna play, my guess is he'll come on for one of the wingers towards the end of games.

688~~~
Guess not.

689~~~
Now Powell is ahead of him? That's a big slap in the face. I wouldn't be taking it well if I was him, to be honest.

690~~~
Needs a loan.

691~~~
Ridiculous how Powell is ahead of him all of a sudden.

692~~~
A person with a brain would have subbed him on for Mata but we have Van Gal what can we expect.

693~~~
So fatty Powell who has done feck all is ahead of him? LVG is a fecking joke <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

694~~~
I am mostly confident Powell came on ahead of him because of his height.

695~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

edit I thought it was nick powell thread, that I would find hilarious, but in this thread its sad, he should get gametime ahead of someone like Fellaini and Powell

696~~~
And his strength and his goal scoring ability. It is quite obvious that Powell is viewed as a second striker type where Andreas isn't. Powell came on and was partnering Martial up top for the most part, Andreas wouldn't be doing that.

697~~~
Andreas could have played deeper and Fellaini pushed forward which he was doing anyway at that point leaving one in midfield.

Still don't get why Mata had to go off tho.

698~~~
Does LVG not rate him? Half the season and such little first team football.

699~~~
I believe he does but if Nick Powell had scored he would be known as a geniuses.

700~~~
Yeah, it's odd. He should head out on loan soon tbh.

Wilson, Januzaj, Pereira are the 3 biggest youth prospects we have coming through if anything and LVG seems to want to use all other U21s more except them. It's weird.

701~~~
Hopefully at least Januzaj and Pereira are given a higher priority next season.

702~~~
Weird not to come on considering Powell did as a 10.

703~~~
What the feck was that tackle all about?  <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

704~~~
was trying to win the ball, what do you think, it was a rash challenge though

705~~~
He imagined the ball was van Gaal

706~~~
Someone really needs to tell him to cut those out. He gets away with them in the u21s but he won't in first team football.

707~~~
Lucky to be on the pitch. Seen those given a red plenty of times.

708~~~
Am i the only one who thought it looked worse than it was due to the lunge ?

Don't think his studs were pointing at the end and he missed the man.

709~~~
Red card more often than not, that one. Was clean off the floor with both feet at one time. If he'd properly twatted Stanislas with that rather than just catching him I think he'd be off.

710~~~
Not a red just a clumsy tackle.

Hopefully gets a go at number 10 this half. Think if we can get him firing he has the ability to be a great player.

711~~~
its so obvious we should use him in midfield, I dont understand why LVG doesnt see it, the master of balance, we are absolutely immobile in midfield, just need exactly player like Pereira. Sure hes a bit of lightweight but he showed on numerous occasions that he can play there, to control the game. He has a bit of flair in him as well, if Schneiderlin comes back for the nexxt game I hope Pereira gets Lingards position at least..

712~~~
I thought he did well after a rash start, put some decent balls in and I like how quickly he makes his mind up when in a good position.

713~~~
I like him. He is very good on the ball and has a decent pass/cross in him. Should be used as a part of a 3 man midfield.

714~~~
Your right he should be used in midfield. I do feel were a bit heavy there at the moment, Carrick, Bastian, Morgan, Herrera, Fellaini. Tbh I don't think we should have bought Bastian and Fellaini shouldn't be at the club because as long as he is here he will always be used as a tool and will continue to play route 1 football. Having said that I don't think Carrick will be here next season and so will open the door for Pereira and hopefully Goss too.

DM: Schneiderlin, Goss (Bastian)
CM: Herrera, Pereira (Bastian)
AM: Mata?, Januzaj

Hopefully this next season

715~~~
Yeah I thought he did okay today really. He obviously has potential, and should probably play more then he does. Is very smart on the ball usually. Just needs to cut out diving into tackles.

716~~~
So... man of the match?

717~~~
This kid is always doing well every time he gets the chance. He needs to play more... much more.

718~~~
Did well I guess...

719~~~
I reckon under the next manager he might even be a starter given how absymal our forward options are.

720~~~
Not sure Giggs rates him that much to be honest.

721~~~
Did pretty ok to be honest, which in comparison to the other options is playing like Messi

722~~~
He's no Tom Lawrence that's for sure.

723~~~
He did really well,hope he gets more playing time.

724~~~
I swear, every time he features he does something positive. Surprising he got such little game time in this mess of time.

725~~~
Based on what?

726~~~
Hasn't exactly pushed for him to start has he. Whereas last season, he was pushing for Wilson to play (probably due to the two goals he scored under him) when we had the likes of Januzaj, Falcao, Van Persie, Rooney, Mata, Di Maria, Herrera etc. all competing for a forward position. Van Gaal even said Giggs was pushing for Wilson to play himself.

Whereas if you look at the situation currently; it's incredible how he has barely featured in this December period with the suspensions and injuries to Bastian, Morgan, Herrera etc. along with having a relatively thin squad, don't you think?

727~~~
Did the best he could under the circumstances, he at least looked lively.

728~~~
You do know that LVG is first and foremost responsible for team line-ups right? It's conjecture like this that makes me wonder.

729~~~
Looks a bit like Herrera in that he looks eager to get the ball moving forward. Supposedly an fairly decent dribbler too, I hear?

730~~~
Surprised he didn't come on for Mata a lot earlier. Performance was a mix of awful and very encouraging. Thought he did really well in the move that led to Mata's shot being saved, after Rooney had been unwilling, or unable, to shoot when better placed.

731~~~
Are you a part of the coaching staff? You have no clue what Giggs pushes for or not. How Giggs rates Wilson has no relevance to how he rates Andreas either. You are just making up stuff based on line-ups that Giggs doesn't pick.

I'm not surprised at all as van Gaal has largely used him as a winger and since we've been forced to use McNair, CBJ, and Varela at the back van Gaal is going to favour playing senior players in front of them over another youth player.

732~~~
He is, I think he's been more cautious with the ball in the first team but if encouraged he can dribble effectively.

733~~~
That's exactly where LVG should step out from his seat, leave the notebook and go tell Pereira to feck it, and create something - "I know you can do it kid" - something a little less cliche, but still. It's not just about shouting to your players making them run as if they are horses at the track, it's also about telling them to just let go and don't worry about losing possession.

734~~~
Quiet liked what I saw of him today. Played a number of good forward balls into the feet of an attacker, and showed lots of directness and positive passing, which makes a nice change from the rest of them just passing it out wide every chance. Wouldn't mind seeing him get more game time right now.

735~~~
I'd start him vs Chelsea. Can't be any worse than Memphis' performances.

736~~~
Fair enough, it just disappoints me he's barely featured at all given how thin our squad is and probably in hindsight more than ever when we have such a lack of creativity. I would have thought that at least someone (and they might have) or even Van Gaal would have pushed for it but they know more than I possibly could about the situation.

737~~~
I would love to see him get more game time as well, but conjecture like that doesn't belong in any discussion - it's journalism really <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

738~~~
Wouldnt be surprised if he plays against Chelsea, is isolated and then doesnt play for 10 games. Seems to be the pattern with United and the lack of consistency for our players.

Will probably make a mistake and be subbed off at half time too.

739~~~
I would have him starting ahead of Memphis every time

740~~~
Said it in October that he was a better player than Memphis. Got battered.

741~~~
Giggs is not the manager. <span style="color: #ffffff">yet</span>
<span style="color: #000000">Watching Pereira coming up through the ranks his best performances have been as part of a midfield 3 or the box to box midfielder in a midfield 2 (like Herrera). That's where he will excel with all the qualities he has. He needs to cut out his rashness when tackling. It's disappointing to see that he's not getting much game even though it's clearly obvious he is extremely talented. He is 1 of the reasons why I felt that we didn't need to buy Bastian in the summer and was hoping Fellaini would be sold. These 2 players are seriously hindering Pereira development and game time. Sean Goss is the other I'd like to see get a few more minutes alongside Pereira. </span>

742~~~
Big Pereira fan, disappointed that he hasn't played more so far, because he plays pretty well every time he gets an appearance. He gets a bit underrated on here, think he has fantastic potential. Someone like Pep would bring the best out of him and possibly Herrera

743~~~
Suffering cause of van Gaal atm. Played and scored against Ipswich in the CoC, started the next game(?), then got benched and barely any minutes. Carry on using him bit part and his progress is seriously going to stagnate.

744~~~
Meanwhile Happy Birthday and Happy New Year to Pereira <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

745~~~
I know we paid 27m for Memphis but IMO, Memphis is stealing games from this guy. I've watched him from the youth ranks and I will keep saying it. This guy can be a star.

746~~~
I don't understand why in a season where our attack has been woeful we haven't given more chances to one of our brightest young attackers.

747~~~
He's done diddly squat to be considered a better player than Memphis.

748~~~
He's had diddly squad minutes. In the most recent game against Chelsea, in that 7 or so minutes he got to play, he created the best chance of the match, only for Rooney to be Rooney and donkey-touch it up.

749~~~
That was CBJ if you're talking about the cross. The chipped chance was well offside so not really a chance at all.

His best game was the Ipswich one where he wasn't very good aside from the freekick. He probably deserves a few more minutes given how crap Depay has been but to suggest he's already better than Depay seems a bit ridiculous.

750~~~
What cross? I'm talking about the run he made from deep, with a couple of one-twos, which he then squared to Rooney, who took a terrible touch and had to play it wide to Mata who the angle was always against. It was in about the 89th minute or so. Was that CBJ? Thought that was Pereira.

751~~~
It depends on how you rate players I guess. In terms of first touch, receiving technique, dribbling ability, change of pace, ability with the ball at pace under pressure then he is already better than Depay. So basically in terms of technique and skill he is better. His main problem at this point is concentration levels which will improve with experience.

752~~~
That was against Stoke I think. That was decent enough but even Memphis has had a couple of those moments. Doesn't really say much.

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

I'd prefer to rate players based on more than one professional club start for a start. Let's see if he can do this at senior level before even comparing him against someone who's had more than 100 games.

753~~~

ahh. van Gaal will let him go to City... <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

754~~~
No don't worry that's only Ander Herrera who we'd be letting go.

755~~~
There's more chance of there being snow in Ethiopia than us selling a player to City when we have a say in the matter.

756~~~
On the flip side, Memphis has fecked up too much on his performances for us to start thinking he is a worse player than Pereira is.

757~~~
Worrying to see we've went so far through a poor season and he's barely had a chance. Seems to say the right things so can only assume he isn't showing it in training.

If you had asked me at the start of the season i'd have said he'd have been the youth product to get into the first team. Seems everyone else has had chances nearly but him. Weird.

758~~~
One of those players who's status grows the less he plays... The few times he's played this season he's looked extremely lightweight. Not ready.

759~~~
If you have watched him from the youth ranks you should know he's not at his best out wide as in Depay position, he's more a #10/#8, that's where he's had his best game and will develop as a player. Saying Depay is stealing games from him is irrelevant. Tbh I'd say buying Schwienstiger has limited his game time. I do agree he will be a star.

760~~~
Agreed, he's obviously got talent but definitely not a starter and should be coming on in the last 15 minutes of a game or into a game we're dominating.

761~~~
Fixed

762~~~
True, having both at club and also Rooney has limited his game time

763~~~
The problem with him is all of the positions that he can play is well-stacked and LVG isn't a manager who like to rotate the squad.However he's talented enough to knock some senior players down the pecking order in the near future.

764~~~
Scored two beautiful goals. (Including one direct from a corner)

Hopefully gets the full 90 in the FA Cup.

765~~~

766~~~
He's such a wonderful talent. It's so strange that he has gotten so few minutes given how poorly our attacking players have performed. It goes against him that LvG seems to prefer a pacey wide forward on the left. But I think he should be played more on the right instead of Mata. Not his ideal position, but give it a go I say.

767~~~
No room for him, Fellaini will play.

768~~~
He should get more game time imo. He's not ready yet but if he plays more often he can grow

769~~~
Many said that about Pogba, it just shows what actual belief and game time can do.

It's not easy coming into a match late, especially when the tempo is usually fast at the end of the game.

He should be given the Mata free role in our team to wonder around and playmake. he is definitely better moving with the ball from a deeper position IMO, but he has wonderful balance and 2 good feet which helps him work his way up the field. I get why Van Gaal has been reluctant recently to play him, but he won't get any better playing at U21 level, he's clearly above that.

770~~~
Still better than sit on the bench for 90mins. He can only learn

771~~~
I love this lads composure.  Every time I watch him play, I think of the term 'United quality'.

772~~~
His set pieces are quite good, deserves more minutes. I want to see more, not just 15 minutes every 2 months.

773~~~
Not yet ready and would benefit it from a loan at a Prem club but feck it, he can't be any less inspiring than Mata, Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Fellaini in there.

774~~~
I'd start him now. He can't be any worse than Fellaini

775~~~
created the martial chance after basti fecked himself up, good freekick as well, basically was more effective than fellaini who should never start ahead of pereira, LVG proly still thinks he's good header of the ball while he's really poor one despite his height, adding absolutely nothing to our team, we have a mobility of an elephant thanks to him and sweinsteigger

776~~~
Just play him ffs

777~~~
I think it's time to drop Mata for him. Or hell, a midfield three of him, Herrera and Schneirdelin, but god forbid that's too risky. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

778~~~
He looked good. He should start or come on as a sub more frequently. And he was basically playing as a deep lying playmaker. That set piece was good too. In a 4-2-3-1 a three of Martial-Pereira-Lingard is brimming with pace, creativity, talent and potential.

779~~~
I'd drop anyone bar Martial for him at this point. The other players are hiding.

780~~~
Almost got Lingard in and delivered a dangerous set-piece, solid cameo from him and like most I'd like to see him get more minutes.

781~~~
Sorry, but I don't rate the guy at all.

782~~~
Honestly he should be getting more minutes for the team now. Think he should have come on earlier than he did (or really should have started, there was no reason for Mata to start ahead of him today).

783~~~
I'd start him more or at least slowly introduce him from the bench. The best pass of the match came from him to Lingard, and he showed he can keep the ball quite well under pressure. 

At the moment with a lot of players lacking confidence, it is worth giving this lad a go on Tuesday.

784~~~
If we play a midfield three like we did in the last league game then I'd be happy to see him in place of Herrera who's been woeful recently.

785~~~
He's class. Great on the ball and has a very good eye for a pass, and can actually play it like he did to lingard. Needs to play more, especially ahead of others like Fellaini who shouldn't be near the team.

786~~~
How can anyone not play this lad ahead of Fellani I don't know.

787~~~
Agree I'd also prefer Jesse or Wilson to Mata. I can't remember a player at United supposedly of a certain standing that so underwhelmed me. Maybe Taibi was the last one but it was that long ago.

788~~~
I'd like him to get a couple of starts at least this season, chuck him in against midgetland with Schneiderlin I say. He's got ability that's quite clear, love his little turns he does in midfield, having a player who has good control and who can turn and change the direction of the play in the middle of the park is one of the most valued skills in football.

789~~~
If he can't get a start against Sheffield United then he has little chance of game time under Van Gaal, the game would have been  perfect for him.

790~~~
He was really positive and motivated when he came on. Constantly wanted the ball and moved in positions to get it. Both him and Memphis stepped up and tried to leave their mark on the game. I'd start them both against Newcastle.

791~~~
Agree completely why is he not being given a chance, it was the ideal opportunity to give him a game and given they were going to park the bus it would have given us more chance of opening them up. For all the talk of LVG putting faith in youth it is more because he has had to due to him messing up the transfer window rather than because he genuinely wants to play them.

If he can't get into this poor utd team at home to a league one side then when is he going to play.

792~~~
I reckon he'll be getting a lot more game time now. Van Gaal made a beeline for him at full time and looked as though he was pleased with him.

I've never been sure about how good he really is, personally. Never saw him as a number 10 because he doesn't have the guile or threat to play there. I see him more like Herrera, who I believe should be played in midfield. They keep the ball moving, link up play and show energy on the pitch. He's definitely worth a shot at this rate, though.

793~~~
Did well, reckon he'll get a start or sub appearance next game. If he takes the chance he might even force his way into the first XI more regularly - bags of ability and actually has a bit of confidence and desire. Which is nice.

794~~~
I really think he has a great first touch and generally receives the ball well interms of body position. which is great for a midfielder . it makes passing faster much easier. would love to see him play in cm with some ball winners more regularly.

795~~~
again didn't get on the pitch, despite having a good cameo. could he not be straight swap for fellaini?

796~~~
I would not be surprised when the allure of regular football elsewhere starts turning his head. I feel for the kid

797~~~
Play him alongside Morgan, he's a better player that Fellaini.

798~~~
he's going to be sold to Juventus in summer

799~~~
is that the rumour? i'm out of touch...

800~~~

801~~~
Criminally underused, it is not like we have 5 worldclass midfielders.

802~~~
can he play central midfield? if so, with our injury situation there simply can be no reason not to play him ahead of fellaini at this point.

803~~~
Apparently, Van Gaal has a good record of developing young talent...

804~~~
He should and could be starting centrally under a more competent manager. No matter what though there is no reason whatsoever for Fellaini to be starting ahead of him, if this continues we could expect him to be leaving in the summer, a player with his talent and potential won't wait around.

805~~~
Our best two from our current bunch went/are out on loan and Andreas who is probably third is on the fringes. 

Not too bad at all. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

806~~~
Could be another Pogba situation with him - where despite his talents and our situation, the manager still does not trust him enough to play him.

807~~~
Good Ol' Caf. Moaning when a youngster is not playing but shit on him if he's bad.

808~~~
an excellent showing for the u21's today... keane and januzaj got the goals, but pereira has been right up there with them.

809~~~
Keep saying he will be a star if allowed.

810~~~
to me he looks like he can play CM or AM... throw him to the wolves against derby and see what he can come up with. he's warranted a start.

811~~~
LVG didn't start him against a worse team.

812~~~
TBF we are in a desperate situation, would you have risked him at the start and have us concede?

813~~~
He's fecking class.

But I can't see him starting in our current system as a CM unfortunately... Feel our 4-2-3-1 is only beneficial for a handful of players and negates combative midfielders such as Herrera, Pereira, Fellaini etc. and rather favours players who are positionally strong enough to be part of a double pivot.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

815~~~
Amazing stuff. He's such a quality player.

816~~~
Great game today. I'm usually not a fan of his style for the number 10 position because he tends to only look for his shot over creating, but he did both today.

817~~~
Is that walking football?

818~~~
Looked good again. In fairness to LVG tho has been muck for the first team. Invisible. He's getting chances but doesn't deserve to be in the team on merit thus far. Hopefully we effect those games more

819~~~
We need to play him, he is absolute class already. Dont want another Pogba scenario in a few years

820~~~
I would of risked playing him to be honest.

821~~~
Yes and not to sound like a broken record, over Fellaini. There nothing that he has done lately that Pereira could not have done and if not better.

822~~~
A lot of folks on here seriously under-estimate the gulf in level between EPL and U21s. 

Will Keane scored 2 goals in 22 appearances for Preston NE. He's gotten 5 goals already in 2 U21 matches.

Look a Januzaj. U21 is a walk in the park for him, but he's struggled in EPL when oppositions just don't give him as much space. 
James Wilson was scoring for fun at all the U levels but struggles to match the level of performance when being given the chance in the 1st team.

Pereira looks best in the No.10 role, which puts him in direct competition with Mata, Herrera or even Depay who was used in that role.

823~~~
Pereira looks best in the number 8 role, however LVG prefers to play with two number 6 and rightly so which is part of the reason why he didn't play much.

I don't think anyone expect him to be first team regular at this point of time.However he has shown a lot of promises both at U21s and first team level in the last 2 seasons and deserves to be blooded more to the team than he has been so far.

824~~~
You were quoting me, but somehow it shows Inigo Montoya. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

825~~~
I'd like is to use a 6 and two 8s like we did towards the end of last season. Schneiderlin, Hererra and Pereira. Plenty of speed, energy and creativity.

826~~~
Like Januzaj, Pereira looks a class above the other U21 players. 

Either he gets his minutes for the first team or we loan him to a club where he can show his talent.

827~~~
Made it look easy.

828~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/UnitedPeoplesTV/status/689840376782397440" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Andreas Pereira: "I'm a Man United player, [but] I've seen in the press that there are various other clubs interested. I get frustrated at times when I don't play but Louis van Gaal is always speaking to me. I need more game time. United will decide with my agent."</a>

"I don't know if United want to loan me out but I'm working hard to get more opportunities. It's their decision."

"I'm focused on doing my job at Utd, of course I want to be more visible to those in Brazil. I need to play and get more chances."

829~~~
This is the shit that happens when we prefer shit like Fellaini to him.

Pogba 2.0 if we're not careful.

830~~~
We're going to balls up another youth player?

Bollocks to van Gaal and his <i>bleeding in Youth </i>hyperbole. Our best talents have all been sent away or not given any opportunities.

831~~~
I'm going to go insane if we do another Pogba. Give this lad some fecking chances.

832~~~
he signed a contract last year. he cant do a pogba

833~~~
Not sure why Lingard gets chosen ahead of him. His quality is all for there to see when he plays, maybe he's not giving enough in training

834~~~
Should have started in the FA Cup.

835~~~
Wow what? I must have been watching a different player then. He's looked impressive for the limited game time he has been given and has contributed already on a few occasions. If you consider the limited opportunities he has been given, he certainly deserves more game time if anything. He already looks a lot more effective and talented than Lingard, who simply lacks the ability and composure to nail down that right wing position. I firmly do believe however, Pereira and Januzaj could ultimately nail down a place in the current team. They are by far our two most talented youngsters (excluding Martial and Shaw of course).

836~~~
Lingards pace and that alone

837~~~
He's not competing with Lingard. Different type of player and Andreas is more suited centrally and Jesse better from out wide.

I'd also drop Mata, Fellaini or Depay for Periera before dropping Lingard.

838~~~
Yeah, that post was nonsense. In the league he has been grasping at cameos in matches where we've been bereft [which is normally every game] and hope he can do something. Against Chelsea he came on and made a great chance for Rooney toward the end, which Rooney couldn't control and forced it wide to Mata. He had a great 90 minutes in the FA Cup, albeit against weaker opposition but he definitely has the capacity to be playing a sizable amount more.

839~~~
Depay doesn't play, and when Lingard plays Mata doesn't play....

840~~~
any notion of him not making the most of his opportunities is completely ridiculous. the guy has received next to nothing but has been more lively in his cameos than most of his teammates.

plus, i'm convinced he's versatile enough to play on the wing. he did in summer and did a great job of it... that's another thing that's so hard to understand. he was perhaps our best player on our US tour and has got nothing from it.

LVG has royally fecked up when it comes to our best youngsters. i know they don't all come good, but in wilson, januzaj and pereira we have three fantastic prospects who should be given more of a chance.

841~~~
That's true but I meant in terms of who's game time Pereira should take based on current form, well up until Anfield anyway.

842~~~
IMO one of Fellaini (most preferably) or Lingard (Pereira has played wide in pre-season and this season in the UCL)

843~~~
He didnt play against Chelsea and only played 12 minutes in the FA Cup

844~~~
I'm not sure how a 20 year old who already signed a new contract and is saying he might need to go out on loan to help him develop is being compared to Pogba. It's basically the complete opposite mind set to Pogba

845~~~
It's the negative mind set of our fans currently.  Anyway,  out of all the youngsters -  he is probably the one who needs a loan out the most.

846~~~
Where would you loan him to though? Which manager would you trust to utilize him correctly?

Bit of a luxury player at this point in time. He'd most likely sit on the bench everywhere else in England. To find regular games he'd have to go to the mid level leagues on the continent - Belgium, France, Netherlands or Portugal - who are more busy developing their own prospects, because that's how the teams their do business.

I'd say, under more favorable circumstances, he's at the right club to develop as a player. It's just a shame we can't afford to play him more often.

That being said...I'd prefer to see him on the pitch over Mata or Fellaini.

847~~~
He'd be one of the best players in the league in Belgium and even up there in Holland and Portugal. After PSG, Ligue 1 is even pretty weak. He said himself last year he could be starting every game in the Eredivisie if he wanted to but he preferred to stay at United in the highest level.

848~~~
Capital One Cup, then? The game he scored that free kick in. The other match I was thinking of was Leicester, I think.

849~~~
His agent is no doubt in his ear, unfortunately the profile outgrows the minutes on the field these days. Pogba has now set the standard for some of these kids, they must be all looking thinking, I could do that. 

From Fleetwood away for the reserves, to the Champions league final in three years. Madness.

850~~~
Yes that's what I mean. I'm not certain he'd be the best, but he'd be certainly a strong asset for a team in those leagues. The point i was trying to make was that teams in Belgium, Holland, Portugal and France rarely take loanees from other leagues. They much prefer to develop the potential in their own squad, to sell on to clubs like us, taking a 21 year old prospect from us might even hinder the chances of developing their own youngsters.

It's easy to say we need to send him on loan, but as we've seen with Januzaj, there not always of great benefit to the player.

I'd say keep him here, he'll get his cameos in time.

851~~~
Januzaj's case does not have to apply to every other player. The obvious reason for the loan failure was the choice of clubs from the get go.

The doesn't need cameo appearances, and he isn't even going to get any. Fellaini has more chance of playing 90+mins in a match than Pereira getting out of his track suit which is just criminal. It should be the other way round. For the sake of the boy I'd be happy to see him move on rather than waste his time on the bench while the likes of Fellaini constantly tralala on the pitch.

852~~~
fine, he could play more, but he hasn't done anything when he's played. The impact you need to stay in the team is pretty big, like compare his little cameos to januzaj 2 years ago. that's how you stay in the team. Coming on and not effecting the game at all won't be good enough, even if everyone knows you have performed well at u21s

But i do think people watch different games to me as there's always a slew of 'woooowww what a talent' after a ten mintues cameo where he touches the ball 4 times and rolls it back to the left back.

I really don't think saying he hasn't impacted in his first team appearances is total nonsense but each to their own view

853~~~
It's obvious he is talking about a loan and not leaving permanently. The gloom and doom is doing my head in.

854~~~
Yes I agree he needs game time, and it's criminal that Fellaini gets more than him...but there are no realistic clubs that would take him on loan and give him enough game time to develop.

855~~~
Yeah but you said he's been muck. Which he hasn't. That's probably why people responded

856~~~
I remember PSV being interested on a loan last season, I think. I think a few Championship clubs might be interested if he is available.

857~~~
I see what you are saying but Fellaini has had a good number of cameo appearances at early in the season without having any positive effect yet he gets a good run of games. I don't know what you would expect of a young player who has been given limited game time. The fact is, whenever he comes on, the talent is there and that is more than 4 touches on the ball.

858~~~
He scored a nice free kick in the League Cup, and played well in that game. Then he didn't get on the pitch for the first team for a whole month. He did something significant to stay in the team, but didn't. He got just under an hour against Bournemouth which was probably our worst team performance this season, a team ravaged by injury. Aside from that, he got 10 minutes against Watford and less than 10 minutes against Stoke. It's not really enough time to make an impact.

859~~~
Sometimes i feel like the younger players who are guaranteed first team players like Januzaj, Pereira & Wilson are treated differently.  Someone lile Borthwick jackson might get games because we lack depth but the others really do need to fight and show us either in the little time they get,  or in training or out on loan. 

We had pereira saying that there was alot of communication & i assume he is now in a position of direct competition.

860~~~
I'd love to see him thrown into a prem game from the start and just see how he gets on, got some favorable games coming up hopefully he gets his chance.

861~~~
So would I. Saying that if I was him, even though I support United, I would ask to leave.

862~~~
Really being wasted here. And it's not like there's some great players playing instead of him. It's average players like Fellaini, Lingard or overplaying older players who should be rotated more like Schweinsteiger/Carrick. All probably because he likes to take risks on the ball and attempts killer passes now and then.

863~~~
Has to start against Derby, may as well leave if he doesn't.

864~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvMHRIiuFQQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

How is it possible this guy is not getting any game time, its criminal and to say we have to put up with the shite Fellaini and Lingard produce, I'm lost for words

865~~~
I don't get why he can't at least be the first attacking sub on, we are never going to see if he can step up if he barely ever gets a chance.

866~~~
We're surely going to lose him because of LvG.

867~~~
There has to be a perceived lack of effort in training. Nothing else makes sense really as everybody else has had a run.

868~~~
He is Brazilian, ain't he? He's just got to sit tight because it won't be long before this senile fool is run out of town and he gets a fair crack at it under Giggs till the end of the season.

869~~~
Being Brazilian has nothing to do with anything. Sure he has spent 1/3 of his life in the Netherlands and speaks Dutch.

870~~~
He should be given a run in the side. Can't do any worse than some of them.

871~~~
We are making the same mistake we did with Pogba.

872~~~
Got 90 minutes for U21s, unlikely he'll start.

873~~~
Foundations.

874~~~
what are the odds andreas and adnan get any minutes on friday if they played the full 90 for the u21's today?

875~~~
Plays quite talentless youngsters because of first team injuries and a small squad (because he sold most players), when the next manager actually manages to succeed, LVG gets the credit. Foundations.

876~~~
Whoosh.

877~~~
The whole Derby team played tonight so there is no reason why Adnan and Andreas can't play on Friday. If they do or not is a different matter.

878~~~
And he spent the other 2/3 in his country, Belgium. In a flemish region.

879~~~
Seeing him and Fellaini walk off the same pitch together makes me sick!

880~~~
Don't understand how he's not getting a game.

We're gonna win feck all this year and probably lose him in the process like we did with Pogba.

881~~~
He's still lacking in strength and the ability to release the ball quickly. Huge potential, though.

882~~~
Haven't seen him live that often. Could he play as CM in front of Schneiderlin and behind Rooney/Herrera for example or is he a CAM outright.

883~~~
He'll start Friday..

884~~~
From the little I've seen, I like him best at CM. Reminds me of Cazorla last season. He doesn't seem to have the end product of a CAM. I might be wrong though.

885~~~
I agree with you. Personally like him much more as a deep lying playmaker than a number 10, much better when he has a little more space to turn and look up and pick his pass.

886~~~
I thought he was more a CAM so he is actually the type of player that we need. FFS what a mess the club is in atm.

887~~~
He might be a bit iffy in defensive positioning but all young players usually are until they get the experience. Partner him with Ander ahead of Schneiderlin though and he'd be grand, dropping deep and controlling the game as he has done in his limited minutes recently.

888~~~
Hopefully he starts vs Derby. In his limited game time, I feel like his finally ball and crossing has been a lot better then most of our other players. Really knows how to spot a runner and actually pick him out, or whip in a cross. He's exactly the type of player we need in our midfield (once he develops) and would be plain stupid if we lost him like we lost pogba. He might not be on quite the same level potential wise, but he can without a doubt turn into a top player. Whatever the "it" factor thing is that the top youngsters have, he has it.

889~~~
He's on the same level potential wise as Pogba in my opinion, he's brilliant for his age to be fair. And I agree that he seems to have that X-factor or whatever it's called these days. If he was playing regular football at a team like Ajax half of Europe would be after him, I'd bet my life on it.

890~~~
Was nice having him whilst it lasted.

891~~~
Relax. He'll probably go on loan for the rest of the season and when he comes back Vangle will have hopefully fecked off and we have a manager who actually uses young attacking players who seek to add something to a game; i.e, not Mourinho.

892~~~
Hope LVG fecks off before he does.

893~~~
Honestly if I was a player in his shoes I would probably leave in the summer unless LvG was gone. Staggering how few opportunities he's getting despite being one of our most talented youngsters

894~~~
Perfect game to gel him in and he's on the bench<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

895~~~
Wonder where we'll see him tearing it up in 2 seasons. Spain? Italy?

896~~~
Must... play... Rooney...

897~~~
It's criminal how his not even getting a few minutes, yet the donkey plays the full game.

898~~~
Surprised he can't get games ahead of lingard.

899~~~
one reason alone why should that fat fecker at the bench should be sacked, so many underperformers in the team and this exciting young lad cant get minutes over them..

900~~~
The one time we actually get a nice comfortable lead when it's late in the game and he still doesn't put Pereira on.

901~~~
Said that earlier today, and I'm still of that opinion.

902~~~
Jaysus Christ! Pogba leaving has gotten United fans all nervous that a youth player isn't getting games. Patience guys, his time will come.

903~~~
He's 20 years old and has loads of talent. It's nothing to do with patience, he should quite clearly just get a lot more game time then he does. If he doesn't play more, he'll leave. Simple as that. A kid as talented as him will have loads of big clubs after him who will give him more chances then we have, just like Pogba at Juve. Pogba left because he got feck all chances when he blatantly should have played a lot more, the same is happening with Pereira. The only difference is we have him tied down for a bit longer so we won't lose him on a free for now

904~~~
I'd like to see him deep next to Morgan until Carrick is fit. I think he'll eventually end up a similar style of player to Modric, rather than a #10

905~~~
A kid that good should be playing and given a chance especially in the current set up. If he fails so what. I think its been disgraceful how we have handled him and it definitely is Pogba * 2.

If I was him I'd be dying to leave on loan.

906~~~
He is talented for sure and is clearly a level above his age group. However he has been poor whenever he's been given minutes on the pitch (bar the Ipswich game). His best games has always been when he's played within his age group. Fwiw I think he should have been played more times than he has but certainly not bad enough to advocate leaving. This is his first full year in the squad ffs. 

I remember there were cries that Lingard wasn't getting any minutes at the start of the season. Then he had a good outing(against Everton I think) and has gone on to start half of our games since then. Also Janazaj was given lots of chances by Moyes and look how low his stock has fallen since then. What I mean by patience is that we shouldn't be treating Pereira as though he's a senior player who is being unfairly kept on the bench. He is still a very young player albeit a talented one.

How many 20 year olds have you seen regularly playing for any of the top clubs? This is why I mentioned the Pogba effect. Because he did it, we all suddenly think any high potential youngster can command a place at an elite club. I wan't to know these "big clubs" you[bosnian] refer to who will are more willing to give him said chances?

907~~~
If Van Gaal won't sub him on in a game against Derby when we were leading, where's he going to get his minutes from? 

The last 5 minutes of a frustrating home game when we've not looked like scoring and the fans are on the team's backs?

908~~~
Hopefully he'll get a loan because it doesn't look like he'll get any minutes under LvG.

909~~~
He's been poor? That is an absolute myth. Everytime he makes a cameo most fans praise him.. I can only recall one poor performance the rest he's usually looked dangerous and positive. When Fellaini, Mata and Herrera have failed to set the world alight.. he definitely deserves a shot.

A player as gifted as him should be playing lots of games.. not stagnating on the bench. 20 is old when you consider his technical ability and he's already stronger than Mata.If he ends up not good enough so be it.. on the flip side you could be unearthing a big talent.

910~~~
I think he is a huge talent and I hope we dont lose him. Must be frustrating to sit on the bench and watch players underperforming week in week out, while he just gets ignored. Every youth player got a run out for a few games and could show if he deserves a starting place, except for Pereira. And he was one of the first to got promoted to the first team and is probably one of the most talented. Youth players nowadays want to play if they are ready, and he is. Times have changed, if they are good enough they should play, and not sit and waste their talent on the bench. He will feck off soon enough, wont be short of suitors. With the right club, we could have another Pogba situation. Some just dont want to open their eyes.

911~~~
I'm with you and surprised he's not had more minutes considering how bad Mata Herrera Depay Rooney Fellaini have all been.

912~~~
What about Lingard. I firmly believe that Pereira could do a better job on the the right than him. He doesn't constantly fluff passes for a start.

913~~~
Until he actually plays, fecks up and gets slaughtered here like Lingard. It's the same blueprint for most of our players really, they become a lot better when they don't play.

Having said that I was also pissed off that more of our youth didn't play yesterday, particularly Pereira and Adnan. It's high time we've given Martial some deserved rest, was no need for Fellaini either.

914~~~
Pereira is a much better talent than Lingard. He is the best in his age group I believe. He knows how to look after the ball better than Adnan IMO. Similar to Mata, I think he has more spacial intelligence than Adnan or Lingard and can find space. 

You are right though, he needs to prove it on the big stage.

915~~~
Our fans are always going to praise him because it's a player they like. Same way they're reluctant to give Fellaini any praise but quick to criticise. Also, despite Varela showing enough to prove he could be a useful player for us, some want him replaced. McNair has been renamed McMare, Januzaj was getting picked on after the Southampton game for this 10 minute cameo. We tend to overate players we're fond of and vice versa.

I maintain that Pereira hasn't done anything on the pitch that tells me he's ought to play more games. I'd like to think the people who watch him day in day out in training are in a better position to judge whether he's ready for a prolonged stint in the side. Like all our youth players this season, I believe his time will also come.

If he's as good as most on here say, he'd surely be playing more. Remember, Martial too is only 20 but he doesn't seem to ever get rested, so the notion that if you're old enough you're good enough is not being ignored at the club. LVG certainly isn't scared of using youth when required.

Let's stop using Pogba as the example. He's one in a few cases that have gone on to succeed at an elite level. Also his case was different in the sense that he was being ignored even when all our midfielders were injured. Remember Rafael and Oshea in midfield? Pereira has more competition in his position now than Pogba ever did.

916~~~
One shit poster calling him that doesn't mean he has been renamed that.

917~~~
Well he might play, feck up and get slaughtered. However, he is far more talented than Lingard.

918~~~
Why is everyone saying he'll do a Pogba? He's under contract until 2018.

919~~~
Agreed. 
And I still don't understand the logic to this.
How can anybody rate Pereira highly, when the guy has hardly ever played a full game?

920~~~
It is a fair point. Pereira has impressed for the U-21s and in some of the game-time he's had for the first team -- but the truth is the hype isn't based on a lot. He's an excitable player though, and seems very creative which is exactly what we are crying out for. And when players who play in positions he can adequately cover -- Fellaini, Herrera, Mata and Lingard -- aren't exactly setting the world alight (Fellaini and Lingard being outright poor imo), it is only natural to wonder why he's not getting his chance. Also, if he's not getting his chance now, when we are at our absolute low-point in terms of creativity, it's hard to remain optimistic about his future. At the same time, it seems like LvG does not want to let him go on loan -- making the entire situation even more baffling.

921~~~
Wasn't in the squad for the U21's, can only hope he's in Van Gaal's plans to feature tomorrow.

Unless he's injured...

922~~~
I was just thinking it seems like he's been 'the star talent' waiting in the wings for what seems like an age now.

923~~~
Our top three talents under 21 have been handled extremely poorly by LVG. That's putting it mildly, too, might I add.

Pereira has deserved far better treatment than this.

924~~~
Pereira, Januzaj and?

925~~~
Wilson probably.

926~~~
Wilson has under impressed in every game I've ever seen him play in, bar his first. 

Januzaj was crap all last season, and equally so at Dortmund.

Pereira doesn't look ready to make the step up, but should be given chances regardless.

927~~~
Aye Wilson.

928~~~
It's utter bullshit that people think he's been good with our youth. If they don't hit the blocks running first time then he gives up on them completely. Lingard survived because he is tidy enough and puts a shift in. Look at the rest: Wilson, Januzaj, Pereira, McNair, Blackett, Johnstone (who played well but has been poorly handled)...the list goes on.

929~~~
At this level, you have to hit the ground running. If you don't take your chances when they're handed to you, there's nothing the manager can do. CBJ and Varela are two examples of players who have taken their chances, both likely to feature for the rest of the season.

With Johnstone... he's never going to start over the best keeper in the league.

930~~~
And Lingard, might I add, is 23. But he doesnt ever look threatening in the offensive half of things, so I can see why LVG rates him.

It's amazing Martial has lasted this long.

931~~~
Wilson has been spectacular, Januzaj has been excellent and Pereira is ready to start PL games then?

932~~~
Ugh i had deleted that as soon as I posted it. My reply was non-sense. Sorry you caught it.

933~~~
OK, no problem.

934~~~
I have thought that too. It's like he's content being the star at reserve level. Anyhow,he could do with grabbing the bull by the horns and making it impossible for him to be left out. No doubting his talent of course.

935~~~
its absolutely ridiculous. Completely unjustifiable.. yet you'll get posters backing LVG saying he hasn't performed.. yeah right.

936~~~
Januzaj with Ronaldo's atitude would serve us well! One can only dream. (I haven't given up.....yet).

937~~~
Apparently Van Gaal didn't want to let Pereira leave on loan this month, despite interest from PSV and Malaga. Poor decision, IMO. He needs regular first team playing time.

938~~~
In fairness to him, he plays a position where it will be difficult to get games. It's not like the Pogba situation where we were playing Rafael and Park in midfield when we had a youth prospect who everyone felt was ready to make the step up (combined with shortage of options). Pereira is contending against the likes of Mata and Herrera (or whichever other midfielder/attacking midfielder LvG decides to play). Best case scenario is he gets a chance on the wing, but not sure that's where he should be playing. I'll defer to someone who's watched more of the youth side than I have, but I've always seen him as a 10.

939~~~
He's very slight physically, he does look like a boy playing amongst men somtimes. Not sure if that counts against him....

940~~~
He's more of a man than that spanish midget Mata.

941~~~
You should have a tagline.......I ♥ Pereira <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

942~~~
No, I want that one. Instead Ive got Adnan's... Sooooo 2014.

943~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Mate, you <b><i>know</i></b> yours was the inspiration behind that tagline anyway, of course! Haha.

944~~~
Wanted to see him come on much earlier

945~~~
I did to, was slightly annoyed it was left so late. Personally, as soon as it got to 3-0 I would of had him on the pitch.

946~~~
Van Gaal gave him just five minutes ffs.

947~~~
This guy needs to play more, not saying he should start every game but 20 mins every now and then would be good to test him out, surprised he didn't get a look in against Derby. Don't think he will hang around if he stays on the bench every week.

948~~~
i don't really understand the point of making that sub... why couldn't he come on around the 75th minute at the very least?

i mean it's not like he's gonna feck up the game is he?

949~~~
Could've given both him and Depay half an hour last night easily. The game was over as a contest. No wonder the lads getting pissed off.

950~~~
There's always something some users can complain about, even if it's only about 10 minutes more or less a player didn't play. 
Pereira is stll young and has a lot of time to show what he's capable of.

951~~~
Why? It's not a big deal at this age. He is 20. He has lots of time

952~~~
Exactly, Pogba was patient and it paid off.

953~~~
Pogba wasn't getting any chance. This guy gets games. Plus pogba left on a free. I doubt if he was on a 3 year contract juve would have paid for him our asking fee.

954~~~
Yeah, I know. Just saying that because he's just 20 does not mean he should be hardly getting any time. If he's good enough he's old enough (which he clearly isn't seeing as he does not play).

955~~~
Striker, Centre back and Central Midfield are the hardest positions for a young player to break in for a team. The tactical discipline and also the responsibility of constant performance in those positions means a lot of youngsters don't start off playing there.

Full back positions, attacking midfielders and wingers/wide forwards are less tactically brutal for a young player and is good fo expressing yourself and just playing your natural game. Thats why, most cases of young players breaking through will see them play in those positions first before moving towards their most natural central position. Problem for United is their best youth players are not really effective in those positions and you have a manager who expects the same tactical discipline from every position on the field.

956~~~
He's not good enough? The reason he doesn't play is because of the amount of central midfield players we have (Inc. #10) and no he's not a wide player. Do you think Lingard or CBJ would be playing if we weren't so short on players outwide and FB? They not good enough too?

957~~~
Maybe he's still a little fazed by playing in front of 78,000 expectant fans. I know I would be. 5 minutes gets him used to it. 

There's no way of know what his issue is right now. I do think, however, he's still lacking in strength and quickness of mind. I think LvG is right to ease him in slowly for those reasons alone.

958~~~
Exactly, he's not good enough to play ahead of players who are better than him which is why he doesn't play, not because of age.

959~~~
Was Pogba not good enough? Was Di Maria not good enough?

960~~~
Pogba was clearly not good enough to play in midfield for United in Ferguson's eyes and Di Maria did not fit the team.

961~~~
But Rafael and Park were apparently! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

962~~~
Pogba was deemed not good enough to play in a midfield two, which is completely different to playing in a midfield three alongside Pirlo/Marchisio/Vidal. Rafael and Park were a gamble but so would have been Pogba who had been so poor playing against Championship side Crystal Palace just a month prior that he had to be moved to CB because we were being outplayed in midfield.

Di Maria was obviously good enough but stopped trying after three months.

963~~~
Oh come on. There's no way Pogba would have been worse than Rafael in a midfield 2. Park was having a really bad season that year compared to his brilliant season the year before.

964~~~
I never said Pogba would have been worse, I said he'd have been a gamble. The way the story is told it's as if we had an already proven top class player sat on the bench, when in reality we had a talented player who had thus far looked out of his depth playing senior football.

965~~~
Nice to see him get another chance today.

966~~~
Give him a permanent chance, he has loads of ability and cant do much worse than Mata.

967~~~
I wish we had given him a bit more time, nothing left to lose at this point.

968~~~
Him making that run at the end, picking the ball up and booting it after the final whistle automatically meant he'd performed significantly better than any midfield player on the pitch.

969~~~
Ha, i thought the same thing. You can tell he cared... He was desperate to make an impression, and I really hope he gets more minutes now.

970~~~
He is getting chance to play very rarely and too late in the game when we are already in hopeless situation. He has to start on Monday night.

971~~~
Can't understand why he hasn't been given more opportunities really. He probably wishes he went to play somewhere else.

972~~~
Wonder if he isn't slightly annoyed by the fact that he's managed to start only one more game then Donald Love has for United this season...

973~~~
Wasn't he moved to CB because we got a defender sent off in that match?

974~~~
I did like seeing that and glad others saw it too. About time one of our players showed some passion on the pitch. It especially contrasted well with Mata's non-tackle before the 2nd goal which probably contributed to Pereira coming on in the first place.

I do really want to see Pereira given a proper chance in the team, practically no-one is rightfully keeping him out of the side right now in any of the 3 positions behind the striker (if Martial is to play the no.9 now). I've watched Pereira play since he was in the U18s, he's earned his chance now in my opinion and I hope he is given it.

975~~~
Personally I just don't get the hype.

He's championed as one of the brightest prospects the academy has seen in years but he looks some way off being ready for the first team for me. Obviously you have to take his age into account but I don't think he's shown anywhere near enough in the matches he's played to warrant the game time everyone seems to think he deserves.

I'd love to be proved wrong but he isn't someone I think will end up being a United level player.

976~~~
How can you judge him? He hasn't really been given a fair chance yet and you're writing him off?

977~~~
Was a bit pointless putting him on at that stage

Going into a game were the other 10 players have long since given up, against a small no name club who are taking the piss surely isn't going to help anyones development

Its more like punishment

978~~~
Said as much in a recent interview. He wanted to go out on loan but van Gaal blocked it.

979~~~
Nope, we didn't have anyone sent off. Carrick was playing CB iirc, and they were switched around because Pogba couldn't get into the game at all in midfield.

980~~~
sfsdfs
lol, he played like 30 minutes in 45 games so far this season, only retards would judge him by that, let alone Van Gaal never pick an easy match for him to send him on to feature in his usual 8 minutes per month

981~~~
What are you on about? He came on when we lost the game already and played like shit. What did you expect? He hardly got any minutes yet you want him to show more in matched - so basically in the last 5 mins of the odd game?

982~~~
Yeah, he deserves a chance, I never watched him n the youth teams but from what I've seen in the first team in his cameos, is that he looks a little light weight, almost Mata like, neat and tidy but ultimately ineffectual. 
Regardless he deserves at least a few starts if purely on the basis that everyone else is a pile of shit.

983~~~
He is like Mata regarding his spacial intelligence and ability on the ball, free kicks, penetrative passing etc. He is dissimilar to Mata in that he has some pace and he likes a tackle, there is aggression in him. He can also go past players with skill (see his goal in the u20 World Cup final) and he takes corners from both sides with either foot. In terms of ability he I believe he us that best we have at his age. He has only played 90 minutes once for us and really does deserve more minutes to prove himself. Similar with Pogba, as the talent level is so high, he should be given as much time as possible to come good IMO.

984~~~
Why not at this stage. Just give him a few starts

985~~~
he will start against shrewsbury, hopefully he bags a goal and an assist to show he needs a real game

986~~~
No start for the boy. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

987~~~
i'm absolutely gutted for him. what the feck has he done that he can't get a start?

988~~~
You would expect him to start today but still no start.

It has to be said, LvG from his time at United has always given youth players starts so maybe Pereira is not doing something right in training.

989~~~
Knowing van Gaal Pereira is probably the best player in training but van Gaal wants to prove he's a genius and makes bold decision to start everyone else ahead of him.

990~~~
that's one of the things that drives me mad about lvg... he gets this ridiculous praise for playing youth, when in fact he only plays youth because people are injured. otherwise he doesn't play them... martial being the exception.

991~~~
He gives players time mainly if they're defenders/first team players are injured. The youth attackers probably haven't had their senses dulled and actually try to play enjoyable football, if the U21 performances are anything to go by.

992~~~
precisely.

993~~~
Well thats hardly fair. He plays the youth when players are injured because he deliberately sold back up players so they would be next in line.

994~~~
i don't believe that for a second. if lvg told me 2+2=4 i'd still require a second source, because nothing he says or does resembles sensibility.

995~~~
Did you miss our fire sales of the past two summers?

996~~~
How shit have you got to be if you can't get ahead of the shit that plays week in week out?

997~~~
i am no expert on youth development, i only know what i see what i read and what i hear.

for my money, januzaj, pereira and wilson are the top three youngsters (not including shaw and martial who are established), and his treatment of all three beggars belief. ok, so on the back end there are a few players showing promise such as CBJ. who else has he brought forward? 

the fire sales were needed, but what he did after wasn't right.

998~~~
Pereira is a funny one. It's obvious he has a huge amount of talent and great technique but his performances are generally a bit hit and miss imo. 

He might be someone we just need to have some faith in and see if the bigger stage brings out the best in him. Playing at U21 level won't always be enough to stimulate a player of his ability. Pogba for example never really turned it on at reserve level but flourished once he got a chance to play first team football at Juve. 

I worry that if he doesn't get a chance now he never will. LVG seems to try all the youngsters except the good ones and I don't see Jose as the type who would ever be brave enough to put his trust in a young player with limited experience

999~~~
what performances?

and whatever these performances are, how can they be any worse than the dross we've been subject to time and time again?

1000~~~
U21s

1001~~~
You don't expect him to play the youth when the first teamers are fit though do you? He has a duty to play his strongest team and unless the young players are that good (like Martial) you would expect the youth to wait patiently.

Lingard has taken Mata and Memphis' place in the side. He's also played CBJ consistently when he could easily move Blind to LB and play Carrick at CB.

LvG is a moron but when it comes to giving youth a chance I have no complaints at all, he stayed true to his word and has given chances.

1002~~~
i'm not trying to be a prick here, but what do you mean by u21's? he's probably been the best player for the best team in the u21's.

1003~~~
What has he done to get one? He's looked more like getting sent off than doing anything useful anytime he has come on.

1004~~~
lingard is 23 years old... hardly "youth".

1005~~~
that same question could easily apply to ten of our starting eleven.

1006~~~
Aside from the propensity to fly into dangerous tackles you could. It doesn't make it a travesty that he's not playing. If that's the only way you can answer my question then that says a lot.

1007~~~
ah, then i give up.

i think i've said all i can here. each to their own, i guess!

1008~~~
I don't understand this. Probably our brightest academy product and can't get a game.

1009~~~
I'll be surprised if he doesn't leave this summer and I wouldn't hold it against him. He's been overlooked over and over again.

1010~~~
What's his natural position?

1011~~~
Nah you're not being a prick. I'm a huge fan of Pereira. I've long said he'll be a first team player. He's been good in the U21s but I don't think he's been so good that you'd say he definitely deserves to be in the first team. Still has a lot of inconsistency in his game. Huge talent though

1012~~~
Surely he has to get half an hour in this one

1013~~~
Everywhere since he's come on.

1014~~~
In a good way or negatively? I think he's been OK, but not amazing. He looks quicker than I was given the impression he was. Also looks like he has a fight in him.

1015~~~
Offensive #8.

1016~~~
How has he not started more games? So lively and his technique, first touch and movement is impressive.

1017~~~
Too good not to play. He's been quality.

1018~~~
Great performance.

1019~~~
I am half watching the game to be fair, but the glimpses I have had, he's been sloppy.

1020~~~
Thought he did very well.

1021~~~
Should have had 2 assists, we def need a central player who can take the ball on the turn and carry the ball, he seems to have that

1022~~~
He just oozes class.  I'd like to see him given a go ahead of Herrera at the moment.

We can't let it turn into another Pogba situation as we'll regret it if we don't hold on to him.

1023~~~
Think he's a #10.

1024~~~
I don't think so, personally. He's always shown himself to be gritty defensively despite the wiry frame (the occasional suicide tackle and all), with good natural pace and the ability to dribble forward with the ball fairly easily when space is ahead of him; his U20 solo Brazil goal is a good example. That aspect of his game is normally shared with other types of midfielders like Modric, Wilshere, Dembele, Thiago etc. Obviously he's nowhere near as polished, but you get the point.

1025~~~
Good positive performance from him, he was always looking to get the ball forwards which was great to see. Really hope he can kick on and get some more appearances now.

1026~~~
Tend to agree

1027~~~
So he's basically a younger Hererra...?

1028~~~
Madness. He oozes class that lad.

1029~~~
No, his ability on the ball is way better and Ander can only dream of his passing range.

The other lads need to take note on how he takes the ball on the turn while under pressure.

1030~~~
Yeah I can't disagree with any of that and ultimately I'd prefer him to be an #8, they're a bit of a premium at the moment. I just think he'll ultimately end up behind the striker, similar to Barkley and alli.

1031~~~
Sort of, I guess. I think he has a natural capacity that is more reserved than Herrera's frantic, high-tenacity style. Herrera also lacks the technique in his long passing, an area I think Pereira will grow in as he progresses.

1032~~~
He's quality. Deserves to be starting at the moment.

1033~~~
Criminally underused this season, could have been our shining light besides Martial.

1034~~~
Nice cameo.  Kids got some potential.  I also remember I think he's an ace with a dead ball?

1035~~~
Scored a free kick for us in the League Cup and scored directly from a corner for the U21s, of which he told Varela he was going to shoot from. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1036~~~
No harm in hoping. Just don't bet any money on it..

He looks good virtually every time he plays; and then it's back to the bench for the next 6 games.

1037~~~
It's a shame he gets so few minutes. It's refreshing to see someone who is willing to beat their man or make something happen.

1038~~~
Yep. Free kick, shots or dangerous crossed balls. He also take corners with both feet. His talent level is very very high.

1039~~~
You saw right. Has a lot of football in him but right now needs time.

1040~~~
He looks fantastic on the ball, I know they were dirt but his touch is quality. He's an exciting player on the ball, very comfortable. You sense he can make something happen when he receives it. That must be the reason Van Gaal doesn't play him much. He doesn't suit the side to side footballing philosophy.

1041~~~
Good way. Keeps asking for the ball and running the game.

1042~~~
A little over eager when he first came on but settled in well and was opening them up and dictating the play in the last 15 minutes.

1043~~~
He will be a top player. I can't be more certain of it. Been watching him since he was 16. It will be a travesty he doesn't make it here.

1044~~~
Oh yeah.  I remember now.  He was ace in that game

1045~~~
So can be our next no7?

1046~~~
I worry for players like Pereira when/if Mourinho takes over at this club.

1047~~~
Okay , I just meant in a positional sense, not necessarily potential.

1048~~~
In what sense? Numerically sure.

He has the high talent level but if he can produce on the big stage is a different matter altogether. I believe he will though. I just think there is a confidence about him, a cockiness even,

1049~~~
No I meant maybe as a wide right attacker in. 4231 formation.  In place of Lingard.  
We need some genuine class in that position going forward.

1050~~~
Best senior run-out so far. First time he's really looked like the same player he is for the U21s, imposing himself on the game and looking to make things happen.

Anyone enjoying or appreciating the likes of Lingard, Pereira, CBJ, Varela, Keane, Riley et al but also keen on Mourinho is fooling themselves. You can have your 'proven winner', and probably will, but be prepared to say goodbye to the youth tradition.

1051~~~
He can definitely play there I think but he is better through the centre. In the kind of position Herrera plays. He could play number 10 as well.

1052~~~
I rate his crossing, he could do a job on the wings but he's more effective through the middle.

Bit like Cazorla in that sense.

1053~~~
We have too many no 10s!!  

Given his crossing and dribbling skills I think he should try and get a slot in place of Lingard.  He can make a play for no 10 later in his career!  

I'd love to have a young Beckham type player again who can strike a ball like a ping pong ball.

1054~~~
Lingard has goals in him but our right wing is so uncreative with him playing there. I would drop Lingard for Pereira.

1055~~~
Would like to see him in a floating three behind the striker (with Lingard and Memphis). Dont restrict them given the movement of all three.

This guy defo needs more more more minutes with the first team.

1056~~~
He's looks ace, <b>should </b>get a good run in the first team now with all the injuries.

1057~~~
I would suspect he would be out on loan for a season in the PL or maybe somewhere abroad if/when Mou takes over.

1058~~~
Woodward's remarks a few weeks back about the academy and the importance of youth was very pointed, I think, and this will be something that the board will impress upon whoever replaces LVG. If Mourinho comes in he will know what's expected in this regard and given the environment here (how we won't sack him if doesn't win the trophy) he won't feel the pressure to put immediate glory over the development of youth. Granted he won't go to extremes like Pochettino would or Giggs will but players like Pereira will definitely get opportunities.

1059~~~
Don't count on it.

1060~~~
Positive approach with always looking to make himself available for the pass and tries to be inventive when in possesion, really should be given much more playing time!

1061~~~

1062~~~
Good news

1063~~~
his movement is fantastic, looks like flying on the ball, has the speed to operate in those tight areas even though it's not his preferred position. He'd be killing it in a functional team. wouldn't mind to rotate him with Mata more, Juanito looked burnt at most of the games this year. Certainly more movement wouldnt do us harm, I also thing that Andreas is very creative and can shoot as well, has the skill to go past player, almost think he would be an upgrade on Mata but he won't get better if he sits on a bench all year, that's how I feel angry with Vangle...

1064~~~
Get him on for Mata.

1065~~~
Bit unfortunate that although we've had huge amounts of injuries, we've still be well stocked in his positons, glad to see him getting some minutes, needs to be more though.

1066~~~
He should be getting more minutes I agree, especially while Lingard has been poor.

1067~~~
Loving the highlights. Very metro.

1068~~~
I'd be playing him ahead of Lingard.

1069~~~
LvG sees him as direct competition for Mata. His time will come soon

1070~~~
Id start him next FA Cup game tbh.

1071~~~
Maybe but Lingard has some experience now and has scored some important goals.  Tonight was not the night to play yet another kid when a more experienced player was available.

But generally I agree with you, Pereira shows a lot of potential and deserves some proper game time to demonstrate if he can make the step up.

1072~~~
Lingard has been extremely poor and Pereira cant be any worse. In the pre-season games he showed he can play on the wing if needed. There is no way Lingard should start games

1073~~~
agreed with all of this. pereira indeed was very good in summer on the wing.

1074~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1075~~~
With everyone else getting chances, wonder when he gets some more ?

1076~~~
He's just unlucky he's a number 10 and one of our best players is also a number 10 and in good form.

1077~~~
I don't think he'll make it here.

1078~~~
Bit awkward now that Januzaj is back because that's extra competition off the bench for minutes out wide. Hope he gets some minutes against Watford.

1079~~~
It's like that episode of Simpsons where all he all star baseball players go missing or can't play for whatever reason, except the guy playing Homer's position

1080~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvMHRIiuFQQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1081~~~
In terms of Pace and his ability to beat a man with a dribble, how far along is he ? I have seen him do really impressive things in tight spaces, but when/if he actually goes at defenders like a Martial or Januzaj, is he effective ? Because I cannot see how else he is going to get much game time. van Gaal doesn't hesitate to put the likes of Martial, Rashford  on the wing, TFM on the left of defence, but seemingly opts to play Pereira in CM (Ignoring the friendlies played) whenever he is given a few rare minutes. That's why I asked the question in the first sentence. Is he good enough to play on the flanks ?

1082~~~
Hope this lad gets another chance soon. Lingard is looking like he needs a rest and I'd sooner see this lad given a shot on the right before Januzaj. Perhaps if Mata eventually needs a rest he might get a shot in the number 10 spot, although I suspect this will be only if Rooney is unavailable.

Was it the Wolfsburg home match he was brought on and seemed to really struggle? I think that set him back a little which is a little unfair given the high pressured situation he was being brought into.

1083~~~
Dont bother looking for reasons why he's not playing, there arent any.

1084~~~
Him and Januzaj have obviously stepped out if line or aren't current flavour of the months.

Pereira in particular has always been cast aside by lvg anyway. At least Januzaj got a loan, but I reckon LVG doesn't rate Pereira as highly as the others. Plus there's the Brazilian thing...

1085~~~
How Fellaini waltz into the team ahead of him amazes me

1086~~~
Obviously he's needed more for the U21. We have Fellaini back now.

1087~~~
He'll break into the team.Patience is needed.

1088~~~
He should have forcefully asked for a loan atleast.

1089~~~
He wasn't allowed to go and he doesn't get to play. Philosophy. Development. Reaching potential.

1090~~~
Pereira thinking to himself 'I'm the best player in the U21 I'm sure I'll get my chance soon'

AP: what do you think of my chances of playing in the first team?
LVG : I believe in you, you have great potential
AP: will I get a chance this week?
LVG: sorry, Lingard shall play
AP: this week maybe
LVG: No, Tuanzebe will
AP: what about this week?
LVG: No, its Fletcher turn
AP: this week?
LVG: erm nah, its CBJ
AP: Please
LVG: maybe, just kidding Varela
AP: Hi
LVG: Love
AP: maybe
LVG: not a chance, Riley will play
AP: now
LVG: no, Rothwell this week
AP: you do know I'm still here right
LVG: yes but it's Keane this week that's why we bought him back
AP: come on just 1 game
LVG: Januzaj is back, yay
AP: .....
LVG: Sorry Powell
AP: how about now
LVG: Rashford shall get a chance
AP: Who?
AP: Its going to be Mensah this week isn't it?
LVG: Yes
AP: FFS!
LVG: no, his name is Weir

1091~~~
Yeah pretty much. And with Mata gone for Sunday I still don't expect him to play. Or even get on the bench for that matter.

1092~~~
Start him against West Ham ffs, I will cry if Fellaini is the #10.

1093~~~
Can't see anyway he will play. Pretty sure Herrera or Fellaini will be used instead of Mata. Clearly LVG doesn't really rate him or think he deserves a chances. If he isn't putting the effort in behind the scenes fair enough but at some point effort showing on the pitch has to count for something and we've had some spineless performances from players in the role he is being denied.

1094~~~
<i>Has </i>to start in the FA Cup.

1095~~~
You're having a giraffe, he'll start tomorrow for the U21, its the only chance we'll have of winning a trophy this season.

1096~~~
It's pretty stupid that he isn't even making the squad now, same goes for Januzaj. I doubt either would've made a difference today because of how ineffective we are against teams like West Brom but our options from the bench are so restrictive.

We'll probably play Herrera or Fellaini at #10 against West Ham. Pereira will be sat on the bench, or worse yet, fail to make the squad.

1097~~~
Surely he's thinking about his options of moving on, I would if I was him

1098~~~
Precisely. I can see Fellaini taking the ten spot, and Valencia taking a spot on the bench. No room for Pereira or Januzaj here.

1099~~~
He's going to leave and be a star for someone.

1100~~~
Definitely one of the biggest travesties this season has to be that Andreas hasn't had "bench performances" or "lost in the wilderness" or some other tag added to his performance thread. Disappointing.

1101~~~
That's what I feel to, So frustrating seeing us give him so limited opportunities while persevering with average tat like Lingard. I really think that in years in to come we will look back at that in astonishment similar to when Pogba was left on the bench while we played a central midfield of Rafael \ Park vs Blackburn

1102~~~
Not sure if he's being punished or what because he is playing in a reserve cup match today so he isn't injured (along with Januzaj). We could have definitely done with them vs West Brom giving our lack of attacking options.

1103~~~
Not in the squad again. <i>Match rhythm-less </i>Schweinsteiger and James Weir seem to make the cut ahead of him on the bench, whilst Fellaini starts.

1104~~~
the extra kicker in this is that LVG didn't allow him to go out on loan, either.

1105~~~
Seriously. Ah well, he'll get his time out on loan when/if Mourinho takes over. Probably won't ever result in him coming back to play here, but a loan nonetheless.

1106~~~
He didn't train either so probably picked up a knock in the u21 game

1107~~~
Definitely a more rational reason to gravitate my doom and gloom. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1108~~~
:-D

1109~~~
Should buy out his own contract if he doesn't start, considering his <i>competition</i> in Mata is suspended and every other midfielder we have can barely string a pass.

1110~~~
What you talking 'bout? Liam Schweinstegier and Marouane Chester are back. No freaking way. A bench spot and he should consider himself lucky.

1111~~~
Not a chance mate, Pereira and Januzaj will start for the u21 against the scousers tonight, theyre far too talented for the first squad

1112~~~
Doesn't seem he was injured yesterday.

1113~~~
Great...

1114~~~
again... this is a guy who was refused a loan by lvg in january. feck lvg pisses me off...

1115~~~
All about the youth, though. Definitely.

1116~~~
Would love to see him slightly deeper than the 10 position again. I felt that was his best position.

1117~~~
... he doesn't even train with the first team anymore, does he?

1118~~~
His future at the club is not looking bright, is it?

Can't have too much of a strong opinion on the matter. Everytime he has played for the first team (which is pretty much all I judge any youth player on) he's looked up to the level without looking outstanding.

I'll be gutted if he goes on to another club and becomes a top player however, at the moment, if he's sold, then I've got to trust the judgement of the manager and coaching staff. It would most likely mean that his mentality isn't at the level we want him to be at, as it's obvious the lad has plenty of talent and ability.

1119~~~
That's normally a sound way of forming an opinion, but I do not trust LVG in any form. If this was any other top flight manager of note, then sure enough. But LVG simply hasnt got a clue.

1120~~~
He's being punished from not treating the U21s matches serious enough me think.

1121~~~
Better than lingard who waltzes into the team most weeks. Probably the most creative player at the club at the minute.

He deserves a chance but I fear he will leave and we will regret it in years to come

1122~~~
He's been garbage in his last few U21 games. Constantly giving the ball away.

He definitely should have gotten more minutes but right now he's no case for being in the first XI.

1123~~~
Hysteria has reached fever pitch when people can compare BFS to Liam Millar... Insanity indeed <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Now he is in the squad so will that stop the moaning?

No, apparently he should play instead of a guy who has constantly proven a work ethic and end product that Pereira has not...

At last, a voice of reason! Thankfully our team selection is based on form in games (and performance in training) rather than the 'Caf Relative Assessment of Performances' (CRAP) approach, where potential is inversely proportional to the number of games that you play in...

1124~~~
To be fair his level for the U21s when he initially came back down from first team football/training was good, it's obviously slackened a little due to his response to mistreatment.

1125~~~
This is a post about the U21s for the last fixture. Januzaj is cup-tied anyway for the senior squad.

1126~~~
Nah he's been really sloppy with his basic passing these last few games. There's no excuse for that.

1127~~~
There's no excusing that, yeah, but there is an excuse and it is quite probably motivational/the hump at mistreatment.

1128~~~
Himself and Januzaj were taking the piss in u21 games trying to outdo each other with pointless flicks and trying to score from corners in games where they weren't even winning. They got a telling off for it and Januzaj has tried harder the last couple of games where as Pereira has looked completely disinterested. I agree that he should have had more chances with the first team but that type of behavior is completely unprofessional and shows a lack of respect for other players who are doing their best to impress at that level and as first team players they should be setting the standard for the other u21 players not acting less professionally than them.

1129~~~
I'm going to be he leaves us soon, which will be a shame.

1130~~~
Not in the squad again along with Januzaj.

1131~~~
Adnan isnt eligible.

As for Pereira, he cant wait to see the back of feckface Louis.

1132~~~
Wait until he sees his replacement <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1133~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1134~~~
He's got Pogba written all over him, probably not the same class but he will become a very good player elsewhere.

1135~~~
Can we PLEASE start playing this guy? Drop Mata for him already.

1136~~~
LVG didn't allow him to go on loan strangely and doesn't use him either while picking likes of Weir ahead of him. 

It's kinda bizarre. 

When Januzaj was allowed a stupid loan to Dortmund where he had more competition and where we lacked even more in numbers, why wasn't Pereira allowed ?

Wonder what he must be feeling at this stage. Won't be surprised if he pushes for a permanent move now either.

1137~~~
He's being punished. Think both he he and Januzaj will be on loan or sold next season.

1138~~~
Yeah I think both will go in Summer unfortunately. So frustrating when you see the likes of Lingard start every week who is nowhere good enough.

1139~~~
Regarding Pereira's 'lack of work ethic' in recent Under 21 games: I don't blame the guy to be brutally honest. You have games in the first team where you play pretty decent and don't look out of place, to then not even get in the squad while you watch the less talented likes of Jesse Lingard start every game, Riley get on the bench ahead of you etc.That must be very annoying and demoralizing. Add to the fact that Van Gaal's man management skills are woeful, that certainly will not help the situation either. He is that age now where he needs to be playing more regularly at a higher level, To have to play under 21 games in front of 250 people wouldn't motivate me either at this point.

1140~~~
Your one man crusade against Lingard is utterly tiresome. The least you could do is keep it in the Lingard thread

1141~~~
It's not just been a lack of work ethic, he's actually been very poor these last few games. Constantly giving the ball away. When you're doing that against Oldham reserves you can't expect a call up to Premier League football.

1142~~~
I was talking about Pereira and Januzaj leaving which was the topic of conversation, I made a brief comment about Lingard because he is the starter in a position that both of these guys play, therefore he is an obstacle in their path for a starting place. I don't have a 'crusade' against the guy, I have given him credit where it is due (the last 2 games for example), However I don't have the blinkers on regarding him either like some do.

1143~~~
O yeah I agree in the fact he isn't helping his own aspirations to make it here by doing that. But I think at this point as long as Van Gaal is at the club he knows he probably isn't going to make it anyways and that is why he has his lax attitude, which does affect performances.

1144~~~
Lingard has the far better attitude and application. Neither of them have done anything to merit a start if I'm honest.

1145~~~
We got offers from Leicester City iirc. What if we didnt let him go on loan so as to not get the Januzaj treatment there and end up wasting 6 months of his career not playing at all? At least here he could play in the reserves. How often would he play in Leicester especially when they have in form players and would want him only as a back up as they have to win every game for their title challenge?

1146~~~
Its almost as if people in here believe that van Gaal is benching him for the feck of it. 

My understanding is that van Gaal and Joyce is trying to get a message across that he needs to be 100 percent professional to reach his potential. He has the talent to be world class, but his work ethic will have to be there aswell. At the top, the inches can make all the difference between average and world class. And if Pereira consider himself too good to give it all for Joyce at the age of 20, he is defintley not mature enough to be a star at Man Utd. I bet Ferguson would have done the same, and maybe if we had done the same to Januzaj he would be closer to reaching his talent today? 

Rashford, Lingard and Weir appear to be very down to earth. Maybe that is part of the reason van Gaal trust them.

1147~~~
Pereira has had very limited chances though in comparison. Lingard has a much higher work rate, no doubt about it, but technically he is worse.

1148~~~
It would be laughable if this happens. Hopefully the higher ups at OT see sense in keeping our two biggest prospects. We're not bloody Bayern to be sticking big talents in the U21's. We start Fellaini. Fellaini!

1149~~~
He had offers from Leicester, PSV and Malaga. The latter two would've been great - PSV were his former club and he speaks the language of Flemish (Belgian-Dutch) and a move at Malaga could've ended up how Charly Musonda is doing for Real Betis. It was definitely a wasted opportunity.

1150~~~
He didn't play much this season because our senior attacking midfielders were never injured.

1151~~~
Exactly and he isn't the most attacking AM either. He is more similar to a Herrera at Am than A mata or Rooney.

1152~~~
Ashley Young could have done the same last season but he kept his head down and proved his usefulness in time. These are beginners and fuelling some sort of entitlement from people is damaging.

1153~~~
Oh yeah, I agree from what I've seen, but the work rate probably applies to training, post match performance reviews, attitude in general. Whilst he may be technically inferior, I'd rather play someone who's willing to put the effort in to play.

1154~~~
Scored for Brazil's Olympic Team

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/iDOH06q2XuD/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

1155~~~
The striker doesn't seem too happy that Pereira went for the shot, despite scoring.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1156~~~
He'll put himself on the radar this summer, Juve will make him a star.

1157~~~
sorry i Missed this.

He got offers but there is no point in getting a move to the dutch league. Anyway I'm sure he was kept as a backup as we were suffering injury after injury but then lingard showed more in training than pereira or memphis so he got the nod. He himself seems to have been a bit underwhelming too (i havent seen but going by the posts here ffrom people who seem to have watched him) which didnt help him either. 

He has 2 years on his contract. Unless juve pays 30m or so, it seems unlikely that he would be sold.

1158~~~
He only recently signed a 4 year contract didn't he?

1159~~~
Personally think any player should be proud to wear any United shirt & put in a shift, in any game they play. I don't get anyone who considers a player right in putting their needs before the clubs. These guys are very well paid & very privileged & I fail to understand why people make excuses for them?

1160~~~
I think it was a 3+1 he signed in 2015. This summer he would have 2 years left.

1161~~~
Yeah but you could spin it the other way. The fact that LVG is starting Fellaini over Pereira suggests Pereira isn't that big a talent, certainly not in Pogba's class. 

This is LVG we are talking about - a man who has given first-team spots to Blackett, McNair and Lingard over the past couple of years. None of those players is ever going to be a world-beater. So if Pereira can't break into the team, maybe he's just not that good - or at least not that good <i>yet</i>.

Does anyone think LVG would have passed up the chance to play Pogba had their spells at Old Trafford coincided?

1162~~~
I don't think LVG is taking talent into account when playing the youth players.

1163~~~
We sold Welbz for 16 million and Nani for about 7 or so? We're never going to sell Pereira for 30m.

1164~~~
You're missing it, as Pereira is far more talented than any of Blackett and McNair, thats more than obvious for everyone who has watched more than two u21 matches. LvG hands out chances to the players he needs, we have many injuries in defence, and injury prone defenders, that's why he's called up so many young defenders in his tenure (McNair, Reece James, Blackett, CBJ, Love, Fosumensah, Williams, Tuanzebe, Joe Riley) while we have more than enough (attacking) midfielders available, it's definitely harder for midfielders in the academy to break through than defenders. Same goes for Pearson, Rothwell, Goss for example who arent any less talented than Blackett, Love, McNair erc. The only attacking talents who have got chances from the academy are pretty much Wilson, Rashford.

1165~~~
Neither of them were wanted by us. We clearly rate Pereira which is why we gave him a new deal last year. Highly unlikely we will sell him.

1166~~~
Wasnt so fed up with a youth player not getting chances in the first team for quite a long time. He behaved fine for half a season, until van Gaal decided to not loan him out and gave every youth player with 2 legs and a half a brain starts except for him. Then he started sulking, which is normal. The sooner the Dutch idiot is gone, the better.

1167~~~
Well said class player great potential but being frozen out cos he does summit different when he has the ball as opposed to passing sideways and backwards. He needs a chance ffs

1168~~~
It's a difficult one to judge either way though. SAF who wasn't scared to give youth a chance either - & I'm sure he was obviously aware of Pogba's talent, also missed a beat to play him. These things sometimes happen.

1169~~~
makes too many forward passes, always looking to move the play up the pitch. that's not what our players are supposed to do.

great goal though.

1170~~~
So another one for Brazil scored from the left side this time with effective run to the edge of a centre. He loves the living crap out of this angle.

If Mensah and Jackson had their chance he should easily get at least 30-45 minutes on the pitch.

1171~~~
Lads going to be in trouble when he get back

1172~~~
Why?

1173~~~
Scored a goal and played with attacking intent. LVG does not likey

1174~~~
As long he likes to watch "who can score from corner" competition between him and Januzaj while other 8 of their teammates are made to look like they arent worth their time.

1175~~~
Well that just does it for me, feck em both off or let their talents rott in reserves, how could 2 audaciously talented players do such a thing. They do not deserve any game time at all. I want them banned from playing football ever again, its criminal.

1176~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1177~~~
exactly. so they were pricks in one game, big fecking deal. it's a problem if it happens more than once, but it never did. i watched the game myself, and the sweet irony is that they very nearly scored.

1178~~~
They did it in 3/4 games though not 1

1179~~~
This.

It has nothing to do with "Goals ? LVG doesn't like that, lololololololololols" It is a pattern of disrespect towards their team mates and the club.

1180~~~
I don't remember 3-4 matches. There's nothing wrong with trying to score from the corner so long as it's clearly not some mini game like in that 1 match.

1181~~~
They were at it during the Sunderland (h) and Middlesbrough (A) games for sure, hints of it during the Norwich 7-0 game until Januzaj went off as well. There was one more that I can't remember.

1182~~~
Pair of dickheads

1183~~~
Again, maybe I felt those instances weren't going overboard. I feel like adnan threatens the goalkeeper often, but in that 1 match it reeked of some disrespectful mini game.

1184~~~
I don't recall losing any of those game so big fecking deal

1185~~~
Adnan took 3 against Norwich, one on target which won another corner and 2 into the box, 1 of which led to a goal. I'll have to go back to the Boro game but the Sunderland match is the only one that really stood as them doing it.

1186~~~
Yeah I went back and checked the game threads and only the sunderland match fits that description. Although part of my criticism of adnan in that match was not just corners, but also general selfishness.

1187~~~
It wasn't just about corners

1188~~~
There's something wrong with it when you've already been told to stop doing it. The teams work on set pieces in training so so to completely disregard that shows a lack of respect for the coaches and other players as far as I'm concerned. I'm a fan of both players but this type of stuff is just stupid and disrespectful especially when they're supposed to be first team squad members so should be setting an example for the other players

1189~~~
Boohoo, I understand that this has tk be adresses but freezing out you're most gifted youth players entirely because of that, seems a bit ott.

1190~~~
Any source for this or just your opinion from watching the games?

Anybody else who watches the reserves agrees with this?

1191~~~
JB knows people who are apart of the academy staff so what he says is about as reliable as you are going to get.

1192~~~
Did feck all today, has a habit of doing feck all a bit too often.

1193~~~
You really expected him to do anything in that team? What him to do the same as others, run, run and run some more without playing football. That was not good football, not creative or exciting, there was no point in him being on the pitch, Rothwell may has well had started. We did not come to play football, we came to restrict the opposition and stop them form playing football. This is the new man utd philosophy, we will always be the underdogs, we will not impose ourselves with football ability, creativity, intelligence. The need for attacking players like Pereira, Januzaj, Wilson, Depay and eventually Martial will not be required to stay at mid table fighting for CL football.

1194~~~
The under 21's have scored more goals than any other team in the league despite playing less games than a lot of other teams along with conceding less than any other team. You seem to base your opinions on the under 21's on the past few games where they've basically been missing all of their attacking and creative players (Wilson, Fletcher, Powell on loan, Rashford with the first team, Keane, Harrop, Goss, Willock, Mitchell injured, Rothwell and Redmond recovering from injury) As well as missing Fosu Mensah and Tuanzebe. Without those players they've had to revert to a more defensive style recently because they've been forced to play players out of position and have still managed to get draws against Liverpool and Chelsea and could quite easily have won the game last night. There were a number of games where they dominated teams completely and had close to 30 shots on goal but don't let things like facts get in the way of yet another brilliantly nonsensical post

1195~~~
Still a bit unsure about Andreas. I've always thought he'd have the best chance as an 8 here, but to make it as a 10 from the academy, I just think you need to be a bit more special than him, at least to be a regular.

Also, I know it's too early to say for sure, but he has real talent coming behind him in his role, and I can't see him, Gribbin and Gomes all making it here, and from what I've seen, I wouldn't back Andreas in a fight between all three in terms of talent. By all reports, Tahith Chong will be coming in too soon.

Definitely too early to call, and ideally he'd have had more chances to show what he can do in the first team, but I don't think there's enough that will stop us signing a player in that role for instance.

1196~~~
He should be playing as a CM, especially ahead of Fellaini

1197~~~
For most of the season, I've been backing him as he's deserved to feature in some capacity in the first team because of how he's been playing (and potentially due to how shite everyone else has been) but recently he's really looked poor and sloppy at U21's level. Perhaps he's demotivated or frustrated but either way, he needs to step it up. He should play like he's fighting for his career but he really isn't showing enough desire.

1198~~~
Hang on a second. Pretty much all of Chelsea's U21 team are either with the first team or out on loan. Both sides were not the preferred choice of players and United had two first team players in their team (Albeit unfit). Pereira playing poorly had nothing to do with his teammates but himself. People should stop making excuses for certain players because they have more talent. Talented players should be demanded more of not less and when guys like Pereira and Januzaj don't play well they should be criticised and not excused.

1199~~~
He should be playing as an 8. Never liked his style at the 10 where he often only looks for his own shot (unless there's an obvious through ball opportunity). Gribbin and gomes should be fighting for the 10 role with gribbin having flexibility to play on the wing. I rather like Andreas using his technique (touch, ball manipulation) to be slippery in midfield to keep possession. Him being slightly further back tends to tear away his habit of looking to create his own shot.

Similar to Adnan, the coaches play him in attacking positions that I don't think they'll be at their best. I know playing them in other positions is something they do for development, but I can't help but want them to play in their best positions sometimes.

1200~~~
Where in that post did I make any excuse for Pereira? He's been atrocious for the past few games

1201~~~
I read the exchange and thought exactly the same. I swear some posters don't bother reading posts but just pick out a few key words that trigger them.

Agree with yourself about the U21's. The no striker situation alone means the team is handicapped.

1202~~~
Yeah the team has been really lacking a focal point in the last few games. Quite a few moves have ended with passes or crosses into good areas but nobody there to take advantage. Even the lads who aren't strikers but could come in and play there like Doughty and Mitchell have been injured as well. The under 18s have had the same problem without Rashford as well but looks like they'll bring in a couple of strikers for next season

1203~~~
Crazy that young lads playing only every other week can get injured so often. Thought Harrop was doing very well but don't think I've seen him for at least a month.

On Pereira I think he needs to go back to basics. Get his short passing back on song and the more elaborate stuff will follow.  He surely can't spend another season in the U21's though.

1204~~~
Never said you did. Just a running theme of this thread where people excuse his bad attitude, lack of respect and poor displays just because he is talented. 

Was just replying to you to point out that Chelsea were under strength too. That's not an excuse for Pereira either as je should perform at that level regardless of who he is playing with/against.

1205~~~
Harrop's injured as well, that's the problem the past few games, not only are the strikers unavailable but a lot of the creative players are as well. Yeah Pereira had outgrown under 21s football last season, he was only put back into the under 21s in January to get match fitness and for the first few games he was very impressive but for the past few games he's been very poor and hasn't looked interested. Hopefully he'll get a decent loan next season

1206~~~
I just don't get it.  In pre-season Pereira was playing at a level well above most of his teammates.  Sure, that's pre-season, but he's barely gotten more than a few minutes of first team action sine then.

1207~~~
Problem is like so many of the young players is the physically haven't got the attributes to play in the Prem or aren't quick enough either. 

With this in mind, who would he displace in the team...

1208~~~

1209~~~
Scored a lovely goal! I've not really rated him from when he's played for the first team but he's doing well tonight.

1210~~~
His talent is undeniable imo, but tonight he was full package. Work rate, attitude, intelligence, discipline. 

If he continues like that he will be a first team regular by this time next season.

1211~~~
Played very well tonight. Lots of ability but just needs to tighten up his passing. Quite frustrating because if he can do that the first team beckons.

1212~~~
Has the quality, impressed with his attitude since he was dropped.

Needs just a bit of motivation that he's actually rated. Give him minutes off the bench.

1213~~~
Fantastic performance.

1214~~~
I thought he was really good today. I loved the goal that he scored but he looked really up for it as well. He was taking on players for fun and I'm pretty sure he was up front, so to say it's not necessarily his natural position he did well. 
He should definitely be involved to some extent between now and the end of the season. 
He must have had some serious attitude problems to not be in the side over the likes of Lingard and Mata.

1215~~~
He did play  in an age group world cup in 2015, it is quite possible that he simply went through a patch where he was quite jaded.

1216~~~
just start him for two, three games instead of Mata/Jesse and see what he can do, he can basically play what Lingard can play so I am not sure why is he so hindered by manager...

1217~~~
When/if he gets a chance I think it's important he comes in and plays for the team. You get the sense with him and Januzaj they think the best way to impress LvG is to do something individually brilliant. If that's the case I don't think they could be more wrong.

Get in the team, play for the team and establish yourself. Then let the individual stuff come through.

1218~~~
Yeah I agree, with Van Gaal it's almost better to have a quiet debut and get the simple stuff right like Tim did when he came on against Arsenal. 
In a sense I understand Van Gaal not playing him, because when he has played he had been sloppy on the ball. But given all the young lads that are playing so well he might as well get 30 minutes at least.

1219~~~
I think both Adnan and Andreas are too expressive for LVG. If we get Mourinho in next I am not sure he would favour either of them. It would be a shame as I am a great fan of Pereira especially.

1220~~~
Think he will be on loan next season.

1221~~~
What's the point of getting him if he doesn't like expressive players? Is that the Utd way?

1222~~~

1223~~~
Wouldn't blame him if he leaves at end of the season in all honesty.

1224~~~
Would be really surprised if we sold him unless we get some huge amount. He signed a new contract just last year.

1225~~~
he signed a new contract a year ago, but i can't help but wonder if he's regretted it.

granted, i'm sure it's for obscene money that he wouldn't have got anywhere else...

1226~~~
i think in regards to a lot of players, we won't have a hot clue until it's known which manager will be in charge. new managers see different things in different players which sometimes come as a surprise. ashley young, fellaini and valencia were all thought to have gone by now, but like cockroaches after a nuclear holocaust, they're still here.

1227~~~
Mourinho likes expressive players. As long as they work hard and off the ball and show a certain amount if defensive rigidity then he actually promotes expression and natural talent on the ball.

1228~~~
Exactly, nobody seems to accept that Mourinho might like smaller less athletic players but he certainly knows how to use them. Fabregas and Hazard were two of chelseas most important players last season, as well as Oscar being an important squad player and in addition he brought in Pedro for this season.

1229~~~
What worries me is Mourinho doesn't usually start fielding young players who are not established already, hopefully he sees something in this lad and gives him a chance

1230~~~
Yeah that part is true, I think he tends to be at teams who want immediate success though and the benefit of playing youth isn't usually as immediate as it has been in the case of Rashford for us. Players like Martial or Shaw wouldn't have any problem getting a place in the team but others would have a struggle. Its hard to tell therefore if he is willing to give youth a chance but it cant be said we are a club who stands by their managers methods anymore if we do get rid of LVG this summer therefore it would be daft of him to not place results and trophies above all else as he would be risking his job. If he would have come in straight after fergie he might have been able to show a different side of his management but now its at the point where we want immediate success.

1231~~~
Because of course, Pogba was getting chances over the likes of Park and Rafael in midfield? It's clear that Pereira deserves a run of games - but LvG is so intent on stamping out creativity that he'd rather play Fellaini instead. Why just Pereira? Even Herrera hasn't really got chances even when fit because he is creative and therefore tends to lose the ball a bit more often. Also, frankly, LvG has only brought in youth team players when there's absolutely nobody else left to play those positions. I would have agreed with your assessment if Fergie was the manager. Not so much with LvG given his stint thus far...

Why loan? He's played a WC in the summer and maybe was jaded (someone else pointed this out too). More importantly, with young kids you need to handle them right to keep motivation levels up. Even in the corporate world, I've seen people go into periods of under-par performance when they're ignored / sidelined for something they perceive as not being their fault. In Pereira, you have a kid who is likely to be extremely confident and aware of his own skills and yet is being forced to see the likes of Fellaini, Mata and even Lingard playing in positions where he's a natural (and they're not). He's seeing the team struggle and yet he continues to not get a chance. It can't be helping his confidence or his motivation and let's not lose sight of his age before castigating him for this.

Personally, I really rate the kid and wish he'd get a run of games in the first team. Given how p*ss-poor our midfield has been almost all season, he can't harm performance and we'd at least have the chance to actually assess how good he really is!

1232~~~
He has. More than enough chances.

1233~~~
What about Azpilicueta, wasn't he fairly young and unproven yet got full confidence from Mourinho? I can see Pereira slowly taking over Mata's role in the team (also more so likely with Mourinho in charge) next season unless we reinforce our #10 situation this Summer.

1234~~~
He was 23 years old, with well over 150 league appearances when Mourinho came to Chelsea the second time.

1235~~~
Ah got ya. Yeah that's quite worrisome for Andreas if Mourinho takes over in the Summer. Perhaps he could get a successful loan spell at a PL club, which wouldn't be the worst thing for his development.

1236~~~
Look what LVG has done to him.

1237~~~
van Gaal driving players to post shitty motivational videos on facebook since 2016.

1238~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> wtf

1239~~~
Oh yeah, successful loan spells. Like so many others before. 
There's Beckham, and, er...

1240~~~
erm...

1241~~~
Welbeck and Evans had fairly decent loan stints at Sunderland.

1242~~~
Beside Welbeck and Evans, I don't think Cleverley at Wigan was a horrible loan spell, it was just that he was never United quality. Give Andreas that same opportunity and see what he can do.

1243~~~
Wtf is this video <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1244~~~
No way he made that.

1245~~~
Yeah, I was thinking more in terms of their eventual long-term development.  But even looking at the success of the actual loan, there aren't many more than those.

1246~~~
John O'Shea had loan spells, Pique went on loan and who knows maybe if we sent Pogba on loan to get playing time he'd still be here. Lingard had loans. 

I don't get the point though, so because no one we have sent on loan in recent times has gone on to be world class it means all loans are useless? That makes no sense for me, our academy has had its weakest production line recently in a long time so loans or not they weren't making it here. 

Just take a quick look at the England national team and Cahill, Rose, Walker, Milner, Wilshere, Sturridge, Henderson, Barkley, Lallana, Drinkwater, Kane, Hart, Carrick and more have all spent time on loans.

1247~~~
Brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1248~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Upcoming:
LVG's video: " I have a friend. He has weird appetite of eating burned BBQ. His dad scolded at him, but he didn't listen. He ended up with stomach illness. My friend finally learned. Word may hurt you, but burned BBQ would damage your health" <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1249~~~
Can't be worse than what Lingard, Depay or Mata have put up lately.

1250~~~
If hes not injured and LVG stays next season, he needs to leave our club for his own sake.

1251~~~

1252~~~
Can't see tweets at work. Could you type down what it says?

1253~~~
He's being Vangaalized..

1254~~~
For those without access to Twitter

1255~~~
Here is one quote from the article...

And here is a link...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-pereira-van-gaal-11321479?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...tball-news/man-utd-pereira-van-gaal-11321479?</a>

1256~~~
All this talk about Van Gaal being the saviour of our youth (a point thrown against Mourinho by many on here) and this is how he treats perhaps our most gifted youngster (apart from Martial who is basically carrying the first team so not including him in this youth list).

1257~~~
How Lingaard is ahead of Pereira in the selection I can't understand.

1258~~~
He does not fit philosophy. Besides it makes sense to play Pereira so van Gaal is absolutely delighted to be able to make an incredibly brave decision of not playing him, it makes him look extra-ordinary. He's been like that forever.

1259~~~
I really think that the reason why Pereira, Wilson and especially Januzaj haven't been played under LVG is because they were already mentioned as big prospects, and so probably LVG wouldn't get the merit on them (especially on the last one) cause everyone knew about them before.

1260~~~
That's the sense you get from his decisions, isn't it?

He does things out of the ordinary so people would praise his genius if it comes off.

He's the that guy in Sunday league football who would ignore you when you're open, opting instead for a no look pass to the guy a long distance away from him.

1261~~~
Yep. He's my best player? He needs to be on the bench, nobody would ever do something like this and I'm true genius for doing this. If he were basketball coach he'd trade Curry for 2nd round pick.

1262~~~
I think so too. So while Rashford and to a certain extent CBJ have done well with the chances, he has picked players from the academy who weren't really thought about as first team material. McNair, Blackett, Love, Varela, Lingard.. So it's not really genius. He is a narcissist who only thinks of his personal glory. Why would we want a man like him in charge?

1263~~~
To think that given the shambolic shampoo of a season, he would have won a few points than cost us!

1264~~~
LVG really hates him doesn't he ?

Got to feel for his treatment this season.

1265~~~
I was hoping he might get a run out for the last 20 mins or so, would have been good since he'll not be playing on Saturday so other players could have had a rest.

1266~~~
Don't see why he'd put him on the bench yet not bother to bring him on when we're 2-0 up.

1267~~~
He is a bigger talent than Januzaj and the best one since Pogba and gets mismanaged and mistreated heavily. He needs to play first team games, has huge potential and was ready for quite some time now. Absolute bollocks

1268~~~
Still don't get why we subbed in Herera and then Depay and not him

1269~~~
if i were him, i'd push for a move away this summer if LVG stays. it wouldn't matter if he has a good summer or not, as he was probably our best player on our summer tour last year. it makes no difference, he won't get played.

feck lvg.

1270~~~
I'd be beyond livid if that were true, one of our most talented academy graduates treated like this. Why not just give him the loan he so badly needed? Wouldn't at all blame him for wanting to leave in summer if LvG stays.

1271~~~
I understand why he's breaking the silence. Who can blame him; he just wants to play football and show what he can do.

1272~~~
I wonder if those are exact quotes, unusual for a player to use the managers name rather than say boss/gaffer etc.....

1273~~~
I thought he'd get a lot more opportunities this season.

1274~~~
Van Gaal has mishandled him, Januzaj and Wilson.

1275~~~
Not looking good

1276~~~
He should leave either way, not a hope Mourinho gives him 5 mins next season.

1277~~~
Aren't these quotes a few months old?

1278~~~
He's obviously going to play in the FA cup final.

1279~~~
These things can happen, LVG may have sincerely believed pereira would play under him and pereira may have believed it too but circumstances can dictate it not happening. Problem is you still need to keep the player sweet and make sure he understands why it has happened and make sure he understands he is still valued and will get his chance, those comments make it look like pereira feels he has been hung out to dry and had minimal contact with LVG.

1280~~~
Pereira knows that he wouldn't play in the FA-Cup final and knows the FA-Cup final is Van Gaal's last match = He can now speak

1281~~~
Or he knows LVG is staying and there's no point in keeping silent because he wants to leave the club <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1282~~~
LvG has mishandled him, Januzaj, Memphis and Wilson.

1283~~~
I believe so too, all the bullshit about him promoting youths this season, it was out of necessity through injuries, selling chico should have been to accommodate Wilson who is an amazing talent, who was the obvious player to fill the gap through his amazing performances up through the academy and u21s, Fellaini playing instead of not just Pereira, which is a waste of talent and not promoting youth, he was preferred most often to Herrera.  Januzaj was our most exciting player in the shit pile that was moyes's tenure, that should have been encouraged, instead he has had 2 seasons of nothing, he looked like he should blossom for us, now I'm not sure he will ever recover the momentum to do anything here.

1284~~~
and yet you could say he's handled Fosu Mensah, Rashford, Borthwick Jackson and Lingard all well. He can't play them all.

1285~~~
Lingard isn't good enough and that's been evident.

Rashford he thrusted into the first team as a hope more than anything, we literally had no-one else.

CBJ has disappeared out of the team until lately and Rojo has been played ahead of him.

1286~~~
Given how many other youngsters he's trusted, do you not think its possible its more that he just doesn't think they're as good as the Caf does?

1287~~~
I wouldn't go as far as saying he trusted the players. The way he dropped Varela,  TFM and CBJ,  doesn't seem like trust to me. Rashford is only there because his love children; Rooney and Fellaini are crap up front. The only thing Rooney has on Pereira is experience,  not technic, not creativity,  not pace,  not set piece ability just boring experience by virtue of age and game time.

1288~~~
CBJ was injured for a while, and it seems more than acceptable to me not to play the kids week in week out, it's not great for their development.

With Rashford he has played him plenty of times when he could have played others.

I'm no Van Gaal apologist but this is one of the few things he's done well at.

1289~~~
I have a suspicion that he doesn't take well to young players trying to advise him on what is good for said player.

1290~~~
Because Wilson and Fletcher were on loan. LvG chose to keep Rashford for a reason.

1291~~~
Pereira should not be playing ahead of Rooney (as some suggest) but should've had more chances instead of Lingard or Mata.

1292~~~
So if the certain youngsters don't get games, it's because LVG has dropped them and pushed under the bus, but when he plays others, it's because he has no choice. Am I doing it right?

1293~~~
Not giving him a loan option was just moronic.

1294~~~
My point is the idea of him trusting in the young players as he claims. Varela and CBJ didn't deserve to be dropped in the manner they were. That's hardly trusting when you compare how he treats other players.

1295~~~
Varela was dropped when Valencia came back. Valencia has been way better than varela tbh

1296~~~
fosu mensah - the sample size is far too small here to say one way or the other.

rashford - there isn't a manager on the planet that wouldn't have kept playing rashford given how fantastic he's been since the off. whether lvg deserves credit for that, i don't really care.

borthwick-jackson - dropped from the fa cup squad. meanwhile rojo is in it. mental. should have played a lot more in the past two months, especially given how poor rojo has been. still not selected for whatever reason.

lingard - you're taking the mick aren't you? lingard is turning 24 this year, and more importantly has been gash. despite being a 90 minute player in an attacking position, he hasn't provided a goal or an assist in the past 15 games he's played. handled him well? the guy should be in the reserves.

1297~~~
Lingard gets some unfair stick. I mean sure he isn't world class but he is definitely a useful player. He had good games vs Arsenal city Chelsea and all. In fact he was one of our best players in those games. To say he is useless is unfair. Even if you think he is useless, if we got some excellent games out of lingard it surely counts as handling him well? Fergie got decent performances out of buttner and that guy barely cuts it in Russia

1298~~~
No. He sent James Wilson and Ashley Fletcher on loan, so he clearly planned to play Rashford ahead of them if need be.

1299~~~
No, he just didn't know William Keane would get injured and especially injured for the rest of the season. Will was very unlucky and I hope he get's chances next season because he was getting back to his best.

1300~~~
Yet he plays Rashford week in and week out not complaining about that fact but ut debunks your argument for there being some method to how he drops players. Pereira should have been allowed to go out on loan not blocking him then proceed to make him rot in the reserves.

1301~~~
It's not black and White as that. Maybe he had every intention of playing pereira when he said it but that would require his application too. I haven't seen the reserve games but a lot of people here were underwhelmed by his performances for them. For all his faults, Lingard gives 100% effort in most games even though he isn't as talented as Adnan or pereira. 

Maybe the manager felt he wasn't putting the effort he needed. It's quite possible.

1302~~~
I don't believe it is always down to effort but his inexplicable trust in certain players that aren't worth the stupid privileges. 

Pereira hasn't been as bad for the U21s as Rooney has been for the first team. When he was out of favour,  he looked like he knuckled down and forced his way into the U20 for Brazil,  something that is hard to get in if you don't ply your trade in SA,  and if you don't,  you have to be a regular in Europe. He had neither so it was clear that he worked hard to augment his natural ability to be considered for selection and I'm sure he'll represent them as a key player at the Olympics in Brazil. 

It's all LvG imo. His whole thing is centred around Rooney. When it was clear that Rashford, was the better striker,  it was all about shifting things around to accommodate him. My question is,  if there were 4/5 Martials and Rashford,  would LvG oust Rooney for them,  I think not. 

First,  Martial came to United on the promise of leading the line,  he got moved for Rooney. Rooney started playing crap and got injured,  Rashford came on the scene,  things were yet again shifted for Rooney at #10. Now things have been moved around for Rooney to be shoehorned into the team at CM. I believe that bar experience,  Pereira would have added more than Rooney over the period of the whole season and it's not like Rashford or Martial are very experienced. 

Pereira is up against a manager that considers his captain undroppable. Even Mata and Herrera don't have a chance to compete fairly with Rooney.

1303~~~
That happens when you are captain. In any club and under any manager. Mourinho was sacked because he dropped Casillas and fought with him. Wenger plays mertasacker a lot even though it's clear he is past it too. Even Terry who was poor played quite often this season. Del bosque even now seems reluctant to play DDG who is the best keeper in the world and Casillas is past it. Rooney according to managers and players does have a good influence on the players for club and country. So it's not unfair to say he is a good captain. So it's understandable that the captain plays if available. 

Pereira according to many here had an OK season. No one is saying he isn't talented. If he wasn't, we wouldn't tie him to a new correct last year. Rooney was off form but no manager will play a rookie. Mata and Herrera got their chances and were appalling this season too. 

I have seen many say that he wasn't anything special this season for the reserves. We have seen Wilson rip up in the reserves yet he struggles even at Brighton. So to say that someone who had a not so great season at youth level will come to PL and suddenly will play really well.

1304~~~
Arteta is the captain not Mertesacker

1305~~~
He has played maybe 2 games in 2 years. He is past it and always injured.

1306~~~
I see what you are saying but he has a power that most captains don't. The backlash you get from dropping Rooney is ridiculous when compared with other captains and he is not even a top player or to captain. Rooney is not the point of discussion here but Pereira and his biggest challenge is LvG who gives Rooney this power imo. Under LvG,  Rooney is pretty much in direct competition to every player ahead of the back four but he has no direct competition imo. Blind is lucky because Jones has just not been good enough and Shaw has been injured. 

Anywhere Rooney is being deployed,  there is a domino effect that affects every player that plays in a position he can play and this includes Pereira. If he is saying that he had been promised game time,  then he must have been somewhere in a pecking order that is reasonable to stay in the club. It doesn't seem like there is any pecking order in any position,  it all reshuffles when the manager decides to shoehorn Rooney. 

I'm not saying that he should play many games but the number of minutes he had received this season is ridiculous for a player like Pereira. 

It's that or the manager does not fancy the kid one bit. He just kept him around for the sake of it because when we were thin he still did not get a chance. 

My main bone of contention is why he had allowed the development of a young player to stall when the kid wants to improve himself. How is that not going to cause an unrest within the player. Training everyday knowing you had a chance to be competing elsewhere but coerced into sticking around when there is a zero opportunity for you will show in your game,  whether U21 or otherwise. We have seen better players put in poor performances for the reserves when they are not happy at the club.

Rooney is a good enough captain. Players look upto him and he has achievements that makes him stand out as well.

Anyway that's not how it works. Last season mata and young were behind players like di Maria and falcao in the pecking order. Mata was benched for 2 months but he continued to work hard and demanded starts. Young put in some excellent performances displacing di maria. You can't want starts and then not put in the efforts just because you have been 'promised' starts.

1308~~~
I would like to see Pereira get more opportunities as there is obviously a massive potential in the player, far more than many other youngsters that have been promoted or even signed. Still, the limited opportunities he has had, bar the free kick he hasnt done enough so far to justify more starts ahead of others

1309~~~
No there isn't

1310~~~
He's as skillful and technically gifted as anyone i've seen in the youth teams over the last 8/9 years I have been watching, maybe bar Pogba and Morrison. He's hardly a loose cannon either, even if there has been some doubts over mentality/application.

There must be some sort of issue there, but I still have high hopes for him should he be given faith.

1311~~~
I'm sorry I didn't make it clear. I think he is great but I disagree that he has far more potential than any of Adnan, TFM, Williams, Wilson etc. He really hasn't done anything to suggest he has more potential than Adnan at all, let alone far more.

1312~~~
Yep you have a point with Adnan, but I think hes more gifted than any of the others imo. Not by far though and other areas of their game may take the others further but pure skill and ability on the ball he's ahead of the rest.

Another thing against him is his position. He's plays centrally in midfield, the hardest place for a young player to break into immediately at the highest level. Lingard and Januzaj can both play wide. I don't think that suits Pereira at all. His positioning has been an issue in his first team appearance and in the 21s and it's held him back.

1313~~~
He should not be at the club next year, for his sake and ours, he needs a proper loan so he can get senior football experience.

1314~~~
I never said that myself. If you read my post it says far more potential "than many", not "any".

1315~~~
Someone mentioned somewhere that Van Gaal makes it harder for Januzaj and Pereira because they are the established youth players with potential and developing them would be too straightforward and not make Van Gaal look as good as him bringing through other unknown youth players.

This is the guy who subbed in Powell in a must win CL game, so I can't help but feel that's true.

1316~~~
Or, its well known LVG hates players who think theyre above the team in some way or who he feels dont apply themselves fully.

Couple that attitude with two youngsters who are far from having made it and it would have been like a red rag to a bull.

1317~~~
If that was the case Powell wasn't Unknown. Lingard wasn't unknown. This is clearly nonsense

1318~~~
Powell wasn't unknown, but it was a move that was unexpected. If he'd scored a goal that saved us that day, you can bet Van Gaal would be giving it the big one basking in his own genius. 

That's the impression I get from his time here. Going for the unexpected, just so people can revel in his genius.

1319~~~
That's just paranoia imo. If this was the case pereira wouldn't have played no games. He did have a few games here or there

1320~~~
It's blatantly obvious that Powell came on instead of Pereira because he is a bigger goal threat. There are plenty of valid criticisms of LVG's time here, we don't need to invent completely absurd conspiracy theories to discredit him.

1321~~~
Turns out his birthday is new year's day. How interesting is that.

1322~~~
Not very.

1323~~~
He's the new generation of Brazilian footballers: stocky, headless, stamina building cross country-runners with as much technique as captain wooden leg. Get rid of him before anyone sees him play!

1324~~~
Pereia's problem is mentality. His technique is excellent

1325~~~
Now this is where I'm going to have to disagree with you.

1327~~~
Him, Januzaj, Fosu-Mensah, and Memphis have all put up inspirational Instagram workouts in the last 5 days or so. Out to impress eh lads?

Your joke isn't too well-received I see.

1330~~~
The only joke here around is you!

1331~~~
Exactly the sort of response I was hoping for when mourinho got appointed. Hopefully this response will be equally evident on the pitch.

1332~~~
It would be really, really great if Mourinho comes in and uses a sizeable chunk of the youth in his time here. I don't think it's likely he'll have more than a few in his 21 man squad, but we can only hope.

1333~~~
Inspired by Owen Hargreaves no doubt

1334~~~
Not sure if serious. You're fecking with us aren't you?

1335~~~
Wasn't he brought up in Belgium?

1336~~~
Played for U20 Brazil last summer. Was with PSV when we recruited him into our academy.

1337~~~
Born in Belgium, played in Netherlands, represents Brazil.

1338~~~
Born in Belgium, moved to the Netherlands at 9 and then moved to England at 16.
