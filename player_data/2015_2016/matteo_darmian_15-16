2~~~
It's happened? Yes! 2nd signing done.

3~~~
BOOM!!!

4~~~
Di Marzio is a beast

5~~~
What a day... coupled with Delph snubbing City <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7~~~
Stick a fork in me.

8~~~
WOOOOOHOOOOOO!!!! What a day to be a United fan!

9~~~
I'll be honest... I don't like the fact that Di Marzio has such a direct line to a (now) United player. I hope LvG tells Darmian to fix the leak.

10~~~
3rd.

11~~~
Translation of the tweet in the OP?

12~~~
"Cairo by President to the least of all the chicks"

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13~~~
<b> 
Thanks Darmian, had four wonderful years</b>

Torino Football Club announces that it has sold to Manchester United, outright, to the right of the player Matteo Darmian.

President Urbano Cairo would like to thank Matteo Darmian for the seriousness, commitment and professionalism demonstrated in these years. Cairo by President to the least of all the chicks Torino FC hopes for Matthew the best satisfaction for this new amazing experience.

14~~~
Erm, who else? not Schweinsteiger yet?

15~~~
Great. Di Marzio is a god. We love you Darmian, not Schweinsteiger.

16~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Welcome Darmian and feck Juve.

17~~~
Well, quite clearly he's got the info from Torino, not us/Darmian.

18~~~
Di Marzio just won the internet.

19~~~
I think my google translate is a bit off.

20~~~
Awesome. Let's also just get Schneiderlin... Delph rejecting City has me a little worried.. I hope that too is wrapped soon..

Di Marzio is amazing...

F*** Juventus

21~~~
Would be more on the Torino end of things. Di Marzio is pretty spot on when it comes to Italian transfers but was way off with saying Gaitan was coming to us

22~~~
Oh you on about the medical shizzle not yet being done? Fair dos.

23~~~
Confirmation from the club in 25 minutes, says Di Marzio.

24~~~
This pleases me.

Feck Juventus.

25~~~
Get in... what a day

26~~~
I think Di Marzio actually is Darmian. Thats how he knew about Schweinsteiger as well, he saw the medical forms at Carrington yesterday evening

27~~~
F**k Juventus.

28~~~
Welcome Darmian!

29~~~
Juventus are alright actually.

30~~~
Good stuff, never seen him play. 
feck Juventus!

31~~~
He has direct contacts with Torino and the other 19 clubs of Serie A.

32~~~
Very pleased with this signing. feck juventus!

33~~~
I'd rather wait for United's confirmation but pleased with this one. My Italian mate says he's good and the fee is cheap so chuffed. Better than spending double on Coleman etc.

34~~~
This calls for a Peroni. 
Welcome Matteo to the  Theatre of Dreams.

35~~~
Could someone please explain the 'fxck Juventus' thing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

36~~~
I can't wait to see him in our shirt <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

feck juventus!

37~~~
First page <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

38~~~
Ofcourse. Fu** Juventus!

39~~~
You have joined a great club, welcome Matteo Darmian.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

40~~~
Ask the Torino fans <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

41~~~
Can't say I know much about him outside of what has been posted on here and YouTube videos. Hoping he does well (and stays fit!)

42~~~
Di Marzio is now a caf legend.

43~~~
A Torino fan who posted in the newbie thread said good things about him and ended it with: "cheers and f**k juventus"

44~~~
Fitting it's Damien opening the Darmian thread.

45~~~
This. Is he Darmian himself?

46~~~
You don't know what F**k means?<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Juventus are a team in Italy.

47~~~
Last season was Ballague breaking first hand news on Di Maria, this year it's Di Marzio. Who's next?

48~~~
A friend of mine an AC Milan fan said a similar thing. He said Darmian is one of the best wing backs in Serie A to emerge in recent years. His main worry is how he will adapt to playing as full back.

edit:feck Juventus!

49~~~
Indykaila

50~~~
Feck off Juventus!

Welcome to Manchester United Matteo!

51~~~
Di Marzio being one of the most reliable journalists is nothing new (sort of like Ornstein for Arsenal matters). Obviously doesn't get everything right but enough to make him among the most reliable transfer journalists.

52~~~
Great signing, feck Juventus.

53~~~
If Torino say they have sold him to us I think it is safe now <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

54~~~
Do we have any Juventus fans around here? They won't be pleased when they see this thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

55~~~
Excellent news!

Cheers and feck Juventus!

56~~~
Can't wait to see our new signings in a United shirt.

57~~~
Yes, compared to the other english journos, the latest scoop they found has been Ardiles to Tottenham in 1978

For the rest is only a past&copy and invented things.

58~~~

59~~~
Matt Darmiaaaaaaaaaan!

60~~~
It's going to be interesting seeing how the lad adapts from the Serie A to the Premier League. It's definitely going to be a big challenge for him and is going to need time to settle in properly. But he has had rave reviews and after watching him give Rooney and Baines the run at the world cup, I'm sold. Looking forward to watching him play on tour.

61~~~
They know it's tongue-in-cheek like. Anyway it's our thank you to the Torino fans who've provided a biography of Matteo for us. Our Juve Cafters will understand...

67~~~
Delighted with this one! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Sounds like the exact kind of player we need. Perfect.

68~~~
Feck yeah

69~~~
Great nickname as well, sangue e bombe, blood and bombs.

70~~~
Depay, Darmian and Schweinsteiger! already a great window! What next ??!??<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

71~~~
Schneiderlin,Ramos,Mueller and Oblak.

Wonder when it will be announced by United.

75~~~
2 minutes time

77~~~
Apparently at 8pm, so in 2 minutes.

78~~~
Cheers.

79~~~
Nothing yet on manutd.com.

edit: And it's one minute over 8. Someone needs sacking.

80~~~
It's on MUTV: Signed.

Interview later tonight.

81~~~
Bah, that could be anything, new lease on car, or marriage licence.

feck Liverpool.

82~~~
Fail!

83~~~
Another "opposite footed" player <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

84~~~
The official site needs to get an interview with Bastian on the other two new signings, purely so the headline "Schwein on Depay and Darmian" can occur.

85~~~
Interview on MUTV tonight don't know what time.

86~~~
excellent another cracking signing.

87~~~
Can anyone PM me a MUTV stream if there are any?

88~~~
4 year contract with the option to extend for another year.

89~~~
Nothing on Man Utd's twitter yet. Those slackers.

90~~~
read somewhere he is the new Paolo Maldini....

high praise indeed....

is that just cause we were in for him?

91~~~
I'm off for a cigarette. Hope we wil anounce Darmian, Schweinsteiger till then. Rumor of Schneiderlin signing and Ana Ivanovic naked pictures would be just bonus #fullmuppetmode.

92~~~
Someone needs to get sacked

93~~~
There we go! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

94~~~
Beaten to it!

What a babe though. No homo.

95~~~
Now confirmed by club twitter

96~~~
He has the look of a man who can't quite believe what's happening! I love it.

110~~~
Schneiderlin will add to that.

111~~~
Happy with this signing.

112~~~
Another good signing for us, I haven't really watched him play much, but from what you hear and read, there's reason to be happy.

113~~~
How good is his English?

114~~~
Now it's real, it never feels real until the shirt pose pics! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Welcome to United Matteo.

I want to feel his....hair

118~~~
And schweiny will be out new silver fox since rvp is leaving

119~~~
Everyone's going with the LVG haircut.

120~~~
We need to stop this buying sensibly to solve problem positions, it'll give me an aneurysm.

121~~~
Brilliant news.

122~~~
We've lost Falcao and Van Persie now though

I mean err football. What a great signing.

123~~~
Oh man! He's beautiful!

feck Juventus

124~~~
Excellent news - looking forward to see him in action on tour.

125~~~
I feel a little thrown because I can't spot any tattoos.

126~~~
That flowing hair

127~~~
A year with Depay, Rojo and Di Maria will sort that out <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Welcome to the biggest club in the world, lad <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

Great signing. Can play on either sides. Very versatile.

130~~~

131~~~
What a day <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

132~~~
...and the Greatest football club in the world.

133~~~
What time is the interview on MUTV?

134~~~
They haven't confirmed it yet. 

Brilliant news. I look forward to watching him on the preseason tour.

135~~~
Ed will no doubt be getting off his tits tonight down the local

136~~~
Its not that im underwhelmed by this transfer, but i literally no nothing about him. He's a complete Patrice Evra to me. Was this guy rated as one of the best full backs in the world? I have no doubts he will be a good player for us but just how good I don't know! For this reason I can't get too excited just yet until i see him play. F**k Juventus.

137~~~
I would like to think that Ed has some coke and some fine hookers instead.

138~~~
He deserves it. Still needs to get Bastian done though before he can relax for the night.

139~~~
An Italian fullback. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

140~~~
In his prime.

141~~~
I would love to see the numbers when a player on twitter signs to Man utd. How many new followers he gets.

142~~~
Excellent signing at a very good price. What more could we ask for. Looking forward to seeing him play for us.

143~~~
Balague tweets about his non league team now.

144~~~
Can he speak English?

Don't most European countries push their school kids to learn English from a young age?

145~~~
Top stuff. Buzzed.

146~~~

147~~~
awwww

148~~~
Yeahhhh! Welcome Matteo. This looked too good to be true, well done to LvG and Woody.

Oh and I have actually always liked Juventus, but still f*** Juventus!

149~~~
A proper RB has been a priority signing for me for the last 12 months. Delighted with this. We're finally sorting this squad out after years of neglect.

150~~~
I rate this one as a good solid signing at a nice price and in a problem area for us. Good work.

151~~~
Agreed, with the players coming in and that have gone out over the last 12 months, the squad should be far better balanced.

152~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/why-torinos-raging-bull-could-have-pick-clubs-england-and-spain" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/why-torinos-raging-bull-could-have-pick-clubs-england-and-spain</a>

Good piece on Darmian from back in April. I'm very happy with this one.

153~~~
This is as good as the Depay signing for me.

The right back position was a real weak spot in our squad and we have bought a good player, at a good age, for a good price, before pre-season even begins.

Excellent work by Van Gaal and Woodward.

154~~~
Nice signing I wanted him when he was heavily linked with Bayern, he should be a top edition to the squad.

feck Juventus <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

155~~~
Welcome! Good signing!

156~~~
MY GOD IS AN AWESOME GOD

157~~~
Ah that word again.. <b>Balance.  </b>

158~~~
Yes they do, so I'm hoping he knows a bit.

159~~~
Quite happy with this. Seems a well-balanced player and for the amount we paid, it's not a huge gamble.

160~~~
Bet Valencia somehow still finds a way to get onto the pitch.

161~~~

162~~~
Someone get Ed to give that Di Marzio chap a season ticket<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

163~~~
We don't deserve this day

164~~~
Christ, he's wonderful

165~~~
He looks tired as feck, those eye-bags man, give this man some rest.

166~~~
Excellent transfer, not only the player, but also the way it was conducted, swift and under the radar.

167~~~
If I'm being honest, he actually looks like 12 in that pic<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

168~~~

169~~~
Bulova sure is getting their moneys worth. Two minutes after signing, they slap a watch on him, and demand that he NEVER take it off.

170~~~
I was slightly worried what I was going to see when I clicked on the spoiler.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

171~~~

172~~~
I'll wait with judging him after he plays for us at least couple of games. Versatile fullback capable playing on both flanks it makes perfectly sense and I am glad we made this kind of signing, still think Coleman is way way better but Everton would skin us for him..

All the best Matteo hope you're better than Santon

173~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Well, I don't like to toot my own horn too much, but that would indeed be an appropriate title <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

174~~~
He's the man right now

175~~~
Coleman doesn't even come close to Darmian.

176~~~
Needs to bulk up.

177~~~
:-D

178~~~
Jesus I never knew how much I wanted paper with the United logo on it until now.

179~~~
Why does it always look like the Chevrolet logo is shopped onto the shirt in these things?

180~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> already got his Bulova watch on? I bet his Corvette was sitting outside too.

181~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

182~~~
Getting shit done today. Hope he lives up to the reputation. Looks promising though and definitely a high priority position.

183~~~
How long will it be until we sign the next player? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

184~~~
Absolute bollocks but whatever.

185~~~
an hour or so?

186~~~
van Gaal looks absolutely dapper in that picture. Prepared for another with Schweinsteiger?

187~~~
Ah, so we've got a pessimist.

188~~~
A bunch of Torino fans signed up, to tell us about him and wish him luck, and posted in the newbies. I reposted their comments in the transfer thread - that seemed to be their standard sign-off <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> - so it's in honour of all our Torino fans, who ask us to treat him well because he's a good 'un.

189~~~
I guess we just have to wait and see until I get proven right. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

190~~~
We will have to since I doubt theres any way you have been watching Torino for the last 4 years <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

191~~~
Nah just want time to finish my Peroni before starting on my Becks.

192~~~
It's actually happening, we are making sensible signings and if we get another CB, CM and forward we are title challengers if not already.

I haven't seen anything of Darmian outside of the World Cup but sounds good from what others say, I hope Darmian, Shaw, Smalling and hopefully Ramos or Otamendi can become one of the great United defences with 'Schweini' and Carrick in midfield too. Come on Ed Woodward United.

Fck Juventus.

193~~~

194~~~
I don't exclusively watch Torino but I have watched Darmian play when Torino face Inter, Roma, Juventus and for the Italian national team as well.

195~~~
This should be made mandatory when posting in this thread!

196~~~
Time for the muppet youtube videos.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QnrRcD3i1NM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

feck Juve.

197~~~
is that a legit account?

198~~~
To thank our resident Torino fans for coming on to RedCafe to tell us about Darmian and to wish him luck, I made this.

199~~~
Looks terrific.

200~~~
A German first team regular and an Italian first team regular on the  same day. What are the odds of that.

201~~~
Darmian and Herrera looks like schoolboys <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I got a feeling he will be one of those players who got away with dirty tackles because they look like nice guys

202~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'd love it if instead of the Chevy logo next season we just had...

...Fck Juventus.

203~~~
Van Gaal got caught out with this one, he's wearing his pj top.

204~~~
Who has the best hair in the team now ?

205~~~
Needs to get some of Saf's summer polo shirts

206~~~
Very good signing for United. Doubly happy with this transfer, we get a very good right back, plus i won't have to watch Valencia.

207~~~
Ander and Darmian, both of them have hair of a 12 year old child.

208~~~

209~~~
They're getting ironed ready for the unveiling of Schweinsteiger.

210~~~
Looks very happy!

211~~~
Yes! Absolutely delighted. Think he'll become the next zebra.

212~~~
Not a fan of Van Gaal's outfit to be honest.

213~~~
Looks like a mix of our own Ander Herrera and Joseph Gordon-Levitt

214~~~
Can't go wrong with a Ralph Lauren shirt and jeans <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

215~~~
Wonder if it's intentional they wear watches on opposite hands to get both in that handshaking picture <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

216~~~
Herrera just retweeted this too. What a nice guy he is <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

217~~~
I thought that or is LVG a lefty?

218~~~
Darmian is left handed.

219~~~
Preparing for the life without Dave i see.

220~~~
Ah right.

221~~~
shirt numbers are not given out yet right?

No. 2 for this lad then.

222~~~
What is the watch company we have sponsorship with?

223~~~
Does anyone know when the interview will be on. They've been promising it all night? Or do you think they are waiting for Bastian to complete so they can show the 2 together?

224~~~
This is getting a little embarrassing. Just a journalist with good sources here doing his job. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

We'll never forget you! Oh, come on... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think they might be brothers.

230~~~
Welcome Darmian! Looks like a real friendly chap, I like him already even though I've never seen him play football or heard of him 6 months ago.

231~~~
he sounds like our lads here... <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Left handed? Never heard of a left footed right-back.

233~~~
Left handed but right footed, we have a few of them.

234~~~
needs to bulk up

235~~~
It's a little bit weird, almost as if he's going away forever or something. But you know how people are after their favourite club makes a signing - they get all cosy inside and want to hug strangers.

236~~~
Love Ander<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

237~~~
Welcome Matteo!
Oh and feck Juventus!

238~~~
Ander's doing a 'Kimmich' <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

239~~~
Is that an offer? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

240~~~
of course it is!

241~~~
Interview at 22:30 UK time.

242~~~
Great, might just about leave me enough time to try and find a bloody link that works.

243~~~
Looking at the picture it looks like that but he is a very strong, decisive and determined player at 6 foot.  See how he goes, it is going to be more physically demanding on him week in week out in the PL, if he requires a strengthening regime I am sure it will be prescribed.  There is no doubt in my mind having listened to LVG's very open and honest appraisal of matches and situations last season that he wanted to add more energy and physical presence to the team as the Premier League has a very high "rhythm",  but all the while not compromising technique, all the signings we have made so far tick all the boxes.

244~~~
Thanks

245~~~
Does he go up for corners? Will be weird to see a right back of ours going up for headers <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> We need a goal-threat there ala Ivanovic.

246~~~
Looks like Joseph Gordon-Levitt


One Robin out, one Robin in

247~~~
He's as solid as a rock and very good going forward as well. Bargain at €18 million. Forza Juve <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

248~~~
Have you found one?

249~~~
You doing it wrong

250~~~
You spelt f**k wrong, mate.

251~~~
Thought i had, was just some Fifa game of United v Roma.

252~~~
Just shows how transfers can happen under the radar and out of nowhere, and that journos generally know feck all.

253~~~
Yep, that's why I'm not too concerned at the moment about the delay in the Schneiderlin situation.

254~~~
Yep, same here. We will get the players we want despite all the false speculation from the clickbait brigade.

255~~~

256~~~
He's speaking pretty good english on mutv right now. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

257~~~
Can speak English. Good stuff.

258~~~
He speaks good English, sounds like the Spanish lads speaking English.

259~~~
Maybe Juan and Ander will adopt him if David does go.

260~~~
Good to hear. One less thing for him to adapt to.

261~~~
How about you guys say what he is actually saying instead? Lol

262~~~
He seems such a nice chap! Gave most of the interview in good English and still apologised for it! Always helps to take to a player when they try to speak in English.

263~~~
It was all pretty generic stuff with the answers provided in the questions, like 'What do you want to achieve at United; trophies' 'yes of course' etc.

264~~~
Thanks for keeping us all updated

265~~~
I like him already. Seems like a nice guy really hope he settles quickly.

266~~~
Di Marzio has been keeping us up to date with his every move.

267~~~
What did he say?

268~~~
Just the usual, responding to the standard questions, nothing extraordinary,

Feels he's best at RB, due to being right footed,
Grateful for the opportunity.
Wants to play at OT, United a historical team with good tradition,
Hmm wants to learn the premier league style and lean the language.

Just the baisc's to the standard questions, he doesn't have the english skills to go above and beyond.

269~~~
He's the lone exception. European journos seem to lack the click bullshit effect of their English counterparts.

270~~~
Considering the best LB ever is right-footed, I don't really see that is a problem.

[Edit, Darmian is right footed anyway]

271~~~
Stewart Gardner on MUTV was acting like Schweinsteiger is complete too so just the formalities to sort.

272~~~
In this he sort of looks like one of the Busby Babes from the old pics of them lining up. His hair is glorious too.

273~~~
It is done, no?

274~~~
In the interview he actually said that he had signed. I don't know if that was just muppetry or whether he actually has.

275~~~
Yeah that's what I mean. I doubt United would have announced it had Bayern not done so.

276~~~
Best of luck to the guy, hopefully has a great career at United.

277~~~

278~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

279~~~
He is so cute. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

280~~~
I'm happy that Darmian speaks some English, would help him integrate into English life better.

281~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rArufeIxGw4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I want to errrrrrr mettermi alla prova. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I love how he starts sentences in English and finishes them in Italian.

282~~~
Great name, great hair, great facial aesthetics. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Hopefully his ability on the pitch matches it too.

283~~~
"I am sorry for my English" at the end <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Adorable.

284~~~
That interview is great. He comes across brilliantly despite the obvious language barrier.

Look at how genuinely happy he is to be here. He really is a right back version of Herrera. I can see him becoming a fan favourite too. His English isn't too bad either.

285~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> great interview. Very humble and good to see he cant wait to start training. He really seems happy and buzzing. I just love these type of signings.

286~~~
Love it that European players just refer to us as "Manchester", no one cares about the noisy neighbours.

287~~~
Aw, he looks so cute when he asks the translator some things in Italian, plus the 'sorry for my English' at the end, seems to be a very nice lad, Herrera/Mata-esque. Got to give it to him that he's thinking about what he wants to say though, albeit limited vocabulary pool, when he's at loss for words he tries to describe what he means.

288~~~
Love how he apologised for his English, which is better than a few of our British players <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Comes across like a nice lad, agree with others that if he can bring it on the pitch I can see him as a fan favourite like Ander.

289~~~
All I'm saying is Juan better keep an eye on Ander. Matteo can make many a man stray.

290~~~

291~~~
"cute", "adorable", this place is fecking weird sometimes...

292~~~
He's so dreamy.

293~~~
Amen.

294~~~
Better than too old or never heard of him. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

295~~~
His English is a lot better than I thought it would be. I imagine he'll be able to speak fluently pretty quickly.

296~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

297~~~
Fair fecks to him for trying to do an English interview at once even if he obviously struggles with the language. 

Seems like a great guy by all accounts.

298~~~
He's going to be best pals with Juan and Herrera you can just tell

299~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Sums it up really...

300~~~
So what can one expect of the kid? Given that he's 25, is he a late bloomer that he's coming to a big club so late compared to others? Or has he just been overlooked? 

I really haven't seen him play at Torino and highlight videos on YouTube only tell you so much, so if anybody has any input, it'd be appreciated.

301~~~
From a Torino Newbie named Toroforever, copied it from the locked transfer thread. Best description so far.

302~~~
We already knew mate. Torino fans were like sell to anyone but Juventus.

303~~~
He's been compared to Cabrini in the past, in fact Cabrini himself praised Darmian's performances with the national team.

304~~~
Truly <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what a nice fella

305~~~
nice read

306~~~
Thanks. If you take the bias out of the post, we seem to have bought a rock-solid player at a position we really needed one. It'll be really important to us that he can defend well and be a stopper on the wing because we've constantly been attacked in those areas. At the same time, it sounds like he'll be a good link between our defensive and our offensive guys and should connect well with whoever is in front of him. I don't expect him to become a world-class guy based on the description, but a good solid defender for a top club. 

As for the interview, he seems like a nice guy, not as confident as Memphis, but that could also partially be due to his language problems. Nonetheless, I think he'll need some time to adjust to his new surroundings and especially the new league, but once he's settled in, he'll be a versatile weapon for us. 

In terms of value for the player, this could be similar to the Bernat signing for Bayern: Nothing spectacular, but somebody who fits right in and is an under-the-radar buy (despite top clubs being interested in him).

307~~~
Also needs to learn side scouse to understand his captain

308~~~
Obviously we have to wait and see but I predict he'll have a lot more impact than Bernat for Bayern. Genuinely think that after a season or so, he can be as influential as Ever was in his prime. BIG ask, but he seems to have his head firmly grounded and seems like the type that'll succeed with us. Just a feeling.

309~~~
Great post.

310~~~
As lovable as Herrera <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

311~~~
Can't quite shake the suspicion we've signed a gem of a player.

312~~~
Mutv really is budget tv stuff. You think they might do some editing,you can hear someone knocking on the door at 5.53. 

Still good interview.

313~~~
I've got the same feeling people will be genuinely surprised with how good he is. He gets a lot of praise in Italy.

314~~~
Wish they didn't torture these players with complicated questions they aren't likely to understand. Reminds me of the infamous Ronaldo/Gary Neville interview.

315~~~
That was probably Schweinsteiger waiting for his interview, thought Darmian finished.

316~~~
We could end up with our better fullback tandems in recent memory.

317~~~
We should sign Toroforever! Seems a good lad.

318~~~
Me too, similar to Herrera, who the majority didn't really know about apart from seeing him play against us twice (like Darmian did vs England).

319~~~
What a day. Oh, and feck Juventus.

320~~~
He literally is Herrera v2 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

321~~~
Is it just me that's actually more excited seeing this lad start for us than I am with Schweinsteiger? I'm sure that'll change and I'm not sure why exactly but then again watching Valencia play at right back for an entire season can do that to a man.

322~~~
Can't wait to see Valencia used further forward again. I really think this could be his season. 
<span style="color: #ffffff">lol</span>

323~~~
Agreed. He may recapture some of his 2011/12 form which would be good to see. Hope LVG gives him game time.
<span style="color: #ffffff">lol</span>

324~~~
Same, think he's the next Ashley Young. feck juventus.

325~~~
Again this world-class argument which i hate. What do you mean by that? Maldini and Roberto Carlos level? Yes he will probably fail to reach this level (but you never know) but there are not many full-backs who are on this level in the game at the moment. The only two who i would rate this high are on there last legs (Lahm and Alves).

I watched him twice. And i mean by that that i noticed him in the match and remembered his display. Probably watched him more times but didn't noticed him. But yeah in those two games, in the WC against England and in the game against Juve, he was really good. Before our interest, i would say he is one of the best RB who is available at the moment, but i didn't think we would go for him. Clyne or Coleman were the best bet for me. And i am really happy we went for him.
But what gives me special hope he is really that good as some say is that my brother who is Juve fan mentioned him a couple of times, pissed because he thought he would be perfect player for Juve but Torino would never sell him to them. I can't wait to see my brother again to rub this transfer in his face.
And when you consider that some top clubs like Bayern were very interested in him you would think he is probably good.

I think he can be one of the best RB in the game. But you never know, it is a possibility that he fails miserably but i don't think he will. Ofcourse this is just speculation based on two games, based on the number of people who rate him and based on my brother observation.
There are not a lot top quality full backs in the game and just two seasons ago this was one of the biggest gaps in our team. Both LB and RB. Now we have Shaw who is 20 and who can be one of the best LB combined with Rojo and Blind as a backup for the LB spot and Darmian, Valencia and Rafael for the RB spot. Hopefully we will not sell Rafael and he will stay injury free and compete for the place in the first team with Darmian. In this case we are very well sorted in that department.

And great interview from Darmiano. You could see how he is wanting to learn the language and want to prove himself as soon as possible.

326~~~
Only seen a few clips, looks like he has a good burst of pace and seems to have the desire to get forward. 

Good experience through his career and generally Italian's are tactically excellent. 

I'd say we've signed a solid player for good value, think he'll give us good balance because he's similar to shaw, good physically, good natural defender, can surge forward

327~~~
The label world-class was used to describe his potential impact on our team in the future. I consider him to be a regular, somebody who can play as a left back and a right back and do his job in both positions. Those players are very important to a team's success.

328~~~
Just watched his interview. That was like hearing Herrera from his first interview! Hope he does well here, seems like a nice bloke

329~~~
was searching for his interview(btw its fantastic!) on youtube and i found this, if someone wants to watch it.....i probably will but it will take me few days to finish it <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

330~~~
Feck me, went to work giddy about Schweini, got back to this. What a day to be alive.

331~~~
Amidst all the other transfer news I had forgotten about Darmian. Just watched the interview though and he comes across really well. His English isn't too bad either, should improve as he is around it more. Do we have any other Italian speaking players in the squad? The write-up done by the person in the newbies was a good read too.

332~~~
Herrera's brother from another mother, comes over over well in that interview, humble and quiet spoken, I think he'll be a good asset to the club.

333~~~

334~~~
He looks like he's absolutely buzzing inside. Happy for him. 

Welcome Matteo! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

335~~~
I already like this guy,Humble,ready to adopt.

336~~~
Haven't seen much of him, but i'm hearing really positive stuff. At six foot, he'll certainly add much needed height to our team too. Can't wait to see him get started.

337~~~
Never heard of him before, doubt he's better than Rafael but we needed a RB as Valencia isn't good enough. Just Schneiderlin, Otamendi and a striker left and we're all set.

338~~~
Yeah both him and Schweiny will add height and physicality to our team. Won't need to shoe horn Fellaini in the team just so we aren't a tiny group of weak players basically.

339~~~
I feel like he should at least get married first before thinking about adoptions.

340~~~
They certainly will, although I wouldn't say Fellaini was shoe horned into our team. He added a lot more than just physicality and height to our team, in my opinion.

341~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> my poor spelling,adapt..

342~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

343~~~
Well yeah I'm not saying he didn't do well, he had a really good season, but I mean he was a key player mainly because of the physical qualities that he added and it helped balance out the team. He wasn't in there because he was a more creative or talented player then some of the others, because that's just not his game.

344~~~
Don't hold your breath mate

345~~~
Feck Juve.

346~~~
Oh good, a fullback who can play on both sides. We needed one of those.

347~~~
Just watched his interview. Very impressed. Nice bloke, humble, intelligent, and genuinely excited to play for us. I have no doubt he will do his job well.

348~~~
This guy is going to be a fan favourite you can already tell. 

Seems really down to earth and level headed, also his English is much better than I thought it won't take him long to be fluent. Looking forward to seeing him in a United shirt

349~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

350~~~
Mata, Herrera and now Darmian. People are gonna tip over to the other side if this continues.

351~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

352~~~
RW is already well stocked with ADM, Januzaj and Mata. I think Valencia will be used as cover/competition for Darmian

353~~~
I am surprised Gardner hasn't asked his trademark question "Do you look forward to play with Wayne Rooney?"... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He will probably ask Bastian twice, just to make up for it.

354~~~
Can't you stop this please? Darmian is from Legnano which is located in the province of Milan. He also came from AC Milan ranks and he was there for a decade. So probably he's childhood team was AC Milan and not Turin

355~~~
The Torino supporters blessed us with the phrase, it'd be an insult to them to not carry it on for them.
<span style="color: #ffffff">feck juve</span>

356~~~
Its stupid as he had highlighted his allegiance even when he was with Turin.

"I have spent 10 great years at AC Milan and I owe them a lot if not everything. I thank Torino for allowing me to mature and AC Milan for making me the player I am now. "



Beckham didnt suddenly became a Real Madrid fan the day he wore the white shirt. Same as Darmian with Turin

357~~~
The beauty of saying "feck Juventus" is that you can be from Turin, Milan or even Manchester and it still sounds so good rolling off your tongue...

358~~~
I think he looks shocked. Football youths in Italy tend to have a hard life when compared to the EPL talent were a youth talent is considered the new Duncan Edwards because he passed the ball straight. They work extremely hard to get into the first team and are the first to be shown the door when things get wrong as inexperience is not tolerated. Darmian like most of the Italian youth talent had to move from one club to another and wait for someone to give him regular football. Eventually some of them do return back but its extremely hard. For example Berardi had been scoring goals for fun with Sassuolo but Juventus has yet to recall him back

 I bet he would have never dreamt he would end up at a top club like Manchester United

359~~~
Not really. Milan fans don't hate Juventus. Inter, Fiorentina (because of the Baggio's deal) and Torino do

360~~~
You're such an insufferable bore

361~~~
May not be the most important feature, but just found out that he was once given the captaincy for Torino.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/YQk6Vjxl.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/YQk6Vjxl.jpg"/> 

Definitely has some leadership qualities in him <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

362~~~
daft final question....'what would you like to achieve here...win trophies?'

'no, I prefer relegation battles, much more exciting..'

363~~~
An article on Darmian:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfcasia.com/italian-serie-a/12/blog/post/2517881/why-matteo-darmian-is-ideal-for-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfcasia.com/italian-s...matteo-darmian-is-ideal-for-manchester-united</a>

"In the beginning I was a central midfielder," he reflected in La Gazzetta, "and if you asked me then who my idol was, I couldn't not answer 'Clarence Seedorf.' Then they started to play me in defence at centre-back so I watched Alessandro Nesta. They then put me out wide to the full-back position and there was only one person I could look up to, right? Paolo Maldini and that was it. And you know what then happened in 2007? Heck, I was in the first-team squad with Seedorf, Nesta and Maldini. To say I tried to steal something from them would be pretentious. Let's just say Clarence taught me what it means to have personality, Sandro elegance and Paolo how to be professional."

364~~~
Am really developing a healthy respect for the lad....

365~~~
On paper this is a great signing. He's looks everything we could want, but Italians are unpredictable adapters outside of Italy. A wait and see for me. I hope the club as a whole help him settle.

366~~~
On the other hand British talent tend to settle outside Britain just fine. Des Walker, Ian Rush, Mark Hughes, Gazza etc....<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/><img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

367~~~
Yeah you're right. Both nations aren't great travelers.

368~~~
I argue with fans from both nations about this argument for the simple reason that they don't go into details about the transfer. For example how good the player actually is? How old is he and what had motivated him to leave? These are questions that needs to be asked. For example both Jay Bothroyd and John Charles were British but the difference in terms of talent is frigging evident. You dont expect the former to be as good as the latter because he's big and physical. Also the leagues are completely different so time will be needed for them to adapt. Therefore its not a good idea to buy a nearly 30 year old player unless he's moving to a smallish club which will give the time he needs to settle down and he's got great attitude (ex Zola). Some of the players who moved countries moved for the wrong reasons including Rush (ie he moved for money and refused to learn Italian), JSV (the passport scandal) and Shevcenko (ie he was pushed out of AC Milan). Under such circumstances its very difficult for a player to settle down irrespective of their nationality

369~~~
I like the character stuff, it bodes well when you have a player mature enough to not kick up a fuss when he doesn't get played in his position, and dedicated enough to do all he can to stay fit. Also seems like he's not stupid, a bit like Herrera and Mata; should fit in well, I hope.

370~~~
To my surprise while creeping on RAWK about us, there seems to be a lot of praise for Darmian. Every now and then he's mentioned in a negative way and established RAWK posters(nutters) are rating him.

An example:



I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon as I've never seen him play, not even on youtube but I'm very excited from just reading up about him. I really think we could've struck gold on this one, especially for the price.

371~~~
I have a very very good feeling about this transfer.

Is very obvious why we showed no interest in Clyne.

I think that this is one of those classic scouting jobs, where we have looked at the players attitude and professionalism as well as his ability.

I think we are building a very good dressing room, full of good honest and hardworking pros. Hopefully this team develops an ethos and togetherness which brings with it a new era of success.

372~~~
Italian defenders are the mercedes of the football world, bags of prestige, class and always efficient. Great signing

373~~~
Sport journalists have some unique of asking the dumbest questions ever.

374~~~
Just watched his interview for the first time, he seems very calm even though he hasn't grasped English fully yet, most signings no matter the club who struggle with the native language usually sweat like feck (I would too) but this lad is as cool as you like.

He also seems very happy when answering questions about him moving/playing with United, which seems to be a bit of a theme with the players we've signed recently, can't be happier with that to be honest.

375~~~
Very happy with this signing. The club went for the right RB, fantastic price and he is here for the tour. Perfect. Cant wait to see him in our team.

376~~~
anyone think he will be better than Gary Neville?  Exactly how good is this guy?

377~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Bless him. His English isnt completely horrible, seems to at least have the basics already.

378~~~
He sounds like he's been taking English lessons ......from Roberto Mancini.

379~~~
More importantly, can he speak Spanish .... that seems to be the dominant language of our squad nowadays!

380~~~

381~~~
How come he didn't get one of those backgrounds with "Welcome to Manchester United" like every signing? The lazy feckers probably are waiting to make only one for him and Schweinsteiger.

382~~~
He did get one.

383~~~
That?

384~~~
No, they always change the backgrounds of the twitter and FB accounts(where the Herrera pic is now) to a welcome to Man Utd picture of the new signing.

Something like this:

386~~~
I am pleased most of all that we have bought a RB who is presumably going to be first choice. I was concerned that LVG would persist with Valencia, and I find him to be far too limited in the role.

As for Darmian himself, I havent seen him that I remember. My first choices would have been Clyne and Coleman but by all accounts he seems like a very solid player, and could well be exactly what we need. Along with Memphis I think those two could be a great bit of business for the club this summer.

Personality wise, Darmian seems to be down to earth, humble and professional which is exactly what we should be after.

387~~~
Needs to learn some English, the lad. Can't have a leader who will be shouting in Italian to Smalling on his left, Carrick diagonally up front, and  Valencia or Mata right ahead. No one will have an idea what he's on about.

388~~~
How many Italians have we had play for us? I can think of Rossi and Macheda. We had any others?

389~~~
Taibi, Macheda, Possebon and Rossi (last 2 weren't born in Italy but have played for the Italian national team).

390~~~
Completely forgot Possebon existed. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

391~~~
Feck Juventus. That is all.

392~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> Was Possebon a national?

393~~~
He played for the Italy U20s, so barely!

394~~~
Seems like he's the only one to survive the medical so far <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

395~~~
This.

396~~~
Looks sexy our Darmian <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

399~~~
We signed this guy as well, people

400~~~
Welcome Shia Labeouf!

401~~~
Although everyone is rightly muppetspunking over fecking Basti and Morgsy Schni Schni, I'm buzzed that we have such a good player in Don Matteo.

402~~~
Did someone find a funky youtube compilation with freaky music from him yet? Need to get my muppet juices flowing for him too.

403~~~
What's probably the best moment of this fella's life is getting completely drowned out by the Sch brothers muppetmania <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

404~~~
This thread will get bumped often during the season, for his great performances, i am sure of that.

405~~~
Probably a good thing. Takes the focus off of him.

406~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/nfDtSyy.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/nfDtSyy.png"/>

408~~~
Exactly the sort of signing fellaini needed too, shame fabregas never happened.

409~~~
He'll be our best signing of the lot this summer. He'll be this season's Herrera.

410~~~
He is so shy and timid, you dont see him in any of the selfie/squad pictures. Not necessarily a bad thing, just hope he integrates into the squad/life in England.

411~~~
My wife fancies him.  Welcome to United Matteo!!

412~~~
Your wife has the same tastes as mine. He can pass off as Ander's more handsome brother.

413~~~
Cheers mate

414~~~
It's been such a mental weekend that I completely forgot about poor Darmian! Welcome to Manchester Matteo!

415~~~
Talksport discussing why Clyne should have gone to United because we need a righback, we can't have Valencia starting for us in that position again.
Fecking presenters agreeing with the caller, if only an established Italian right back were to become available...

416~~~
wonder what <a class="username" data-user="60388, @DomesticTadpole" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/60388/">@DomesticTadpole</a> thinks about him compared to Ander

417~~~
Seal of approval from RedNev.

418~~~
Gary Neville knows his fullbacks as well. I don't know much about Darmian but all the noise about this transfer suggests it could end up being a very shrewd signing.

419~~~
In other news, now that Ronaldo's off to Madrid a lot of responsibility is going to fall on young Wayne Rooney's shoulders.

420~~~
He clearly didn't do a good job then. Rooney had no interest in tracking this guy at the WC and so he gave Baines a spin around.

421~~~
His English is decent too. Was wondering how he'd get on but it seems he's a very educated lad and should hopefully fit in well.

422~~~
Is Darmian training with the group? It was reported that during his first day at the club he trained in a solo session with van Gaal.

423~~~
who spread that report?
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.manutd.com/~/media/2B49DFE019D34303A7B5DD8586D14825.ashx?mw=500" src="http://www.manutd.com/~/media/2B49DFE019D34303A7B5DD8586D14825.ashx?mw=500"/>

424~~~
Thanks for that photo. Good to see he's training with the group now. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-signing-matteo-darmian-9639457" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...chester-united-signing-matteo-darmian-9639457</a>

Most likely it was because he missed our scheduled training sessions because of flight and medical. I'm assuming that since now he's training with the group as confirmed by that photo.

425~~~
Excited by this guy, a good age at 25 not too young and has plenty of experience should make a big difference for us.

426~~~
also probably the first time LvG trained with him face to face, as opposed to Schweini (of course) and Morgan (already known in PL)

427~~~
Schneiderlin and him are my two favorite signings this window.

428~~~
He's nice, but I still like Ander.

429~~~
Agree with this - not every player wants to be the centre of attention all the time. I dont really know much about Darmian but based on what I have seen, I think he will be quite content to be able to focus on settling into the team without any distractions.

Also agree with this, although I do think we could potentially strike gold with Depay. All in all a good set of transfers.

430~~~
Bastian Fecking schweinsteiger.

431~~~
Not comparing them.
Signing a two - footed fullback from an unfashionable club, for a small fee, who is an international and quite reserved, reminds me of when we signed Irwin. 
I hope he mirrors his career here.

432~~~
Smalling proposing during pre season training, completely unprofessional

433~~~
or helps us maintain 100% success record regarding transfers from Torino FC

434~~~
At the time of the goal Welbeck had come on and Rooney switched to the right - it was Welbeck falling asleep that gave Italy the goal, not Rooney.

435~~~
Here Here!
Although I wasn't around for that one.

436~~~
Darmian's performance so far summed up: <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

437~~~
Looks like he's being playing with United for years. Really impressed.

438~~~
Intelligent movement, good positioning and good on the ball. I like the lad.

439~~~
That little piece of defensive awareness just before the stroke of half time, when Jones stepped up and he moved infield to close the gap and sniff out the danger - that's what Valencia's just not doing. The virtues of being an actual RB I suppose.

Looks very solid.

440~~~
Looks great. I like how he has height but pace also, and I can imagine some really good stamina. Looks like a potential RB staple, if he can adjust to the Premier League.

441~~~
He looks fantastic. Love the way he carries the ball forward, and he looks very solid defensively.

This could be one of the bargains of the season.

442~~~
Solid defensively and gets forward quite a lot.

Good in the air as well. Premier league teams won't have much joy pumping long balls to that side of the field

443~~~
Looks really good so far.

444~~~
Liking him already. Solid and composed at the back.

445~~~
You can't read a lot from pre season friendlies, but he's a talented player on the ball and seems a pretty solid and reliable passer with both feet, which is a great quality to have especially in our style.

446~~~
Without coming across like I'm taking a dig at Valencia, it is nice to have a right back who looks comfortable on both feet, and can come inside. Just makes that whole right side more flexible.

447~~~
Good start from him, very assured passing and took up good positions when not on the ball.

448~~~
Solid enough debut from Damo.

449~~~
Great first half. He'll prove to be a snip at £13m, I'm absolutely sure of it.

450~~~
His overall game looks goods and that one run attacking the space was impressive as well.

451~~~
Yep. Valencia did well last season IMO but just little things like first time incisive passes with his left foot is just something that never happened with Tony

452~~~
Looks very good, I like him already.

453~~~
Probably needs to get stronger for the EPL, but which foreign import doesn't these days.

454~~~
His awareness and positioning is very good, much better than Valencia and Rafael's.

455~~~
He needs to bulk up or he'll get pushed around quite easily in the league.

456~~~
That is what happens when you actually play a defender at RB. Valencia tried his best, but he defended like a winger.

457~~~
Solid performance. I'm looking forward to an improved back four this year. 
Mata should give him some hugs and invite him to dinner to prevent Darmian getting homesick like Immobilie in Dortmund.

458~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

459~~~
Like this guy a lot! Really impressed me seems great on the ball, he's everywhere and looked really bright!

460~~~
Didnt see the game but as with Schneiderlin, I am really pleased Darmian looks to have slotted straight into the team. My concern was/is that with a few bad performances, Valencia would continue as our first choice RB.

RB has been a bit of an issue for us for years due to Rafael's injury issues. We have played Jones, Smalling and Valencia at RB far more than we should have done, so having a 'proper' RB with good fitness I think will improve our team a lot. I dont think Darmian will ever be a 'star' for us, but he should be a solid first team player for a good few years to come, which is exactly what we need.

461~~~
I don't even think it was a great performance, probably a 6.5/10. And don't get me wrong, I say that because there is a lot more in his locker. Which we'll see when it's a proper competitive match, where the team has instructions to press and hassle.

462~~~
Thought he was ok. Felt he could have overlapped Mata on a few more occasions, and he got caught flat footed a couple of times when Club America's winger ran in behind, but other than that, he does look promising.

463~~~
Looked alright, am expecting much better from him, was caught out a few times in behind and muted in attack.  Love how he uses his left foot though such an improvement over Valencia in that respect

464~~~
You can't judge any new player on their first preseason match without fitness.  I just think I saw some sparks of a very good player.  His positioning and awareness of players running behind caught him out on a few occasions, but I thought his ability going forward was very, very promising.  Can't wait to see more of this guy!

465~~~
A right back that can use his left foot and move the ball inside?!?

466~~~
He already looked a level above anything we've had at right back for years. Slotted into the team almost seamlessly.

467~~~
A huge overreaction. Rafael has put in some excellent performances over the years and against proper teams instead of Club America.

468~~~
Am pleased his debut went ok. He's very steady and intelligent. Plus he's not one to make a fuss it doesn't seem. Hope he can keep improving and getting used to his teammates and the coaching team.

469~~~
Not sure he has any training until he joined us, but he seems to go about things quietly and efficiently. So someone who can actually stay fit, doesn't get into trouble with referees and can actually defend is an improvement all round.

470~~~
Yep. I like everyone else get giddy over the 'star' signings, but as much as I enjoy that, my favourites tend to be players with this sort of attitude to be honest.

471~~~
Looked very solid in his first game. Liked the fact that he can use both feet well. Sometimes caught out of position but recovered well. He will definitely keep improving and wil enjoy watching him develop.

472~~~
I don't think he was lacking in trying to overlap, it was just that Mata chose to go inside instead on more than one occasion when Darmian had made the run.

473~~~
Maybe Juan has to realise he now has someone he can link up with and he isn't called Valencia. He had probably given up trying to pass to Tony V.

474~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's certainly possible, I just think Mata is drawn to the center like a magnet as it's where he really wants to be, it's his first thought when he gets the ball and he''d rather use the fullback run as a decoy.

475~~~
how about best right back in our history or history of football?

476~~~
He looked a little nervous in his passing to me, chose the safe option of passing backwards a few too many times, but that's to be expected. 

Defensively though was very aware, but nearly got caught with 1 long ball. Overall I think he's going to be very good for us. He might take a while to settle though.

477~~~
Thought he was a bit dodgy in covering for the CBs but he looks promising.  Definitely quick and very confident with the ball.

478~~~
At last a square peg in a square hole at RB

479~~~
what's this?

480~~~
A deluded or drunk, Darioterios lol

481~~~

482~~~
I honestly was very impressed with him, he has a great engine. Needs to get stronger, tho.

488 posts in this thread and I bet about only three of us have actually ever seen him play.

491~~~
When i was watching the pre season game i mentioned in the thread i actually saw a lot of nev's game in Darmian. very impressed and very balanced.

492~~~
Liked the way he played. No nonsense. Not an attack enthusiast so maybe he will get some stick but his anticipation is first class

493~~~

nice article actually. I just hope he's as cool on the pitch as he talks.

495~~~
Yep, seems like he's a real pro. Hope he can live up to his reputation here!

496~~~
I'd imagine quite a few would have seen him play two matches at least.

497~~~
he's so fast.

498~~~
LvG said he is 2nd choice RB behind Tony V.

Face meet palm.

499~~~
He's hardly going to say that he is first choice ahead of Valencia because the latter had a shit season. LvG want to push them both to improve, and normally Darmian won't have any problem displacing Valencia. Darmian comes from another league and will probably need a couple of months to bed in where he'll be in and out of the team.

500~~~
He has to say that. Darmian has just joined us and the message to him has to be that he needs to earn the spot and make it his own.

501~~~
I think we will see something similiar to what we saw with Herrera last season. Didn't play many games in the first half as he was understanding his ''philosphy'' and probably bulking up a bit in the gym. But will probably play a key role in the 2nd half of the season and take over from Valencia as the number one right back.

502~~~
It was clear as day that Tony V was the weak link in our back 4 last season. I thought LvG would go down the, 'even established players will have to prove themselves again' route. To give Tony that promise of being 1st choice is something I don't agree with.

503~~~
I didn't even read it as second choice. LvG said he needs two players for every position, because McNair was playing RB when Valencia was out. Now, he has Darmian, he has two in that position, the 'second' right back. That directly translates to back-up? I don't think so.

504~~~
"We have brought Darmian for the second position behind Valencia," he told reporters. "Now already because of that injury [Paddy] McNair has to play there."

-LvG

505~~~
no fecking way does valencia stay first choice right back. jeez. i'm fully on board the darmian band-wagon and i want him to take that position for himself. the sooner valencia is on the bench the better everyone will be, especially our forwards' shins, assuming his disastrous crosses get past the defenders in the first place.

506~~~
Darmian second choice behind Valencia? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

507~~~
Chill, guys. He'll have made the RB position his own by November.

508~~~
I don't even know what to say to this. Just when you thought we'd finally be able to play an actual proper right back.

509~~~
Van Gaal's comments in the press are generally fairly innocuous. Darmian and Valencia are our right backs. Valencia was first choice last season, is an experienced squad member, speaks the language and already understands how to play in this team. 

Darmian, however, struggles with the language, will be getting to grips with a new league and is a brand new face. Valencia starting the season at right back wouldn't be at all surprising. Infact, it's probably the sensible thing to do. 

Darmian hasn't arrived here to be second choice. People shouldn't play dumb.

510~~~
Dont be such drama queens ffs! Darmian has to earn his place first, get adjusted to the EPL and get to know his philosophy. LvG is not gonna put him as a starter just now but if he does well, he will be rather soon

511~~~
No chance. Valencia can do one.

512~~~
i hope Van Gaal realises that ive brought Darmian into my fantasy footy team, so won't be best pleased if he's on the bench.

come on, this is serious!

513~~~
He has to say that though

514~~~
Players have to earn their places on merit, at the moment Valencia is in possession, Darmian needs to prove himself a better player. Hopefully he'll do that over preseason.

515~~~
Nah Gaz...

516~~~
Wouldn't surprise me if Valencia starts the season and Darmian was eased into the side.

517~~~
i can see this done for all our non epl signings to be fair

518~~~
Not worried about Darmian. He will surely will No.1 for us at RB. Guy is very level headed and professional and has talent. Don't see him kicking up a fuss - just getting on with it and learning as quickly as possible. He'll have this nailed imo.

519~~~
Valencia can't play for all of them! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

520~~~
He said we bought Darmian for the second position at right-back and in this context he was talking about his "philosophy" that every position needs two players for squad depth and his beloved balance. Pretty much straightforward. So what he meant was that Darmian is the second player for the right-back spot, because he won't use Rafael there and he didn't mean his order of preference.

521~~~
I'd like to believe all this.  But we're talking about a man who played Valencia ahead of Rafael pretty much all season.  

Never underestimate the power of those photos Valencia has the only copies of.

522~~~
I thought Valencia was probably the second most consistent Right back in the league behind Ivanovic <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> Keep wondering why everyone has a moan about him.

<span style="color: #ffffff">meltdown about this post coming shortly</span>

523~~~
Valencia doesn't speak the language. But to be fair to him he has only been in England a decade. 


As far as Valencia at right back goes, he's solid.

He had a couple of goals conceded attributed to him that had nothing to do with him, but the various posters who hate him look to blame him anyway. 

He was at blame for a couple of goals but big deal, so was Shaw, Ivanovic, Rafael, Azpulefeckiticantspellit and Baines among loads of others who are not only fawned over but also lucky enough not to have every movement forensically analysed.

524~~~
Valencia played ahead of Rafael all season because he was reliable, consistent, is great at holding onto the ball and has great physical attributes. Most importantly, he stays fit. Valencia isn't a bad player at all, people on here need to understand that. His only thing is that his final ball is shite, but other then that, he's a very good and reliable player that 2 of the greatest managers of recent times have loved.

525~~~
agreed, the guy has a lot to prove and learn but has a good chance to impress on tour while Valencia's out. Good luck to him

526~~~
He's just not a defender, and you can see that when he's always out of position or lunging in with tackles. Hopefully he will improve, because he certainly has over the last season, but he's 30 now I think so there's not much time. Valencia wasn't absolutely fecking awful, but we could certainly do a lot better and I'd be worried he'd be a weak link back there.

527~~~
i think its because Valencia was so shite at right wing in the latter years and the memories of this still live in heads today. Thats the only reason i can fathom the valencia bashing on this forum

528~~~
Gives away too many cheap free kicks around our box.

529~~~
I think he needs to improve his passing for our possession game. had a few poor passes  that went straight to the opponent

530~~~
Had a solid season, to be fair, I thought his best game was the one he played at CM, though, which was really surprising.

531~~~
A little rushed in his passing tonight but his attacking threat and blistering pace are good to watch.

532~~~
He's quite good.

533~~~
Think it will take a lot more time for him to adjust than some obviously seem to think around here. His passing was a little nervy and rushed, which is understandable I guess, but he'll have to improve that eventually. He has good touch and the ability and pace to go past his man, so hopefully he'll use this more when he feels more comfortable on the ball. You've got to remember that he can't communicate too well with his teammates and the United staff yet, I'd expect a good six months to bed into a new environment and language.

Valencia was always going to start as first choice, and personally I'd suggest he's a good one. I don't understand some of the Valencia hate around here, he's a great pro, strong and quick, and he's been playing at fullback for <i>just one year</i>. Give him a chance! Darmian is the future, and could be both exciting and reliable, but Valencia is currently the best full back in our squad for the system and expectations of a Van Gaal fullback.

534~~~
Valencia is supposedly injured though, if he doesn't play in the pre-season it will be a hell of a risk to have him start the season with no games.

535~~~
This is how you use your man managment skills, best he could say for two players with one sentence. Valencia has been here for years, he will not come out and say that Darmian is now first choice. That would be foolish towards managing Darmian as well, with this he tells him that here you have to work hard to deserve a starting spot.

Darmian, as the better player, is clearly the first choice for LVG.

536~~~
dunno why we're selling Rafael, still comfortably our best and youngest RB, maybe Van Gaal ran out of patience with his injuries... 

Darmian on the other hand looks solid both defensively and going forward but he's hardly a world beater yet, needs to work hard to get over Valencia in the pecking order first. Maybe when he settles down, gains some confidence, learn language his development accelerates and we will have a world class fullback again, too soon to judge though..

537~~~
Needs to time his runs better outwide. Doesn't seem to be giving us too much going forward. He's very good technically which is great and he's a decent athlete. High hopes for the lad.

538~~~
Signs are promising, although clearly work to be done. I have no concerns at the moment.

539~~~
Looks good so far! Is fast and has a lot more presence than Rafa.

540~~~
I swear he plays like Neville as well as looking like him. Am I mad?

541~~~
Yeah been pretty decent.

542~~~
Will become a brilliant RB

543~~~
I really like this guy, he seems to be playing like a winger a lot of the time.

544~~~
I like what I've seen of him thus far. Looks very dangerous in attack at times, and seems capable of putting in a good cross as well.

545~~~
Very good half, always looks to go forward and is really active and positive.

546~~~
I like the cut of his jib. 

Looks solid, fast and good offensive awareness.

547~~~
Proper RB. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

548~~~
First time I've seen him properly but he looks the real deal. Reads the game very well.

549~~~
I love him. Forza Darmian!

550~~~
Next Maldini. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

551~~~
It feels so good to have an actual RB in the team. Really becoming a favourite of mine.

552~~~
Certainly looks like he's got it down. Can't be easy playing next to Jones sometimes.

553~~~
Looks great. Composed and seems smart.

554~~~
Quality. Very good positionally.

555~~~
Was quality today, solid defensively and showed some very good passing and dribbling going forward, and put in that great ball for the one chance. Think he's only going to get better once he adapts to the prem. Will probably bulk up a bit to adapt easier to the premier league but that's only going to improve him.

556~~~
The fact that he is tall and pacey makes him perfect along with his technical abilities. Getting excited about him.

557~~~
Looked far, far better than Valencia (who is only playing his first game tbf). Expect him to be the #1 RB pretty quickly though.

558~~~
Very good defender. Would like to see a bit more going fwd. But looks solid at the back. And quite tall

559~~~
Looked like a proper RB, defended very well.  Felt good watching a cross from our RB actually end up in the danger area of the box.  I was actually surprised.

560~~~
Tbh with Mata you don't seem to get the same combination play as you get with Young.

561~~~
and tbh the fact that mata comes narrow means that the right back has alot of space to make runs and crosses into the box. as i said he did well. only just wanted a bit more in attack, but thats just being slightly over critical maybe

562~~~
I think he looks like the average right back, which makes him a lot more solid than Valencia

563~~~
He can cross, he can use his left foot, and he looks strong. And he only cost what? 13m or so? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

564~~~
Looks solid. Really like him.

565~~~
What I meant is that Mata generally looks inside when he cuts in from the right, he isn't necessarily looking for the overlap like Young was. Obviously it's a new partnership on the right and will take some work.

566~~~
He's new in general and will take some time to adapt. But I'm happy his excellent  defending has carried over and continued.

567~~~
I thought he was MOTM, he certainly got Irwin's vote of confidence. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

568~~~
Like Shaw the previous summer, for me he will be this window's best buy. He was mostly unheard of in England but in Italy he gets compared to Maldini and Cabrini a lot by the media and those past legends. Even Italy veterans like Materazzi have very high praise for him. Materazzi went as far as saying we signed the best wingback in the world.

569~~~
Love his composed passing.

570~~~
Excellent signing, what a bargain he will turn out to be. Him on the right, Shaw on the left, fantastic pair of fullbacks.

571~~~
He did a great job.  His positioning was much better than the first two games and looked dangerous when he gained the line.

Scared the hell out of me when he was down, though.  <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

572~~~
You can see that he is a proper defender. Good reading of the game and positioning, he will become a great player for us

573~~~
Really like him.

574~~~
We seemed fine last season for the short time it was Rafael/Herrera and Mata on the right. It was when Valencia came into the picture it stalled a bit.

575~~~
Big fan. Gets the job done with minimal fuss and very composed on the ball.

576~~~
Amazing, defensively solid without being offensively impotent, some here will want you to believe such right backs don't exist. Really happy with him, shrewd bit of business.

577~~~
Another showcase of Valencia being criticized for nothing. During our best spell (Tottenham, Liverpool, City etc.) last season, Valencia was our starting RB who performed consistently well. Him, Herrera and Mata combining down the right worked well. His final ball might leave a lot to be desired, but overall he had a good season. 

As Rafael was full of injuries, Darmian seems like a good replacement. I don't think RB will be a problem, regardless of which of these two plays.

578~~~
Seems to have slotted into the lineup rather seamlessly. Lets see how he fares at full speed when the season starts.

579~~~
I think Valencia did well, but quite often when he got the ball he turned back, which slowed down the attacks on that side. Darmian seems more willing to get into the box or byline and put a cross in and obviously he can defend as he is a natural defender. It isn't Valencia fault that he was asked to play at RB/wingback. That was down to as you say Rafael always being injured.

580~~~
He doesn't look like a new player. And thats sort of the biggest compliment I can give him. He's just slotted into the team almost seamlessly. He's not flashy, he just gets the job done. 

One of his crosses in the first half last night was a peach too. I'd forgotten what its like having a right back that can cross a ball.

581~~~
Eyes off. Herrera is yours as long as Matteo. One day I'll have the tagline "humongous twit obsessed with Darmian".

No but really, he's a great player. I have really high hopes for him. He'll probably be our best signing this summer. Only 25 and with plenty of room for improvement.

582~~~
Quality performance. Solid defensively and an intelligent and "aware" passer.

583~~~

585~~~
Darmobot at it again.

586~~~
He's going to love Rojo when he meets him. He can give him a lecture about tattoos.

587~~~
for the money he's okay, he's been solid but nothing special. He needs to step up to get ahead of Valencia first and one day he can perhaps reach Rafael level.. Hopefully it will be sooner rather than later. 

Still baffled about how easily we let Rafael go, younger and much better player atm perhaps too injury prone for LVG's liking..

588~~~
Rafael is good, but he isn't that good not on a world class level.

589~~~
Rafael's been world class two seasons back, only injuries held him back to claim it. He also became ne of the most consistent players through the dark season under Moyes and before that. Not saying he would ever become injury free but he was quite unlucky with rib and cheekbone inujuries last year. I think it was premature to get rid of at least decent right back who is experieced and still very young - younger than Darmian who my bet will be nothing special in his first season but then on we will see.

I want the Italian to succeed for the sake of our team and he's quite likeable character too but he needs time to develop and we already had complete rightback with clearly higher potential on our books in Rafael which is shame imo..

590~~~
How can you know that Rafael has higher potential than Darmian who has just started for us. Maybe you saw him in action in Italy but I doubt it.

591~~~
Potential doesn't matter much if the player isn't able to reach it. We can't wait around forever.

592~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

593~~~
C'mon, I liked Rafael too.  But it's a stretch to say that he was ever world-class.

594~~~
Rafael was world class? 

World class is when you describe Lahm or Alves. Rafael has never had a season that has matched those two. The word world class gets thrown around way too often.

595~~~
Is it just me or he looks a bit...erm...mediocre?I'm fine with a solid defender but can't get the excitement.He looks like the type of player that most of the fans will want to get rid after 2-3 seasons (not myself but knowing our fans it looks likely to me)

596~~~
For what it's worth, my housemate is from Turin and supports Torino. He says we've signed a great defender and emphasised his 'no nonsense' approach.

597~~~
the only world-class Rafael I can think of is Rafael Nadal

back to the topic, really refreshing to see such determined defending like that. Valencia for all his tank is never a proper defender

598~~~
I don't think even when fit he would have played. He is defensively inconsistent. In 12/13 he was good but he hasn't been defensively sound in 2 years. Vardy brushed him off with a shove. I don't see darmian or Valencia being shoved away with such ease

599~~~
Mediocre? Based on 2 games or more?
He's a type of player who will and should be at the club for years to come and who will make that position his own. THat's my expectation anyway.




-btw I like Rafael but some posters are overrating him immensely.

600~~~
No? Unless if you're expecting him to be the next Alves, Maicon or Lahm bombing down the flanks.

601~~~
It's just you, I think. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

602~~~
You won't be saying this when Rafael is plying his trade for some Turkish/Russian club trying to win a place in their first XI. Aside from one season Rafael has been miles off at United.

603~~~
Mediocre? He looks like our best buy this season. From all our signings he's performed the best. 

From our squad I think Shaw and Darmian look the sharpest during these 3 preseason games we've played.

604~~~
Pre-season doesn't mean much.I'm talking more about long-term i.e what he can bring to the team.All I can see is a solid defender but limited going forward - which is again, not bad at all but isn't the type of signing that will bring excitement and limitation will be scrutinised a lot on here soon enough when the real campaign kicked off.

605~~~
He can attack as good as he can defend. He played as a wingback for Torino. We have signed one of the best right backs in Europe and he will show it during the season.

606~~~
His performance vs Barça was outstanding.. If he can show this for us in the PL we have a hell of a player on our hands..  Just oozes class.

607~~~
So Rafael Dos Anjos is a chicken? <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

608~~~
ah I hardly follow MMA, so the name certainly slipped my mind<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

609~~~
I figured you weren't a MMA follower.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

But on topic, Darmian is class he is so smooth that's almost boring.

610~~~
He's much quicker than I thought, really good acceleration over short distances.

611~~~
he was not, and that can happen easily Brazilians are often prone to be comfortable with moves like that after they give up. Don't think Rafa gave up, it was Van Gaal who told him, he doesn't count with him, some strange decisions has been made before... miles off is silly overstatement mate.

612~~~
omg again at it, it was just clear faul, hand was pushing, Vardy didn't play with his body, it was unfortunate moment. Valencia showed how much liability he is on dozen more occasions but nobody talks about that, his defensive contribution is also very passive unlike rafaels which give us good advantage to set up counters and aggression pretty much needed. Darmian hasn't proved himself yet

613~~~
Always injured then. He hasn't really been that great for us, Fabio was getting similar praise before his departure and he's not even good enough to be a starter for Cardiff these days. Both had some good moments but were ultimately inconsistent and couldn't be relied upon.

Darmian looks like he's going to be significantly better.

614~~~
Darmian gonna be ace for us - no question about that. Very happy with this signing.

615~~~
Valencia was never a liability last season. That's an overstatement. He wasn't spectacular and he had minor issues in the RW to RB transformation initially but he was really consistent over the season. We can blame him for maybe 2 mistakes that led to goals. Which is why Rafael was benched even when fit.

616~~~
his understanding of the game and his passing are superior to rafaels. i really like rafa and i hope he would have gone out on loan instead of being sold.

617~~~
Sadly There's no point of that. He is 25. Darmian is the same age meaning even if he comes back next year he will still be second choice.

618~~~
i would give valencia another season and sell him when hes 30. then we can have rafa and darmian compete for the RB spot. that would have been ideal

619~~~
Valencia turns 30 this year. I don't think that will happen anyway. He doesn't really fit the profile we want

620~~~
yeah like i said i would have preferred that. as you correctly put it - it wont happen. clearly not a van gaal type of player.

621~~~
I am with you, it starts like with Blind, omg we've got new Pirlo etc and all of a sudden we have got squad player at best..

Again I get the excitement from fans, we have not seen always injured Rafael in full action for a long time who was an exciting player, instead we watch 6/10 or 7/10 ultraconsistent Valencia... fans have reason to be excited but , Darmian was quite average IMO, nothing special, hardly exciting going forward and okay defensively but harder times will come in the fecking premier league.

I want him to succeed but I think that Valencia will be the starter anyway which is a bit worrying..

622~~~
Next Gary Neville!!! (lol)

623~~~
Nobody compared Blind to Pirlo.

Valencia starting the season as our RB isn't worrying, he did a decent job overall last season and Darmian may well need a short adaptation period. As Van Gaal said, Schweini and Darmian have to prove themselves in the Premier League.

624~~~
he was hyped as feck, read the thread if you don't believe me and don't pretend it wasn't like that, that was also due to lack of quality at center midfield, particularly no6 position, we had only two players, injured Carrick and him.. hence the excitement

Of course he will need time to adapt, that's not worrying but I don't see him as exciting signing as others at all, and that's all. Valencia being decent I agree, I was on his side when lots of people slated him for his average performances but he wasn't anything special and our right hand side could have worked much better going forward if Valencia hasn't played like robot using his only foot. Overall it was slightly better than average season from him, he did half a dozen mistakes which led to goals too, being it rafael he was crucified here

625~~~
Blind wasn't hyped to feck. A lot of the caf members did not want him. 

You yet to show these world class performances Rafael put in.

626~~~
Rafael is no where near "world class". I've just caught the back end of this conversation but you can't seriously suggest that, <a class="username" data-user="84491, @m1y2" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84491/">@m1y2</a>?

627~~~
From the games I have seen him play he has looked a good defender, good positioning and snuffs out danger, contributes to making the team as a whole more solid he reduces options for the opposition where valencia offers them

628~~~
I see the same, but its a bit harsh to draw any conclusions from preseason. At least he looks more secure defensively than Valencia, which will allow the team to play better

629~~~
people have short term memories, he was world class two seasons back, on par with Zabaleta for the spot in the premier league TOTY, no one can deny that, as well as that injuries stopped him from being our no1 RB.

Feck that I stop posting here it's the same like to argue with people in Daley Blind thread from the beginning that we are buying an average player. No one believe that and Modric and Pirlo comparisions came from people who never seen him play in a single league game..

Not saying Darmian is like Blind but he's hardly world class and exciting player. If he can replicate Rafael's best season in two years time I will be only glad. I also can't judge on Darmian that much as I have seen very little of him unlike with Blind before but it seems very similar situation. Let's wait and be patient is my stance now but keeping Rafael to fight for the spot too would be much more exciting than a poor competition with Valencia...

Also last time I say this as it's getting annoying to me to repeat that Rafa's even younger than Darmian and already acomplished right back with a lot of experience, we've seen a lot of players overcoming their injuries in their mid twenties. It's not like he's Hargreaves, we should keep him too.

630~~~
But that isn't world class. Zabaleta isn't world class either. World class is when they're amongst the best in the world in their position. Rafael has NEVER been that.

631~~~
If Rafael is world class then why is no top side interested in signing him?

632~~~
Exactly.

Peak Alves, who was carrying Sevilla and then at Barca was world class.

Lahm is world class. Maicon was world class. 

If Rafael was world class, don't you think clubs would be lining up? Especially considering the lack of world class right backs.

633~~~
That's actually a lot. Usually you don't concede a goal where you can pinpoint the mistake of a single player.

634~~~
Rafa world class <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

He's not even in the top 5 RBs in the league. He's never been anything close to world class.

635~~~
LVG said yesterday in his long interview that Darmian will hit his peak later. I'm pretty sure that he will get better and better playing in PL with us. He showed absoluted class last year at the WC with Italy and showing what a real RB provides to a team.

He's very athletic, meaning that he's not afraid by the challenges, and he can runs down the wing. 

I'm very happy with this signing

636~~~
Of course Darmian isnt word class. Maybe he'll be probably not, I dont care ,what I care about if he'll be good and reliable for us. ANd from what I've seen he can be only better. 
Strange that you have already made your opinion on him, you think he's average and he's similar to Blind..

 And what does that exciting part mean. What should he do to make your excited, step overs or sthing? He's a proper RB, defends good and has a decent cross on him or a very good cross. Of course we should wait and see. He has just arrived and we'll see if he can replicate that one great season Rafael had.
Oh and as much as I rate Rafael he wasnt wc.
ANd there's nothing to prove he's not exactly like Hargreaves.

637~~~
Most full backs do. Because they often get caught out of position because of their requirement to attack and defend. Coleman clyne have 2 or more mistakes that led to goals

638~~~
Or why Brazil doesn't play him anymore?

639~~~
Zabaleta was the best right back in the fecking premier league in the strongest of seasons (same with coleman the other one). What are you on that you claim otherwise, now he's not, he peaked and he's on decline but he had world class season as had Rafael. 

really no need to spend time arguing with you it's heading nowhere

640~~~
I said that he reminds me of Blind hype last season but added that I won't make a proper judgement on him after he plays some games, please read what I wrote. Yes I made a statement about him what I think but it was rather a prediction..

I don't really demand stepovers for RB, what you described is what I want from the player too but there's difference in what he does on the pitch in the premier league and he does seem for me too leightweight and perhaps too little aggressive for my liking and pretty average going forward, this very good crossing thing, he made one good cross in preseason and some rushed misplaced passes too. I am really not excited, he's also average speed. If people are comparing him to Valencia than I get they are excited, he's likeable player but we should wait until the season starts and he puts in some good shifts. For that reason I rather like to underrate player than overrate him and be disappointed after.

641~~~
not to mention he can't buy his way into the Brazil squad either and with that defence, it's kinda sad

642~~~
He has been world class only in this forum, nobody outside of here considered him a world class, only a decent player at the best.

643~~~
Darmian was the best wingback in Serie A by all accounts, so clearly he's much more capable in "attack" then some are making him out to be. He's played a handful of pre season games with a new club, in a new country - where he doesn't even speak/understand English that well.

So he's clearly not going to be confident and perform at his best yet. The lad will only get better, but the signs are really promising.

644~~~
Well it seems you've already done that with Darmian. 

Also people are comparing him with Valencia in the sense we finnally have a proper RB unlike Valencia who's a winger turned to RB. 

From your statements it seems Darmian is really poor to average player from 3 preseason games. 

Also Zabaleta being the best RB in the 'strongest of season' (whatever that means) in the PL doesnt automatically make him wc.

645~~~
Against Barcelona he charged forward several times, but didn't get the ball and doesn't matter how good a FB is attacking wise, he msotly depends on overlapping and if the winger doesn't give him the ball, there isn't much he can do.

646~~~
If we are going to have wingers who ignore the overlapping fullbacks, then Darmian and Shaw may as well stay back and concentrate on defending. Because if the winger then messes up the FB is well out of position anyway.

647~~~
that means cutting off a very potential source of havoc

648~~~
I know but we depend on winger and fullbacks for our attacking play, so it needs to be addressed. I maid this point only because some people are complaining about his attacking abilities.

649~~~
That's not solely them to blame now is it. Not like Welbeck's goal against us in the cup.

650~~~
I know that, so someone tell the wingers to involve the FB's properly. Otherwise they will just be like a spare part who gets caught up by the goal line.

651~~~
Zabaleta had an absolutely brilliant season and you could possibly say he was world class, but there were still a handful of right backs that were better than him.

Rafael has never been one of the best right backs in the world. He hasn't, and you're extremely wrong in saying that. No one on here agrees with you for feck sake <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

652~~~
While they might get used regularly, a gambling forward run always helps even if a winger decided not to use them. Look at beckham/Neville, he used to get a lot a lot more time with Neville overlapping because the defenders couldn't get too tight. If Neville never made those runs the defender could easily get tighter and show him inside. 

Being a fullback requires lots of stamina but you have to accept sometimes you are purely making a dummy run.

653~~~
that basically means you never seen him play or that you are biased towards him. People also don't remember what happened last season let alone some seasons back.. you're forgiven if you name three rightbacks who were significantly better than those two mentioned but it's pathetic to even start. Because it's simply incomparable as the two aced the most toughest of leagues in the world while some other fullbacks aced their own league. Pathetic and subjective to even start but you can have a go..

654~~~
Darmian is very good attacking wise. He isn't Evra or Cole in that aspect, but he is hardly Azpilicueta who doesn't do much attacking wise.

655~~~
So according to your logic, Harry Kane is now a world class player - amongst the best strikers in the world - because he had a brilliant season last year? Of course not. To be recognised as one of the best in your position you have to be consistently brilliant there, that's why I said you could possibly argue that case for Zabaleta. Rafael had a <b>good </b>season in 2012/13, not even a brilliant one, never mind enough to be said to be 'world class'. Ridiculous claim, frankly.

Who would you say is world class at United right now then? I can think of one.

656~~~
Some hardcore debating going on.

657~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 'While some other full backs aced their own league.' So I was probably right when I said that if you're not PL proven you might as well be dead.

For starters Dani Alves was a much better player than any Premier League right back over the last 10 years or so. Lahm has always been significantly better than any PL full back too.

658~~~
Zabaleta was good. Quite some distance from world class level though. Alves and Lahm both considerably better than him and possibly the only world class right backs of the recent years (until Lahm was shifted to midfield for some strange reason), some players equally good during last years at one point or another (Lichsteiner, Piszczek, Carvajal). When it comes to full backs Marcelo and Alaba are also miles ahead of Zabaleta in terms of quality.

'Strongest of seasons'. Premier League teams record in Champions League over the past 3-4 years has been abysmal. City getting knocked out by the first good team they meet failing to make it out of groups twice. Arsenal not getting past last 16 even once, United never beating anyone decent (also knocked out in group stages in 2011), Chelsea aside from 2012 when they fluked it also never made any lasting impression and don't even get me started on Liverpool last year or English teams in Europa League. Chelsea were the only side that did any decent in Europe between 2011 and now. Doing well in Premier League is not really anything that plays in Zabaleta's favour when you consider the quality of players Lahm, Marcelo, Alaba and Alves came up against in Champions League (where their teams did well unlike City) and their domestic competitions.

But I guess you are just one of the people who reckon that until you've done it againt Lennon, McManaman and Brunt you do not exist.

659~~~
Agree. 

If we go by 23 world class players (2 players for position and 3 keepers) then Zabaleta was never (close) to a world class player. If we go by 5 players for position, then it could be argued (argued not definitely proven) that Zabaleta was a world class player, while Rafael wasn't.

660~~~
We cannot really name 4-5 world class per each position. How many world class strikers are there now? Midfielders? Attackers? World class definition should be 25-30 best players on the planet, not 70.

Rafael was never a world class player even if we stretch it to 5-6 per position I think.

661~~~
Yep.

The best 'definition' I have seen is probably 23 players (like the selection for WC/Euros). Probably add a few attackers (generally there are more than 4 really top strikers) and remove players from any position if needed (for example it can be argued that there isn't a single world class left back).

Anyway, Zabaleta was never a top 30 player in the world, and probably not even a top 50 player in the world. Rafael was never a top 50 player in the world. Both of them were easily top 100 player in the world in 12-13, but that isn't world class.

For Rafael is even more easy IMO. You cannot be world class if you don't perform for 3 seasons or so in a very high level. It is the reason why I wouldn't count Kane or Sterling world class.

662~~~
Alaba and Marcelo.

Agree with this definition. Rafael was only ever close in 12-13 and he was still some way behind Lahm and Alves.

663~~~
I do feel if you turned back time and went to that old Rafael thread 3 years or so back you would find that redcafe talked about him in a reverent manner. I distinctly remember the love and adoration he was showered with by nearly every cafite, and the scenario was much the opposite on here: the one or two people who dared to suggest he was not very good were quickly shot down in much the same sarcastic manner... I believe <a class="username" data-user="84491, @m1y2" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84491/">@m1y2</a> is the sane and proper human being here, he was simply one out of many on the caf who toekissingly adored the little guy, everyone was praising his passion and attacking play and if there were 3 or 4 people who qiestioned his defending, it would have attracted many condescending comments about how these people only formed those opinions from the same shit newspapers who said DDG was crap... it seems only <a class="username" data-user="84491, @m1y2" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84491/">@m1y2</a> has decided not to rewrite redcafe history.

Now that he has come down with injuries, fallen out of favour after the Fergie era and struggled to find form, he is simply getting dropped by the harsh mentality of football supporters. No respect.

That is why I feel footballers may act the cnut and follow where the money is, but supporters are just as fickle: lose your value and they want rid asap. If you are good or great, they will scream murder and disloyalty if it is the footballer who decides he can find a better place to ply his trade.

664~~~
There is a difference between liking a player and calling him world class. No one is denying that he was good till 12/13. However to call him world class would be a stretch.Can't really blame anyone else for his loss of form. At a team like United you really can't retain a player in the team if he doesn't offer anything. 

Marcelo isn't world class. He is good but nothing special. And like 90% of Brazilian full backs, he is average defensively. Alaba too isn't world class yet. But as he is young he is potentially going to be one if he continues the performances. And he also doesn't really play at LB anymore for bayern. Last season he played even at AM with bernat at LB

665~~~
Which mostly based on the fact that he's great offensively, also been said about Alves numerous times with no real basis to it. He's good enough defensively and Alves in his prime was excellent defensively too.

666~~~
You had quite a number of people on here calling him just that, world class/best rb in the premier league/wouldn't swap him for any other rb, etc. The love was real and it wasn't just because he looked like a huggable curly teddybear or because he tried to murder Tevez.

667~~~
Alves was world class, wouldn't say that Marcelo is. Alaba might have become one, but he plays now as midfielder.

To be fair, saying that he was the best RB in the league wasn't overrating him that much. Zabaleta was probably better, but it was marginal. Rafael was by far our best defender last season, and our third most important player (after Carrick and RVP), in a season when we walked the league.

If he had played for 2-3 seasons in that level, and improving a bit with experience, he would have been world class.

Anyway, while Caf isn't exactly RAWK in that aspect, we have a tendency to overrate our players. Even Evans was called world class at some time from people here. And Fletcher while a great player, was never world class but people called him so. Smalling will be the next in line.

Anyway, the real question is can Darmian become a world class RB? He looks a Zambrotta-lite to me. In a few years, who knows. He certainly has potential to become a very top right back. And while I love(d) Rafael, I am extremely happy that we signed Darmian. He is as good as Rafael has ever been, but more importantly, he never gets injured.

668~~~
Got forward well against Barca. I'm very optimistic about him as a signing.

669~~~
world class player - that expression has lost any meaning long time ago as it's thrown around to no end.

670~~~
This. Lallana can't wait to train with the world class talent back at Melwood? Give me a break.

671~~~
Been excellent so far

672~~~
He's class. One of my favourite United players already.

673~~~
Solid....

674~~~
Defensively superb.

675~~~
Best signing of the summer so far, absolute class and isn't afraid of getting forward.

Did feck all when he switched over to LB though.

676~~~
The engine on him! Ran tirelessly up and down that sideline all game long, even covering up for Calamity Phil and Johnstone a couple times in the process. He's going to be a special player if LvG doesn't dick around benching him for Valencia.

677~~~
At least he played well.

678~~~
I love him.

679~~~
Very impressive against PSG. Only defender who seemed to be reading the game, getting back several times to cover.

680~~~
I was worried because he seems so quiet off pitch, but damn has he proven me wrong out there. Great performance...again. feck Juventus!

681~~~
So how long do we have before Real come in for him?

682~~~
His dream is to entertain me, in any way he can.
So he'll stay at United.
At least until I die.

683~~~
One of the only positives tonight, he's been solid on this tour. I think he's going to make that position his own, Valencia the clown hardly done himself any favours tonight. I think his crossing is the only part of his game that is lacking but that will come. Really good signing, happy with Darmian.

684~~~
Can you say power engine ?

This is what we were waiting for from quite a time. Right kind of player for this club.

685~~~
The only real positive. Excellent tonight.

686~~~
Both full backs were very promising today.

687~~~
Oh, yeah, forgot about Shaw. He did well.

688~~~
Endless energy, and swept up after our dodgy CB's more than once as well as providing some threat in attack in the first half.

689~~~
Looks like we've signed a top quality player who will only improve over time.

690~~~
Love him already.

691~~~
Absolutely brilliant tonight, left and right back. Can become the top full back in the PL I reckon.

692~~~
looked a bit mediocre, average, while we waste one apparently world-class guy and let him leave.
<span style="color: #ffffff">yeah right...</span>

693~~~
He looked quite good. Seems to have a good understanding with Mata.

694~~~
Darmian looks promising.  His movement and positioning are class.  His recovery running is eye catching; he definitely bailed some folks out tonight.

At times he tries to force longer passes that he shouldn't and causes turnovers, but more time in the team may sort that.

Let's see how he does with the physical EPL play.  He's not the biggest and came from Italy.  I think he'll have some momentary struggles but will prove plenty good enough to make it.

695~~~
Changed his opinion about Valencia starting and Jones will probably be dropped for Smalling. Darmian will be starting Spurs now. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

696~~~
Loose as feck.  Fecking love him.  Needs to be in our starting XI against Spurs.

697~~~
Blind at left centre back, fantastic.

698~~~
What?
Italy is known for having good defenders, and he is said to be one of the best there, as far as I could gather.
Not the biggest, but he is far from a small right-back, keep in mind that the guy is 1.82 and can play CB as well.

699~~~
I agree he's tall and comes from a culture that produces excellent defenders. 

It's the shoulder to shoulder I see being a problem intitially.  I think he'll line out quickly, but he'll face an adjustment.  It's just so much faster and more physical than what he's faced.

700~~~
Played well defensively in the first half and made good runs but his crossing let him down.

701~~~
That's all that matters.  His crossing was fine anyways.  Not like Valencia offers more in that or any other department unless it's a bodybuilding contest.

702~~~
Can improve on his crossing but He is good. He quietly does his job without all the screaming and shouting at players for making mistakes

703~~~
His mentality and humility will serve him well.  Can just tell similar to Mata, he's a decent lad.  Future fecking legend.

704~~~
Really,  were you watching the same game as the rest of us?  To me, him and Shaw were the only 2 players who gained some credit in the game.  LVG also seems to agree.   I like Rafael too, but you can't be blind and not appreciate another player who did do a great job at RB.

705~~~
<a class="username" data-user="93689, @darioterios" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93689/">@darioterios</a> Oops! You got me there!

706~~~
Pretty cool today.

707~~~
All good but he's no Rafael, yo!

708~~~
He seems a good fit for us, he's slotted in quite seamlessly.

709~~~
Player of the pre season for me.

710~~~
Really happy with his performances, he's not only solid defensively, he looks very good going forward.

711~~~
Our best player against PSG by a mile. Until now, he looks like a real steal.

712~~~
Have you seen him? speed isn't going to be an issue. Doesn't matter how fast the EPL is, he's already one of the fastest players in the team. And more physical, yes, but hold the hype train. It's not as if the average Premier League player is built like Antonio Valencia and Memphis Depay. We overemphasise the physicality of the EPL. It <i>is </i>physical, more so than others, but he's a professional athlete playing in a league known for not being soft.

713~~~
Love him to bits.

714~~~
i love him dearly. i want to hold him tight and sing lullaby's to his ear as he gently falls asleep.

what a lovely pick up he's been. i'm a huge fan already.

715~~~
<img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/> Man, I guess I am not as clear as I think I am when I post.  Let me try again.

I've seen him in all the friendlies so far.  Yep, plenty fast.  I think I've posted about his recovery ability, so yeah, no arguments here.

I mean the speed at which the EPL plays: limited time on the ball, frequency of runs, etc.  Seria A is just played more slowly and deliberately.  Everyone that moves to the Prem says it's fast, even faster than they figured it'd be.  It's like the summer here in Texas.  I can tell you it's hot, and you may well believe me.  If you come down from further north it'll be a little rough for you until you acclimatize.  It catches people off guard.  I imagine the way the EPL is played versus Seria A isn't altogether different.

You don't have to be soft to take a few matches to learn to get your hips a little lower than your used to for shoulder to shoulder contact in Seria A.  You don't have to be soft to be surprised a whistle didn't blow for what was for the previous years a foul in your experience. 

I don't think he's soft.  He gets stuck in and carries on well from what little I've seen.

While not every team resembles Pulis' Stoke, he'll have to adjust a bit.

In any event, I'm looking forward to seeing him develop.  He looks like he's already good with upside yet.

716~~~
Ok, that explains it better. In that case, fair point.

As for Texas, you're preaching to the choir. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> I lived in San Antonio (Nacogdoches) and New Braunfels for five years. You need to develop gills for living in San Antonio because it's like breathing pure moisture. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

717~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvV0B4_civU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

718~~~
He was tied with Zabaleta as the best right back in the league when he was at his peak, admittedly that may have only been for a season or two. Injuries really fecked the poor guy over.

And no, he was never world class, but that doesn't mean he wasn't a fantastic player for us at times.

719~~~
When you read the comments on his FB page, you understand we have a gem at this club, a top top block and a bloody good footballer.

720~~~
Pay me tens of thousands a week to be constantly injured and I can be a top bloke too. There no doubting his attitude is top notch but it makes 0 sense to keep a constant sick note.

721~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

722~~~
Wrong thread mate.

723~~~
He's barely put a foot wrong so far. If he carries on like this then that's RB sorted for years. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

724~~~
He's absolute sex. One of our better signings in years.

725~~~
Looks like a real class player so far.

726~~~
Very impressed so far

727~~~
Looks the real deal.

728~~~
Looks class. So aware of moving inside to RCB when Smalling is having to overcompensate for our left side.

729~~~
Very involved offensively, he could play with a little more courage at times but you can already see he could be seriously good for us.

730~~~
Loving him so far

731~~~
Looks like a very good signing.

732~~~
Reads the game and positions himself wonderfully. 

Looks like he could be a fantastic signing.

733~~~
Fantastic game so far.

734~~~
"Value" <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

735~~~
Probably our best player that half.

736~~~
Really good so far. Been confident in him since we were linked, will be a top player for us.

737~~~
Easily the player of the half. Stopped so many counter attacks. So diligent and effective.

738~~~
Motm for me so far. Absolute class defensively

739~~~
Flawless. He's a huge upgrade on Valencia.

740~~~
More signings like this please, the boy is absolute quality. Assured defensively and can actually pass the ball, if only we had a couple of cb's like him.

741~~~
Even the Liverpool fan I'm watching with says he looks a cracking player<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

742~~~
Italian's suave defending style.

743~~~
Great start.

744~~~
Brilliant so far.

745~~~
Having a responsible RB who knows defending is his first and foremost duty is a little surreal tbh. Great but surreal. 

We haven't had a solid RB who made the position his own in what, 7-9 years?

746~~~
Anyone else see the cute high five with mata? 

Herreras eyes must be going green on the bench. 

Great performance so far looks solid in defence and attsck

747~~~
He hasn't had a bad game for us yet.

748~~~
Wow!

I am immensely impressed. Barring injuries, I can see him becoming the staple of our defense this season, and hopefully for many to come. Sure there will be mistakes while he settles in, but he looks like he has it all, and he looks entirely reassuring in everything he does.

749~~~
Looks like he's excellent player, especially defensively, his reading of the game is top notch.


<span style="color: #ffffff">Please stay fit.</span>

750~~~
Played well, currently looking like our best signing this season which is a surprise.

751~~~
Feck me, he's good isn't he?

752~~~
Best player in the league right now. Fact

753~~~
probably our best player with Smalling, not that everybody else was great, it was a poor half overall

754~~~
Very good so far! could become a fan's favorite

755~~~
Rafael who???

756~~~
Looks like he's been playing for us for years. A definite upgrade over Valencia and Rafael, in my opinion.

757~~~
I love him already. He plays so reliable, seems to have a good head on his shoulders and does the simple things. Good pace, stamina and no nonsense.

758~~~
Da Silva mate
<span style="color: #ffffff">Seriously Darmian has been great</span>

759~~~
With some players you can just tell that they will be good. This guy looks the part so far, hopefully he doesnt get injured often.

760~~~
Reminds me of Gary Neville. Very solid defensively, but no mug when it comes to going forward. Also works his socks off.

761~~~
Florentino Perez is watching

762~~~
He looks really solid so far, might even be our best player so far in the match.

Edit: Also fecking refreshing to see him being able to use his left foot after a season of Valencia's right footed charade.

763~~~
He's owned his area so far, which has allowed Mata to roam about to wherever he wants to

764~~~
He's more technically gifted than Gaz. In reality he's a mix between Gaz and the Da Silva boy. He's better defensively than Rafa but not as good as Gaz is. He's more technically gifted than Gaz but not as technically gifted as Rafa.

765~~~
Who made the mistake with the Spurs' chance in the 5th min? Commentator here said Darmian should have been higher up so Eriksen would be offside.

766~~~
He loves to run, what a player!

767~~~
One of the midfielders should have been tracking Eriksen IMO.

768~~~
I love the guy it's like he's been playing for us for ages! He is everywhere on the pitch defending and attacking. What a fantastic signing he is!

769~~~
He is cheating, I thought if you were RB you were only allowed to use your right foot? Needs to be careful or the ref may start picking up on it.

770~~~
Looks nifty. Like.

771~~~
No wonder Ancelotti wanted to keep him at Milan. Really talented lad.

772~~~
My only gripe is that he doesn't wear the number 2.

773~~~
Best of the new players today.

774~~~
Excellent PL debut. Very impressed by his defending.

775~~~
Fantastic.

776~~~
Excellent debut. Really like the look of him.

777~~~
What a debut.

778~~~
The whole defence looked dodgy once he is replaced by Valencia. Shows how much better of a RB Darmian is, Valencia is not even anywhere close to his standard.

779~~~
It's Darmian you knowwww..hard to believe it's not Neville



Well, you get the point

780~~~
Best player today.

781~~~
He's solid, this guy is gonna be a very very goo signing.

782~~~
Top, top quality. Absolute bargain.

783~~~
Man of the match along with Smalling today.  Diiffence falling apart after his subsitution

784~~~
Impressed with his defensive awareness, kept Chadli out of the game till he went off. Last 10 minutes showed the difference between him and Tony V defensively, great buy from LvG

785~~~
Really liked his performance, solid defensively and a couple a decent crosses. Cringed when Valencia got caught under the ball and Smalling to bail him out.

786~~~
Looks a good player, happy with his performance.

787~~~
Some miscommunication now and then that's understandable but his defensive qualities cannot be doubted.

788~~~
Good debut from him today. Looked solid defensively. Doesn't look like he is going to be a driving force overlapping going forward. Instead being a more solid option that plays it simple and smart when going forward.

789~~~
Yes, Valencia was caught out of position no less than two times within minutes of coming on. Didn't amount to anything, thankfully, but both situations could've become dangerous. That's the difference between a defensively good right back, and a half decent one. The former will open up space for potentially dangerous situations far less than the latter. Sometimes it can be hard to spot, too, as people tend to look at what happens where the ball is, which is only natural too. That's why it's so refreshing to see so many recognize Darmian's terrific debut.

790~~~
Very good start. RB Position sorted for years to come.

791~~~
I think I love him.

792~~~
Pleased with his defensive effort, expect more from going forward but overall looks decent prospect with a room for improvement.

793~~~
Just class. Solid as a rock. You saw how good he was when Valencia replaced him.

794~~~
Very very good.

795~~~
Great performance. Based on an enormous sample size of 1 game he is clearly the best of all the signings.

796~~~
We bent over as soon as he came off. I think it was coincidence, but his positioning was perfect.

You can tell he's been brought up in Italy.

797~~~
Played like he's been here for years, great to see. MOM for me because of this although I understand why Smalling is leading the vote. Great to see him play well too.

798~~~
Excellent from the Italian Gary Neville. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

799~~~
Fantastic debut. Classy performance, and has a very good football IQ

800~~~
Brilliant performance from the lad, a really intelligent player, who has great positioning.

801~~~
Class act. Fantastic signing.

802~~~
Going by that performance it looks like he's going to offer or bring some much needed solidity at the back.

803~~~
So this is what it's like to have an actual right back...

804~~~
Very solid. Imagine if he had Vidic, Ferdinand and Evra as his partners...<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

805~~~
Thought he was very good today.  I think if we actually play with a proper right winger he can cause all sorts of problems and defends so well.  His positioning and awareness was wonderful versus Spurs in his home opener.

806~~~
You could see how much of an impact he was once he came off and Spurs were getting so much freedom down their left. Mata had to come back and help Valencia ffs.

807~~~
If DDG leaves he will be probably be my new favourite player <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

808~~~
Love the lad. Those Italians know how to defend.

809~~~
Would have been MOTM if not for Smalling's catalog of tackles in the 2nd half. Great debut. Best of the new crop so far.

810~~~
Impregnable.

811~~~
Excellent showing. Love him already. Not afraid to get stuck in either.

812~~~
He'll be player of the season, mark my words.

813~~~
Not too early to say best right back in the league is it? In all seriousness, I think he will be before the season is done. Class.

814~~~
Being substituted resulted in him getting the biggest applause of the day. Must have felt good to him

815~~~
The Italian Gary Neville.

816~~~
Van Gaal: "I like the performance especially of Darmian"

Good he agrees with us.

817~~~
Excellent debut, what a class buy from us.

 Don't understand how Milan voluntarily let him go.

818~~~
Darmian<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
So happy we've got him. Gonna be immense for us.

819~~~
Just as in pre season he looks a class act, superb defensively and open to overlap but it's difficult as Mata drifts inwards with the ball so often.

820~~~
I think his passing and general footballing ability will go unnoticed because he's such an accomplished defender. He played some great balls forward today. Really happy with what I've seen so far today and in pre season.

821~~~
So, so glad we got him instead of Clyne. We should have the fullback positions sown up for years to come now.

822~~~
Ancelotti wanted to keep him, but he was fired in 2009. They sold most of their youngsters those years IIRC.

823~~~
My MoM. He was imperial in defense and good going forward.

824~~~
Give Smalling MOTM, but Darmian was very close. Defensively, I thought he was superb. He also got forward at the right time and put in a couple of decent crosses. I'm not sure Mata compliments down the right, though.

825~~~
Great RB, very solid passer and defends with his brain. Looks like a real bargain at £15m.

826~~~
MOTM for me.

827~~~
MOTM for me, glad to have a solid right back. This boy looks a player but still early days.

828~~~
He highlighted even more just how horrible Valencia is. He came off and we looked shaky at the right. Super debut!

829~~~
Excellent, my MOTM.

830~~~
And me

831~~~
Superb. As soon as he left the field it was open season for Spurs down our right.

832~~~
Excellent performance, an actual RB.

833~~~
Good debut. Especially convincing with his defensive work. Looking forward to seeing more from him.

834~~~
From the BBC match report. Think they watched a different match.

835~~~
Pleasantly surprised by how he played, wasn't expecting him to be as composed as he was, best of the debutants for me

836~~~
I really like him. Very impressive debut. Please stay fit all season.

837~~~
Milan has gone bonkers for very long now.

838~~~
Yup. It was very stupid of them to focus on veterans rather than developing youth too.

839~~~
He's one of those satisfying players that isn't going to behave like an idiot every couple of games. Solid, reliable and clearly very, very good at his job.

840~~~
Early days but he looks a proper right back. His injury record looks very promising too.

841~~~
Was very good again, looks like we may have an absolute gem at a bargain price.

842~~~
Interesting to see how good he can become with us, was probably my MOTM

843~~~
The difference between Darmian and Valencia. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

844~~~
That's racist.

On a more serious note, after he went off I started wondering if he's that good or if the rest of the defense is that bad.  Either way, it's a sign that he's the type of player who makes the people around him better.

845~~~
A very close 2nd in my MoTM voting. Thought he was very good though. As the commentator said, he was made to look even better once he went off because you could see the clear difference between him and Valencia. Very happy with our full-back situation for the season. Hope they both stay fit. Good debut, Darmian.

846~~~
Unless you are called Andrea Dossena

847~~~
Looks like the real deal. I think he will prove to be one of our better signings of the last few windows. Looks more than capable defending and comfortable in possession also. Owen in the BT Sport commentary said a few times how he wasn't as good going forward which I don't think was a fair reflection of that game. I felt he got forward when he could and showed some promise in the attacking third too. Seemed knackered at the end, which is hardly surprising.

 Hope he cements that right back spot as his own and I think he will.

848~~~
Excellent debut. Looks a top class player. Technically very good and an actual defender at right back.

849~~~
Shaw and Darmian should be our fullbacks for years. The new Irwin and Neville.

850~~~
Yup.

I hope substituting darmian with valencia after 70 minutes is not going to be a habit for van gaal though.

851~~~
Darmian had cramp. It's expected as he's still not 100% used to the pace of the premier league while also being so early in the season.

852~~~
Still early but he looks quality plus Spurs found room immediatedly after he went off. Humble pie for me after I favoured a move for Coleman over him.

853~~~
He's quite good. Signing I'd expect Fergie to make. Unassuming character who puts  solid performances.

854~~~
Remember he needs to reach valencia's level first before he can think of being as good as Rafael. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Bloody brilliant so far.

855~~~
My MOTM for today, he was brilliant hope he wasnt taken off for an injury. Easily the best of the new boys so far.

856~~~
hmmm...I can see why the Maldini comparisons were made.

looks a fantastic signing.

857~~~
Wonderful player, I also love the fact that we have two quite tall full backs now.

858~~~
I still wanna see him vs a strong pacy winger who challenges him directly. 

Otherwise he seems quite good defender.

859~~~
Does nothing but impress me every single time he steps on the pitch.

860~~~
Nah Smalling was different class.

He looks very dependable though and the sort of player you just instantly feel assured about.

Could be a very shrewd signing.

861~~~
Best Torino player we've bought since Denis Law. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

862~~~
I think i remember <a class="username" data-user="66946, @khoazany" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66946/">@khoazany</a> calling this lad average <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

863~~~
Absolutely, the amount of times you see centre forwards peeling off onto the fullbacks when crosses come in, just not going to happen any more, it also means we can afford to sacrifice height in our areas of the pitch too.

864~~~
From what he shown on pre-season.Happy if he can prove me wrong though.Don't want to see Valencia at all.

865~~~
Agree with you there, I don't think even Valencia does.

866~~~
He was our best playerin pre season by a distance.

867~~~
Reminds me a lot of Gary Neville.

868~~~
Man of the Match for me, and quite comfortably.

He's been the most impressive of our signings including today and pre season.

869~~~
Love him. Only £14m, was he? He's already one of our best players.

870~~~
£12.7m

871~~~
That's even more of a bargain. It's such a shame Clyne rejected us(!)

872~~~
Looked a class little player, particuarly for the price we paid, RB looks sorted longterm, not much else to say.

873~~~
Comparing Darmian and Clyne is like comparing Ashley Cole with Philip Neville

874~~~
Indeed. To be honest at their ages, they could be the next Irwin and Neville and Evra!

875~~~
Really, really good performance from Darmian today. Have tears in my eyes watching the first real fullback since G. Neville. He will make mistakes, but i don't expect him to keep making the same dumb mistakes all the time.

876~~~
If we can find such a cheap and good rightback in Italy, perhaps we can find a cheap CB too..hopefully left footed defenders are in hot supply there too.

877~~~
Agree looks a class solid defender in the mould of Gary, a snip at the price.

878~~~
I would like that

Its the return of the fullbacks who can actually defend which is something we needed since we've got no Vidic and Rio constantly covering their arses. I kind of missed that.

879~~~
Awesome player, comfortable with the ball at his feet and head, proper positioning, fighter's attitude. May he stay injury-free.

880~~~
Ladies and gentleman we have a proper RB.

881~~~
I just want to take this moment to thank Alves for signing his new Barca contract, he would have given us 2 years max and cost a fortune in wages, this fella could give us 7-8 years of fantastic service with non of the baggage.

882~~~
He's fan-fukcing-tastic.

We finally have a proper right back.

883~~~
So much for 'adapting'. First PL-game, and arguably the MotM (maybe Smalling). Looks the real deal, this Darmian fella.

884~~~
Good game from him. He will do well here.

885~~~
Weirdly never worried when he went in for a challenge. I knew he wouldn't get done.

886~~~
I've said it before he even kicked a ball for us, he will be our best signing under van Gaal and one of our best players for a long time. Players like Cabrini and Maldini don't sing you praise for being average.

887~~~
He's meant to be very fast, and seems to have impeccable positioning. I think most pacy wingers won't get much out of him. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

888~~~
I am confident he won't get outpaced like Ivanovic was today against Montero.

889~~~
Mate Ivanovic couldn't handle him, he must have been so happy when Montero got injured.
TBH though Montero is fecking rapid, he could trouble quite a few fullbacks. Interesting to see how Darmian will do against him

890~~~
Signing of the summer for us, so far anyway.

This is why we railed against Valencia last year. THIS is what we've been missing.

891~~~
Very solid. Looks like an Irwin type, understated and goes unnoticed most weeks with 7 or 8 out of 10 performances.

892~~~
Darmian was flawless today. If we can keep him and Mike fit, the right side of our defence is rock solid.

893~~~
Thought he was great.

894~~~
?

895~~~
Shaw's looking solid as well, just need that LCB nailed down. Either a new signing or Rojo rising to the occasion will be required cause I don't think Blind's the answer. Not a slight on Blind at all, I think he's done alright playing there but that is the area we could improve in the defence.

896~~~
Smalling. LvG called him Mike Smalling in a press conference

897~~~
That would be Mike Smalling.

898~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

899~~~
Quite dissapointed that we went shopping on that wank Serie A for this kind of average player. Should have instead signed an EPL proven player like Clyne, Coleman or Walker.

900~~~
To think some wanted Clyne over him hahahahaha

901~~~
He closed the right channel. Closed and sealed it.
Valencia messed up a bit.

902~~~
The fact that we only really started to look shaky is when he went off speaks volumes. It's a big big defensive bonus when you are able to seal off the opponents wings in the premier league, as it is a league based primarily on wing play. His positioning is impeccable and he has the composure to go with it. If we can keep him and shaw fit, it might just be a record season in terms of clean sheets...

903~~~
Love the lad, a future Caf legend.  Will be an OT favorite by end of the season.  New league, new country, new language, no problem.  Seems like a throwback to the modern footballer, mentality-wise.  We need more players of his ilk.

904~~~
His positioning is very good.

We got him for 12.7M, what a bargain.

905~~~
I wonder how this thread would be if Kane had scored off of that chip.

906~~~
It was Eriksen, Kane played the pass. 

I wonder how this thread would be if Rooney had scored from Darmians cross...

907~~~
Aside from a couple of slip ups, I love his tactical awareness. As expected, he displayed a very very good positional and tactical awareness today. Let's hope he can keep this going.very solid performance.

908~~~
Ah , they all look the same to me. Point made.

909~~~
They would be murdering the Blind thread.

910~~~
Just the player we needed, someone in the Evra, Vidic circa 2005 mold, who is relatively unknown and can come in and serve for up to 7-8 years.

911~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

912~~~
Finally good to have a right back that can you know, defend.

913~~~
Can't ask for anything more on a debut. Really positive signs.

914~~~
Love him already. Looks like a seasoned player, who has seamlessly fitted in with the team. 

Excellent performance last night. If I have to pick a fault, it would be that he didn't take a shot, when a couple of time he has the opportunity to do so. Got himself in good positions in the box and then decided to pass it. 

No complains though. So far looks the best of the summer signings.

The contrast from him to Valencia was staggering. Hope, we don't have to see the Ecuadorian much at RB, rather see him as a right winger again.

915~~~
Tbh Raoul, these are the kinds of signings that provide the most satisfaction as opposed to the big name players. 

Value for money, hard worker and you'll get consistent good performances out of them.

Along with Schneiderlin, my signing of the summer.

916~~~
Hugely impressive. Had we kept Rafael as his backup instead of Valencia we'd have been set for years.

917~~~
Injured too often to be a reliable back up. At least Valencia stays fit.

918~~~
Not fair to tell a player Rafael's age that he'll be an indefinite sub.

919~~~
Why did he come off by the way? Was he injured? Surely can't be a fitness issue, he's been first choice all throughout pre-season.

920~~~
True. It would however, be fair to offer him the chance to stay and fight with Darmian for the spot if he was willing to do so. Instead of that we froze him out and tried to convert a winger to the position. I think Rafael would definitely have been happy to stay if LVG had showed some faith in him. 

Valencia's always fit and has had a lot of good games there but he's still really struggling with positioning and awareness. We had another example of that yesterday for Eriksson's chance. It's happening too often for me to be confident when he's at RB.

Maybe I'm being old fashioned but I really think defenders should be able to defend. I'm not a fan of finishing games with two midfielders in the back four. LVG likes to experiment but I don't think it should be at the expense of the basics. Two natural centre halves and two natural full backs should be a given imo.

921~~~
I think he took us all by surprise, not because he was bad before he joined but most of us had never seen him play. I remember reading pieces on him from Serie A fans and they were raving about how lucky we were to sign him and for the price we got him for. 

If he plays like that every game & Shaw stays injury free we'll have the best fullbacks in the league.

922~~~
Great display, my MOM.

923~~~
Solid enough performance.

924~~~
Good performance, I was very impressed with what I saw on the tour. If I was a betting man I'd say he'll be in the Pfa team of the season.

925~~~
Got some praising in passing from Martin Samuel too..

Seeing as Rafael never won over the English press, it seems that Darmian really did impress..I'm glad.

926~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6RJaWKOBEI0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

927~~~
Does anyone have any news regarding the knock / injury he picked up during the game?

Hopefully he is fit to play against Villa on Friday.

928~~~
Was just cramp I think.

929~~~
Would have been ideal.

Very pleased with Darmian though.

930~~~
I went the game and haven't seen the highlights but he was very tidy and got to everything first. Looked very calm and tracked runs, refreshing!

931~~~
I think we need a young rightback in the same mould as cover..that can stay fit and can cross..lets see if our scouts can hit the jackpot again.

932~~~
Varela?

933~~~
Perfect.

934~~~
Darmain will be our right back for years to come. At the moment I'm struggling to find a weakness to his game. The price tag certainly doesn't justify the talent.

935~~~
He's not had much top-level European football experience, so Im not sure how how he would handle the step..If the coaching staff thik he can, then yes..if not, a a young gem..maybe in their late teens or early twenties

936~~~
Was OK. I think there's a lot of room for improvement though. For example, I guess he didn't hit the fullback once with his cross. 

I just miss the fear in defenders eyes when Valencia was approaching. I mean the fear of bruises all over their body.

937~~~
I've noticed that he's quite good at picking out a quick forward pass. Noticed it during pre season as well. There were instances where our players would normally just pass it sideways or back and he found someone further up the pitch releasing the ball very quickly.

938~~~
That will get instantly coached out of him, dont worry. Too much risk.

939~~~
If you want someone of your description - young, talented and with plenty of european experience then you have to pay a lot of money like we did for Shaw. Better off trying to develop Varela if he's as good as they say he is. Now is the best time to start bedding him into the first team

940~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

The sad thing is that you aren't joking.

941~~~
Not necessarily European experience as in playing in continental tournaments..I meant playing regularly in their league..you learn more from playing against older players I feel..And not necesarily british...someone much cheaper..thats where our scouts come in..However, Ive got no problem with Varela. hope he makes it.

942~~~
Another quality half defensively.

943~~~
I was so wrong to be skeptic about him. I admit it with joy. Fecking brilliant signing.

944~~~
Very good defender. Daft on the corner though.

945~~~
He's got the dirty Italian defensive arts about him too. Better and better and better. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

946~~~
Our best player so far. He's excellent.

947~~~
Gone from being highly sceptical when we signed him to being in love in just 1,5 games. Will no doubt do some errors over the season but he looks extremely solid.

948~~~
After watching winger breezing past Valencia time and time again, as well as him giving countless freekicks away too, Darmian had been a breath of fresh air. Nothing much goes past him.

949~~~
Best player on the pitch for United, for me.

The word <i>solid</i> defines this lad.

950~~~
Nice to see he isn't afraid to stick in and let who ever he's marking know he's there. Every defence needs one or two of them type of lads.

951~~~
Now this guy can defend. Poor on the corner, but love how aggressive and tight he is in 1v1's.

952~~~
This guy is amazing. A wonderful defender and very calm presence on the field. I feel so safe with him in the side.

953~~~
We should import all our defenders from Italy.

954~~~
He's Gary Neville with pace. There I said it.

955~~~
Has impressed me again this match! Great signing!

956~~~
Stuart Pearce saying he's been dissapointing on Talksport.

957~~~
Guess he'll be the next Cafu in that case.

958~~~
Hey guys. Do you remember that one time when someone got past Darmian with the ball?

No. Me neither.

959~~~
His did a bit of shirt tugging and the pundits are all over him? Skrtel does it every game he's played in yet no one even talks about it after so many years.

960~~~
Has definitely steadied a weak spot in the team.

961~~~
Clueless. Darmian has been amazing so far.

962~~~
Both our fullbacks have been amazing so far.

963~~~
Good performance from him. Not convinced it was as good as some are making out but positive signs from him.

964~~~
He'll be better than Gary Neville. There I said it.

965~~~
10/10. 
Won almost every tackle he attempted and looks solid position wise.

966~~~
Very happy with him so far. To be honest he was the signing which I wasn't really sure if he would be a success here. But now I have no doubt he will be a brilliant signing for us <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

967~~~
Will be interesting to show his attacking side more.

Been class so far otherwise.

968~~~
Everytime someone ran at our defence from his side, I was looking forward how Darmian would shut him down this time. Fantastic.

969~~~
I fecking love his cute face when he turns around to check if his kick cleared the ball. Lovable little fecker <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

970~~~
His defensive awareness is miles ahead of valencia. cant believe we bought him as a cover for him. Knows exactly when to tuck in to defend and senses danger so early.

971~~~
Proper fullback performance!

972~~~
Was a rock today. Was lucky to not concede a pen though

973~~~
Flawless performance. The second coming of Gary Neville.

A bit like Vidic in the sense that you see him doing all the little things, the dark arts of defending, with aplomb from the first time he steps onto the pitch.

974~~~
An intelligent, tactically-minded defender. Exactly what we needed.

975~~~
Looks comfortable at RB wouldn't have thought this was his first season in England.

976~~~
Darmian's making me forget about Rafa. That's how good he is. 

Loved his handbags with that City reject Richards. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

977~~~
Don't believe that for a second. He was bought to be first team.

978~~~
He still looks like it's a training ground game for him, he doesn't look like he's trying! Very impressed with him thus far.

979~~~

980~~~
Got better as the game went on but not as strong and composed as in the first game

981~~~
Never got worried when Villa was attacking from his side.  So solid defensively.  Loved his handshake with Richards before the corner.  Richards was thinking "Wtf?" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

982~~~
love him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Him and Shaw are brilliant, so rarely get beat

983~~~
What he did with Richards was hilarious. Love the lad.

984~~~
That's even more hilarious when you consider he's a fairly wiry lad and Richards is a tank of a man. What a guy.The cynical corner tactics actually make me trust his defensive nous even more. Gary Nev was the master of the defensive dark arts and this lad seems like his bastard Italian son.

985~~~
He said it in a beautiful Italian accent.

986~~~
Someone who can defend one-on-one *sheds tear*.

987~~~
Cheeky bugger.

988~~~
That's hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

989~~~
Still cant believe the ref didn't give that as a pen though. He was looking right at it.

Played well despite that.

990~~~
I love him. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
How often do you see penalties given from shirt pulling during corner kicks? If they start to be given there will be 10 penalties each game.

991~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

992~~~
It's not a pen to me. He was pulling Ricards' shirt but had released it just before Ricard jumped. A bit dangerous but well played by Darmain indeed.

993~~~
Love Darmian. Oh my what a player we've got. Bringing his dark Italian arts to the Prem on United's behalf. Oh my<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

994~~~
Showed tonight that his baby face belies some good old fashioned defensive skullduggery. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

995~~~
Richards actually thinks Darmian is pointing to his face as if he got something sticking there <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

996~~~
He did he had a cut on his right cheek

997~~~
And if anyone knows talent when he sees it, it's currently unemployed manager Stuart Pearce.

998~~~
Luke Shaw is good aswell.

999~~~
We were too nice for a while..we need that back.

1000~~~
So he's even versed in the dark arts, good to know.

1001~~~
Did he or was Darmian trying to distract him? He was offering Richards his hand to shake at another corner. Deliberate distraction? Or is that reading too much into it?

1002~~~
He let go of Micah just in right time. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1003~~~
He was distracting him, typical Italian defender will try to take advantage of anything including bleeding Cheek

1004~~~
Love it.

1005~~~

1006~~~
I'd be very surprised if he doesn't establish himself as the best right back in the league at some point.

1007~~~
Very good signing by the looks of it. Incredibly hard to get past. He has this knack of always getting a toe on it making the attacker make a mess of it. I'm very impressed so far.
His tugging at the corner could have cost us though.

1008~~~
Did we bollocks. Van Gaal's words likely got interpreted wrong because he doesn't speak great English. He was just saying Darmian is now a 2nd option at right back, as in we now have 2 options.

1009~~~
Bets on how many times we will hear "typical Italian defender" by pundits and commentators before the end of the season? It's going to get nauseating.

1010~~~
Cleaned up very well, again.  Clearly a trend.  

I'd rather he had not carried on so much with Richards.  It was a mismatch to begin with, and he found himself playing catch up a time or two--notably when he committed what should have been a penalty.  Had he just focused on his man and what he had to do, maybe he wouldn't have found himself in that situation.  Either way, he outmatched alone and stood up well.

1011~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1012~~~
Love the guy. Such an intelligent defender. He seems so tricky to get past. Just reads dribblers so well. 

He will no doubt get sent off once or twice a season in the PL due to his Vidic-like style at corners but he is such a talent. Chuffed to have him.

1013~~~
I should preface this by pointing out that it has only been two games, but....Used to hate when other full backs would try this.  Most of the time, the foot in either caused the attacker to chip the ball past the defender or it resulted in a needless foul in a dangerous position.  But Darmian is so quick and smart with his timing and anticipation that it seems to be a real strength of his.

He has replaced Rafael.  Therefore, the go to for commentators with Rafael, ie Brazilian, so good going forward but struggles with defending, is going to be replaced by "typical Italian defender."  They need to rely on mundane, over simplified tidbits to get themselves through the game of commentary

1014~~~
1 red card, 19 yellows in 133 appearences for Torino.

1015~~~
Someone´s gotta say it . . . meh!

Virtually zero going forward. What, one cross? A couple of very clumsy fouls that gave Villa some dangerous free kicks. Could´ve given two penalties away, and was clearly outclassed by Richards on one of those corners. Caught dangerously out of position at the 50th minute on one of Villa´s best chances. Valencia would´ve been crucified for a similar performance.

Solid defensively for the most part, but I hate finding myself agreeing with Stuart Pierce.

Would definitely still take him over Valencia, but am not on the bandwagon as of yet.

1016~~~
I like him a lot already,he is going to be the best right back in the world in a couple of years and hopefully turn Barcelona down when they come calling.

1017~~~
Hahahaha I love this so much and couldn't stop laughing because if you play it for longer, Richards thinks he's saying "I'm watching you" in Italian but he was just trying to help Richards, bless his heart. I think herrera is now 2nd behind my newest man crush.

Can defend too.

1018~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Loving this lad already.

1019~~~
I thought he was pretty off today and made a lot of mistakes, which happily for him ended up on nothing.

1020~~~
Best right back in the league... Yes I said it.. The guy is a class defender.

1021~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fantastic

1022~~~
Seeing this quote everywhere. Who did he say that to?

1023~~~
Clumsy fouls <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> They were as clumsy as the freekick and yellow Bastian picked up when he came on against Tottenham...

1024~~~
The answer to your question is in the tweet itself.

1025~~~
I think he means who interviewed him.

1026~~~
That's why I never drink while watching a game...

1027~~~
Not sure if you're being serious but I meant who did Micah Richards say that to. Seems an odd thing to admit and makes him look a little bit.. soft

1028~~~
Class player.

1029~~~
Are you sere that was in the 50th minute? 
Or it was 52nd?

1030~~~
Yeah I´m sere.

1031~~~
Based on these games, yes! What a player he looks! I'm so excited that we have what looks like a pretty complete RB already.

1032~~~
We seemed to have Shaw and Darmian sat naturally deeper, as though they were under instructions to not get forward too much. I don't think he was as clumsy as you're making out.

1033~~~
Loved the juxtaposition of these two hyperbole-ridden posts. I guess football is subjective...

1034~~~
Shaw was clearly more offensive and exciting than Matteo. We were dead on the right side of our attack.

1035~~~
He's calm and composed, reminded me of an ivanovic type performance. Apart from not scoring goals hardly anything gets past him in defence.

1036~~~
Because Mata was a nomad - both the chances he created were either through the middle or the left side. Darmian can't really bomb forward without any security.

1037~~~
Distraction is exactly what he was trying to do, on both those occasions <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1038~~~
Valencia and Mata seem to have much more of an understanding. Natural I suppose given the time they´ve had together.

1039~~~
I already love him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's mental

1040~~~
Very solid defensively, as expected.

But with him and Mata on the same flank, our attacking play from the right wing has been virtually non-existent in the past two games.

1041~~~
He's taken to the league very well so far. Should already put a very early end to the Clyne>Darmian debate.

1042~~~
And the "PL proven" myth.

1043~~~
This is true, but that's the tactical instructions he has. It doesn't mean he has no offensive abilities. He played wingback in a 3-5-2 (on both sides as well) for Torino.

1044~~~
Given that this is pretty obvious, I don´t get such mastubatory praise for a Manchester United right back.

1045~~~
Amazing. He's got some bollocks to be saying that to Big Micah. He looks anything but soft.

1046~~~
Micah's big but he's not a Kompany or a Vidic. He's never really been the hardman.

1047~~~
Perhaps not, but he looks like a monster physically. I wouldn't fancy giving him any jibes.

Darmian seems a little cocky though, which I like.

1048~~~
The fact he's new to the league, is extremely good positionally, solidifies the back line, tackles brilliantly and still manages to provide a decent option further forward (that will no doubt improve the more he plays) isn't worthy of praise? Strange.

1049~~~
He's a gentle giant it seems <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1050~~~
Excellent fullback, United has struck gold with him.

1051~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He will be a fan favourite in no time.

1052~~~
Thank god we didn't buy clyne

1053~~~
Say it brother. Darmian's class. Makes you laugh at all the stuff that was said about Valencia being able to be first choice.

1054~~~
He's looking like one of the best in the league I reckon he could make the team of the season if he keeps this up. He's solid and consistent what's not to like?

1055~~~
To be fair Clyne was just as impressive against Stoke as Darmian has been for us.

Another solid performance though. We are much more secure with him there than Valencia. Wish we had kept Rafael as back-up though. He would be good to inject when we need some offensive threat. Instead Valencia doesn't really offer us anything at all.

1056~~~
His shirt number.

1057~~~
Like someone else said, he's probably going to be the best right back in the league. Superb defensively and his stamina is amazing

1058~~~
I don't think he's made a mistake of any note yet. Well on the way to becoming my favourite player.

1059~~~
He's been brilliant so far, arguably our best player. Why are people complaining he's not going forward enough? He's settling in to the team, it will take time, but id far rather a solid defender who doesn't go forward than a rubbish defender who is always forward.

I also like that Darmian knows when a situation warrants a foul. Amavi got the ball past him once or twice in dangerous positions and he made sure the man didn't get past too. Not many players seem to do that now.

1060~~~
The defending on the corner was risky. Referees will probably be watching for that now. Since he didn't get caught up on it though I guess it isn't a 'mistake'

1061~~~
That happens in every match. It was weird that Darmian was highlighted by the commentators.

1062~~~
He's amazing, I love him already.

1063~~~
Not sure an arm around the opponent's neck happens every match. It looked worse than what you usually see. Smalling does it too but doesn't grab around the face.

1064~~~
Maybe I'm just desensitised by all the porn I watch.

1065~~~
Interviewer: 'Should you have had that penalty?'

Richards: If I was a defender and if that was given against me, I would be disappointed. I have done that a couple of times myself, so yeah, you win some you lose some.

1066~~~
If that's a true quote, then it's really mature and honest of him... He could very easily have made a great deal of this and said it cost us a point blah blah... What the commentators say is also right... There needs to be consistency in this rule.. Either it's a penalty every time or it's never a penalty

1067~~~
He already seems like a experienced campianer,he looks a perfect fit to us and we are luck to get him.

1068~~~
He tackles everything doesnt he? I lost track of the number of times he just won the ball off players.

1069~~~
He reminds me of Chelseas LB, Azpi. I dont fancy many players to go past him on a one and one situation. He defends super tight, lets see how he is like with Hazard.

1070~~~
Bargain of the summer. Defensively a beast and loving that he has some tricks up his sleeve. Also when he does get forward, he isnt too bad. His crosses create some danger at times, i hope he can offer a tad more in future. But for now, does his job brilliantly with Smalling on that right defensive side.

1071~~~
Such a natural.Played a more disciplined role and played it perfectly.

1072~~~
He's brilliant. Absolutely love what he does. A defender who defends.

1073~~~
Very good start, typical italian defender who doesn't take risks. Rare to see a fullback who is better at defending rather than going forward, in shaw and darmian I think we have two though. Mata did leave him exposed quite a bit last night but he coped well and so far looks like a bargain.

1074~~~
Darmian has shown in a couple of games not all players need time adapting to different leagues, clubs and countries. Fantastic find.

1075~~~
Love everything about Darmian already. He's had a really solid start and can only get better.

1076~~~
Love to watch his defending. Now if he adds a bit more in attack...

1077~~~
Quickly becoming one of my favourite players. Amazing to think he was at Torino and hardly anyone knew much about him a few months ago. Goes to show that there are quality players out there for decent fee's. Don't need to spend crazy money all the time.

1078~~~
Fair play to Richards.

1079~~~
Looking forward to Sterling/Hazard/Bolasie vs Darmian. He has been very solid the last 2 games, promising performances.

1080~~~
Does he has dreams of Juventus? Or even worse Barca/Real?

1081~~~
Yes, who hasnt.

1082~~~
Torino fans won't be happy.

1083~~~
He is one of the very few players that fans from every team of the league he plays in rates him highly and praises him a lot. All the Serie A fans that I can find are convinced that he is going to be a great addition to our team.

Don't worry about Juventus. Just read the first few pages of this thread and you will understand why.

1084~~~
I think he will go back to Milan when he's in his mid-thirties.

1085~~~
Co incidentally dani alves had a horror game last night

1086~~~
And play for another 5 years?

1087~~~
have to love caf, after a very average game MOTM, I think he was good but Shaw was better as fullback yday

1088~~~
Weren't you the one advocating the signing of clyne and was absolutely gutted when it turned out we were going to choose Darmian?

Heh.

1089~~~
nah

1090~~~
He is a huge Rafael fan, gutted that he is gone obviously. Seems also a massive Shaw fanboy. Obviously Darmian cant keep up with both of them

1091~~~
Quick search of your contribution to the closed Darmian transfer thread:

Yah.

1092~~~
The professor strikes. Again.

1093~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1094~~~
solid.

Feck juventus.

1095~~~
Him vs Montero of Swansea will be an interesting battle. See if Montero will be the Lennon vs Evra.

1096~~~
Seems a real good guy as well, shaking Richards hand during the match last night was a nice touch. He is definitely part of the reason why are defence is so tight this season, imagine having DDG in goal as well. The midfield we have I believe we are only 2 signings away from being challengers this season, Pedro and a striker.

Over to the Rooney thread for a not so nice review.

1097~~~
Its sad when some posters would much rather hate on a player that is doing well because he replaced their favourite player..Mad Winger crazy..

1098~~~
Fixed

1099~~~
so maybe you could quote where I wrote that Clyne is more than. Meh

1100~~~
Played well but Shaw was Motm for me yesterday.  

We have an absolute diamond there and with Darmian as well our fullbacks should be sorted for years to come.  

Massive improvement to our defensive abilities.

1101~~~
I think he'll handle Montero. Montero is rapid but not a great dribbler at all.

1102~~~
What a signing he has been. Him and Schneiderlin stand out so far. So happy we got these two. He breaks up almost every dribble the winger tries to make against him so far. He somehow gets his foot in there.

1103~~~
And to think LVG said in pre-season that he is backup to Valencia <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1104~~~
Clearly that's not what he meant though

1105~~~
I've just rewatched the match and Darmian's pass to Januzaj in the lead up to the goal was fantastic. Beautiful technique, vision and forcing of the initiative. Probably the third best pass of the match after Mata's two.

I think I'm falling in love with him.

1106~~~
He's an AC Milan fan, which is only fair since he's their youth. Can't see him going back there though.

1107~~~
I found that amusing as well, however I can understand LVG's line of thought. Every player should be made to feel that he has to win his first team place

1108~~~
Any particular reason?

1109~~~
How can I re summarise these in few points

a- Financially AC Milan are much worse off then we are. The days when they could pick and choose the finest players in the world to play for their team are long over. They can't afford our fees, they can't afford our salaries etc. Its like leaving United to join Spurs (and yes Im flattering AC Milan here cause financially wise Milan are nowhere near to Spurs)

b- At top managerial level they are a mess. Silvio Berlusconi shifts between politics, courts and the club and is pretty intrusive in his own way (ie he even lectures managers on how they should play football in front of the press). His daughter Barbara inherited her father's intrusiveness and love for the opposite sex but not his charisma and Galliani was never a great director in the first place. Now a new investor had came in the fold (ie Mr Bee) who will surely want a say. Imagine having Gill, Woodward, Edwards and another person fighting with one another on whom United have to buy, what strategy it should take etc.

c- Darmian will soon learn a lesson Di Canio, Ravanelli and Vialli learnt before him ie that there's a better life-work balance for footballers in Britain than in Italy. In Italy football is everything and when results start getting bad the players lives can easily turn sour (ritiri etc). In Britain players are more protected especially at a club like ours

d- Ironically Darmian will add more years to his career in Britain (as a fullback) than in Italy were they usually play with the wingback role. As Gaz said going up and down the flank as a wingback is very tough and requires plenty of stamina and leg work

e- Darmian was brought up looking up at the likes of one club legends such as Baresi and Maldini who were cheered and loved by the fans. He can achieve that at United if he can stick to the place. After all we love our fullbacks just as AC Milan fans do. 

I am not saying that we're completely out of the woods. If Real or Barca come knocking at the door than he will certainly think about it just like all the rest of our players. Also if we leave him with just 1 year contract left than expect the Italian clubs (expecially Juve and Milan who are experts in the matter) to grew bold and try to sign him up. However I am optimistic about the guy remaining here. Real-Barca doesn't like spending crazy money on defenders and the Italian clubs are nowhere near us in terms of finances

1110~~~
Jesus. He's played two games for us and we're already worried about him leaving for Madrid. We've been scarred deep.

1111~~~
He's quickly becoming a fans favourite, I actually feel bad because I gave him a 6 for his performance vs Villa and now feel like I really underscored him!

I enjoyed his duals with Richards on Villa corners.

1112~~~
If that's true then that's brilliant! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's brilliant there is just something Herrera-like about him and his personality! I think he's a great signing and it's like he's been here for ages! Keep it up lad!

1113~~~
Mr Consistent,  been brilliant thus far.

1114~~~
My favourite United player.

1115~~~
Really good going forward tonight as well as defensively, couple of excellent runs. His crosses didn't work out, but with Rooney so deep there wasn't really anyone to aim at.

1116~~~
Still mint. It's such a cliche but he is a typical Italian defender. Has a much better understanding of defense than the headless chicken fullbacks who populate most of the top leagues.

1117~~~
Think he could do more attacking wise tbh.

Been solid though.

1118~~~
I agree but I'm sure that will come

1119~~~
I really like him, very solid player.

1120~~~
So far he just look like you can count on him,which is great imo.

1121~~~
He was solid defensively, but his crossing was damn terrible today. If Valencia's end ball was as bad today as his, I am very sure we would have seen his performance thread page filled with many pages of fans moaning about how terrible it was today...

1122~~~
Fast becoming one of my favourite players and he's only played three games for us. You can see his class though, a top top player.

1123~~~
Solid player. Proper full back who can defend and attack.

For the record, I think Van Gaal has instructed him not to attack in this period of time. Maybe he wants him to get used to the team and the league before going gung ho up and down the pitch.

1124~~~
Thought he was brilliant. Quietly my favorite signing of the summer so far.

1125~~~
Got in behind a few times in the second half which was good to see. Someone should have gotten to that ball when he pulled it back to around the penalty spot. The ball seemed to be laid on a plate for an eternity waiting for someone to bury it.

1126~~~
Yeah, I think only one at a time out of him and Shaw are meant to be going forward as a holding mid usually drops back and blind out wide (well, when it was Shaw going forward I noticed this, I imagine Smalling went wide when Darmian went forward but don't know).

1127~~~
He's just a really solid right back. Such a good signing from us.

1128~~~
Finally a proper right back! Mr consistent

1129~~~
Thought he was top notch again.

Really liked it when he fizzed a few passes into the box early too.

Didn't always come off but he tries to mix up his delivery a bit.

1130~~~
Consistent. The most important thing for a fullback and he looks it. Solid performance again.

1131~~~
He's brilliant. Forza Darmian!

1132~~~
We're clearly going to draw Juve in the CL and he will destroy them.

1133~~~
Already becoming Mr. Reliable.

1134~~~
Two foul throw-ins yesterday. Learning fast he is young padawan.

1135~~~
Forza Darmian! That should be his chant right there. Bloody brilliant and he showed some of his attacking prowess last night. I think with a proper winger in front of him we'll see him improve in attack. Still hes a RB who can actually defend which is fecking great in itself.

1136~~~
Because Valencia is so bad defensively that we expect him to at least be doing something useful offensively, seeing that he used to be a winger. The problem is he doesn't.

Great game from Darmian again. Glad to see that he is quickly establishing himself as one of our starting XI as well as becoming a fan-favourite.

1137~~~
Very consistent player, I like it.

1138~~~
Third consecutive 7/10 performance. And he's the kind who will keep giving that level of consistency.

1139~~~
I get your point but I'd say his Spurs match was at least an 8/10 <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1140~~~
Yup, my underlying point was about consistency. I voted 8/10 for the Spurs performance as well!

1141~~~
Third consecutive 8/10 for me. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1142~~~
He is so 7/10 to 8/10 type of player for me too. Looks so reliable that even reminds me of Irwin

1143~~~
I'm a massive fan of the way he opens his body up to play an accurate and quick first time ball forward.

1144~~~
It doesn't matter. I have witnessed days when Valencia has had good days defensively and his crossing was bad and people would still do the same thing. Nevertheless Darmian was solid today. I've seen him do much better going forward and crossing wise and I thought he let down a bit in that aspect.

1145~~~
25 years old, Italian international right-back, defensively very solid and already first XI material, for 13m pounds. Now that's what I call value in the market.

1146~~~
Feckin brilliant, signing of the summer.

Now stay fit you loveable bastard.

1147~~~
New Manchester United right-back Matteo Darmian says the Premier League is more physical but less tactical than Serie A.

Darmian has impressed in his first three appearances for United following his summer transfer from Torino, but the 25-year-old, who says it was an easy decision to join the club, has already noticed some differences between English and Italian football.

<b>"When they called, I didn't have to think for a second," he told Tuttosport. "It's impossible to turn down a club as important as this. I'm delighted to have decided to make this move abroad." 

"The rhythm's a lot higher in games here. You get shoved around a lot more and physical contact gets punished far less than in Italy, with the game interrupted far less. 

"It's less tactical here too. Each team just play their own game, and play to win." 

Asked about living in Manchester, Darmian added: "I'm still living in a hotel right now, but I'm looking for my own place. 

"I'm improving my English too bit by bit. Certainly it's been positive, with both my debuts [in the Premier League and Champions League]. It was a great emotion each time."</b>

1148~~~
Sounds like he's enjoying the extra physicality, and again he's a player who actually wants to be here. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1149~~~
Yeah. It's very refreshing to hear a new player admitting that. He's only 25 y.o. and he's already this good. Is he the first Italian that could remotely be a success at United? There was Rossi who couldn't make the step up to the first team (such a shame, though).

1150~~~
Still living in a hotel? Couldn't United fix him an apartment or house somewhere?

1151~~~
Yep, he really owns that RB position, him and Shaw on the other side and we finally have two proper fullbacks!

1152~~~
Tearing up just at the thought that we finally have a proper right back after G. Neville. That right side of the pitch does not wide open when the opposition are attacking down that flank, that too without much help from Mata.

1153~~~
Yeh we don't look vulnerable down that right side anymore. With Darmian and Shaw as fullbacks it's gunna be pretty hard for opposition teams to have much joy down the wings, two of the best 1 vs 1 fullbacks there are. Which leaves them having to attack centrally where we'll be shielded by Schneiderlin and one of Carrick/BFS. With Smalling between them all its not hard to see why we haven't conceded in the league yet.

1154~~~
He's a proper Italian bastard, I love him. Christ I've never fawned over a set of summer signings like this before. Love them all. 

Except Romero, something about his face puts me on edge.

1155~~~
He hasn't found a place? Its not hard to find a flat or something near carrington.

1156~~~
Decent but wasteful when Mata played him into positions.

1157~~~
Definitely no Dani Alves in offense (not yet anyway) but seriously, I am very impressed by his defensive skills.

1158~~~
Yeah, seemed to fall asleep on a couple of occasions where great balls were played to him. Thought he was good apart from those moments, and I imagine that he'll improve on that fairly rapidly.

1159~~~
I thought he looked average today. His crossing was bad, and unlike against Club Brugge, he wasn't that great defensively and could have gotten two yellows.

1160~~~
Wasted most of his attacking opportunities, but I prefer a full back who is solid in defence. We're definitely missing the link up we had with Herrera, Mata and Valencia on the right hand side though.

1161~~~
It was his lack of awareness for some of Mata's clever balls that got him the hook I think, not that Valencia was any better.

1162~~~
Good game again today.

Really needs to work on his crossing though. He was in plenty of great positions but made a hash of them. Still good however.

1163~~~
Solid defensively. Lacked a bit going forward though. Regardless, I'd clearly still prefer him to Valencia. Needs to just keep working on it.

1164~~~
Really keen on him so far. Barely puts a foot wrong defensively, sharp enough to pressure and win the ball back quickly when the opportunity is there. Has the pace to be dangerous going forward, just needs to be a bit more adventurous.

1165~~~
Early yellow got me a bit edgy but he's a such a damn good player.

1166~~~
Another good display. 

The only thing that needs improving, is his final ball. He gets in good positions, but his crosses are sometimes too short, inaccurate or get blocked by a defender. Apart from that, an excellent start for the young Italian.

1167~~~
I was delighted that we signed Matteo Darmian. I haven't posted on here in a while, but I was really pleased about us signing him after everything I had seen from him. I have always followed Italian football and Darmian had really proven himself in both Serie A and Serie B. One of the traits that I always really liked about him, is that he is a front-foot defender. He was always someone who would anticipate rather than react, and always committed in the challenge as well as when going forward.

He has shown this for us so far too, great levels of stamina going back and forward and it's important to remember that he is a truly responsible player. He covers for the CBs really well, and he has leadership skills which will improve as he becomes more comfortable with the language (he was given the captaincy at times for Torino). Always seemed like a great professional too, purely dedicated to his football and being let go by Milan at a young age seemed to have strengthened his resolve to be a top player.

No-one can doubt his pedigree in my opinion, even when we signed him I was really surprised by people claiming to have never seen him play, or never heard of him or even that we should be aiming higher. He won Italian international team player of the year for 2014, and he was outstanding in the league for Torino too. I actually watched his debut for Italy vs Ireland at Craven Cottage last June (0-0, not a great game) but he played well that night and was great at the World Cup too. Hoping to see him really make that right back position his own for us, hopefully for many years to come.

1168~~~
Great defensively though he was a bit silly at the start with those couple of fouls one after the other getting him an early yellow. Still needs tow ork on his crossing though - he had plenty chances to play accurate balls and was allowing himself to be blocked or tackled as he seemed to want an extra half second he didn't have. Will continue to improve as he settles. A great addition so far.

1169~~~
I thought it would take him a while to settle, but he’s taken to the Premiership like a duck to water. Very impressed so far.

1170~~~
He was brilliant, as usual. Fast becoming my favorite United player. Awesome energy and great defensive concentration.

1171~~~
Surprised to see so much praise after Saturday's game. Got into so many dangerous positions thanks to Mata but was too slow on almost every occasion. Against the smaller sides we need our fullbacks to provide more of a threat.

Still very happy with him so far but I'd say it was his worst performance (shows how well he has started), was also quite rash in the first half and picked up a deserved booking.

1172~~~
Really like him. I'd like to see Valencia in front of him to see what sort of partnership they could form.

1173~~~
Defensively he has been pretty much perfect so he certainly deserves praise even if at times going forward he is lacking

1174~~~
Absolutely agree, I love the fact we have 2 fullbacks who are great defenders. Could do with both contributing more going forward though, especially in games like Saturday's.

1175~~~
Impeccable 1 v 1 and starting to get an understanding with Mata and timing his overlaps.

1176~~~
Let the ball bounce in the first half when he shouldn't have which caused a bit of panic. 

But that's super picky and more a testament to his high standards. Him and Shaw as a fullback pair are delightful.

1177~~~
I'm being picky here, but he does have a weakness after all. Long balls/crosses from the left side often put him in trouble.

1178~~~
Brilliant attitude from him before the game. Really likable player, so glad we signed him.

“For us, 0-0 would be a good result but we always try to win and, when we go to Brugge, it will be no different,”

1179~~~
He was quiet in the sense that he did not do much going forward, but you simply don't notice him on the pitch because he does everything so well in defence. One or two shaky moments early on, nothing more. I know it was only Brugge, but he had both of their left-sided players in his pocket the whole game, without much help from Mata. 

If he knew how to cross a ball, he would remind me a little of Gary Neville. He is as good as it gets when 1 on 1 with a winger. Like Shaw, one is always confident he will come out on top.

1180~~~

1181~~~

1182~~~
Huge test for him today.

1183~~~
He'll pass it with flying colours, no doubt about it! Ferguson would have loved this lad.

1184~~~
Montero vs Darmian. Lets wait and see. If he can handle the pace and trickery of Montero, he can handle anyone in the league.

1185~~~
Never worried with him defensively thought he played ok today, but he really needs to offer more going forward.

Hard to stretch teams with him and Mata on the right.

1186~~~
Played ok today. Not as good as in previous games but was definitely one of our better players. It doesn't help that Mata just refuses to pass to him when he goes forward. Just tells you all you need to know about our overall team performance today.

1187~~~
Agreed, when watching him for Italy he use to fly forward at all times, I hope LVG hasn't put the hand break on him he has to bomb forward when Mata picks the ball up..

1188~~~
Him and Mata have no chemistry.

1189~~~
Defended well again but he has no one to link up with on his flank far too often.

1190~~~
An absolute non entity going forward, passed back more than forward, zero understanding with neither Mata nor Young, and though decent defensively, chinks being to show. The cross, the hammer and the nails would be out for a Valencia performance of this nature.

I miss Rafa.

1191~~~
Very good defending from him today, as usual, but he has zero connection with Mata. That's not really his fault (him not being able to cross a ball is a separate issue), but I do think we should experiment with who plays ahead of him. Mata has been excellent this season and is the last player who deserves to be dropped based on performances, but even on a day when Memphis had nothing coming off for him, our left side was still more dangerous (simply because Shaw and Memphis work so well together). 

He was our best player today after Shaw and Smalling today - one or two times he was caught out of position, but he handled all of his 1 on 1s very well. Never lets a winger beat him. It's incredible how quickly he has settled here - i've said it before and it may be premature, but he really reminds me of Gary Neville with the way he defends.

1192~~~
Mata isn't really a winger, or at least he doesn't have that skill set.

1193~~~
Was his worst game I thought.

1194~~~
Which is saying something as he was still one of our better players. He is just totally exposed down the right flank as he and Mata don't play well together.

1195~~~
The few times they're close to each and Darmian makes an overlapping run, he doesn't receive the ball.

1196~~~
It isn't his fault Mata doesn't pass to him, he does go forward but usually doesn't receive a pass.

1197~~~
Darmian, Shaw and Smalling are our best players every game. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1198~~~
Mata turns inside and ignores the wing right?

Mata belongs on the left or behind the striker but not on the right wing. This infuriates me from Van Gaal.

1199~~~
Was superb for Italy tonight

1200~~~
Well in Matteo.

1201~~~
#4 is a bit dodgy for a RB

1202~~~
Brilliant for us so far defensively. You can see attacking isn't his strength though but I have no problem with that as long as he keeps defending as well as he as so far.

1203~~~
Still can't believe we have a solid RB.

1204~~~
Fantastic to see him continuing with his 6-8 performances. Excellent the way he slotted into the team.

1205~~~
Did he play vs Malta?

1206~~~
Yup.

1207~~~
Yup, played very well apparently. Was WhoScored's Man Of The Match if that means anything.

1208~~~

1211~~~
Best signing so far for me, no doubt. What an excellent acquisition, reminds me of Herrera a bit off the field. Just happy to have him, thought we would never go for him.

1212~~~
Wonder how long we've got before the "he doesn't contribute anything to the attack" posts cropping up <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Love him already, such a solid performer. Can only remember one time an attacker got past him - can't remember who it was now - but he recovered well enough to put the ball out for a corner.

1213~~~
He's my new favorite player.

1214~~~

sounds weird, hopefully a loss in translation

1215~~~
Have you not read the last few pages? Some people are already saying that, that we're not strong enough going forward on the right. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>


I'm guessing he means <i>signing</i> for united is not the apex, i.e. he wants to win loads of trophies too.

1216~~~
Defensively he is so fecking solid.

1217~~~
I'm a big fan of Darmian already and defending is much more important than attacking for a fullback, IMO, but I don't think criticisms about his attacking game are unfair. He was a lot more impressive going forward for Italy vs. England from what I remember and given he played as a wingback last season I suspect there's a lot more he can offer in that regard. 

As with Shaw last season it's natural to go back to basics and focus on making sure you're solid at the back first and foremost - at least for natural defenders like these two - and then once settled in and full of confidence they can start to be more expressive and daring going forward. That's exactly what we've seen with Shaw this season and I expect much of the same from Damian.

1218~~~
Guess I missed that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ah the Caf.

1219~~~
It just means he isn't resting on his laurels.
Kinda like saying "this is only the beginning".

1220~~~
Admittedly I didn't know much about Darmian but looking back on it <b>now </b>the meltdown by some when we opted to go for him over Clyne was glorious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1221~~~
To be fair to Clyne, he has had a similar effect at Liverpool - huge upgrade at RB and been one of their better perfomers. I prefer Darmian but the want for Clyne was definitely justified because he is a good player.

1222~~~
he looks on similar level to Clyne but he's ours and good to have one Italian in the team too. I also hope he will get better going forward as I think we need creativity everywhere on the pitch and in this system we struggle a bit to create chances sometimes. Being solid defensively these days shouldn't be considered as sufficient for a top team who wants to fight for champions league trophy every year and especially for which the wing play was considered essential for a long time, it will be long after Van Gaal too..

But he's still young and doesn't look injury prone which is a bit of relieve and a nice change, for this reason I feel he has a good chance to improve himself too, if him and Juander make a good understanding after sometime, it will be joy to watch

1223~~~
Lets just prepare for when Real Madrid come

1224~~~
More like a purposeful distortion to get c licks. Clicks.

1225~~~
I'm not sure I'd agree with that. Unless you're an Alves AND you have a Messi in front of you, I think at the top level (against Champions League elite), it'd be a 'better' option to have a very good defensive full back, who knows how and when to come in and play a narrow line/cover his centre back rather than have an attacking full back with 'decent' defensive ability.

Why do I say that? Because realistically speaking I don't think we're ever gonna reach the pressing/possession game of teams like Barca, Dortmund, Bayern or even PSG for the near future. I.e I see us defending more than attacking against the top teams. Obviously Darmian's attacking ability will need to be there against teams below that before we even get to that stage but I think we'll do alright with him and whoever is in front of him (hopefully not Mata..unless it's compensated by an all firing cyclinder Aguero-like striker and a flying winger/playmaker Ribbery type i.e it's not happening soon).

1226~~~
He's performing much better than Clyne get real, Liverpool haven't looked defensively solid and if it wasn't got some horrible referee decisions they'd have 3/4 points less.

As for his contributions going forward he played as a wingback in the past and was excellent going forward so no reason why he can't do it here. Full backs rely on the attackers to create space and our front 4-6 just aren't doing it.

1227~~~
Odd quote from him.

1228~~~
I get the feeling he means that being good enough to join United is not his limit. That he can improve more. I'd be surprised if he means he sees us as a stepping stone although obviously that comment will be skewed as such.

1229~~~
Clyne is decent but I think our Italian is quite an upgrade imo

1230~~~
What he meant is that he isn't going to stop working hard just because he signed for United, which a lot of people will see as the ultimate goal. I don't think he means that he is going to work hard to go to another club.

<span style="color: #ffffff">I think maybe he means he fell out with van gaal and now wants to go away</span>

1231~~~
This is exactly what he means. Not enough to get to play for United, have to make an impression here. I have faith in him, he's not fussy, just gets on with it. You feel if he sees he needs to improve on something, he will just do it without any fuss or ego. Have a feeling he's one of LVG's favourites i.e. he's not high maintenance like most football players nowadays.

1232~~~
oh yeah, sure. They're defensive record is pretty much the same as ours and they had certainly tougher opening fixtures than us and played Milner as defensive mid, while we have double pivot and Smalling. Clyne is on the same level/potential as Darmian like it or not but yeah there will always be fans biased towards team liek liverpool, they are our biggest historical rival after all and once one of our players has a decent run of games for someone he's world beater. Keep the distance and judge them again. And I'm not even Clyne's fan.

I can agree with the part that Mata's contribution to the wingplay attacking moves is doubtful as he tends to come deep and certainly centrally than Depay but we have also seen that someone as dumb as Valencia (meaning football brain ) could make a beautiful triangle with Mata and Herrera.. So we will see if this can work with Darmian too or maybe Pereira/Martial..

1233~~~
They should have conceded a goal vs Bournemouth which the FA later stated should have been allowed, Benteke's goal shortly afterwards should have been ruled offside. Vs Arsenal Ramsey had a perfectly legitimate goal ruled offside as well which would put their goals conceded at 5 and drastically changed the context of both those games. Why does Milner's position matter? They've had Lucas and Can available but choose to use him there, that's up to them.

1234~~~
The reason he cant get forward is because mata plays with no pace.  If thr latter loses the ball; darmian is normally completely isolated as the only defensive pressure on the right hand side.

Mean while on the left; depay can atleast add pressure to guide the attacker as closest to shaw as possible.

1235~~~
It's not just because he's a Liverpool player. I've always thought he was overhyped, and when we were rumoured to be in for him I was really disappointed. Darmian, on the other hand, really does look the real deal to me.

1236~~~
Nonsense. Valencia was/is always able to go forward with Mata on the wing and had a good understanding with him. I can´t believe such massive praise for a Man United fullback with zero offensive output. Obviously he´s solid defensively, but solid defensive fullbacks with good positioning are a dime a dozen. When Darmian is anywhere near Luke Shaw ability I will understand the praise. As of now, our attack on the right side is as dire as I´ve ever seen it.

1237~~~
That's nonsense. You may criticize his offensive capabilities, but he does provide a couple of runs every game and does give us some width going forward. He is also better than Valencia at beating his man.

 He is conservative in his playing style yes, but you will also see more chances being created down Luke Shaw's corner than Darmian's - as the game against Swansea attested to.

1238~~~
The difference is that Valencia is an absolute physical beast and speed demon; he's able to maraud up and down that line himself because he has the energy to do so and because it's his natural game. Obviously you've lost a bit of defensive shape with his tendency. 

As for the bit I've highlighted there I think you've underestimated the level of Darmian's positioning and defending. He's not been up against the very best but I don't think he's going to be shown up by the likes of Sterling, Hazard, De Bruyne etc. Brave prediction but I think his concentration is an elite level above Clyne on the defensive end (and by default, another level above 90% of the full backs in the league). We don't know whether that's  be due to his natural game and footballing upbringing or the 'sacrifice' of his offensive game but I think it's better for us that way. I quote you my post above.

Before that though, I absolutely agree that he can improve massively on the offensive end (and Mata certainly isn't helping).

1239~~~
Must admit, after Rafael and Valencia I'm happy to have a right back who does his job first and hopefully allows players further forward to do what they are best at knowing they don't have a complete weapon playing behind them at right back.

1240~~~
Yes, with all those goals we´re scoring and chances from the right side, I´m ecstatic.

1241~~~
I'm ecstatic about the lack of chances the opposition is able to create on our right side. At Swansey, both goals came from the left side and Luke Shaw left huge gaps there, something Darmian just doesn't do. That's the trade-off for having an attacking minded fullback such as Rafael/Valencia/Shaw. Hopefully Shaw can improve his defensive positioning and Darmian can improve his attacking capabilities.

Last game the type of fullback you are talking about cost us a defeat.

1242~~~
The blame lands more so on blind/romero tbh but shaw was leaving space in behind him, sometimes he was quick enough to get back. Sometimes.

1243~~~
You cant conpare shaw to darmian.  Shaw's biggest problem is that sometimes he is too attacking and can leave the defence weak footed.  On the opposite,  darmian could be more attacking minded but then again mata doesnt support him in that mattwr as instead of playing like a forward; what we have is a right sided player moving in to a central attacking midfield spot. 

Like it or not that means the complete width is only dealt with darmian alone.  I'd even go with the fact that it seems like he doesn't attack because of tge shear space left over on that side.  

If darmian did what shaw would do; we would be completely outnumbered all over.

1244~~~
Full backs that defend to an excellent level are certainly not a "dime a dozen." We're lucky in that we've got two.

Valencia is rotten going forward, we've seen more than enough to know that.

Darmian, meanwhile, has played a few games and it's likely he'll grow into the attacking side of the game. Full backs need to get it right at the back before they push forward with abandon.

It's patently obvious that Darmian is a good attacking outlet. He's demonstrated this elsewhere and it's clear he has all of the qualities needed to demonstrate that here at United.

That you're baffled by Darmian's popularity is baffling in itself. The right back position is filled with a quality player and people are duly delighted with that.

1245~~~
Luke Shaw set up our goal, something we are sorely lacking . . . and does anyone know where Darmian was on Swansea´s first goal? Nowhere to be seen. Maybe he should´ve been somewhere even remotely near to Ayew. Even Mata was there. Anyone remember in the last minute Darmian was embarrassingly beaten and saved by Smalling on the touchline?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/ovba" width="560"></iframe>

1246~~~
Blind was covering shaw.  The whole idea behind playing 3 at the back last season was for us to be able to shape up to a 3 at the back in a time where one of our players get caught on the ball. 

Blind moved to the left most side; smalling as the central player with darmian as the right sided defender.  In this case it didnt work but i dont see why anyone other than shaw should be blamed for that goal.

1247~~~
Swansea switched to a diamond with Ayew playing as the #10. Why on earth should Darmian be there? That's the job for Basti/Carrick.

1248~~~
Absolutely not. Look at the goals again, you will see that on both occasions that Luke Shaw was tracking back behind the ball when he clearly shouldn't have during a 1-0 lead. Meanwhile Blind had to cover that area of the pitch; leaving it wide open behind goal for the opposition to cross the ball into the penalty area where both our center backs <i>should</i> be. Darmian almost never gets behind the ball, he is extremely cautious when is comes to leaving his area of the pitch wide open, because there is no way we can risk Smalling having to cover the right flank.

1249~~~
Spot on.

1250~~~
Look at how open we are and how Shaw finds himself behind the ball, that video argues against your cause. Meanwhile, Darmian did cover his man at the far post, if you look at the video again.

1251~~~
Darmian is in the middle of the pitch, marking no one, except maybe Smalling

1252~~~
That's Schneiderlin, Darmian is running back on the right hand side as we were caught on the break.

1253~~~
Sorry I thought that was Darmian. My bad.

If you look at the play from the beginning in the extended highlights, Darmian had run through the middle of the pitch with the ball, passed Rooney, who just gave it away to the opposition. Not Darmian's fault there, but he should have stayed seeing as we were 1-0 up. It is hard to say he should play more attacking football when his team mates just constantly give away the ball to the opposition. Also, Shaw was too high up, he should know that if Darmian goes up the pitch he has to stay further down.

1254~~~
Now watch this and take off your Darmian-wank glasses. He´s marking Gomis all the way and get badly beaten, plain and simple. We lose the match! Very poor defending

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/vygw" width="560"></iframe>

1255~~~
Would not say badly beaten, he almost gets there and he's made the angle quite tight. If Romero actually comes for it like he started to, and actually saved it. We would not be talking about it. Quite frankly Gomis should not of scored from the angle. Smalling is pretty poor there as well.

1256~~~
That was shit defending by Darmian, no two ways about it. Stop making excuses! It cost us fecking match. At least Shaw set up a goal for us. Can you imagine the reaction had that been Valencia defending???!!!

1257~~~
In that situation, you have to trust your keeper to save it. Romero fecked up there (and I'm not one of those who thinks he has no chance of being good enough for us). Darmian prevented Gomis from shooting across to the far post, or squaring to their player further over, which is pretty much exactly what you'd want him to do there. Gomis had very little to aim at, and Romero had all the time in the world to come out towards him and make a block.

1258~~~
Your agenda is horrific, how on earth is that Darmian's fault again? That's piss, uber pisspoor goalkeeping.

1259~~~
I'm sorry but some of the defence of Darmian's defending there <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1260~~~
It is partly Darmian's mistake too. Romero should have saved it, but Darmian has to do better there, he is too late.

1261~~~
As if Valencia was creating chances galore from the right.

1262~~~
Agreed Romero could´ve done better on that, but pause that gif right at the 6:08 mark. Darmian is marking Gomis quite well, and then boom, Gomis beats him badly and scores the winner. End of. Romero doing poorly does´t take away the fact that Darmian was beaten for the winner.

It´s no agenda. I like Darmian and think he should be starting, but the over-the-top wankfest for him is not warranted.

Remember when everyone thought it was so cool and wow that darmian wagging his finger in Micah Richard´s face . . . well, what everyone seems to ignore is the essential part, Richards ends up beating Darmian for the header that was a decent chance. Go back and look at it

1263~~~
I think Valencia at least crossed the ball decently more (and nearly scored the winner) in his cameo vs Villa than Darmian all together in his last couple of matches. In that destruction of a poor defending Brugge, Darmian was basically non existent offensively.

There was a reason LVG brought on Valencia when we were desperate for a goal. Very rare to sub on a fullback when you need that winning goal.

1264~~~
Not really. The goal was from the left side, how can you blame Darmian? It was a good ball and a good run, but it was a very tight angle. Sometimes you need your goalkeeper to save it. It was normal defending, but awful goalkeeping. That's it. if anything, the issue was not putting any pressure on Ayew who had all day to pick the pass.

1265~~~
Valencia is marginally better going forwards. He'd be much better if he wasn't so shit at crossing because he gets into great positions due to his pace even though his ability to beat a man has gone. Darmian is much better defensively though and with Shaw bombing down the other side, no real surprise to see van Gaal pick the superior defender even if he's weaker going forwards.

1266~~~
Moments before, Darmian had Gomis marked well, and then got beaten.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6351601.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Swansea-vs-Manchester-United.jpg" src="http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6351601.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Swansea-vs-Manchester-United.jpg"/>

1267~~~
I´m not trying to big up Valencia, and I prefer Darmian. But we need to score more goals and get more Rafa-Valencia offence from the right side. Darmian is giving us nearly nothing thus far, especially from what we´ve become used to from manchester United fullbacks. Let´s hope he steps it or that LVG changes some tactics around.

1268~~~
He definitely could have done more there, he wasn't alert for Ayew's pass at all. No two ways about it. Yes, Romero should have saved it but he shouldn't have even had anything to save if Darmian had covered that run.

That's not to say he's not been great for us but by the standards he's been setting you'd expect him to cover that without a sweat.

1269~~~
As I said, hopefully. Hopefully it will come as team gels.

1270~~~
Yes there was a reason and it is called a "mistake". We needed someone who could create chances. Valencia has been awful offensively for the better of two years and yet people yearn for him.

1271~~~
He also very nearly scored the winner. Huge mistake to bring him on.

1272~~~
Slammed a close range shot straight at the defender right in front of him = nearly scored the winner. Sure.

1273~~~
I remember clearly also that Valencia got skinned twice on the right in 5 minutes when Darmian hadn't so much as let a fly through for the first 80-something minutes. 

That's too high a cost to pay for some ankle hitting crosses imo.

1274~~~
Yeah, the goal keeper had to dive full length to save that shot. Oh wait.. 

Next you will say he nearly put in a great cross although it "unfortunately" hit the defender's shin and went for a corner. Laughable.

1275~~~
Yes, he does need to improve on his offensive game. Especially if we are playing with 2 deep CMs, the FB can bomb forward even if Mata is infield which he does tbf to him but needs to do more often.

1276~~~
That's what I felt. Didn't come out or translate too well.

1277~~~
Sorry, I meant the Newcastle match, not Villa. That five minutes vs Villa were poor indeed.

But he was alright against Newcastle, though nothing spectacular. In 15 minutes he had three decent crosses and nearly scored the winner. That´s probably more than Darmian´s output all year offensively.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xoAhztv3PMc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1278~~~
I thought it made a lot of sense to bring on Valencia because Newcastle were tiring, there was loads of space on the right that Darmian wasn't taking advantage of and Valencia is undoubtedly a more potent threat at the moment and played an important role in stretching teams last season. He didn't play very well though as the video shows. Good idea that didn't quite come off this time. I expect to see it quite a few times this season when we're piling on the pressure.

1279~~~
That's what lots of people wilfully ignore in cases like these. For any goal there's usually a number of mistakes which are required for it to happen. Darmian's is one, no denying it.

1280~~~
It's a classic case of overseeing the mistake of some one you like and expecting mistake to happen from someone you are already skeptic about. Some of the micro analysis of Valencia's performance truly surprised me last season as how deep people could go to justify their agenda. There is a theory in psychology where it is claimed people make decisions before .. ala Valencia is horrible at RB, Romero is at fault for every goal we concede, Darmian is beautiful defender with no mistake ... and then form reasons for these decisions based on what they expected to see ..like Valencia was at fault for Chelsea's goal at Stamford bridge last season, Romero was at fault for double deflected goal against Brugge etc.

1281~~~
Looking back at that video of the goal it's Smalling/Romeros fault. Romero should be claiming that, but Smalling is too flat footed there.

1282~~~
Yep, that's a pretty good summary of it.

I notice it a lot with Schweinsteiger. People keep babbling about how great he is, how more comfortable we look etc, but I'm just left constantly underwhelmed when he comes on. I think people mostly judge him by his name, not his contribution on his pitch. I for one sure hope we gets <b>a lot </b>better than what he is now.

1283~~~
Yeah, me too. But he's BFS so everything is allright and the glorious pass to Herrera against Brugge. But I think he'll raise his level once he sheds the few summer pounds of his.

1284~~~
Had a very good game for Italy tonight against Bulgaria, such a reliable type of player.

1285~~~
That was far more Smalling's fault than it was Darmian's. He let him get behind him and lost where he was. It was the same situation in the previous clip.

1286~~~
I wouldn't blame Darmian for that. No more than I would Smalling or Romero. Really Romero should be doing better there, it's a tight angle and Gomis gets it in way too easily. 

With the first clip posted, I have no idea how that's meant to be Darmian at fault. The cross comes in from the left which isn't his side, and there are two players in the box who don't deal with the cross. It'd be nice if Darmian was magically in the box to head the ball clear, but that's not really where he's meant to be most of the time, is it? Especially when the goal comes from a quick counter. Full backs are allowed to get forward because when they do, other players will fill in the gaps and be ready to get back and defend if possession is turned over. We can't expect him to be in two places at once.

1287~~~
To be fair, Valencia has not really offered us anything offensively for a whilst, not since his injury. No longer do we see him use raw pace and strength to beat a man, in one on one situations he was not the most skillful but his cut backs or pace used to have him win most situations, and he was not afraid to put a cross in. Now he usually passes, more often than not backwards, instead of whipping in a cross or taking a man on. He can get quite deep into the attacking half on that right wing and then he just slows everything down. 

As for Damian, his crossing can do with some work, but he has an attacking side to his game. Didn't he end up with 5 goals and a few assists last season as his previous club? He's good at defending very high up the pitch, he's won the ball quite a few times near the opponents areas to set off attacks. Unfortunately at the moment, Shaw and Damian are not Evra and Rafa, but both are young and will learn.

1288~~~
The Gomis goal to me was more of communication failure than any one defender/goalie's fault. Smalling waited on Romero to catch it who was waiting for Smalling to clear it and Darmian stuck in the middle on both players' hesitation.

1289~~~
Or Valencia's in last few years.

1290~~~
Coming into the EPL from Serie A and being as consistent as he has in the handful of games he's played in is fantastic. Once he settles fully into his new environment he will go from strength to strength. Very happy with him so far and there's much more to come.

1291~~~

1292~~~
Good for him, would have been my choice although it could have easily been Smalling or Shaw too.

1293~~~
Should have been Mike or Shaw, but he has done very well.

1294~~~
Agreed. But I suppose it's quite nice for a new player to come into the team and feel appreciated very early on. Good on him, hopefully it continues for a long time.

1295~~~
Smalling has been better but it's been a good start for Darmian.

I just want to see more application going forward. I don't know if it's his natural game or if it is instruction.

1296~~~
He played as a wing back quite regularly for Italy and Torino. Most of the time he makes forward runs but Mata opts to go inside.

1297~~~

1298~~~
He'd probably be our second best CB if played there. Given our lack of options there I'd like to see us try it soon. His reading of the game and positional play is exceptional.

1299~~~
Off to Barcelona in the summer <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1300~~~
I think Shaw deserved it more, but I'm not going to complain about Darmian getting it. Great to see him settle in so quickly and look so assured defensively. Just need to see more from him going forward and I think we will in time.

1301~~~
His defending is fine, great to watch. His attacking is dogshite. The anti Dani Alves.

1302~~~
Has looked great so far. All the fullbacks have to be fair, but Darmian stands out for me as I've not seen him play before.

1303~~~
Standard performance for him, though tonight he's had a couple more opportunities to get the ball when he's gone forward than the last couple of matches. Good to hear an oppo fan appreciating his performance! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1304~~~
Just so solid, 1 v 1 he's as good as anyone around IMO, the fact he can use his left foot to nick the ball with ease makes it hard for wingers to get around him.

1305~~~
Yeah that's what I've noticed the most, seems impossible to dribble around, always comes away with the ball.

1306~~~
Very very solid defensively.

1307~~~
His defensive intelligence and general reading of the game is great. If now he can start crossing like GNeville and improve his attacking play, he will be an United legend.

1308~~~
Wish he'd stop picking up yellow cards, he has 3 now right? Don't you get a 1 game suspension for 5 yellows?

1309~~~
I don't think we can stop it I'm afraid, his first instinct is to stop the player. I think he's one of the best one on one defenders I've seen wearing the red shirt, I'd love his attacking game to improve but defensively he's outstanding.

1310~~~
Yep, just worried about the prospect of having to play Valencia there if he does get suspended!

1311~~~
Same again. He's a rock. Very clever defender. Thrilled we have him.

1312~~~
Spot on. This is the thing I've been most impressed with.

1313~~~
With him and Shaw, we have the best full backs in the league.

1314~~~
I think he's got elasto-legs or something. He occasionally looks beaten, then somehow he ends up poking at the ball, killing the attacking threat.

1315~~~
He's just getting better. Defensively, he's top. Now if he could improve his attacking play, he'd be perfect

1316~~~
Like many Italian players, his tactical knowledge, reading of the game and cleverness helps him a lot

1317~~~
Saw some glimpses of good attacking play, that chance that Carrick created for Darmian to put in a good cross could have resulted in a goal if Fellaini's touch was better.

1318~~~
and that run where Herrera picked him out. With more confidence I can see him make more runs

1319~~~
2 of the yellow cards he received this season were really soft. Anyway, i d rather he gets a yellow than letting the winger/striker run past him. He is clever to know when to foul at the right time.

1320~~~
Whenever I see him in a 1-1 I'm not worried at all, even if a player gets the wrong side of him you know they aren't getting away, he'll snap 'em.

1321~~~
We have bought him to defend.... Last season, every team exploited us on the right side and we looked so vulnerable .... we eventually had to double up every time a team attacked us on our right.... 
This season, how many times have you seen mata go for defending ... if he frees up our attackers from defensive duties, even that's a plus for us

1322~~~
True that

1323~~~
Funnily enough for a player who rarely attacks and is the best RB defensively in the league, he still offers more going forward than Valencia who's a winger by trade.

1324~~~
Didn't think this sort of right-back was available during the summer, since I hadn't seen enough of him and thought our best options were some young players to develop. Really happy with him.

1325~~~
He might have the best defensive game out of any defensive player out there. He's really looking like Maldini. I'm more than convinced that if he was to play at Centre back he'd be amongst the best in the world.

1326~~~
You have a lot to learn about football

1327~~~
He was very good today, no doubt. Looked much fitter and sharper. 

Won't even bother with a comeback to that lazy comment.

1328~~~
He almost played another runner onside, as he did against Swansea (right? It was that game, I think). Other than that, he's been fantastic defensively.

1329~~~
Before we bought him I remember reading somewhere that one of our scouts had advised LVG not to buy him... he simply wasn't good enough.

I truly hope that was just some made up rumour. Otherwise I guess he might be looking for a new job...

1330~~~
Absolutely brilliant at both ends of the pitch, yellow card machine

1331~~~
He's fast becoming the second best right fullback I've ever seen with United. His intelligence and composure is at par with Irwin's

1332~~~
Has any player had the better of him over the course of 90 minutes yet? No one.

1333~~~
The guy is a dark arts master. Love his no fecks given style of defending.

1334~~~
He's absolutely brilliant. Just like Shaw he never seems to lose a 1 on 1. Best pair of fullbacks in the league, easily.

Does need to cut out the yellows though, might come back to bite him eventually.

1335~~~
I don't think he'll ever lose a 1 on 1.

1336~~~
Him and Shaw just never get skinned. They both have an almost telepathic ability to know exactly what the attacker is going to do.

1337~~~
And they're only going to get better <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1338~~~
Absolutely. Add in Smalling and Blind, and our defence really does look sorted for a good few years to come.

Dare I say it, could it eventually emulate Nev/Vidic/Rio/Evra?

1339~~~
He did everything right, again. You just cannot find fault with him.

Even the yellow cards are good play on his part - they're never accidental. He knows exactly when to take a foul to stop an attack.

1340~~~
He truly is a true-blooded Italian defender. Knows what to know and intuitive in his movements. Just need sto work on his crossing, but I guess it will come once he settles completely here. Feel so composed and relaxed knowing him and Shaw are playing as fullbacks.

1341~~~
My favourite thing about him is that he is so utterly and blatantly Italian in the way he plays football, especially with regards to tactical cynicism. A couple of times now this season, he's found himself in a less than ideal situation which he has solved by conceding a free kick. And it's not that he concedes a free kick, it is the way he does it without any sort of panic, he just does the deed, entirely composed and cool as a cucumber, and walks away.

He gives the impression that he is always fully in control of every situation he's involved in. I can't think of anything more Italian than that, when it comes to football.

1342~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1343~~~
Absolutely love this trait. I just chuckled at the ease he does it.

1344~~~
The baby faced booking.

1345~~~
This guy was an absolute steal, and he's quickly becoming one of my favourite players at the club.

1346~~~
Needs to stop getting booked with such regularity.

1347~~~
He is ridiculous defensively.

1348~~~
He's unbeatable in 1v1 situation and he also has the unique ability to nick the balls from awkward positions and angles where you'd least expect, and where other defenders would hardly even think of attempting a tackle.

1349~~~
Just wish he wouldn't get booked so much. Felt the free kick and booking he conceded yesterday was unnecessary. Solid otherwise.

1350~~~
He is brilliant not just on the flanks but also to cover up for his CBs sometimes. I have lost count of how many times he is the last man defending and marking a player's run and getting the better of him.

1351~~~
3 yellow cards in 5 league games, and he's not even a particularly dirty player. I love him.

1352~~~
Fantastic signing. He's brilliant.

1353~~~
What a signing he's been. In fact, he's turned out to be the best of the bunch so far.

1354~~~
They've all been cynical as feck!

When he is rarely beaten he just takes them down.

I love him.

1355~~~
I'd say that's his first mistake of the year?

1356~~~
second? I count the first half goal

1357~~~
Move him to LB and play valencia at RB. 

Blind has to stay central; our defence is shambles without him organising everythung with smalling.

1358~~~
His worst game for us so far.

1359~~~
Lost his composure totally after Shaw's injury. Afraid of going in, early passes, losing his man. Understandable but thought he would have more mental strength.

1360~~~
2 mistakes, 2 goals. I thought he looked tired as well.

1361~~~
He was the main culprit for both goals. First really poor match from him.

1362~~~
Very poor for us today, 2nd to Mata for our worst player on the pitch I think.

1363~~~
Terrible game today.

1364~~~
Very poor - even at the end when we were carved open.

1365~~~
He fecked up for their second, was bad overall. Hope he recovers well from this.

1366~~~
He looked shagged. I think he needs a rest.

1367~~~
His first bad game for us.. it costs us the game

1368~~~
Had a bad game, it happens, move on.

1369~~~
Decent first half. Suffered majorly when Memphis and Young switched wings. Memphis just doesn't help out defensively. Shaw has suffered from it in recent games, and now Darmian got it as well. That doesn't excuse his performance, as some things were all down to him, but he still needed help.

1370~~~
At fault for both goals.

1371~~~
He needs a break. Looked knackered in the 2nd half.

1372~~~
Funny how nobody was like this when Valencia had bad games(much like this one)
This game further highlighted how poor he is going forward and how he needs to improve upon that. He poorly marked Moreno and left way too much space in behind for the second goal, although Daley Blind had the biggest impact on that goal conceded.

I will cut him some slack, just because of how great he has been defensively and it is just one really bad game. Also I think he might be a bit fatigued. I've noticed on a multiple occasions that he really struggled to get back on defense leaving us vulnerable to chances being created on the right wing and counter attacks. I also think we should keep perspective that he is also adapting to the fast pace of the EPL as well. We should rest him our next game.

1373~~~
Wouldn't be surprised to see Darmian get dropped for the weekend

1374~~~
First bad game for us after nothing but top performances.

Pick ourselves up and go again. Just a bad day at the office for him.

1375~~~
Said this before but he just looks like a centre back playing at fullback to me. Not good enough on the ball / going forward (yet), especially for a team that dominates possession and needs the fullbacks to attack.

Needs to concentrate on defending corners too rather than trying to distract opposition

1376~~~
Poor today defensively Ffor the first time.


But what does he actually add in attack ? Needs to do lot more on that end.

1377~~~
Mistake prone and useless going forward. Still, it happens. I'd rest him.

1378~~~
Bad game. It happens.

1379~~~
Our worst player today easily. Weak for the first goal, and awful giveaway for the second goal. Gave us nothing going forward. He won't get much criticism because he's a new signing, but he was definitely the reason why we lost today.

1380~~~
Tonight is on him. Poor marking at the corner and gave the ball away needlessly for their goal.

Shame because he has been superb.

1381~~~
Given LVG has left us with Valencia as the backup option, after sidelining and selling Rafael not sure resting him is a good idea.

1382~~~
Very poor game for him and as I said from the beginning, going forward he doesn't offer enough yet. Maybe a game or two on the bench wouldn't harm him. He's new to the club and played every game

1383~~~
He has been solid. But frankly he's gotten overpraised a bit as he's added little to nothing in attack so far in all games combined.

1384~~~
First bad game, his counterpart is out for the season... This was a very bad day, need to move on quickly...

1385~~~
Hasn't he played a lot of games on the left as well as right? Would rather see him at LB than what we finished the game with tonight.

1386~~~
He had an absolute shocker tonight sad to say. Still like him though, sure he'll be much better in the coming weeks.

1387~~~
First bad game, couple of massive errors. Hope he doesn't hit a slide in form.

1388~~~
His first poor game defensively, really needs to up his game in attack though.

1389~~~
Bad game. I would have moved him to LB and kept the CB pairing the same but oh well. Maybe he does need a rest, it wouldn't surprise me.

1390~~~
Agreed, but in the other matches he's played he has proven to have been a good addition for us. Everyone has bad games. The marking on the corner was unfortunate, I think Blind was just as much to blame but the mistake for the second goal was just poor.

1391~~~
Really bad game. He'll get a bollocking from Van Gaal and hopefully it won't happen again.

1392~~~
Offers nothing going forward and hasn't all season bar the odd game. Needs to really step up his attacking contribution.

1393~~~
He's giving us nothing going forward which is causing us problems cause given the sheer amount of the ball we have, we need our fullbacks to give us width. Move him to Centre back and play young at right-back I'd say. 

As for his defending? Pretty confident that's about as bad as its gonna get through the season in that respect.

1394~~~
Gives us nothing going forward, never takes on a man, and this is the second match out of the last three that his defensive lapses have given up a goal where we lose by a goal. He looked awful on that goal by Moreno, as he did with Gomis´. I don´t see why we bought a right back that needs to be replaced by Valencia when we´re chasing a match.

1395~~~
During the first half, I kept wondering where he was, that blonde seems to break every time. Poor display from him today.

1396~~~
Was poor today, but I'm not worried as he has been class in all the other games. Bad games happen from time to time.

1397~~~
Quality player but looked absolutely knackered in the 2nd half. Need's a rest.

1398~~~
Had forgotten his atrocious play was directly responsable for their second goal as well. That makes three of the last four goals against us directly due to his shit defending.

1399~~~
Don't see why he should look anymore knackered than our other players so don't think that's a valid excuse. He just had a really poor game.

I think in general from what I've seen so far he needs to be better. Defensively it's only tonight he's looked bad (he never seemed to be anywhere!), but on the ball and going forwards he hasn't been good enough in any game so far for me...and that's what cost us the second goal tonight. He shows no composure and poor decision making with the ball. It's no good defending well if you're going to take yourself out of the game because you can't play a pass...tonight was the first tiime he's been punished for this but he does it too often. 

The first goal he was just too weak.

I think he needs time before we'll see if he really has what it takes. He needs to add a lot more for me but then he's just come to the club from another country so I doubt we've seen him near his best and most confident yet.

1400~~~
At fault for both goals, looked tired and weak

1401~~~
Would be nice if we had Rafa to come in and give him a break. We'd get more attack down our right side anyway. Instead we'll get Valencia who gives us neither defensive solidity or an attacking threat. Who usually plays on Southampton's left? After that we have Sunderland at home, that'd be the ideal one to rest him for.

1402~~~
agreed

1403~~~
Had a poor game, can offer a lot more. No idea why his attacking game has been so poor, seems to do better for his national team and was even played as a wing back when he was at torino.

1404~~~
Most difficult game for him so far.Couldn't get forward and was caught out at the back a few times.

1405~~~
He was atrocious defensively and in attack he was a non factor but I think he might have been a bit overplayed in the last few weeks though. We really should manage the workload on our players more skilfully than we have thus far. Valencia should have played either the Liverpool match or last night.

1406~~~
Lol I though that little exchange a few games back "Darmian Wank-Goggles" was a bit of a laugh. It is a shame after his solid display.

1407~~~
I was under impression that he's a very offensive full back from his time at Torino, he barely played full back there - was usually a wing back and a very offensive one at that (likewise for Italy). I don't understand why he's been so poor offensively here.

1408~~~
Bad day at the office. Time to forget about it and move on. Maybe rest him during the weekend, all though Valencia does not fill me with confidence.

1409~~~
Hasn't played very well this half. Needs to get back to his early season form.

1410~~~
Part of being a fullback is to attack.

1411~~~
After a great start he's been less impressive. He has played alot for us (and italy?) so maybe he needs abit of a break?

1412~~~
He's definitely looking a bit tired.

1413~~~
Needs to offer more in attack given we don't have a proper wide player on the right.

1414~~~
I don't think pairing him up with a slow player like Mata helps him. If he had someone a bit more explosive alongside him, so that space opens up for him. 

Valencia did well when he came on. But how many attacks was he really involved in? Not many.

1415~~~
A bit like Depay, who's also played very game in a new league and both internationals, Darmian is another who might benefit from a rest on Wednesday.

1416~~~
Think he needs to rest a bit hasn't been the same since the international break.

1417~~~
That guy is in dire need of some rest. I would  rest him for the Wolfsburg game in ten days and let Valencia play the next two games against Ipswitch Town and Sunderland. Both him and Depay are not used to this level of intensity so it is best not to run these players to the ground.

1418~~~
LVG said he took him off as he gave too much space for Tadic, then praised Valencia as Tadic was nowhere to be seen in the 2nd half. 

Could be seeing more of Valencia now, not particularly against it to be honest.

1419~~~
Yeah, definitely looked a bit tired. Also think he would perform a lot better going forwards with somebody to overlap. But the way we play, Mata's like an additional #10 and Darmian has the right all to himself. Valencia was a beast when he came on so I'm not against rotating them for a bit as Valencia is more then capable.

1420~~~
He was dogshit today, just needs a bit of a rest and he'll be back.

1421~~~
Way too many crosses were coming in from his side in that first half. Hopefully the combination of only playing a half today and getting a rest midweek (presumably) will make him fresh for next weekend.

1422~~~
I think he needs a rest, he got done by Tadic (to be fair he is a good player) many times down that side. We looked much better in that area when Valencia came on at half time.

1423~~~
Didn't think I would be saying this but I would like Valencia to get a couple of games at RB, especially in the next couple vs Ipswich and Sunderland when you can expect us to have 70+%. Darmian isn't providing anywhere near enough on the ball and is always too deep when we are in possession. His solid defending from the first few games seems to have disappeared too, shaky moments vs Swansea and really poor performances vs PSV & Southampton.

1424~~~
I really really like him at LB. Good to know we have a competent replacement for Shaw.

1425~~~
<a class="username" data-user="47926, @AngeloHenriquez" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/47926/">@AngeloHenriquez</a> 

Remember when you quoted a guy for the mental post thread when he dared to suggest darmian be played at left back

Heh

1426~~~
Thought him and Valencia were as good as each other tbh. Both very good

1427~~~
As solid defensively at LB as he is at RB and actually looked better in attack today.

1428~~~
Another brilliant signing by LVG. Solid, dependable and talented.

1429~~~
Darmian excellent in both fullback positions and also can do the job as a CB. Quite great that we can depend on such a talented and versatile player.

1430~~~
Leave him there and have Valencia on the RB spot. Good cover for Shaw.

1431~~~
He's just immense. I think he could play for any big team in the world, and wouldn't look out of place.

1432~~~
I love that cheeky fecker to bits.

1433~~~
Very good at LB too. Great to see.

1434~~~
My man of the match. Looked solid defensively, and intelligent on the ball. I have not seen such a well putt together and balanced fullback like Darmien in awhile. With Shaw on the left, they are perhaps the best fullback pairing at United for a very long time.

1435~~~
He's the kind of guy you'd want to go to war with.

1436~~~
Glad to see him back to his usual standards again after a minor hiccup. Looked as good playing LB as he was in RB. I love the versatility of the players in the team right now, everyone can play lots of positions and that helps us cope with injuries better.

1437~~~
was linked to Bayern before joining us, and supposedly they balked a the price quoted..20 mil Euros is too much for a rb for most teams ..Its a bloody bargain for us.

1438~~~
Can see LVG's logic in wanting players that are 'flexible' and can play multiple positions. Surprised how well he's played LB today. Hope he continues with those performances until Luke is back.

1439~~~
I think this guy is our best defender. Solid at RB, as impressive at LB. Fast becoming one of my favourite players, along with Blind.

1440~~~
I'd put him in the same category as Blind, both are good players with very consistent levels of performances, but you wouldn't claim either was world class.

I'm a big fan of both players!

1441~~~
Thought he was brilliant today, back to his early season form after a bit of a blip.

1442~~~
Magnificent player who seems to have inherited Paddy's fitness levels and immunity to injury.

1443~~~
Looks more comfortable going forward on the left than he did on the right. Top purchase in my opinion, best we did in a while.

1444~~~
I thought today was probably his best game. It was good to see him overlapping. It's strange we hadn't seen a lot of it before.

1445~~~
Glad to see him at the top of his game.  His recent so-so performances were probably fatigue more than anything.

1446~~~
With Mata constantly cutting inside on the right, Darmian doesn't have anyone to overlap with, so I guess that's the main reason, not tactics.

1447~~~
He is immense, back to his best today. If he improves his crossing, he will be unbelievable.

1448~~~
Depay constantly cuts in too. That actually makes it easier to overlap.

1449~~~
Funny he seemed better going forward as a left-back than in his natural position. Very good game today, showing some trickery and pace in attack. Didn't know he had it in him.

1450~~~
He's generally great defensively but I still find him somewhat frustrating going forward. And Id say today was his best attacking display we've seen.

Confident he will add this with time though. He had the ability it's more the know how. Saying that, he was great against England at the world cup in an attacking sense.

1451~~~
Funny how you guys are all saying Darmian played brilliantly and then in the Valencia thread people are saying he was OK, when they had very similar games.

It's double standards, they are both right backs, analyse them similarly.

1452~~~
He found it easier overlapping today because of Memphis in my opinion. Memphis cuts in and takes defenders with him while Mata cuts in field and defenders just seem to pass him on. Plus Mata doesn't stay wide long enough, he moves infield quite a lot a roams around that area. So on the right hand side Darmian is usually facing the defender one-on-one if that makes sense. 
Anyone he was great today.

1453~~~
Personally I think he is our worst, out of the usual 4, but that is just how good our back line is which is bloody great.

Still think he can offer a bit more going forward. I think he has gotten away with some defensive mistakes as well, especially tracking runners. Great buy overall though.

1454~~~
Memphis draws more attention from the defenders with his runs, which leaves more opportunities to attack to our leftback (being Shaw or Darmian). Memphis is faster than Mata and contantly runs at the defenders (even though most of his runs aren't exactly successful), while our attacking play on the right is basically Mata standing still and waiting for the rightback to overlap, which is more predictable and doesn't always work.

I agree that Darmian has been somewhat hesitant in his attacking play on the right, though. He was much more involved today and I think it's down to Memphis' aggressive style. Memphis might cut inside as much as Mata, but spends more time on the wing than him IMO and that's why most of our attacks go down the left with Mata often waiting at the far post.

He needs to improve his crossing, but was better at it today than in the previous games.

edit: agree with Gerald G's post.

1455~~~
Anyone else see that little bit of quick feet to drag the ball around the defender in their box late on?

That was more skill than I thought he had in his locker. More and more impressed with the guy, I'm not sure I've seen a defender settle so well so quickly in this league. Certainly not for us.

1456~~~
Back to normal. Was great today and a good option for lb

1457~~~
It helps he is playing with Depay. Depay is harder to mark than Mata and teams double up on him. Which creates space for Darmian.

Where as Mata is easier to play against on the wing as he's not going to run past you and always look to come inside.

1458~~~
I just think there's a lot to adjust to. Serie A is very different in tempo and tactics, we play 4 at the back, new teammates, new language, different of coach and Torino don't dominate their games. 

I think we'll see a new, better player by the end of the season.

1459~~~
Though he was great yesterday - looks like we found our new LB while Shaw recovers. 

Tony V and Mata work well together on the right, and Darmian with Memphis work well because Memphis is pretty much always double-covered - creating space for Damo.

1460~~~
Great signing like all them this summer just made so much sense.

1461~~~
Some people simply do not like Valencia, no matter what he does..you are wasting your time trying to  do otherwise...

1462~~~
Depending on how highly van gaal regards Rojo; i can see darmian staying at LB until shaw is fit.  Then Mcnair can start edging towards the RB position.

1463~~~
Heinze?

1464~~~
That's probably a fair call actually. We tend to think less of him because of how things turned out but I was a huge Heinze fan until he turned out to be a cnut. Not sure he ever looked as natural a defender as Darmian does but he did settle very well, very quickly.

1465~~~
Maybe because that's the first time he's played in that position for us and we badly need a good LB now that Shaw is injured?

1466~~~
So you are saying Darmian was better because he played left back for the first time for us despite playing it regularly there for Torino while he was there and Valencia is worse because he had an almost identical game to him but he's played right back for 1 year, only transferring from being a winger very late in his career.

1467~~~
Compared to Valencia Darmian had a higher pass accuracy, more tackles and more interceptions. And most of the Sunderland shots came from the right side of our box except that one in first half De Gea saved with his legs.

1468~~~
Of course. He has a winger on that left side supporting him. On the right side Mata leaves him alone when he cuts inside.

1469~~~

It's a lot closer than you'd like to make out. A performance where some people continue to criticise Valencia yet laud Darmian despite it being close defensively and Valencia being the more adventurous and successful going forward.

1470~~~
Valencia also wins the stats for running the ball out of play when no one is around. 

Sunderland's best chance came right down Valencia's side also when he was caught out of position as usual.

1471~~~
Actually he had come in to cover for the winger, Mata was supposed to be following the full back, Valencia can't 2v1 (like anyone else) and Mata didn't do his job there.

1472~~~
Unfortunately with Valencia is his RB performance is looked through the prism of his RW performances. So if he isn't skinning some player and putting in a great cross like the good ol days it's poor whereas Darmian is a FB and is given slack in that he isn't primarily a dribbler.

1473~~~
He was as natural as they come. Going forward was where he looked very awkward.

1474~~~
When you look at those stats against the worst team in the PL both need to improve their crossing and chance creation in a system that relies on the fullbacks for most of the deliveries into the box.

1475~~~
Hienze looked very natural in this team.

1476~~~
Agreed but people who say that Valencia isn't good defensively have an agenda against him.

1477~~~
Yesterday and the game before he was fine I agree, but he had quite a few dodgy positional moments last season.

1478~~~
I thought he was one of the best right backs in the league last year.

1479~~~
I'm not so sure about that. Admittedly a lot of it is excessive, but there are a few occasions when he is caught out of position when Darmian wouldn't be.

I do think his passing has got a lot better though, if not his crossing.

1480~~~
Played well, really well at LB. 

I like how multi functional a lot of our players are!!

1481~~~
Exactly like van Gaal.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Are you van Gaal?</span>

1482~~~
I like my players to be versatile and understand the philosophy. 

They must adapt.

1483~~~
No, I am not saying that, read the fecking post again. And nobody watched him in fecking Torino.

1484~~~
You basically said that...

You might have meant a different thing, but it came across as that.

1485~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I was watching the DDG saves from last season on another thread, it was amazing how many times Valencia was out of position, lost a tackle or just struck out needlessly, lost his man, or just not in the frame as a chance was created down his side. I thought seeing Darmian, a RB who actually knows how to defend, how to operate as part of a back 4 would refresh people's memories and show them what's wrong with Valencia.
It's even more surprising that these are mostly the same people who criticised Rafael's defensive work based on his positioning, when it was atleast acceptable compared to Valencia. Brown was the last RB we had who properly owned his flank, and I think Darmian can do the same.

*I'm commenting on the general notion of Valencia's defensive work not on his game yesterday which I haven't seen. If Sunderland's biggest chances came down our right that would be quite typical of him.

1486~~~
This sounds good. Develop a promising youngster.

1487~~~
Not really. Valencia's defensive positioning can be a major, major issue.

Take the Van Aanholt chance yesterday even. He gets sucked in far too often and Smalling, particularly last season, often ends up being dragged out to the touchline in his place.

Valencia does well there considering he's been an attacking player for the majority of his professional career, but there are definite positional flaws in his game that have cost us previously and probably will do again. That's no agenda I'm afraid, just the truth.

Generally, though, I'm happy to have him at the club in the role he has right now.

1488~~~
Like I said in a Previous post Mata was marking the left back and didn't follow him, Valencia had already tucked in because the winger had. That was the only attack they had from our right.

1489~~~
Mata definitlely had defensive responsibility, and Cattermole played a great ball, to be fair, but a few steps to his right and Valencia is immediately in a better position to force the issue and perhaps get a foot in. I'm being quite critical I'm aware, but it's something of a regular occurrence with Valencia.

One vs one against a wide man he has no issues defensively, in his defence. But the more subtle side of the game can catch him out.

1490~~~
Valencia's man had just made a run inbetween him and Smalling, Valencia had to narrow to shut the space off in the middle of the pitch. The fact is Mata couldn't track Van aanholt's run due to the pace differential. That is not Valencia's fault though, you can't keep a tight back line and then quickly sprint wide it just isn't possible.

I personally put more blame on either Carrick or Schneiderlin there, their midfield had WAY too much time to pick any pass he wanted. If 1 of them had shut him down a little quicker that pass wouldn't have been on.

1491~~~
Seamlessly fitted into the left back position.Continues to impress.

1492~~~
Classy and versatile too. What a gem.

1493~~~
Our best defender, in my opinion (sorry Mike).

1494~~~
They were going through are left side like water in the second half. Has moments of defensive brilliance, but has his embarrassing moments as well. Once again, at fault on their goal

1495~~~
Incredible for us tonight! Really led the way towards the end there.

1496~~~
He was very good at the end against Trash and Schürrle

1497~~~
Very good. Closed VFLs right side.

1498~~~
Not his fault, Our midfield became non existent when Schweinsteiger was substituted. He had a lot of pressure on his shoulders and did extremely well.

1499~~~
What? Did you not see Valencia's positioning?

1500~~~
He contributes nothing in attack.

Though i love his defensive work most of the time, going forward he gives little to nothing. 

Mata on that flank seems better playing with a Valencia/Young as runners on the outside.

1501~~~
Will you ever give this agenda up? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1502~~~
Great performance

1503~~~
I agree with this. Valencia is too much of a liability though.

1504~~~
To be honest I thought he was quite poor in the first half. Made it up though in the second half and especially towards the end.

1505~~~
Not only did Darmian play him onside, it was his man as well. Valencia made no difference in that play. End of.

1506~~~
First half, we had the ball and he had little to do. He does seem to value defending far more than attacking, and I really enjoy that. Second half, he was called upon and he was brilliant. Can't ask for more.

1507~~~
Blaming him for the goal? 

Daley Blind was at fault for charging out in midfield and then fullback.

1508~~~
Absolutely quality today, not been playing well recently at rightback but was fantastic when we needed him today.

Their goal was all on Blind and Valencia, proper nonsense to be blaming Darmian.

1509~~~
Did you watch the match? I'm going to assume you didn't. <b>Valencia </b>was right back and played their forward onside. Darmian was playing left back.

1510~~~
No go and watch the replay, and watch Darmian´s very poor defending

1511~~~
Bizarre. It was mostly Valencia's fault. How can you not see that?

1512~~~
Did you?

1513~~~
You can really see the agendas at play when half out team has now been individually blamed for that goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1514~~~
Not really. Wolfsburg had several attacking moves down our left in the first half also. Thought the CBs bailed out Darmian often. I am not even considering his attacking output at this point - even though he crossed the ball to Mata for a good chance in the first half.

1515~~~
Yes, now I see it, Darmian's fault.

1516~~~
He gets very little passing when he does overlapping runs and that is a bit disappointing as I think he can attack pretty well but he never gets the ball to do so,

1517~~~
I doubt Darmian would even have been that deep if he hadn't spotted Valencia in no man's land and tried to make up for it.

1518~~~
Regardless of Valencia being off in la-la land, their player would have been onside anyway and Darmian was the man who let him go so he isn't completely wrong on this one, it was poor defending from everyone. Thought Matteo was absolutely excellent in the second half though after a bit of a shaky first half.

1519~~~
Love him.

1520~~~
Could've arguably done a bit more to be with his man, but in all fairness to Wolfsburg it was a decent bit of play from them.

1521~~~
Why do you only post in the Darmian and Valencia threads?

1522~~~
He obviously didn't watch the match but simply heard that the goal came through Darmian's side and got the ammunition to feed his agenda. Schneiderlin and Blind played like amateurs on that move and Valencia was stupid to help them bust the offside trap.

1523~~~
Shows Darmian clearly playing him onside as well, so Tony does´t matter, does he. I wish Darmian would've marked his man

1524~~~
Why do you care?

1525~~~
Means a lot to me.

1526~~~
I bet it does. I sometimes post on movies and politics as well. Wild.

1527~~~
Valencia was so bad that LVG see it as a necessity to sub him off during half time. But okay, blame it on Darmian.

1528~~~
Weird the way some people seem to get so hung up on defending unfairly criticised players they end up being outrageously biased against players that keep them out of the team.  The goal was mainly Blind's fault but Valencia fecked up badly too. Darmian was almost completely blame free. He had a very good game IMO.

1529~~~
Valencia's still fairly out of position, though, which hardly helps.

1530~~~
Darmian was at fault for their goal, but it was a collective defensive deck up.  Thought he was superb mostly.

1531~~~
Darmian was solid tonight, but should go back to RB.

Instead of having only two players out of position in Young and Blind, we ended up having three players out of position. Young at LB and Darmian at RB should've been a no-brainer. Unless he was put out there specifically to nullify Draxler/ Schurrle, which he didn't do very well at.

1532~~~
Honestly there is no need to argue whether Valencia was badly positioned or at fault for that goal, go watch literally any other game he's played RB for us and you'll find an example of his poor positioning. He's always drifting into the wrong place, it's one of his biggest weaknesses.

1533~~~
Nobby loves him some Tony V.

I thought Darmian was vital tonight, his closing down and endless energy at the back really helped Smalling as Blind was off the pace.

1534~~~
Darmian, Blind, Smalling, Valencia and Schneiderlin were all in someway at fault for the goal. End of.

1535~~~
The agenda in here is stinking. Let it out.

1536~~~
Only seen the replay once, but it did look like Darmian was at fault for the goal. Thought he was very good otherwise though.

1537~~~
I didn't watch the match, so I don't even really know why I am commenting <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. But anyway, going by the replay and the still-shots I have seen I thought Blind and Valencia were more at fault than Darmian.

1538~~~
Needs to be back at RB. Don't trust anyone else there aside from him.

1539~~~
I'd say I'd probably be a bit guilty of that at times but Darmian was definitely not blame free. It was poor positioning by Valencia but he could've been stood on the halfway line and the goal would still have happened.

1540~~~
Its better to start him at RB and Rojo/Young at LB,but i think LVG would play him again at LB against Arsenal.

1541~~~
Prior to the goal Darmian was out of position, therefore Schneiderlin and Blind took it upon themselves to cover the vacant right back position. Caligiuri made the run on the wide right channel, whilst being tracked by the aforementioned players, and he plays the ball back towards Draxler (who Darmian is marking/covering). Draxler passes to Kruse who assists Caligiuri, who should have been stopped by either Blind or Schneiderlin, but instead had a free run at goal. 

Darmians run of play was tracking Draxler, then covering the CB space left by Blind and then shifting back to his RB position, as Blind moved back centrally. In my opinion, the players at fault were Blind and Valencia. Blind for not tracking Caligiuri and Valencia for being Valencia (the RB version).

As the ball is played to Caligiuri, Darmian instantly steps up, which is what they're most probably practicing in training, however, Valencia is so far back that it destroys our attempt at playing the offside.

1542~~~
Would be a bit surprised if he starts at LB, he should be up against Sanchez.

1543~~~
It might have but it would have taken a well timed run and pass. Valencia's failure to step out meant they had a huge margin for error on both elements. It was horrible defending all round, really. All the more frustrating because it involved four players usually known for their defensive smarts (Blind, Smalling, Schneiderlin and Darmian) If any of them had done their job a bit better then Valencia's naivety would have been much less of an issue (still an issue though)

The comment about "some people" wasn't aimed at you btw. <a class="username" data-user="44946, @Nobby style" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44946/">@Nobby style</a> has been a fervent defender of Valencia for ages (sometimes with good reason, sometimes not so much) which seems to have translated into a desire to constantly belittle Valencia's replacement, Darmian. Who's had a couple of ropey displays but has generally been excellent (i.e. better than valencia)

1544~~~
Sanchez plays from the left wing.

1545~~~
Erm, exactly...

1546~~~
My bad misread that. To be fair Valencia handled Sanchez very well last year, in both games he was pretty ineffective. I have a feeling he will be more lively in this game though.

1547~~~
The thing is, Valencia is measured by milimetrics for everything negative, and usually completely ignored for anything positive, whereas Darmian is completely measured the opposite. For anything right, his balls are polished to a beautiful sheen, and not many people notice his feck ups. I´m just going to measure Darmian equally. The guy has been at fault on four goals in this young year already, been skinned several times, has been yanked off at halftime for being shite, and provides basically zero offense, which for a Manchester United fullback is a sin, yet by reading the praise of him, you would think he's the second coming of christ. The guy is usually decent and has very good moments defensively, but he is massively overrated in response to the bandwagon of hate for Valencia.

1548~~~
I think it's possible to have distinct and unrelated opinions on both of them.

1549~~~
Totally agree, let´s just judge them equally.

1550~~~

1551~~~
Completely agree.

1552~~~
his performances completely fit to what Iv'e said about him before he joined us even I didn't know him that much. He reminded me Blind when he came here, similar players in terms of what the've achieved in their league/ in national team, similar price, similar consistency and never a world class potential. Both look good buys but still are found out of their depth at times... 

Darmian offers almost nothing going forward with that I agree the most. Fullback who plays for MANchester United should definitely know how to get forward and even more in this at times very rigid system with double pivot at the base, something which Shaw started to offer this year at the age of 20. I still think Matteto can come good but he's been a bit overrated after his arrival as almost every other player who came for a position we had so needed to strengthen. It's good to be optimistic but stay realistic at the same time guys..

1553~~~
He's been good at left back as well and some of his left footed crosses are great. He seems comfortable on either side.

1554~~~
I can't get over the fact that we have a relatively old-school defence-first fullback. It's great.

1555~~~
Dreadful.

1556~~~
What a fecking disaster!!!

1557~~~
And again. Wow, take him off for Jones.

1558~~~
I doubt I ever seen any worse performance from a right back like this half against Arsenal. I like being optimistic but only thing he's got on Rafael is that he can stay fit. That's what you get when you finally play world class player from the left against you..

1559~~~
First and third goal was all on him unacceptable performance for a player at this level.

1560~~~
One of the worst defensive performances from a United player since Evra's debut.

1561~~~
Hopefully this is him just settling in. For someone who's not great going forward he needs to much better defensively.

Jones would do a better job at RB.

1562~~~
Seems to be getting worse each game.

1563~~~
Looks like an under 18 player out there.

1564~~~
I like him but no denying that he's served up a horrow show today. maybe he got overworked with the tight fixture or is just settling in but that's no excuse.

he can do better and he needs to.

1565~~~
He was great v Wolfsburg to be fair.

1566~~~
Has having an absolute nightmare against Sanchez. Wonder if he'll get the hook at half-time.

1567~~~
Getting absolutely destroyed by Sanchez.  Valencia might be shite but at least he doesn't get physically dismantled.

1568~~~
He's been naive and rash today.

1569~~~
Had a mare. Worst player on the pitch, and that's an achievement considering the game Blind, Rooney, Carrick, Schweini and Depay are having.

1570~~~
Been going backwards in recent games. Would ideally need a rest but our squads too thin to do that.

1571~~~
Darmian is one of the best defensive fullbacks in Europe, and has been at the club for just 3 months. We need to keep that in perspective. There will be ups and downs, and some horrible performances, especially when the team as a whole capitulates. Which is totally understandable because he still hasn't adjusted fully to the league, having played just 7 matches before this - and less than 10 hours. We will have to be patient with him, just as we were with Vidic and Evra and Ferdinand, and more recently - Smalling.

1572~~~
Has no protection at all. He's having a nightmare but it's not all his own doing.

1573~~~
Hooked

1574~~~
He has been poor, but the lack of help he and our other fullback have got has been disgusting to watch.

1575~~~
Young did the exact same thing today when Ramsey was about to score. In my opinion, Darmien should have remained on. I do not know why Van Gaal took him off.

1576~~~
Probably because he doesn't offer much going forward and that what was needed.

1577~~~
Darmien actually offered our best chance in the game when he pinged the ball to Martial. Valencia is unintelligent attacking and since coming on, he has not done much in the attack beside what he tends to be associated with.

1578~~~
Interesting the excuses he enjoys in contrast to Valencia.

1579~~~
This. Smalling provided no cover at all

1580~~~
The problem is neither Valencia nor Darmian. The real issue is that we play with a defence which is 50-75% made up of midfielders. We may get away with it against the smaller sides but the cracks are evident once we have to have 2-3 top forwards at one go

1581~~~
Can't believe people are making excuses after a performance like that. He was by far our worst player and should have been taken off after the third goal.

1582~~~
People aren't making excuses. They just want the knee-jerk, over the top critics to consider the setup of the team, and maintain a modicum of realism about his progression as a player still new to the league. Players have a couple of bad performances from time to time. C'est la vie.

1583~~~
How he responds now will tell us a lot about what sort of player we bought.

1584~~~
Had a shocker- though not many could have handled Sanchez with how he started the game.

1585~~~
Not great but new league for him and a step up in level, we saw with Vidic and Evra it can take time to adjust. There's enough positive signs so far with Darmian.

1586~~~
Today?  We could have let a couple more in if he remained.
Really? He was terrible defensively. What's the point of playing a defender that can't attack and is terrible defensively on the day?

Valencia would have been crucified for that.

1587~~~
He had a shocker but why is he always isolated? I have the same question for Valencia, Young and Shaw, why our fullbacks are expected to defend alone?

1588~~~
Darmian's not used to play in the midweek as well I guess. He'll get used to it.

1589~~~
Valencia should have played on the right from the beginning.. He can match SAnchez's pace.. Darmain should have played on the left..

1590~~~
looked tired

1591~~~
Memphis doesn't track back and Mata's a bit insignificant defensively. Carrick doesn't have the legs to get out wide to cover too.

1592~~~
Very naive today and just poor

1593~~~
Memphis, that's why. Can't defend for toffee and loses the ball too often. Needs to improve vastly if he wants to keep his place.

1594~~~
But it's not new, LVG needs to fix that because it's a huge flaw.

1595~~~
He had a stinker today but we should remember that he has been one of our better players up until today. It will be interesting to see how he responds to this all players has bad games but what separates the best from the rest is how they reacts to those setbacks.

1596~~~
He was woeful. He was affording Sanchez a ridiculous amount of space.

1597~~~
Memphis is on the other side, but it works for Mata.

1598~~~
trouble with this is that Valencia doesnt add anything going forward either. Cant beat his man, cant cross, no left foot at all and always cuts in and lays off a soft square ball.

1599~~~
He's had some dodgy games in the past couple of weeks leading up to this today. Don't know if it's tiredness or what but he's definitely gone off the boil aside from a good second half against Wolfsburg.

1600~~~
Had a nightmare but what's annoying is that we could all see him get roasted and no one decided to help him against Sanchez.

1601~~~
Needs taking out of the firing line, unfortunately we'd not bought enough cover for the full back positions. 

This would have been no different with Shaw still fit, we simply have no recognised full backs.

1602~~~
If this was the Valencia thread , the pitchforks would be out . There is a serious bias against ugly looking players on the CAF. Poor Valencia

<span style="color: #ffffff">Half kidding. </span>

1603~~~
He was crap on both ends of the pitch today. He never should have played from the beginning and hopefully he gets some rest.

1604~~~
Started fairly well in his first couple of matches, but has looked completely out of his depth in the last 2. Shocking stuff for an Italy international of his age

1605~~~
Be nice to see him cross the ball instead of waiting for a teammate to come

1606~~~
Had a mare today, Alexis really murdered him.

1607~~~
The manager doesn't see it that way.

1608~~~
He was, but he never got any support.
Equally shite were Smalling , Blind, Young, Carrick, Schweinstiger, Rooney, Mata and Depay.

1609~~~
Sanchez is a top 10 player in the world, if he has a good day he's roasting any fullback 1 v 1.

1610~~~
Is Valencia ugly? Didn't know that...

Darmian was really poor today, but he has shown that he has a lot to offer. To me, Darmian should have played on the left and Valencia on the right.

1611~~~
True that, but Valencia has done well against him in the past.

1612~~~
Said this from the start. Looks like a centre back playing at full back, so awkward on the ball and going forward. I'm not too worried about the poor defending as he was up a world class player but he really looks low on confidence on the ball, poor first touch and distribution

1613~~~
He had a shocker today but when Sanchez us given free reign to run at a full back that much he's going to destroy him.

1614~~~
The concern with Darmian is if he has lost his confidence after a great start at the club. Being hooked at half time in two consecutive games (although arguably the right call in both) is probably a bit of a blow for him personally.

1615~~~
Exposed badly and didn't help himself. Set the tone in the first minute by giving away a free kick and we couldn't get out our own half.

Don't think Carrick or Mata did him any favours. You should always look to double up on a player like Sanchez. Just like Arsenal did to Depay. Cazorla and Bellerin were doubling up on him.

1616~~~
That is the same thing I would be same thing I would have done. Hooking Valencia off at half time against Wolfsburg was not great for me, especially for his morale. Young isnt a fullback at all, and that is a stupid thing to even try, and we will pay for that. Valencia for all his weaknesses offers something as fullback.

1617~~~
Alexis went past him like twice, the fact that one of the times he did it ended up a goal is the reason everyone says he ripped him. We played better in the second half, Alexis never had a chance to take Valencia on so we didnt see how he would have fared.

1618~~~
Sanchez absolutely destroyed him today, I know he's one of the best players in the Premier League so it was always going to be difficult but he could've at least tried to make it somewhat difficult for him out there but he just had a shocker.

1619~~~
He has been average to bad in the last couple of games, i hope it's not a trend that continues.

1620~~~
Starting the season fantastically, but seems to be fading already. Slightly concerning.

1621~~~
Hauling him off at HT today did him a favour, as it meant he didn't get roasted in the second half. 

I'd have dragged him off after twenty minutes today,as he played a role in all three goals. It's a huge concern after his strong start.

1622~~~
I didn't say that he didn't deserve to be taken off - only that being dragged off in two consecutive matches will damage his confidence, and after his impressive early form and our lack of options at FB (with Shaws injury), this should be a concern.

1623~~~
Didn't get sent off you mean. The chances of that were quite high.

1624~~~
I would have pulled him after 15 minutes. Pathetic, useless display. Couldn't defend and then decided that he just didn't want the team to keep possession.

1625~~~
really no idea what happened to him all the sudden. he looked very promising at the start of the season.

1626~~~
Slightly? I would say that's VERY concerning.

1627~~~
He would be alright,I don't blame him instead I would blame teams position on second and third goal,pathetic.

1628~~~
Yeah thats true. His performances have really dipped.

In fact the whole defence seems to have fallen apart since Shaw's injury.

1629~~~
Shaw was vital for us with his pace and an absolute rock. It just shows what a monter he was/is, i cant wait to see him again.

1630~~~
It is alarming to see so many defensive errors that cost us goals from a full-back that contributes very little going forwards. His current error rate must be close to that of Rafael and Evra, yet without their attacking contribution. 

Needs to cut down on the number of errors. Far too many.

1631~~~
The guy's quality, give him time. Up till recently, he has been one of our best players.

1632~~~
He's had a couple of bad performances mixed in with mostly excellent ones... I'm not worried at all about him. Not one fullback can handle Sanchez when he's on form, especially not when he's being isolated one on one and in so much space out on the wing. He had no help really and the back 4 was constantly attacked without the shielding from the midfield that we usually have. Was quality in the game against Wolfsburg so it's not like he's been in poor form.

1633~~~
Was brilliant against Wolfsburg. He was only really poor today and against Southampton really. Hardly something to be worried about. Not one fullback can handle Sanchez when he's on his game like he was today.

1634~~~
Poor guy. A real welcome to the Premier League. Imagine the reaction if Valencia had produced that defensive display <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He will learn from it though. Players need games like this to grow.

1635~~~
Useless and pathetic? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1636~~~
Had an off game, looked pretty fatigued. But it is quite frankly insane and idiotic to claim he is useless and pathetic. It is impossible to properly setup and defend against the opposition when your midfield is nonexistent and being constantly overrun - particularly when you're tasked to cover a player like Sanchez. 

Anyone who has actually played football - especially in defense - can appreciate that.

1637~~~
Had a bad game, though I would like to point out that Mata needs to help out more defensively.

1638~~~
Darmian season is just like the LvG philosophy. Keeps running between good, average and bad.

1639~~~
I was feeling the same. He really was awful. Just awful. I know Sanchez is a great player but Darmian is an international level RB. He was humiliated. Not sure what has happened but his decline is concerning.

1640~~~
am i the only one who sees a slow decline in his game? He was fantastic at the beginning of the season but recently has poor.

1641~~~
Didn't you bother reading the last few pages? If not go read & if you did, you already have your answer.

1642~~~
I wasn't excited about him on pre-season unlike some but I think this lack of rotation has killed him.Needed to be in a top shape to defend against a top player like Sanchez (especially when the midfield two was two static 30+ yo players).His lack of attacking abilities always concern me though.

1643~~~
I still haven't figured out what it is people think Darmian is actually good at. 

When he has to defend, he doesn't do it very well. When he has to attack, he doesn't do it very well. When he has to play football, he doesn't do it very well. He isn't amazingly fast, or big, or strong. So what is it people think he's good at? 

I've only seen him play ok so far, and that's against non threat teams like Sunderland, where you could play a kid there and they'd look ok more often than not. 

I mean fair enough it's his first season, but that's an excuse for being a bit shite, not an excuse to pretend he hasn't been.

1644~~~
Guy needs a rest, unfortunately he won't be getting that any time soon. Italy have two important games coming up, after that it's away to Everton and away to CSKA followed by City. Hopefully he picks up a tactical yellow against City so that he's banned vs Boro, otherwise there's no stopping LVG from picking him in that game. 

The amount of work full backs are supposed to do is quite draining and demanding. Teams are supposed to have four proper full backs. Look at City with Zaba, Sagna, Kolarov and Clichy. It's really not Darmian's fault that he's the only proper full back fit at the moment and will remain that until Shaw is back or we sign some cover in January. Say what you want but players like Valencia, Jones, Blind and Young are not full backs.

He had a poor game but I'm not blaming him for the result. 1v1 vs players of Alexis' calibre is the death of most defenders. Our defence was quite stretched because Bastian was playing Rooney's role and the wingers weren't tracking back. Give any decent counter attacking side that much space time after time again and they will punish you regardless of how good you are.

1645~~~
When people are making judgements, they should also remembr he's new to this league. He's done well overall imo.

1646~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1647~~~
Why didn't we keep Rafael as his backup/competition ?

1648~~~
Rafael was never fit anyway so it's not like he'd provide much back up.

1649~~~
That was a mistake IMO. Would be a better option than Valencia (and Young). Could also play LB if required too.

1650~~~
Darmian got roasted by Sanchez who was playing at his top level. He wouldn't have been the only RB to struggle against Sanchez in that type of form. He looked in a total panic by the 10th minute. 

Let's not forget that he's new to the league, he had absolutely nothing in the way of protection from Mata (same happened on the other side with Memphis as well) and Arsenal were essentially allowed to run at the defense at will due to our Midfield two being literally non-existent.  

He was awful, the entire game is a write-off and he needs to show what he's made of when he's given another chance. Perhaps Varela could be given a shot at right back? I actually think Darmian has looked better at left back if i'm honest.

1651~~~
Darmian will be fine. Evra and Vidic had a tough start as well. The guy is intelligent and will adapt. He could use a break now and then though. But our situation is what it is for the moment. No need to lose our shit over this.

1652~~~
I hope that performance yesterday hasn't knocked his confidence here long-term because it was honestly that bad. I have faith that he's a good player and early in the season he looked promising, so he needs to get over yesterday fast, learn from it and move on. Hopefully he has a couple of solid games for Italy that will build his confidence a bit again.

1653~~~
Because he was mostly injured? As he is now for his new club. We're therefore proper fecked until at least January to see if we can get someone else.

1654~~~
He looked like a good all rounder for his first couple of league games, but other than that I agree. People were over the moon when we signed him and praising him in pre-season but he looked like the average right back to me

1655~~~
I think that is a bit harsh. like someone said earlier, he passed in the ball for our only real chance of the game. The whole team bombed yesterday and he had a particularly bad day, but he's not average. He needs to improve going forward, but on most occasions he's reliable enough to be in position and get a tackle in. The way his day was going, the 3rd goal summed it up. Tackle wasn't strong enough against someone like Sanchez.

I genuinely can't think of a better right back in the league (not saying he's the best, just don't think there are many around better, they are all this pretty decent level). Bellerin is faster, but Sagna is the only one I could really say has outshone him.

1656~~~
If anyone deserves a pass for yesterday, it's Darmian.

1657~~~
Put Sanchez against any defender one vs one and he'd destroy them. You have to double up on him and I saw none of that yesterday. Disappointed really.

1658~~~
Too many overreaction about his performance versus Arsenal. He should have done better with our first goal, but I doubt many other fullback would have done that much better against Sanchez in that form.

1659~~~
Agree with this to an extent.

I think his defending at times has been good e.g. Spurs, Villa, Wolfsburg but has also had some truly dreadful games at PSV, Southampton and Arsenal.

I think he is a decent defender but so average on the ball. Looks panicky when he receives it and chooses the easy option, first touch poor and has surrendered possession multiple times by not having the confidence to take a touch.

1660~~~
Rafael is injured..he is an absolute crock..what we should have done is get another fullback in as cover. LVG small squad will cost us, they look tired, and we havent even gotten to Christmas where we will be playing three times  a week.

1661~~~
Id rest him perhaps for Everton , and start Valencia. Seeing as Italy have already qualified(I think), a word with Conte to give him a rest wouldnt hurt. But he is a good defender, and he was good on Wednesday. It was a terrible day at the office for him though against Arsenal.

1662~~~
Did he have any other bad games besides the last one?

1663~~~
Had a rough time against Southampton too, getting hauled of in the half-time.

1664~~~
think he might be getting overworked, partly due to intensity of the premier league. he's played the full 90 in the 12 games he played this season didn't he? started a long string of games before the soton game as well.

1665~~~
He is definitely deteriorating by each game. Need to start with Valencia for a few games. The problem is that if Rojo is also out, we would then need to play Young as the other full back, which is far from ideal.

1666~~~
Sooo, tell me I wasn´t absolutely spot on on my criticism of Darmian. I´m not making this up just to "belittle Valencia´s replacement."

Let´s continue to evaluate his play once again. It´s only fair to measure with the same microscope that is on Valencia.

<b>At fault for goals</b> . . . . yep, add two more to that tally after that embarrassing display at the Emirates. That´s about 6 now, and we´ve barely begun the year.

<b>Another yellow card </b>. . . . yep, to save himself from being skinned again he resorts to clumsy fouls ending in dangerous free kicks. How many yellow cards already? 4? 5? Same thing over and over. Careless fouls to make up for shite defending.

<b>Zero chemistry with Mata</b> . . . once again mata turned to shit as they have no understanding. Mata looked better when Tony came on, and seems to be one of our best players with Valencia behind him making runs and giving him width.

<b>Replaced at halftime for being shite</b> . . . the second time now in 8 PL matches. In other words, he´s been so bad in 1/4 of our PL matches he´s needed to be replaced by Valencia who has shored things up. On what footballing planet is a defender considered good when he´s yanked up for being shite 25% of the time? And if you look at our two CL matches, he was absolute crap against PSV, allowing goals and all, so he´s been shite in 50% of our CL matches as well.

<b>Taking on a man</b> . . . . I don´t think I´ve ever seen him take on a man. Ever! This is a Man United fullback we´re talking about. Absolutely indefensible.

<b>Going forward, creating chances</b> . . . . I think he´s the worst offensive Manchester United fullback I´ve ever seen going forward. We can´t judge his crossing cause it´s such a rare occurrence, and they usually suck when it happens. As we´ve seen with the criticism of Valencia, completely unacceptable for a United fullback.
<b>
Defending against elite wingers</b> . . . raped by Sanchez, raped even by Tadic, probably the second best winger he faced. Pathetic.

I´ve also noticed that in the last two matches, not only were all the goals scored coming from Darmian´s side, but that both Wolsburgh and Arsenal were always attacking Darmian´s side. You would think with United playing two converted wingers as fullbacks, opposing sides would be attacking them. However, Wolfsburg was running through our left side like water through a sieve, and Arsenal attacked the right side when LVG moved the Italian over there with embarrassing results.

Totally agree with this. He isn´t even in the same league as a Luke Shaw.

1667~~~
Weren't you guys slagging off Evra in his first season too?  He came good in the end, as will Darmian.

1668~~~
I think we won't see consistency from Darmian until next season. It's a whole new level of intensity for him. We were exposed at Arsenal mostly because Van Gaal put 2 granddads in central mid instead of having the defensive energy of Scheiderlin in there and that gave Arsenal a free license to rip us apart......And Arsenal will rip you to pieces if you give them that opportunity......So the whole defense looked awful against Arsenal as wave after wave of attack came at us.......I think Darmian has showed that there is a wonderful defender in there to be developed but it all depends on whether he settles well into living in Manchester. If he settles long term then he will be great in big games starting from next season......But he has absolutely shown in some games that there is a lot to come from him if he can stay injury free and settle in Manchester

1669~~~
Other than the Southampton and Arsenal games, he has been very solid. Go back in this thread and see the glowing praise for him.

You're only as good as your last game is how it goes here though. Forget everything good he's done. He got butchered by Sanchez and Monreal because they doubled up on him and he hasn't figured out how to be two people at once. Sell him.

1670~~~
Can't believe all the hate Darmian's getting. You guys are crazy. The gulf in quality between him and Valencia is enormous.

1671~~~
The Caf becomes unbearable after a loss. Can't wait for the next game.

1672~~~
I know Darmian's had a few bad games but ill be shocked if hes not the best in the league in the next season or two... I think everyone's over reacting a touch in here. As we seen by his first 5 or so games he's your typical italian defender. The only place I forsee him lacking is in attack.

1673~~~
Seems more like that it´s become unbearable to some to shine the light on some very serious defending and attacking issues.

1674~~~
How many full backs in the league would do well 1 v 1 with Sanchez in a game as ridiculously stretched as it was due to our poor pressing and cover through the middle? 

It was daft not to have schneiderlin there to help the defence out.

1675~~~
Erm, Valencia for one, and he´s supposedly shite.

1676~~~
That's it. Let us cut our loses and get rid.

1677~~~
Valencia? Please tell me this is not based on the 2nd half. Is it?

1678~~~
Please tell me you watched the Arsenal matches last year, and actually noticed.

1679~~~
Such as the game where Valencia put the ball on a plate for Welbeck to knock us out of the FA Cup?

1680~~~
You mean the one where LVG said he was our best player? No.

The other matches where Valencia had Sanchez in his pocket.

1681~~~
What's with all the raping, pal? I'm genuinely concerned.

1682~~~
Me too. Hence the post.

1683~~~
The game they created as many chances as this year and couldn't finish leading to 3 undeserved points for us? I am far from someone that can remember individual performances that far Back Hut I'd be amazed if he kept Sanchez in his pocket while out entire defence was having their assets handed over to them.

1684~~~
What did Sanchez do in the game?

1685~~~
By all means, go back and have a good look. See what proper defending against Sanchez is all about. And then rewatch the first half of last week´s debacle. Compare and contrast. It won´t look pretty for the Italian. Luckily LVG saved him and United from further embarrassment by taking the poor lost lad off.

1686~~~
I'm not going to so i'l just ask you this. Valencia was having a stellar game while our defence was repeatedly being torn apart?

1687~~~
But our defence wasn´t being torn apart last year against L' Arse, so what´s the point? Mainly cause we had some proper fullback defending on Sanchez which made a massive difference. I do know though, that in the F.A. cup loss, LVG had rued that his best player in that match had made the unfortunate back pass.

1688~~~
A lot of that is bollox, which I can't be bothered to unpick in detail but let's focus on the last bit. Isn't "even" in the same league as Shaw. That implies being in the same league as Shaw is an unimpressive achievement. Shaw's form this season has been exceptional. Being "in that league" would be quite an achievement.

Re Darmian all I can say is that he's put in a number of unequivocally impressive performances in a United shirt. Anyone who ignores those to slate him as a poor player/signing is either terminally biased, blind or unbearably negative about <i>everything</i> like the other person whose post you quoted.

1689~~~
I am talking about the league game which we won while being clearly the worse side, not the FA cup match. Even in that game, LvG's comments about Valencia being the best player was mocked.

1690~~~
Terrible back pass aside, Valencia played well in that game. Something noted by Van Gaal in interviews afterwards. Unfortunately he was a victim of the standard redcafe trope where a single bad error is enough to ensure that it will be all that 80% of people on here can remember about the performance.

1691~~~
Talking about the league game Pogue, not the FA cup match.

1692~~~
Oops. My bad. Ironic that my feck up occurs in a post where I accuse other people of having bad memories <img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/>

1693~~~
Slating players and managers is a cool thing to do. It builds up your rep.

1694~~~
You can accuse me of having a bad memory about individual performances and be right every time. 

I am genuinely asking how it's possible for Valencia to have such a good game when I vividly remember our defence being piss poor that night.

1695~~~
Feel free to show how a lot of that post was bollox, or even a tiny bit of it. I think I was proved rather correct by my previous criticism of the Italian. Glowingly correct in fact

Could you address this as well. I just don´t get it either. Help me out here. An unequivocally impressive performance by a United fullback with zero attacking skills does not compute. I thought the 1970s were thankfully dead.

1696~~~
Basically, what Nobby is trying to say is that he doesn't like him because he is no Valencia.

1697~~~
This is what´s called <i>Valencia-is-shite-no-matter-what-happens</i> memory. It´s actually quite a common occurrence here.

1698~~~
That's just noodle being noodles. He can never see positives, in anything. Darmian has shown plenty of good attacking skills. Over-lapping runs and very good passing. No idea what you mean by the 1970s. I wasn't born then so can't comment. How about an easier era to remember. John O'Shea and Wes Brown at fullback. I guess they didn't have enough stepovers for you either?

1699~~~
I seriously think John o´Shea had as much or better attacking skills as Darmian. That´s how dire he is. And Wes Brown was far better. Go back and watch the 07/08 season.

1700~~~
K.

1701~~~
I remember being very upset with him at HT because was being dragged all over the place and they had a number of chances from his area. Well before the backpass. LvG's praise mystified me, what he did vs Sanchez was win a few headers and a sprint or two. Otherwise Sanchez was cutting inside with no resistance, and was opening up the space with simple runs too.

1702~~~
Knew it would be a problem when Shaw got injured that we wouldn't have enough attacking play from the full backs. Darmian singled out.

1703~~~
As someone who criticised Darmian in another thread pointing out in my view he was no full back, it's rather refreshing to see some support for my view in this thread.

Nobby style insofar as this is concerned talks a hell of a lot of sense.

1704~~~

It's all very well making a clever interception and scoring a great goal but what's he actually good at? The caf needs to know.

1709~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you don't think that it's easier to look better when you have cristiano ronaldo in front of you then juan mata? With sir alex ferguson as manager compared to Van gaal? Darmian has done well overall. Nothing spectacular, but his overall game is very good and just had an off day against sanchez and arsenal. It happens.

1710~~~
He's had some very good games and a couple of very bad games. Clearly the talent is there. People forget he's still adapting to a new league, country etc. Remember how long Evra took to adapt to English football. I say cut him some slack for now.

1711~~~
How about that Martial though? He isn't even in the same league as Messi. Our transfers are like bloody amateur hour here.

1712~~~
anyone using this kind of language to describe football isn't really worthy of any time

1713~~~
Yeah basically this. We could do with actually playing two CBs in the middle so he has more support from Smalling who always has to push to the left side of our defence.

1714~~~
Hope we got a couple of more matches with Azerbaijan! . . . Azer wuz whoo??? . . . Azer been Badin???

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i371.photobucket.com/albums/oo160/2008chode/Gifz/gladje4.gif" src="http://i371.photobucket.com/albums/oo160/2008chode/Gifz/gladje4.gif"/>

1715~~~
Darmian is a very good player, but ala Memphis I think the move to two matches a week for us has been a struggle this far.

1716~~~
An obvious dislike for Darmian as he displaced his favorite Valencia. I don't know why people grace it with a response. That post is so blindingly biased it makes no sense to even take note of it once you read the first couple of sentences.

1717~~~
Jesus Christ, arm chair and FM managers, give this lads time to settle before judging them. Everyone want 7-8 players signed every summer and they won't give the signings time.

1718~~~
After such a good start, it is perfectly reasonable to see him struggle now. It was easily predictable, the same will happen with Martial too.

1719~~~
He's just tired. He's taken a massive step up in intensity coming to the Premier League. In his first few games he was worn out before 90 and subbed, but since then he has been playing every minute of every game and its caught up to him.

He was one of our best players until recently and he will be again when he gets a rest. Everyone using Shaw as a stick to beat him must be forgetting the goals we conceded because Shaw was getting caught out of position and leaving his flank wide open.

1720~~~
Geography really isn't one of your strengths is it? We will put that in the pile with 'talking sense' and 'football knowledge'.

P.S. looking forward to reading some more of your Valencia fan fiction.

1721~~~
Let me know when Darmian goes into Buenos Aires and comes out man of the match, instead of showing up less-than-League 2 laughable defending.

Watch this impressive, lightning quick display of defending against the big bad Azerbajian attack. Impressive.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8MMsmTAnig?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1722~~~
Could you find me a video of him standing 5 yards behind the rest of the back 4? Or behinds one of him playing a woefully short back 'pass' to their centre forward. I'd really appreciate a collaborative video of all his crosses that hit the first defender as well please.

1723~~~
Dude, I don´t think you want to see that video of Valencia "¿5 yards? behind the rest of the back 4." You know why? Cause it will also clearly demonstrate your boy Darmian playing the Wolfsburg striker onside as well, making my point about his poor defending, and thus making Valencia completely irrelevant. Valencia could've been having a pint at the Bishop Blaize at that moment for all it would´ve mattered. Not to excuse Tony though, very poor defending by the both of them.

I wonder if Matteo gave Valencia thanks for saving him from being the real goat.

1724~~~
I have barely seen you post in any other threads bar this one. Do you log in just to big Valencia up and criticise Darmian?

1725~~~
Why does it bother you so much that poor Matteo is being put under the same microscope that Valencia has to obsessively endure??? Let´s be fair. And don´t worry about my posting habits, it´s really no worry for you. Let me defend mi compañero suramericano. He´s one of my favs and he´s overcome tremendous odds to achieve what he has, and is nearly the longest serving present footballer on this great club. Respect.

1726~~~
Didn't realise Valencia had a new spouse ?

1727~~~
That´s a real knee slapper! Ho ho.

1728~~~
My last response to you should have told you how much I "bother" about this. The only reason I asked you what I did is because whenever this thread is bumped, I see your posts here yet I don't remember seeing you in any other thread. I might be mistaken ofcourse. 

Regarding your last bit, if Valencia is one of your favourites and you respect him etc, why are you in the Darmian thread slagging him off instead of posting in the Valencia thread posting about Valencia?

1729~~~
Read what I´m saying, I´m simply putting Darmian under the same watchful critical eye. This is a thread about commentary on Darmian´s football. Fair criticism should be welcome, and I don´t think any of it has really been unfair. Does it bother you those who continuously slag off Young and Fella and Tony?

1730~~~
I don't think an unknown person's opinion about a footballer could ever bother me so I'd have to say No to your question. 

As I said in my first post, your criticism of Darmian doesn't bother me at all, why should it? The only thing I said was that for someone so active in this thread, I don't seem to recall you posting anywhere else which is a tad odd. You then proceeded to tell me it's because you love Valencia, respect him etc which makes it even weirder considering you should be in the Valencia thread then especially as your man got MOTM vs Argentina. Yet here you are bashing Darmian instead.

1731~~~
Just sounds like a lot of bitter butthurt posters just cause their new boytoi is being exposed by someone definitely not on his wanky bandwagon. Deal with it, and stop the condescending crap, daddy.

1732~~~
You take your opinion way too seriously. You are just a nobody on the internet and you posting all this does NOT (newsflash) affect people the way you think it does. I already pointed out to you that the only reason I quoted you was because of where you seem to spend all your time on the Caf and had nothing to do do with what you post on the subject.

You might think Darmian is the new cafu or you might think he's the next abel xavier, who gives a shit man?

Regarding the bit in quotes, I have no idea what that is or where it is from. Certainly not something I have posted.

Edit: I am not being condescending btw, it's just odd to see a United fan post only in the Darmian thread especially when the reason behind this according to him is his love/respect for Valencia. I do get it now though, bashing Darmian makes you feel better about Valencia. Carry on. Won't be quoting you again.

1733~~~
Scoring against your mother country... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1734~~~
Oh my god, you´re not going to quote me again? I´m disappointed. Are you some kind of management here, or voice of The Cafe? WTF?

1735~~~
You see that there is the difference, a marginal mistake doesn't compare to a massive one, one is a slight miscalculation, the other is evidence of a complete lack of understanding of how to play the position.

How come you didn't mention the backpass in your post?

Jesus I'm suprised Varun could continue to be so level headed conversing with you, he's actually a very respected poster who's opinion people value and generally are able to have a conflicting opinion without resorting to childish name calls. 'Bitter butthurt'? Seriously?

1736~~~
Sorry to go on about Valencia, but I suppose I should address the post.

Has Valencia made loads of these offside positional mistakes? If so, I was´t aware of them. Feel free to post some specific examples, and not just the typical baseless generalizations. Wouldn´t you suppose he has a very good understanding of how to play the position, considering he is still here, playing for one of the elite clubs in the world, and Rafa was flogged off, and LVG has brought him in more than once when Darmian was too shite to continue, and he responded adequately. Seems like he probably understands very well, has the gaffer´s confidence, and likely still learning a thing or two being that he´s fairly new at fullback.

And yes, if it makes you feel better, the backpass was a horrible mistake. Valencia, like everyone else, is prone to a few.

1737~~~
Someone should create a Valencia vs Darmian thread to prevent this one getting clogged up by Valencia's agent.

1738~~~
Way to piss on your own point. Lets use your logic shall we?

Wouldn´t you suppose Darmian is much the better player, considering he is here, playing for one of the elite clubs in the world, while Valencia has been demoted to back up, as LVG has brought him in to replace Tony in the starting line up because Valencia was too shit to continue?

1739~~~
Can we please stop talking about Valencia, dude. 

I'm actually still comfortable with Darmian starting, however not impressed I may be. Will be interesting to see what happens when Shaw is back. A lot will have passed by then.

1740~~~
You could argue he was brought in as a much needed squad fullback as Rafael leaves and Blind moves to CB. He was given a chance to make the spot his own but hasn't really done so just yet and has been pushed out of favour recently after some poor performances.

1741~~~
Who brings in a squad fullback and then starts him in every match to give him a chance? How has he been push out of favour as well when he has started every match other than the league cup? He was taken off early twice but Valencia was taken off early once too, there is nothing to suggest he has been pushed out of favour.

1742~~~
Except that hasn't happened has it? Who has LVG favoured over him?

1743~~~
Well, two of his last three PL performances have been a disaster with him coming off at halftime. That´s a bit of a suggestion. A mare against Everton could prove the tipping point. Who would he be possibly up against on Everton´s wings?

1744~~~
Meanwhile Telegraph puts him in the dream team for Euros 2016 as one of the best options at RB.

1745~~~
I understand the criticisms but we have a collective problem, our fullbacks are too often in situations when they have to cover the outside and inside channel at the same time, Shaw had the same problem, Darmian had that problem early in the season but did very well and he is now struggling badly. To me the reason for that is that our CBs are too narrow (like for Walcott's goal last season), they cover a very little area and the fullbacks have a lot of room to cover between their CB and the touchline.
At the moment our defensive organization is bad, the wingers need to put a shift and the CMs need to provide better shielding which will allow the CBs to occupy more space. The 4-3-3 with Carrick deep could be an instant solution.

1746~~~

1747~~~
No one has said he can't defend... everyone has bad games, but he is a very good defender. He can't attack though.

1748~~~
Thats bs, its actually a very big part of his game

1749~~~
No it isn't. 90% of the time his crosses come to nothing.

1750~~~
I wasn't talking about 2 months of his career at United. He is a good attacking fullback.
Do you think Depay is not a good attacker also due to 2 months?

1751~~~

13% successful crosses for Torino last season...
1 assist

Attacking clearly isn't his forte.

1752~~~
He comes forward very well, creating pressure, although with those stats, his final ball clearly could be better

1753~~~
Try watching a player...

1754~~~
I have but me saying I've watched the player without producing any evidence is a pretty shit argument.

1755~~~
Not yet for United...

This is not the end of the world though as even Shaw was poor going forward in the first half of the last season and he improved gradually. Could be a feature of LVG 's coaching - maybe he wants them to master the defending first in our system and then build upon it. But there is no excuse for the poor crosses and poor throw ins he has shown till now. Got to improve from them.

1756~~~
I agree, but hes been here 2 months. Look at Depay

1757~~~
A good, solid, quiet day for him after the horror show at the Emirates.

1758~~~
Agree with <a class="username" data-user="54684, @Scrumpet" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/54684/">@Scrumpet</a>. Was under the radar today but tracked his runners well and defended well. Provided a couple of good overlaps going forward in the first half too.

1759~~~
Probably the least eye-catching of all our players today, but still a solid no-nonsense 7/10 performance.

1760~~~
I think its fair to say that he enjoyed a honeymoon for a while there. He's new to the league and the up and down nature of the EPL will get to him from to time to time.

1761~~~
Solid today

1762~~~
Yeah, solid performance. They got no joy at  all from his flank.

1763~~~
Did his part in keeping the strong back 4 shape, needs to offer more in the attack though.

1764~~~
It's great when he shuts down that flank.

1765~~~
Did put in a couple of great crosses today though.

1766~~~
Good to see him bounce back well.

1767~~~
Back to early season Darmian. Great to see.

1768~~~
Solid today. Nothing fancy. Still needs to massively improve on his crossing. At least Valencia fizzes his crosses with some hope that it might deflect into the goal but his crosses are really poor.

1769~~~
Decent performance today, nothing special. His crossing needs work, otherwise we're going to be playing another man short in attack on the right flank when Mata is already usually drifting.

1770~~~
He put in a great cross that went right through the opposition's box.

1771~~~
Yeah, I thought Rooney was a tad hesitant otherwise it could have been on a plate.

1772~~~
Actually looked good going forward in the first half. Made a fantastic pass to Rooney as well. Good to see. In the second half he disappeared once again. Decent performance against a toothless Everton who gave him loads of space. Shouldn´t be lost however that a replacement Rojo did twice in four minutes what Darmian hasn´t been able to accomplish in a United shirt. City will be a massive test.

1773~~~
Started well the season, now he lost the plot

1774~~~
I'd imagine he'll be behind Valencia in the pecking order after Valencia just b*tched De Bruyne.

1775~~~
Rojo did that, Valencia was only up against KDB after the Navas sub when Sterling came off. Sterling had a very bad game though so credit to Valencia there.

1776~~~
My bad, meant Sterling.

1777~~~
Tony is injured. So he will have more opportunities.

1778~~~
Good to have two competent right backs , they will push each other and neither are foolproof...it would be nice to have this sort of competition for a variety of positions.

1779~~~
As well as Valencia played yesterday, he always has many more games where he is dross against far worse players.

Darmian had started the season fantastically well, faded a bit in the last couple of games but he will be back to his best whilst he continues to settle.

1780~~~
Drop him when he(Valencia) struggles..But he kept out a decent rb last season, he'll be up for the challenge this year too.

1781~~~
Looks short of confidence at the moment after a very strong start. The loss of Shaw has definitely had a big effect on Darmian. Looks like a headless chicken

1782~~~
Was shite when he came on. He's a tidy player in possession but his deficiencies when going forward are badly exposed when we need to chase a game.

1783~~~
He had a great game just last week.

1784~~~
I don't think he had enough time for a warm-up mate.

1785~~~
how come?

1786~~~
You could see the diffrence in quality between Darmian and Shaw and Shaw is 5 years younger. Darmian is a decent option as a back up for both LB and RB spots but we should buy some proper rightback of Manchester United quality. Not sure where to find such player. Hopefully there is some Martial of RB's out there..

1787~~~
I'm not sure I'd completely write off Darmian as a potential long-term starter at RB. He's been struggling a bit recently, but he made an excellent start to the season and looked like a really good find. I think it'll be a lot easier for us to judge his potential long-term role at the club come the end of the season.

1788~~~
This would actually be my biggest concern with him. Struggles with the basic first touches/passes IMO. Solid defender though

1789~~~
I'm not writting him off just yet but I don't see a world clas potential in him. Just because we had Rafael injured all the time recently and Valencia played there while we've seen some rotation of Smalling and Jones over the years there, doesn't mean Darmian is the answer. I'm not as excited as others but still not writting him off. I thin he can be some sort of Monreal for us with slower start and become reliable option on his side of defence but for every Monreal/Darmian there is a Belelrin/Shaw who are level above... the question is whether there is a player like this out somewhere but I believe so.. the likes of Galloways/Gomez's came "out of nowhere"..

And last thin, Rojo had a great game last night but he is not a long term option. In ideal world I would have it covered by Darmian while having another full back of great quality on the right. I wouldn't necesarilly go for leftback as Shaw is good enough to bench anybody but some proper fight between Darmian and the new face would be nice to see. Valencia's been good servant to the club but I hink he's the next one who will be transfer listed..

1790~~~
I wouldn't read too much into a 10 minute cameo, especially, given how good he has been in most games this season. He's been very solid in defense, not great in attack, however, attacks from our right side seem to be very rare these days with Mata coming inside on most occasions meaning the full back is normally isolated. He doesn't have Valencia's pace so he's not really going to beat his man with pace and power.

1791~~~
What did he do wrong yesterday 
I was nervous that coming on so late and immediately facing KdB, there would some damage down that side, but nothing happened, at all. And there was one misplaced/misread pass to Rooney. 
And people are writing him off?????

1792~~~
Yesterday he played few mins, but he looked like nervous with a really bad positioning

The difference between him and Valencia is evident (in this moment).

1793~~~
Thought he was fine yesterday. Not easy to come into a game like that for the last 10 minutes.

1794~~~
Erm, he wasn't ''shite'' yesterday. He played 10 minutes and misplaced one pass. Other than that, nothing happened.

He hasn't shown much in his attacking play so far for us, but he's already shown that he's capable of making an attacking impact with his displays for Italy and Torino. I'm sure it'll come once he fully settles into the team. He should work on his crossing though.

Valencia was great in the second half against CSKA and against City so he deserves his starting spot at the moment, but Darmian was good against Everton after a couple of bad performances and with his early season form in mind, I think that he's been good for us so far. People should remember that he's still getting used to the league, so some bad performances here and there don't make him a bad player. Writing him off is extremely knee-jerk.

I also don't understand the extremeness in some of the posts on the caf. I have noticed it in many other threads as well, but it still boggles the mind. When a player is playing good, he's fecking brilliant, but when he plays badly in the next game all if forgotten, he's shite, should have signed someone else instead and/or doesn't have a future in the starting eleven. 

There was also some rival fan on here than called Darmian a ''poor footballer''. It's fecking ridiculous.

1795~~~
The Caf is so much Jesus or Judas..  
He started well,  fade a bit then had a great game vs Everton..  There is no Jesus or Judas here.. Very good signing.

1796~~~
How was he shite yesterday? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1797~~~
DDG
Darmian Smalling Rojo Shaw

Blind, Jones, Valencia as backup... Looking world class to me

1798~~~
Another shocking performance... I don't really read into this onsense , fullback should know how to defend first and as long as he's good defender he's good enough for us. He's absolutely useless going forward, he's got touch and dribbling of Rooney let alone his passing which is off as well. Let's hope we scout someone and are ready to bring into the team as Rojo/Darmian/Valencia as fullbacks is bloody average for a club like ours..

1799~~~
Valencia gives more than him attacking wise.

Whatever happened to the Darmian vs England at the world cup in attacking ?

1800~~~
He's not a threat going forward.

Too often under pressure, he just lumps the ball forward too.

1801~~~
His positioning when we attack is shocking sometimes. Lingard is cutting in with the ball, turns around to see the whole flank absolutely empty and Darmian on line with our CBs. Ah...

1802~~~
Shockingly bad at the moment... seems a world away from the player he was when he first joined us. Just what seems to be the issue here.

1803~~~
Nothing wrong with his defensive game. Not shockingly bad by any means.

1804~~~
Not today.

1805~~~
Hasn't done much wrong.

1806~~~
Obviously. At the moment implies the match that's currently being played. Having a go at him for this match is just poor form.

1807~~~
I only got home at minute 50, so I assume Darmian must have stunk the place up in the first half to be called "shockingly bad"? He's been alright since I've watched.

Then I read about his poor attacking/delivery, which id agree with - he's been poor in the attacking third for a while now, but this is when he overhit a cross to the back post, seconds after putting a good ball in to Fellaini, who's first touch was shit.

1808~~~
He created a few of our better half chances on the overlap and defended solidly. Hasn't stood out as bad tonight by any means.

1809~~~
Headless chicken at times tonight.

1810~~~
He was alright, just desperately needs to work on his attacking.

1811~~~
He makes Smalling look like a good technical footballer...and his defending hasn't been all that.

Must do better.

1812~~~
What happened to him?

1813~~~
People built him up because his name wasn't Valencia. Hopefully he improves because he looked decent enough the first couple of weeks but at the moment Valencia is first choice if fit.

1814~~~
he has been pretty bad this half. could have gave away at least 2 goals in the first 10 minutes alone.

1815~~~
Poor from him that half

1816~~~
Generally not been very good since his first month. Hopefully it's just form and he'll pick up again.

1817~~~
It's really worrying that Valencia is again our best right back option by a mile even though we bought new fullback over the summer.

1818~~~
He is used to the wingback position in a league were flanks aren't used the way they do in the EPL. It will take time for him to adapt

1819~~~
Goes to show Valencia is no where near as bad as people make out he is.

1820~~~
Terrible today. 

Can he actually attack? We can't play a fullback that can't actually do anything in the attack.

1821~~~
What happened to him? He was unbeatable when he first signed.

1822~~~
Terrible today, despite Rooney getting the lowest rating overall I think Darmian was clearly our poorest performer, in the last two games his defensive composure seems to have gone walkabout.

1823~~~
I've been defending him a lot, but he was terrible today. Although, we haven't been very solid at the back for a while.

1824~~~
going for a record for yellow cards by the look of it.

1825~~~
A Manchester United right back has to be good at attacking. Darmian is not. He just doesn't overlap. Why?

And now defensively he is getting worse. He's currently pointless. 

At least Valencia doesn't get destroyed by pace and despite hitting shins he gets us on the front foot.

I hope Darmian improves because that's a month if dogshit from him.

1826~~~
Valencia would have been better suited to handling Zaha's threat. Shame he was unavailable.

1827~~~
I don't particularly like Valencia at RB but he should be getting the nod if fit at the moment. A few too many bad days for Darmian recently and if he isn't offering defensive stability then he really isn't bringing anything to the mix.

1828~~~
Very disappointing after the initial promise. The defensive tenacity he showed in the earlier fixtures has completely disappeared; never did much in attack even then. Seems to suffer against pacey attackers. Both Sanchez and Zaha had him seeing starts. Hope it's just teething problems in a new league.

1829~~~
Wouldn't be the first player to find himself somewhat out of his depth during his first season in the PL. Could do with finding a way to make an attacking contribution because his defending doesn't appear as amazing as it had appeared.

5 yellow cards in PL so I imagine he'll be suspended next weekend.

1830~~~
Starting to worry about this guy and wonder how far down the pecking list he was for a RB. His knack for picking up cards is a worrying one, think LVG did him a big favour taking him off before he got a second yellow.

Valencia should be starting when fit. As much as people complain about Valencia's attacking contribution he offers far more than Darmian who i've yet to see do something decent in attack.

1831~~~
Seems to be getting worse. Very disappointed because prior to his move and even in his month he was being raved about as one of the best RB in Europe.

1832~~~
Nailed it.

But for the crossing and occasional defensive brainfart, Valencia has a positive impact on asserting our own attack and getting us on the front foot.

1833~~~
How can you look so ridicilously solid in the first few games and then regress this drastically? Still feel he's a good RB though.

1834~~~
Still remember having some doubts about him here after pre-season and was shot down.Ridiculous how he has regressed defensively in the last few matches though.

1835~~~
Bolasie killed him for pace and he couldn't handle his trickery. Totally killed him

1836~~~
We had a couple of posters calling him the best right back in the world a few weeks ago

Seriously that happened

Going to be honest I'd prefer Valencia at right back

1837~~~
That was from the other day mate. He was shite today. He's been pretty poor since the first month in my opinion with a few okay performances and a number of mediocre ones.

1838~~~
Lost all his composure since Luke Shaw got his injury. Seems hesitant in every thing he does now. I don't understand the link, but he needs to get himself back on track fast.

1839~~~
With Darmian, one must keep certain things in perspective. He is barely 10 games into a new league (one that is physically intensive), and is probably low on confidence. He has to adjust to the physical demands, a grueling schedule, the magnitude of the club (keep in mind that Italian players are treated like trash by their parent clubs), not least to the country and all the off-field stuff. Plus, he played as a wing-back at Torino, so it's a positional change coming to a league where teams generally employ a fullback + winger. He will come good, there's a reason why both Barcelona, and Bayern Munich were in for him, apart from United, and why Juventus fans were pissed the club never approached him. He was the best wing-back is Serie A for consecutive season - the record speaks for itself, hence him being rated highly at the start of the season to go with a solid start. A fully adjusted Darmian would far outstrip anything Valencia can or has produced at rightback. He just needs time, and patience, like all imports do.

1840~~~
I agree

1841~~~
Considering how Clyne is playing maybe we should have gone for him. Will obviously stick with Darmian and hope he can turn it around though. A shame his form has dropped away so much.

1842~~~
How many goals have we conceded from our right side with him in the team? I think you're quickly forgetting the amount of times he is in the right place at the right time to cover for our CBs. He's just a bit tired or as van Gaal said about our players, in the red zone in terms of fitness.

1843~~~
He's very sloppy and its hard to make a case for him on current form being a better choice than Valencia... Which is extremely worrying because the bar is pretty low

1844~~~
considering how very little he charges forward, he's not even good that defensively... a fullback who stays back and doesn't need to chase back should be the best defender in the league which Darmian obviously isn't... Hate to say I told you so but he's squad palyer at best, hoping for him to turn out to be our Monreal but meanwhile we need a new RB..

just watch how Galloway, Gomez from Liverpool emerged on the scene. Surely there are some good options out there over the three best English leagues or anywhere in the world. Now it's time for scouts. We don't need to bring in a world class star or a senior figure, we need tenacity with potential. Someone like Bellerín.. or actually give a chance to underrated Varela

1845~~~
He's been great going forwards for Italy and he was perceived as an attacking fullback at his previous club, right? Has he been philosophised?

1846~~~
Jesus Christ, the tide turns so quickly these days.

He's a young-ish player adapting to a new league, of course he is going to have a few teething problems.

I think we've seen enough from him to be confident we've got a good defender on our hands.

1847~~~
More likely that he's just adapting to a new club.

1848~~~
I just don't get it, he stated the league on fire, winning every tackle and 1on1s. He's been worse than Valencia in terms of defending the past month.

1849~~~
No, not really. 

I am the last one to defend van Gaal and I think few other players have been "philosophised", but Darmian never really looked great going forward for me, and he definitely looks like player who would struggle technically playing for any team when he is under pressure. His passing is average, and he panics too much when under pressure, his technique is really average. Two or three times yesterday he gave the ball away in first 15 minutes due to poor technique/passing/first touch.

1850~~~
Hopefully he'll come good but one thing I noticed from his pre United videos was a lack of mobility,  something I brought up before he signed.  Yet his initial performances blew any such concerns I had away.. seems so strange how his form has just dropped. 

Clyne is a beast for Liverpool,  we will hopefully not regret missing out on him but he looks a proper player better than Coleman for sure.

1851~~~
Not seen  much of  him so have no view on how good/bad he is but some people  seemed to  overreact  to his early promise.
Trouble  with  that is the disappointment is greater  when a player's form takes a dip. 
Think some just need to take a step back and give him a bit longer.

1852~~~
Great player but confidence is shot. As LVG cranks up the pressure, some players just don't respond well to it and that's him IMO.

1853~~~
I think going forward the biggest problem is that there's no one on the flank ahead of him actually helping out. Valencia has freakish strength and pace that it doesn't matter but Darmian doesn't. Whenever he finds any space it's normally the space Mata has vacated and he finds himself with a man to beat and no one close to him. Mata's support running is also awful whenever he's actually out on the flank, he just doesn't attempt to make space wide by overlapping he just looks to drift inside. This is where Valencia is invaluable for his ability to breeze part people in the middle third and basically end up in positions where we could do with a decent player with end product. Darmian has dropped a level defensively but I think the caf is over playing this post Arsenal. He's still a much better defender than Valencia in my eyes.

1854~~~
Have to say I am concerned that he might not be good enough on the ball and not quick/strong enough to be a top full back in this league. Its not just going forward that he struggles with but in possession in our half he also looks panicky and gives the ball away. Still early days but I am hoping Valencia is fit for the next game

1855~~~
In a team playing better we could probably not be too concerned I Darmian simply stayed back and was solid in defence. Unfortunately we're in dire need of Valencia out there because despite what people think of him as an individual he is a very good team player and makes the job easier for Mata. We'll be a better team with Valencia in there.

1856~~~
Precisely. His excellent form at the beginning of the season has probably exacerbated the situation. It's a shame that people are writing him, and a number of others, off three months into the season.

1857~~~
He's come into form more recently but he started pretty poorly, several times he's nearly cost them by making a mistake. I personally wouldn't swap him especially when darmian regains his first months form.

1858~~~
I personally would. . Clyne is fantastic going forwards. He practically runs that right flank by himself,  very good on the ball and fantastic recovery pace.. decent positioning too.. not great but solid. Darmian will hopefully recover his form but even then.. going forwards he doesn't have the same influence as Clyne.

1859~~~
That's the problem though he relies on his physical attributes too much. He's basically a slower weaker Valencia with more technique. He goes sleepy especially on cross field passes, a little like Rafael used too.

1860~~~
Nothing wrong with relying on physical attributes,  Dani Alves without pace would be shite.. his physical ability enhances his impact as a player.  Darmian might be the more intelligent player but unless he can't demonstrate the ability to handle the physical nature of the league and keep up with the faster wingers he'll not make it. I think he does have the pace as he showed in the first few games,  its the general fitness which is an issue .. he needs to be able to play at a high physical level consistently.  That should come with time.

1861~~~
Suspended for the West Brom game

1862~~~
Bit of a yellow card magnet isn't he?

1863~~~
He's actually a wing back ie hes used to defend less. It will take him time to adapt in a flat 4 defence

1864~~~
Not a good excuse at all. He's frequently played in a back four for Italy and his offensive play has been far, far worse than his defensive play. Except the one time he played left back, oddly enough. His best trait is his positional play and sensing danger - it's only his 1 on 1 defending that needs refinement, for me.

1865~~~
I'm not interested in excuses. If he keeps playing shit than he should be shown the door. All I'm saying is that he's used to a different formation to the one we use. Also there's not many wingers in the serie a

1866~~~
He should be playing like a wingback for us, though. Like Valencia does. Rojo plays like a hybrid between a third centre back and a left back in the same way Brown did on the opposite side in 2008. That's what gave Evra the licence to motor forward constantly. Darmian has the same responsibility and he fails to do what's asked of an attacking wingback. So I don't see how tactics has anything to do with it.

1867~~~
I think people writing him off are doing way too soon. Now I'm not trying to say he's been great recently because he's looked ropey for sure. I reckon it's just a confidence thing, he looked very solid to begin with. I'd back him to get back to form. He's still adapting right now and definitely has the potential to get better. I don't see any room for Valencia to get better in that position.

1868~~~
Yeah, pretty much this. I don't understand opinions, sometimes. A hefty amount of people feel that van Gaal needs more time to embed his philosophy into the team, yet aren't willing to give his players that same leniency.

1869~~~
Nope.

1870~~~
Started very strong, but has started to wobble. But the good we have seen from him is enough to convince me that he is a good player suffering a bit of a dip. In the first few games, he looked unbeatable. Pretty much nobody got past him with the ball. Looked solid in one on one situations. Good in the air too. In those opening games, the general consensus was essentially "what a difference a proper right back makes", and he did make a difference from the off. There was a collective hard-on for him around here. 

He starts to wobble, which coincides from the whole team underperforming, and he's shit all of a sudden.

We sure do ride the form rollercoaster here, eh? You're either Paolo Maldini incarnate, or you're not fit to lace the boots of William Prunier. Zero middle ground.

1871~~~
Not everyone has been on this rollercoaster. There are those of us who thought we was bang average from the beginning regardless of the group think bandwagon. Imagine bigging up a Manchester United fullback with no attacking ability? Madness!

Anyway, this checklist is becoming more and more familiar and depressing.

<b>Yanked off early for being shite</b> . . . check! Imagine having to bring on Ashley Young as a <i>defensive </i>necessity?? Just how shite are you? Credit to Ashley though, he seemed to handle Zaha without much problem and actually gave us something offensive.

<b>Put a decent wing against him and he´s a disaster</b> . . . check! You could almost see Super Alan licking his chops for the second half to set loose Zaha against Darmian.

<b>Yellow card (and suspension) to make up for shite defending</b> . . . check! Again he resorts to embarrassing fouls to save himself being skinned again, getting yet another yellow. That one on Zaha just outside the box (not the yellow) was the stuff off league 1 football. The suspension may be a positive thing at least.

<b>Nothing offensively</b> . . . check! I would´ve graded him less than zero for his attacking contribution. It´s Palace for fecks sake, get yourself up there, old bean!

<b>Zero understanding with Mata</b> <b>or Herrera</b> . . . check! Funny how Mata becomes like our best player with Valencia behind him. I wonder why? And who´s forgotten those interesting triangles with Valencia and Mata and Herrera we started seeing last year? This is almost argument enough for Valencia being above him.

<b>Adding to his tally of goals allowed</b> . . . ok, they didn´t score off him this time. We´ll give him that. But not for lack of trying. He almost gifted them like three goals in the first ten minutes, and if LVG hadn´t yanked him off, it was only a matter of time before Zaha would´ve either scored or set something up. It was getting downright embarrassing. Shame we can´t play Sunderland every week, and get the best out of this guy.

Or is the poor lad just being "philosophized" by that evil LVG? Jesus! Get well soon, Tony. Please! Darmian may well be our future at right back, but that future is defo not now. He´s been absolutely awful.

1872~~~
He really hasn't been "absolutely awful". Look at the threadmarks. Barely anything resembling a bad word said about him up until the Arsenal game. Quotes from LvG praising him as the best signing, column inches from pundits praising how good he has been. He made a number of the Soccer Saturday bunch's Team of the Season so far a few weeks back.

He's been fine, often very good, but he's had 2 or 3 poor games.

1873~~~
He has done very well. People don't seem to take into account that he is new to the league. He'll be flying for next season.

1874~~~
He is in a new country,league,team...its called adaptation,ah forget it,sell him in January.

1875~~~
Leave Matteo Alone!

1876~~~
He was absolutely horrible against Palace. Nowhere to be seen in the tricky situations. fecked the ball around on the pitch and could hardly control it himself. What the hell is happening when all the guys in the team is suddenly starting to lobb the ball to each other all of a sudden??? just what the feck?

Darmian, I forgive you for this one bad game. Please try to be a bit quicker next time will ya.

1877~~~
Do you bother reading threads or watching matches? Read (or watch the match) about him vs PSV and at fault for both goals. What about Southampton where he was so wank and was being skinned so badly by Tadic (Tadic!!!) that LVG yanked him off at halftime and resolved that issue. This has been going on for a while. And thank god Valencia was available for City and Sterling! Can you imagine?

1878~~~
Tadic is a good player.

1879~~~
Yeah, you´re right. That´s true, but Man United should be able to field a right back to hold his own against him.

1880~~~
Nobby styles' painfully see-through agenda is pretty embarrassing. It's like he's absorbed all of that equally embarrassing Valencia abuse and channeled it all into one bizarre attack on Darmian.

1881~~~
Yeah but Darmian was taken off at half time, I think you missed that part.

1882~~~
Painfully see-through agenda (ha ha, good one) . . . you mean he hasn´t been taken off for being shite in about 30% of his PL matches? You mean he really is good offensively and works well with Mata and Herrera or Young? You mean he hasn´t been directly at fault on like 5 or 6 goals this young year already? You mean he hasn´t been yellow carded already 5 times? You mean he hasn´t been constantly skinned and removed by decent wingers? You mean he did a good job on that dangerous Sterling . . . my god, it must be all that Valencia abuse, doctor. What was I thinking?

1883~~~
No I don't mean any of that. Your reaction underlines my point quite well to be honest. If you could take a step back you'd be able to notice that you're not the only one criticising him. I did exactly that today and I agree - his attacking play's been crap. It was good in that one game he played at left back though.

1884~~~
Started really well and looked a top class signing. Was quite bizarrely taken off at half time vs Southampton, which followed the PSV mistake and his confidence dipped. He hasn't looked as assured since.

Unfortunately, he's not the first and won't be the last player who gets the LVG master class in man management.

Hopefully he will rebuild his confidence and come back stronger.

1885~~~
Valencia should start over him right now.

Darmian's poor play going forward has been a problem. Especially because he has more freedom than Rojo to go forward.

1886~~~
In his defense he's probably never faced pace like Zaha or Sanchez in his career. I could be wrong though.

1887~~~
"....., said no one ever.

1888~~~
I've seen people say it.

I say it as one of Valencia's harshest critics too. Darmian has been poor lately imo. A rest will benefit him and the team.

1889~~~
I like Tony but he won't be able to offer what Darmian does defensively. He may be apporpriate in certain one off situations when we are dealing with particularly pacy wingers, but in most cases, Darmian is comfortably better.

1890~~~
Valencia has a good understanding with Mata and Herrera. I'd still rather Darmian play though, despite his recent struggles.

1891~~~
Are you serious, he made Tadic look like Ronaldo <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

He is a great player but he has just hit some bad form recently, but he will improve.

1892~~~
He certainly has. Sanchez played for Udinese...

1893~~~
He's in a bad patch of form at the moment, his positioning at times isn't very good. Give him time it is only his first season adapting to a new country and a new league. First month of the season he was possibly our best player.

1894~~~
He was excellent when he first signed, and has been very good for Italy for a little while now, (seem to remember him tearing England anew one at the very least). I think it's just a patch of form, maybe confidence or carrying a little niggle? you dont suddenly become aweful forever.

1895~~~
Torres?

1896~~~
Please dont say that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1897~~~
He's a good full back, better defensively than going forward, but he lacks pace, and it's normal that when he comes up against quick, tricky wingers, he'll struggle a bit. Don't think it makes it any easier having Mata ahead him, though. 

Although Valencia is injured, we have two good full backs who offer us something different.

1898~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Your football posts are catching up to your posts on politics and parenting.

1899~~~
The content, format, and aggression level of your posts are all equally horrible.

1900~~~
He showed enough early to make me think he's s good player in appalling form. But he does need help. Get Mata into the middle.

1901~~~
This is why I am glad we have both him and Valencia in the side. Both will have difficult times during the season, but we can rotate them throughout the season. 

Darmian is struggling at present, but he'll adapt. What he needs now is a bit of a rest.

1902~~~
He went through a honeymoon at the start of the season with everyone still getting into their stride. He's in it now alright. I'm pretty sure he's never come up against such offensively aggressive wide men playing consistently at a high intensity. How good he is will determine how well he adapts.

1903~~~
I don't think it has anything to do with form at all. As some previous poster has said, rightly so people were hyping him up because he was not Valencia and for once we had a right back who could defend.

Fast forward to today, people have realized that a man utd right back also needs to attack and Darmian currently does not possess such a trait.

So I wouldn't put his latest performances down to form but rather he is probably trying to adapt to what is required of him at the club. When your mind is confused then you will be far from your best. 

So he has joined Rooney in the confused club <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, not to worry he will adapt at some point.

1904~~~
Likely true.
Go back another year and people were doing the same for Blind. He wasn't Cleverley and we'd all felt starved of a good midfielder, so people (in my opinion) got carried away by him doing simple things and showing a degree of competence. People were claiming he was better than Carrick and things like that.

And then what happens is people who criticize them in the midst of all of the initial praise are told they have agendas.
And then once the player's level drops, people start claiming that anyone criticizing them is being knee-jerk. When actually people were being knee-jerk in throwing praise at them in the first place.

Best to just see how things go with Darmian. It's possible that this current level is closer to his usual. Or it's possible that his initial level is closer to his usual. And then it's arguable whether, even at his best, his attacking game is good enough.

1905~~~
Your point, to be quite honest, was some lazy bollocks about a poorly worded "painfully see through agenda" in a way to discredit the criticism of Darmian instead of directly addressing what I said. Agendas aside or whatever you´re into, does not take away how really poor Darmian has become. Even you admit his attacking play is crap (some sort of agenda?), yet LVG has had to take him off early in 3 of his last 5 PL matches for being absolute shite, <b>and it has nothing to do with crap attacking ability. It´s his defensive play that has been horrible,</b> yet somehow there are those who still think he´s fantastic defensively. This has been going on for quite a while, not just a dip in form. In that run of his last 5 PL matches does not include the match against against Swansea where he gave up the winning goal, nor that catastrophe against PSV, nor Wolfsburg, where along with Valencia, he played the attacker onside for the goal. And LVG saved us from Sterling and Citeh by keeping him safely on the bench. This guy has seriously fallen off the charts.

Don´t bollock the messenger for stating the obvious. You don´t think other managers see this. Pardew moved Zaha (a United reject) one time in the second half with a predictably embarrassing outcome.

1906~~~
Seems to be behind young and Valencia now

Hopefully Lvg is working hard with him to help him recover from this bad patch

I don't mind young and in particular Valencia at right back but my preference is someone who is a very strong defender rather than attacking attributes and Darmian surely offers the most in that dept

1907~~~
He's shown what he can do so I have no worries about him. He really needs to improve going forward though.

1908~~~
What happened to him?

1909~~~
Suspended.

1910~~~
Seems like Nothing Sensible has forgotten Evra's first few months...

1911~~~
Going to be counting on him quite a bit at this point with Shaw/Valencia out.

1912~~~
I feel he is quickly becoming another product of Van Gaal bad man management. He is was arguably our best player in the first few months of the season and then his form drops so unexpectedly like an earthquake. Kind of similiar to Di Maria during his term here. I could be overlooking things and maybe he just needs a rest, but his recent performances has been piss poor. I would not be surprised if Van Gaal told him to completely changed his game, which might have affected his mentality on the pitch.

1913~~~
Its his athletic level which has dropped massively from his first few games for us. He looks a liability whenever he plays against someone with decent pace now.

1914~~~
How does that happen in such a short period when he does not appeared injuried? His confidence and mental strength must have been hit by something. He also appear to be a player who is grounded, so I doubt he took his earlier performances for granted.

1915~~~
It baffles me too.  Tbh what is strange is that before we signed him,  I thought he was a tad slow and leggy and I didn't think he would be a great signing based on the limited games I'd seen of him. But he blew me away with his initial performances and he looked very althetic. 

He now looks like the player I thought he'd be like but clearly he has it in him to be much better, how do we get it out of him though... is it a case of him not being able to handle a huge workload of high intensity football and he needs to adapt?

1916~~~
Nothing baffling about it at all. With a healthy Valencia, Darmian probably wouldn´t even make it on the substitutions bench.

1917~~~
Quality poster above.

1918~~~
He's played both games for Italy, hasn't he? Maybe van Gaal thought Young simply had more energy to offer and has been good recently.

1919~~~
It's true. If Tony V was fit he'd be first pick. It's obvious LvG isn't impressed with the no shows in attack from Darmian. It's why Young is playing there again.

1920~~~
still baffling how the guy can go from looking like our next right back for a number of years to being replaced by 2 wingers.  so basically our defensive wingbacks are currently our left attacking winger and a jack-of-all trades in Young and Blind.  hopefully he can turn it around though and it's a "simple" case of first season at United / New League syndrome

1921~~~
LvG has done this with plenty of players in his time here after they hit a patch of bad form (everyone bar Rooney). Darmian will be back in the lineup soon enough.

1922~~~
What's wrong with playing a winger like Young who has a lot of energy and defends well at full-back?Young needs to be considered as a serious option and as long as Darmian doesn't show that he can do better, bench is the place for him.

I have never been impressed by Darmian's attacking play so I don't have high expectation but he clearly need to get his defending back on track,hopefully before we need to play him regularly again.

1923~~~
what's wrong is that young isn't a defender and hence his positional awareness isn't as good as someone who is a "natural" right back.  against better opposition we can't be playing Young there, quite simple.

this is not an attack on any player at all by the way - I like young, blind as players and they're good for United.  I'm just saying i don't like the fact our left and right back are not players who's position it is and we'll get found out.

I'd rather have a right back who can defend and lit him pass to the right midfielder / attacker to do his job rather than an attacker at right bac

1924~~~
And yet he has still outperformed Darmian defensively recently so there is nothing wrong with it at all. Darmian has offered feck all going forward and started to get dicked defensively as well. He was rightly dropped and until he sorts that out he should remained dropped. Young and Valencia's positions or former positions are completely irrelevant.

Bringing Blind into it is stupid too as he has regularly played at LB throughout his career and has put in much better performances for us than Darmian has. Blind is much more deserving of a spot in the starting XI than Darmian is.

1925~~~
What i dont understand is how he managed to look so threatening for italy the times ive watched him, but for united he's essentially passive past the half way line.

1926~~~
You mean like this display from our right back last time we played PSV?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8pSfSuu6Qc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1927~~~
fair reply and he had a shocker, as do all players.  my point kinda was more that i want defenders to play in defence and attackers in attack.  hate it when we play players out of position like Fellaini as a striker, valencia as right back

1928~~~
People are way too obsessed with positions. Good players can play several positions, and Young and Valencia are both very good rightbacks. The players who perform best should always start, no matter what position they used to play. Darmian has clearly been the weakest defender of the three, when he is supposed to be a natural defender. Van Gaal is making good decisions lately.

1929~~~
I think he's still getting used to LVG and a new league of course.

Evra was hardly great when he arrived.

1930~~~
Valencia has performed better than Darmain maybe. But certainly not Young. Besides Darmian has played good at least in 50% of the matches he played. His form went awry but he was not utter shite. 
Unless Young is providing something extraordinary (offensively) from the right, there is no need to start him at RB over Darmian.

1931~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1932~~~
His loss of form coincided with Shaw's injury - which is odd as it really shouldn't have anything to do with him. He was great for the first month and won the fan's player of the month (although that should have been Smalling) so I still have faith in him. I think he'll regain his first team spot before the end of the season.

1933~~~
A loss of form in your first season is totally acceptable, the physical demands of the Premier league are different to all other leagues. I'm sure once he adjusts his game he will be fine.

1934~~~
Yeah, he hit the ground running, but sort of lost steam. Same as with Depay, really. Maybe the seeming ease of transition caused some complacency. He's shown what he can do, so it's just a matter of getting back to that level.

1935~~~
I would definitely play darmian next PL match. More than attack, we need defensive contribution against schlup vardy and all and I think darmian is better than young in that regard.

1936~~~
As I said earlier, a lot of LVG's signing last season showed a "V" trend in their development (Herrera, Shaw, Rojo and Blind). After signing they initially showed a lot of quality and promise, and substantial improvement over the incumbent in their position. This was the honeymoon period that led to lot of excitement amongst the fans. Then their performance levels dipped by a lot suddenly with some extremely average displays, often leading to them being relegated on the bench. This was a period where they were seemingly getting accustomed with LVG's philosophy (and perhaps PL's rigour in some cases). Then finally they reached the acceleration stage, becoming an integral part of the squad and are still continuing to develop. 

I think something similar might be happening with Darmian (i.e., he is in the second stage) and I fully expect him to grow out of this slump. He has shown sufficient quality early in the season to not be able to do so. The same with Memphis actually, whereas Schneiderlin has already crossed the two stages and reached the third.

1937~~~
Young is quicker and has played his heart out even against tricky opponents. Please do not change the the back four unless it´s needed.

1938~~~
Doesn't really apply to Shaw. He's been great every time he played, and was simply injured for most of his first season having won Louis over after some pre-season fitness issues. He's never struggled to be first choice for more than a game or two when fit.

1939~~~
It does actually - even though he wasn't really dropped by LVG. He didn't have the best of form during the middle part of the season even fit which led to people questioning (wrongly obviously!) if he was massively overhyped and if he had the potential to become a good player for us. Specially, questions were raised as to his attacking potential. Then around the time we played Chelsea the second time, everything started coming together for him. He was actually the best player for us against Chelsea, which obviously was the norm this season before his injury but was a new phenomenon last season.

1940~~~
I am of the opinion now that LVG doesn't actually rate him that high. There was plenty of times he could of been brought on in Saturday's game but was avoided time and time again. He is really going to have to work to get back in the team as a fixed starter, which is a shame for him as he started excellently.

1941~~~
What's this early 'purple patch' people keep talking about? I remember he was very good in the Spurs opener and fantastic afterwards against Aston Villa (and Sunderland later on though I wouldn't read too much into games against such low-levelled opposition) but since then you could probably count his 'good' performances on one hand. Hardly a lengthy amount of time to be in form.

I still defer to the judgement of those who have watched him more closely than I in terms of his quality (as well as his notable defensive play in his form games), and I'm well aware that it will take him time to adapt and replicate that level. He's been better for Italy so I think it's largely the speed of play in England that he needs to get used to.

1942~~~
I actually believe that he wants at least one of the fullbacks to be ultra attacking, and with the injury to Shaw, he going now with the right side. 
He is a very good defender, (even if he has had a few bad games)

1943~~~
Are you judging his defensive skills or attacking skills?

1944~~~
Both in combination, as I would for a fullback.

1945~~~
You're right. He started very well but he didn't really keep it up long, unlike the Caf's general perception of his performances which for some reason kept going up and up. People would put him in Real, Barca and Bayern's teams when making combined XI's in one thread. The whole thing was really odd. He was great in the first two games and then had another good period (Sunderland and Wolfsburg) and that's about it. My rating of him on the Caf so far is 5.8, compared to the 6.3 average and my ratings of the other players are generally pretty similar to the average.

I don't know about his Italy performances. I watched them against Bulgaria in September but don't remember how he did. He wasn't particularly good against Belgium though.

1946~~~
I guess a player gets 0 time to adjust to a new league these days eh.

1947~~~
What would make you think that? Most here are critical but many are pointing out that he's still adapting and it's normal.

1948~~~
Ive witnessed comments in here saying LVG doesn't rate him, and that he offers no attacking threat.

1949~~~
I does seem that way at times, though not so much for Darmian perhaps. Plenty of people basically gave up on Depay, writing him off completely, and Rojo's been getting stick from some from day one. Plenty of people were (and are still) doubtful of whether Blind's good enough. A lot of people seem to have the patience of literal children.

1950~~~
Yes, I agree - he doesn't seem to trust him for some reason.  I think Valencia would have carried on in the role had he not got injured and now Young is playing there, which puts Darmian at third choice.  he has also been withdrawn at half time a couple of times I think - disappointing as we had high hopes for him

1951~~~
I don't like this player really. I think he's a very ordinary player who you could find almost anywhere. He's not very mobile. He's quite good at going forward and taking runs etc, but otherwise I'm not a very big fan and could easily think of another player to replace him with. I just don't see the athletic side to him, and I want a full back to be more like Dani Alves.

1952~~~
This guy is the Anti-Evra, one couldn't defend to save his life and this guy can't go forward. I do believe he'll come good eventually once he gets used to the system and improves his attacking. People need to be patient.

1953~~~
I think he did very well in the early stages of his Manchester United career. But has been injured now and has lost his form.

1954~~~
In and out of the side, due to injury and form, leading to speculation that LVG doesn't rate him, especially since Young has played a portion of the season in his position.

Matteo Darmian is this season's Luke Shaw.

1955~~~
Indeed

1956~~~
He wasn't playing well and he's been benched as a result, that doesn't mean lvg doesn't rate him. He started out extremely well so I have little doubt that he'll eventually get back to those standards. As most are saying he's likely just finding it a bit tough in a new league and team setup. Hopefully some rest will help him out.

1957~~~
He isn't an ordinary player at all. His first 5 or so PL games and the CL qualifiers, he was very good. He was defensively sound and got into the right positions. Most of the players struggled to beat him 1v1. Meaning he is technically sound. It's probably a temporary form or confidence issue. I'm certain him and Memphis will be mainstays in our team soon.

1958~~~
He'll be back in the team in the near future and do very well. Some whopping posts kicking about in here.

1959~~~
Reads like you've never actually seen him play.

1960~~~
Evra was solid at one point

1961~~~
I meant at the beginning of their United careers, Evra's first few months were very bad.

1962~~~
I think right now LvG just wants a bit more of an attacking threat on the overlap from his RB since Mata hardly ever pulls wide in an attack. Darmian started off very well defensively for us but has yet to show much in the final 3rd even in his best games, Young offers a bit more in that regard.

1963~~~
How can he be this bad with ball at his feet? How is it possible that he played/plays wingback regulary in/for Italy?

His passing is really bad, first he needs time to spot a player, then he looks where the ball is and then his pass is late for about 3 seconds because opponents obviously aren't that slow to intercept it. When he is not doing that he is passing it randomly forward and if he is lucky someone from our players will be there.

I was seriously impressed with him at start of the season and I thought this guy is a great buy and is already great player, mostly because of his defensive game and that that will be good enough to compensate for his average attacking game but I think it's obvious he is nowhere near good enough attacking wise and that he simply doesn't have quality in his legs to improve there. I am quite sure he can't be a starter in future for us if we don't have strong winger ahead of him or if our left back isn't great in attack.

1964~~~
He looks like a central defender playing as full back good when defending but offers very little going forward.

1965~~~
He looks very, very average lately, and I think I'm being generous. Not writing him off yet but a disappointing turn after a promising start. Even his defending is looking suspect currently.

1966~~~
Adds nothing to the attack.

1967~~~
This is a pretty accurate summation.

1968~~~
Doesn't look like a full back. He plays like a DM played at right back.

1969~~~
I'm happy to give him some time, he's coming from a very different league.

1970~~~
I thought he was decent. Certainly an improvement over his recent performances.

1971~~~
You guys are overreacting. The guy looked quite good in the first half making some overlapping runs and kept tidy with the ball.

1972~~~
I noticed that our fullbacks too often have no one to pass to. The midfielders and wingers are always too far away. Dont want to make excuses for him, he was poor as the others, but too often they are isolated and cant contribute much

1973~~~
He looks like a CB playing full-back offensively, and is physically bullied defensively. Worrying signs, even if yesterday wasn't one of his worst performances.

1974~~~
He was good yesterday. Weird to say he offered little in attack when Lingard didn't touch the ball until he scoffed a chance in the 75th minuted of the 2nd half. There was just nothing happening in offense so of course the full back isn't going to be the one to make stuff happen. All in all I thought the full backs did well yesterday. Rojo was dangerous every time he got into a crossing position. He either put in a good cross or got a corner. That being said I would like to add that our corners looked good yesterday. Many people have been frustrated with them this season. The reason we've been taking them short is because they've been getting the ball out to Blind (who took our corners for the most part yesterday). Blind is the best crosser in the team hands down. I've been saying it all season, he's actually a top class crosser.

1975~~~
I'm still waiting for any evidence at all as to what it is he's supposed to be good at.

He's average defensively and on the ball he makes Smalling look like Paul Scholes.

He doesn't look like someone playing out of position to me. He just looks like someone who's not good enough at football. Although he did look ok at left back in the one game he played there.

1976~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1977~~~
He was okay yesterday, but that's probably coming from the fact that there were several players on the pitch who were a lot more terrible than him. Not too bad, but didn't offer all that much either.

1978~~~
I thought he was a bit naff to be honest.

Whilst he does make a few overlapping runs (though not enough for my liking), he never seems to be that annoyed when the ball doesn't come his way. I also can't help shake the feeling that he's a massive wuss.

1979~~~
It's true though. If one of the main problems is an inability to pass the ball to someone else on your team in simple situations, then moving to defensive midfield or centreback is probably not going to resolve this, and definitely isn't going to make it unimportant to your performance.

He just seems to have no composure at all. Any hint of pressure and he just kicks the ball in a direction and hopes for the best. It's Manchester United not schoolboy Sunday league.

It's too early to write him off but extremely drastic improvement is needed.

1980~~~
It's often the ones who live in the Premier League bubble and haven't seen these players at previous clubs who come with misguided 'not good enough' comments. Happened with Blind last season, when he was being written off even before we signed him without taking his performances for Ajax and Holland into consideration. Is happening now with Darmian who was wonderful at Torino before he signed for United. Matteo will be fine in the medium to long run, Van Gaal's 'system' or method or whatever you wanna call it - is notoriously harsh on newer players and there's a substantial growth learning before they start clicking. Right now he is worrying about positioning and ball movement (two keys for Louis' fullbacks), and that can be mentally taxing as players go against their natural instinct, and what they've learnt under previous managers - hence the circumspect playing style (as players play within themselves instead of doing things organically) and positional errors; but soon enough he'll get a hang of the whole thing, and start playing with automatism. This is how new players have historically performed under Van Gaal, and Darmian is not an exception to the norm.

1981~~~
Feels like Blind's first season seems to be seen quite negatively in hindsight, but I actually thought he was decent. Far from inspiring in midfield, but a comfortable, reliable passer when that was what he needed. Also someone who managed to put in some good performances at left-back when we needed him to.

Anyway, as for Darmian, I've still got plenty of hope that you're right on this one because he looked terrific in some of our pre-season games. Dangerous going forward, and comfortable in defence. He's not shown that at all recently though, which is obviously a concern. The problem is so far that like noodlehair said, he's just not been looking like a particularly good footballer. Again though, I'm hoping that's just a temporary thing, and that he'll come good for us.

1982~~~
He started off well till Southampton game. Well is an understatement. He annihilated most of the opponents he faced. He was especially good in the 1v1 situations.

After that he has been injured or has been benched. It's been 2 months. He isn't playing amazingly well of course and nobody would be saying it is. But to make statements like he isn't good at football or that he is not good enough at this level is highly knee jerk. He was also the Italian player of the year ahead of many other talented players. He is clearly a very talented player who is going through an off form period

1983~~~
He's actually got pace. Not sure why he doesn't run beyond his winger much.

1984~~~
I thought he was just ok and people seemed to get ridiculously carried away. I don't think there's been a game where he's looked really good. He's suspect in 1v1 situations. He gets caught square footed a lot and ends up having to try and foul the opponent when he shouldn't have needed to...and then sometimes buggers that up as well.

The thing that makes me reluctant to write him off is that he's not as bad as Evra was in his first 6 months...but Evra DID improve drastically. Darmian will need to do so.

1985~~~
Yep, Blind was silently impressive last season. Sometimes I think modern fans like us are guilty of losing any form of perspective when it comes to new additions. Many of them are coming from small clubs, from less physically intensive leagues, they can't speak the language and have lived rather sheltered lives. To go from there to a club like United can be daunting - and they do need a bit of an adjustment period. But no one cares on the back of a few bad performances. 

As for Darmian not looking good as a footballer, that happens quite frequently with Van Gaal's players in fairness. His instructions are very demanding, and the players have to forsake the comfort of their natural game. Every footballer thrives when he's playing with full confidence, but right now - for players like Darmian - every time he doesn't do what the manager wants, he will be pulled aside, and that is likely always in the back of his mind. Hence the mistakes, lapses in judgement and errors in concentration. Once he 'gets it', and he eventually will - Italians are very thorough with tactics, he will get back to being the player he was at Torino. We'll just have to wait until his natural rhythm catches up to the instructions.

1986~~~
You may have a point with the Van Gaal stuff but the first part of your post is presumptious nonsense to be fair.

No one wrote Blind off before he'd played for us, and in anycase I'm still not sure on him now...he's currently used as a makeshift centreback who massively struggles whenever he has to do any defending, because he hasn't proven reliable enough to be in the starting line up anywhere else. He hasn't been awful but you would struggle to explain how he fits in to a United team that's actually as good as it wants to be.

1987~~~
Are we sure about that though?



This is just from the first page, would have to trawl through 64 more to find the real gems.

It's not presumptuous because we've seen it happen time and again on here with players we're linked with, or ones who are signed from lesser leagues. and if they do sign for United - every time they commit an error we see heaps of comments declaring that they just aren't good enough for a club of United's stature. The underlying point is that we need to atleast give these players a chance to prove themselves for before writing them off, or being overly critical of them (not aimed at you mind - he does admittedly look a bit shite right now, but there's one poster who has a clear agenda against the lad).

I agree with you on Blind being marginal so far too by the way. He is a good utility player, who's being thrust into the starting job given the lack of alternatives. Those that saw him at Ajax knew that he was a step below what we needed in terms of starters, but he would be a good squad player, the kind of jack of all trades almost every team needs - his ideal position is on the bench as a relief for worn out starters, or an emergency stop gap. Now he's being thrust into regular duty with a heavy workload, and sometimes we see cracks in his game. And for that, the manager is culpable for blame, moreso than the player himself.

1988~~~
He's fine. Really ought to utilise his stamina and respectable pace a little more - rarely bombs up and down the flank. I'm sure that's down to confidence.

1989~~~
As for your "Premier League bubble" logic, it may as well go the other way; there´s a long line of players United has signed from sides as good or better than Torino who haven´t made in the Premier league. I see you conveniently don´t mention them. And don´t compare Darmian to Blind. Anyone who wrote Blind off from last year is a football genius clown, which sounds like you would agree with. 

I also don´t get, just because Blind came good, it means Darmian will. It doesn´t. You use Blind as an argument, but then again you can use as a counter argument any player who started off well and turned to crap. There are thousands of examples. You might as well use one of them, it would be just as valid as using the Blind example. 

I just don´t see how Darmian is suddenly going to change. He´s never going to take defenders on, and beat them. It´s not going to magically happen. His understanding with the wingers seems to be getting worse. He looks slow, lost and lethargic going forward and our wingers seem to ignore him. Even Valencia, with only one foot, is far more technically astute, and a much better passer and makes great runs (albeit with a less than satisfying final product). The same can be said for Young. In these days of United´s poor offensive form, Darmian seems much more symbolic of it than any kind of solution to it. It´s mad to bitch about our offense, and then turn around and want Darmian to be at right back.

He´s not suddenly going to be graced with pace to keep up with these quick PL wingers who continually skin him. Besides his good one on one play, where is there anything else laudable, or the potential for this guy to get better? This is not Torino. This is not Serie A, nor international play. Some pointed out he was "good" and "decent" last Wednesday, but this of course was against a toothless PSV playing at Old Trafford. This is when Darmian seems to "shine" as decent. But back in Holland, with a more lively PSV, they killed him, and he was at fault for both goals. Opposing managers haven obviously taken notice. Rainieri has probably creampt in his drawers thinking about putting Jamie Vardy up against this guy. I can´t imagine LVG would let this happen to  this supposed "natural fullback and great defender."

I also hate the fact that when he plays and we are chasing the match, LVG must always substitute him. Why are we having to waste a substitution on a right back when we´re needing a goal? This guy was gifted the right back position. It was his for the taking with all the wanky bandwagon support he could ever want, and by mid season he has fallen back to second choice behind Ashley Young. Ashley Young!!! I said before, with a healthy Valencia (not to mention Shaw), Darmian would not even be on the subs bench. What would be the point? 

I don´t dislike the guy personally, and would certainly never call him stupid or a coward or question is footballing brain, but this guy is not good enough for the PL (well, maybe for Stoke), and the bandwagon created for such a bang average fullback has been a joke, and one that seems difficult to disappear. People keep wanting to compare him with Evra´s poor start, but Evra was never even near this poor, and the potential was obvious as he took an excellent Gabby Heinze´s place

1990~~~
Why shouldn't Darmian be compared to Blind? Both of them were labelled players who would struggle with the physicality and pace of the Premier League at the fullback spot. Blind was named to the Eredivisie Team of the the Year, and Darmian to the Serie A team of the Year. Blind was Dutch Footballer of the Year, and Darmian won the Pallone Azzurro for the Best Italian national team player in 2014. The real clown here  is the agenda poster who keeps creeping into the threads to have a go at Darmian when he's barely played 10 games in the league for United, and needs to settle down a bit.

Who said Darmian will improve just because Blind did? Blind was merely an example to show how players are written off in a hurry before being given a fair shot. No need to take it on a tangent.

Except he took defenders on with frequency at Torino, and takes defender on quite regularly for the Italian national team? There's clearly something wrong at United that a player who's perfectly capable of bombing forward for Italy from the wingback position seems circumspect at United. Maybe those are positional instructions, maybe he's taking time to adjust to Van Gaal's requirements - how can you state with great gumption that a player who was comfortable going forward for his previous club, and is currently capable of going forward for Italy can never go forward for United, and that's not going to change? It's a bizarre form of argumentation.

Has the thought ever crossed your mind that he looks suddenly slow and lethargic because he's bogged down by technicalities, or is still adjusting to the physical demands of the league like a lot of imports need to? Like how Ander seems less adventurous; or how Schweinsteiger played it safe under Van Gaal at Bayern but found his groove under Heyneckes, and has now again started playing safe passes at United. Valencia and Young aren't even in Darmian's class provided he settles in. This is a player who was being chased by the likes of Bayern Munich and Barcelona, and neither club would entertain the notion of the players you hold superior to Darmian.

Utter crap. Azpilicueta and Zabaleta are no faster than Darmian, and they're among the best fullbacks in the league, and have been for a while now. Arguably the greatest rightback in Premier League history - Gary Neville was no faster than Darmian. Football isn't just about raw speed, or we'd just have 100m athletes playing for every team. It's also about positioning, tracking the runners and working as a unit to contain the pace. He has barely stepped into the United setup, he hasn't had the time to build chemistry with the team-mates, he's processing what the manager wants from him - that's a lot to adjust to, and it takes time. You dismiss Serie A because you didn't watch him play there, that much is pretty evident, otherwise you wouldn't be spouting the same kind of rubbish over and over again, on almost every single page.

Guess what, everything that Van Gaal does in terms of substitutions doesn't make sense, no matter how much you hate it. He leaves Rooney on to play as a withdrawn midfielder, he brings on Mata with 7 minutes left, he subs out Ander without a second thought - it's a mess. This guy was gifted the right back position because he was rated as one of the best rightbacks in Europe, and created more chances per minute than your darling Valencia, Clyne and Coleman; as well as being defensively secure. That's the reason United went for him in the first place, and that's the reason we handed the spot to him. Your hard-on for Valencia is just hilarious.

Alrighty then.

1991~~~
I like how preferring one player in a team mostly means that you hate other player who is his direct competition(see Nobby).

1992~~~
Really? I think a few silly rumours are way too often translated to being actively chased by all top clubs and then someone concludes that he has to be quality. Pretty much every player who signs for a top club these days has been rumoured to be chased by every other top club. I rate your posts highly and value your opinion on the player (even though I disagree in Darmian's case). I just think that this line of reasoning simply doesn't work. Of course it doesn't negate everything else you wrote in your post, just pointing this one out.

For what it's worth, I never understood the hype about Darmian. I thought he looked decent at best whenever I've seen him for Italy or in Serie A games. And I didn't understand the early hype on the Caf after the first few games either. But that's just my opinion and it's certainly not based on a big enough samplesize to make a good judgement. Just my impression that I got so far.

1993~~~
You have this weird tendency to be negative to extreme. He's been absolutely fine in a lot of games and was very good back in Italy.

1994~~~
Dunno, I was just going by La Stampa and Gazzetta Italia's reports:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.gazzetta.it/Calciomercato/08-06-2015/bayern-monaco-a-darmian-torino-vira-donati-12089654091.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.gazzetta.it/Calciomercat...-darmian-torino-vira-donati-12089654091.shtml</a>

And links on a couple of Bayern boards:

And the Juventus forum where some posters were losing their shit because they weren't going to sign him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.juventuz.com/threads/41208-Matteo-Darmian-RB-LB-Torino-F-C/page7" target="_blank">http://www.juventuz.com/threads/41208-Matteo-Darmian-RB-LB-Torino-F-C/page7</a>

As for rating Darmian, that's fair enough, it differs from person to person. I've admittedly liked him quite a lot since his Torino days, thought he could be Azpiliueta part II at United, a defesively sound fullback who was decent to good going forward - the likes of which are becoming a rarity these days. Maybe it doesn't turn out too well for him, who knows, but still, the sample size at United is a bit small to judge him harshly like the poster quoted does.

1995~~~
I know that there were rumours and it was discussed but nothing was ever confirmed from players, agents, managers as far as I know and the newspapers close to Bayern never published anything based on their own sources. Donati is also still in Leverkusen, even though Darmian left <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>.

Obviously true.

1996~~~
Oh please, stop with this lazy argument. Address the valid criticisms of why this guy has fallen so far down in the pecking order and why LVG has so little confidence in him, meanwhile you bitch and whine about the lack of a dynamic attack.

And I seriously doubt Bayern or Juventus or anybody else is still interested at the moment. Probably the contrary.

1997~~~
And the irony with that is the vast majority would (and maybe still do) have Azpi in their TOTY's each season in those threads but will come in and bitch about Darmian having the same downfalls. Grass really is always greener, I suppose.

1998~~~
Well, I actually criticised him a lot this season, but you are one of his biggest critics, and it's quite obvious why.

1999~~~
One thing this summer has taught me is to ignore the so called caf experts who pop up whenever we sign a player. You could have been forgiven for thinking he was going to be Gary Neville reborn when in fact he's only been marginally better (if that) than Valencia which is rather disturbing given horrible Valencia is. I'm beginning to think Clyne might have been a better option, as spectacularly average as he is.

2000~~~
See I am not a huge fan of Azpilicueta because he is bang average on the ball. He normally gets away with it because Chelsea had Hazard ahead of him who could do most of it alone last season. Azpilicueta sticks out like a sore thumb in the Spain team too, he is the only one who isn't good on the ball.

Very good defensively but I think a full back needs a lot more than that these days. And that's why I have been critical of Darmian from September onwards. It is is first season mind so lets give him time

2001~~~
Non-existent in that first half and I thought he was every bit at fault for that goal as Young for not cutting out the pass

2002~~~
Should definitely have cut that out.

2003~~~
He's fecking awful going forward, absolutely dreadful.

2004~~~
I love him and he is a great defender but he is clearly shot of all confidence and is playing horribly

2005~~~
He had more than enough time to intercept that ball to Vardy

2006~~~
He's so bad today.

2007~~~
There's just no point in passing the ball to him.

2008~~~
We'd be better with a youth player just now

2009~~~
That was tough to watch. He did not seem to anticipate the ball or the man he was marking. There was more than one point where some extra effort would have broken up the play, or made it much harder on Leicester.

2010~~~
God I miss Antonio Valencia

2011~~~
Not just today unfortunately.

2012~~~
He's been dreadful defensively as well. Absolutely awful.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You know our squad is in a mess when we're pining for Valencia.

2013~~~
True. After a good start for us he's been shite since early september. Bad signing so far.

2014~~~
Having a mare.

2015~~~
the hell's happened to this guy? looks nothing like the player who was flying high early season.

2016~~~
That was the type of ball Vidic would've easily handled

2017~~~
I actually have more confidence in Valencia which says it all <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2018~~~
Got van Gaaled

2019~~~
He's been absolutely awful this game, surprised he is still on

2020~~~
He needs a one on one session with Gary Neville to work on his crossing.

2021~~~
Yeah I can't believe he was still on

2022~~~
Awful. Wasn't a presence defensively, and did nothing going forward. I miss Rafael. (Even though he'd probably be injured)

2023~~~
Really disappointing.

2024~~~
Still early days for him in the Premier League.. Should be patient with him, he is not a bad player.

2025~~~
The prophet hath spoken . . .

2026~~~
The feck happened to him?

2027~~~
That cross when we were in a dangerous position in the latter stages just summed up his day. Very poor.

2028~~~
He is scarily bad on the ball

2029~~~
hes a good player but his crossing has always been awful even at torino.

2030~~~
Worst United game for him so far.

2031~~~
Horrorshow from him today

2032~~~
Not sure what has happened to this guy. Doesn't seem a very good defender or a very good attacker. In the circumstances i'd rather see Young play at Right back.

2033~~~
Absolute garbage today, I thought coming from Italy he'd have more experience playing with a back 3.

2034~~~
That was on Carrick and Young far more than it was on Darmian. Vardy was on his blindside and was doing a decent role covering the space - Young had to pick up his man and Carrick had to put pressure on the ball.

He was horrific outside of that though. Can't believe he was a wingback in Italy because he's utterly useless. So timid.

2035~~~
This was about ten times worse than anything Valencia ever put out. Tragic.

2036~~~
Non existent in the game against PSV and very poor today.

2037~~~
Could Darmian be any slower in reacting? You could almost hear Rainieri screaming pass it by Darmian.

2038~~~
As poor as the goal was, I don't think Darmian did too much wrong. His woeful attacking play is of greater concern.

2039~~~
Useless going forward.

He contributes nothing. It's worrying. Even when he was decent at the beginning, he was poor going forward. Gotten worse now.

2040~~~
Agree with all of that. The goal wasn't his fault but he was really poor. On both sides of the pitch.

2041~~~
Shame he couldn't keep that left foot shot a bit lower near the end. Apart from that he was dire.

2042~~~
He has looked poor when attacking from full back, why LVG thought sticking him at wing back and being the sole provider of width on the right would work is beyond confusing.

Gave the performance I pretty much expected having seen the formation.

2043~~~
He could have cut the pass out but like at various points throughout the game, he was very slow at reacting.

2044~~~
does he not practice crossing in training?! absolutely atrocious when we're on the attack. He has had, and will continue to have, lots of time and space so he better sort his crossing out soon because it's unacceptable and it's going to cost us chances. Any decent 15 year old can do a better job crossing and beating a man than him.

2045~~~
playing a defensive fullback in wingback position was a tactical masterstroke.....

2046~~~
So where is the Valencia bashing brigade who thought that every cross from a fullback should result in a chance? Getting some perspective now i think. Awful performance from Darmian and he had the most space in the attacking third.

2047~~~
My thoughts exactly. He does not benefit from the 3-5-2 system.

2048~~~
He wasn't good going forward despite taking some good positions. H wasn't that bad tbh, was a bit surprised at the criticism in the match thread but maybe that was more frustration than anything else.

2049~~~
Getting worse with every game

2050~~~
Terrible. Should've blocked the ball to Vardy for their goal, and crossed pathetically.

2051~~~
Why is he the only one getting blamed for that goal? Young was facing Vardy, and had to know the pass was coming and could have stopped himself running and played the guy offside.

2052~~~
He was awful in attack but blaming him for our goal is harsh. Young tracked Vardy, saw the line and saw the pass. Then he somehow decided not to keep tracking him when the ball was played in.

2053~~~
Didn't van Gaal experts say during the summer than he is van Gaal type of player?

2054~~~
I really miss Rafael. Say what you want but he was fantastic attacking wise and given as much space as darmian got today he would have tore up that right side.

2055~~~
But when he plays crap at fullback, we are told its because he's wingback...

2056~~~
He did last season and we lost 5-3.

If memphis hadn't have fecked that shot up, his header would have been considered a good assist.

2057~~~
Darmian was woefully slow in reacting to this pass. He truly has become a defensive liability.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/3rxs" width="560"></iframe>

2058~~~
We are going to have to find a way of playing without ever passing him the ball.

2059~~~
Is it just me or does that show that it was easier to cut out the pass then look around and adjust your stride to chase back?

It makes no fecking sense...

2060~~~
Not a wing back. I know he played it at Torino, but he lacks the attacking instinct to do it. He even struggles at full back when he has Mata in front of him who cuts in, meaning he has to do it all on his own. He's not that type of player. He needs someone he can link up with and get round, very much like Gary Neville was.

2061~~~
when we signed him, I'm sure one journalist said, be honest, can you see him being the first choice right back in 2 years.
The meaning, being he was some stopgap filler.

Then he started really well, and it looked a ridiculous comment.
Now it's looking more, "he's no Valencia"

2062~~~
Have to agree, he's getting steadily worse.

2063~~~
Where was the reincarnation of Maldini/Baresi/Moore/Rio/Vidic/Jesus/Buddha/Moses when Vardy found himself with the ball in front of goal? At least Darmian and Young (who also messed up terribly) were actually in defense

2064~~~
Seems to get worse with every game he plays.  Cheers, LVG.

2065~~~
erm... up front for the corner? You really expected him to be back within 10 seconds and two passes?

2066~~~
I bet Van Gaal bollocks him for having that shot at the end. 

He should have turned and passed the ball backwards slowly.

2067~~~
He has been a big disappointment so far, I really thought he was the answer to our right back problem when we signed him but as it stands Valencia would be a big improvement on him.

2068~~~
He's no Dani Alves. With that being said, he suddenly regressed a lot, what happened?

2069~~~
His attacking is pathetic, he makes Valencia look an accurate crosser and Rafael look like Haile gebreselassie.

I expected him to be a strong dominant defender with good stamina, but he just looks like he's playing well within his shell.

2070~~~
Maybe it's a confidence thing, he's normally the one taken off when the team isn't performing, that could have taken a toll. He was much better in the beginning, a rock defensively and a contributor in attack.

2071~~~
Another quick player that looks good in Italy but just doesn't look anywhere near as dynamic in the PL. He looks like a CB playing at RB. Completely useless attacker.

If he can't find some sort of attacking instinct we are wasting our time and I just don't see any evidence that is going to happen.

His Mata partnership is so aweful to watch. It doesn't work. They do the total opposite of complimenting each other.

2072~~~
I struggle to see what he's good at really. He gave the ball away time after time with his passing and miscontrol of the ball. His crossing was utter wank. He looks slow and he's been left wanting defensively many times this season. He's not good enough and I doubt he ever will be.

2073~~~
Remember the praise after the Tottenham game. Football fans....

2074~~~
Even Djemba-Djemba had good games.

2075~~~
He has lost his defensive ability for some reason. I assume it is a lack of confidence/bad run of form. He really is awful on the ball when he goes forward though. He'll have to really work hard to improve. A bad performance, after what I thought was a decent one against PSV.

2076~~~
I actually thought he had an alright game when you consider he's not good enough going forward. Young was at fault for the goal, but I think long term we're looking at Darmian being a defensively solid rotation player. That was about what we got today.

2077~~~
Christ you lot pick and choose your gripes. 

Valencia last season got nothing but abuse for solid performances with the odd mistake thrown in. 

Darmian comes in as the the saviour and everyone's new favourite and after a solid first couple of games seriously starts to struggle as the league kicks into full swing highlighting just how well Valencia has done for us. 


....but it's Van Gaal's fault that Darmian is playing shit of course.

2078~~~
It's you. Young didn't follow his man. Young just slows down and lifts up his arm, possibly wanting offside.

Carrick doesn't press Mahrez because he knows he'll get skinned if he does. Better to try and hold him back a bit and let his team mates track back. A second before the bass Vardy is right next to Young.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/WMgFTO4.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/WMgFTO4.png"/>

~1 second after the pass. Young has lost Vardy.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/53VSNVc.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/53VSNVc.png"/>

~2 seconds after the pass. Young stops following Vardy at this point and assumes that Darmian will get him despite Darmian only having just turned around and is further away. What you can also see is that the ball is too far away from him to reach. Ball travels much faster than the man and the only way to intercept the pass is to start going into position to intercept it before the pass is made.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/TJh7hNA.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/TJh7hNA.png"/> 

Darmian could have tackled in front of the shot but that would run a high risk of tackling into Vardy (who's also known for going down easy) and thus giving away a penalty and getting a red card with 66 minutes left to play.

2079~~~
It's hilarious that he's getting blamed for the goal, young is the culprit  but he's the answer to Memphis so it's OK for him to not communicate to the defender ahead of him/followed the runner. Anyone who has ever played in defense at am average level knows Darmian isn't at fault here. Regardless of the performance it's not his fault.

2080~~~
Will be better off for the experiences of this first season. All foregin players need time to adapt. It's just a shame he looks like he will take this full season, well off it at the moment. Especially after a promising start.

2081~~~
Not his fault at all for the goal.

Didn't stop him from still being pretty terrible though.

2082~~~
<a class="username" data-user="28053, @Snow" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28053/">@Snow</a> 

Appreciate the effort but I still think he could have cut that pass out.

Not the only time in the match where he inexplicably just let the ball role past him either...

2083~~~
Whoa was he crap against Leicester. His technique is awful at times, his passing erratic and he is awfully sluggish from a standstill. Both he and Memphis looked fast when they arrived, and now both look leggy as hell. There is no doubt that Valencia would be a better option at the moment.

2084~~~
Is anyone here defending his poor crossing? So don't understand your point about Valencia's bashing. Valencia got all the stick he deserved for his crossing just as Darmian is getting now.

2085~~~
Not his fault at all for the goal, but he looks lost and doesn't quite know what he's supposed to be doing. I think the step up from Torino is hitting him and he needs to get his head straight. He's shown he has the ability earlier in the season.

As bad as his crossing was, lets not forget it was still better than Valencia's average day at work.

2086~~~
I must not have been watching carefully. I thought Vardy got the ball when it was behind McNair.

2087~~~
Getting worse and worse

2088~~~
We vastly overrated him at the start of the season didn't we?

I still think he has the ability to be good for us, but right now he's makinge mistakes at the back and is worthless going forward.

2089~~~
Player with 0 confidence.

2090~~~
I was home watching it on the TV, what does that have anything to do with the goal?

2091~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Are you being serious?

2092~~~
Really needs to work on his crossing, we are so impotent from the right wing. One of the reasons why we don't score is because we create nothing from that side.

2093~~~
He was uselless yesterday...but asking a player with very limited ability on the ball to be the main attacking outlet for the entire team was just really fecking stupid. It's not Darmian''s fault if the manager asks him to do something he is very obviously no good at.

If you put alll your money on a two legged horse to win a horse race, it's not the horse's fault when it doesn't win.

2094~~~
Never mind his crossing, he needs to sort his first touch out. It was embarrassing yesterday.

2095~~~
I agree, Noods. When you play wing backs, they need to be good on the ball. It was frustrating how often the ball landed with Darmian and he completely fecked it up. To a large degree, though, injuries have forced our hand.

2096~~~
He's an ok player. I'm ok with that.

2097~~~
Injuries didn't force our hand though. We didn't have to play 3-5-2...in fact the players we had fit made this more of a problemm than playing our normal formation would have been...and every time we have used 3-5-2, our wingbacks have been our main attacking outlet, so it was obviously what was going to happen. It was either a deliberate (and baffling) tactical choice or a worrying lack of forsight from Van Gaal...and if it was the later he'd have surely changed it

The thing that annoys me with Darmian though is his defending is terrible as well. Leicester's goal was absolutely pathetic. Both him and Young would literally have been more use if they weren't on the pitch, because at least then Vardy would have been offside. It is some achievement to make yourself even more useless than nothing.

2098~~~
Van Gaal always seems to switch to 3-5-2 when he doesn't have enough suitable centrebacks or wingbacks fit to play 3-5-2. It's like he deliberately wants to create his own problems.

2099~~~
The shift to 3-5-2 was definitely a mark of respect to Leicester. One could argue that we shouldn't be adjusting our tactics so much for such a relatively average team, but there we go.

With Darmian, I'm hoping it's just a lack of confidence / lull in form, because no one had any complaints about his defending in the first couple of months, he looked excellent.

Young fecked up the offside trap a couple of times yesterday, always a risk when you play players out of position.

2100~~~
I hadn't seen anything of Darmian before we signed him but plenty on here were telling me he's a far better player than Coleman. Not a chance.

2101~~~
It's a big shift of tactics...because every time we use 3-5-2, our main attacking threat is from the wingbacks...so effectively we were asking Darmian to win the game for us going forwards...is this clever? If I told you before the game Darmian would be our main attacking outlet, would you have told me "that's a good idea"?

Not only that but our centreback trio consisted of two players who are used to playing as a pair and one who'd barely featured all season...which showed with our disorganised, clown like defending. It also seemed to make us extrmely exposed on the counter...every time we lost the ball Leicester seemed to outnumber us going forwards. Smallling bailled us out twice...Leicester fecking up easy passes bailed us out twice. De Gea bailed us out once.

The only thng we (eventually) did effectively was keep the ball...which we do just fine with four at the back anyway. 

It was just odd as usual. We had about 70% of the ball but you're watching thinking "they look like scoring more than we do"...because of our sillly set up.

2102~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<a class="username" data-user="4448, @devilish" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4448/">@devilish</a> once again in being completely and utterly clueless about the defensive end shocker.

2103~~~
Defensively. He was, now he is a total liability.

2104~~~
He started well but feck knows what's happened to him in the intervening period. Coleman is criminally underrated defensively though.

2105~~~
I bet those that said he was better than Clyne/Coleman are feeling a little foolish now.

Both are 1000x better in attack and better defensively.

They're the RB we should've gone for.

2106~~~
Typical overreaction as usual. He's in his first season in England, he started well but now is going through a difficult patch. It is way to early to be slating him as much as some of you are.

2107~~~
Im glad you didn't noticed my joke/provocation. Oh well...

2108~~~
In the modern era he is nowhere near good enough on the ball to be playing rb for us. I think he is a weak enough defender also.

2109~~~
And when they feck up and have shit games like every other player under the sun, we will look at other players, and collectively wish once again that we had them instead.

2110~~~
He cant get the basics right. You can go whistle dixie if you think you can make an excuse for that.

2111~~~
He was woeful yesterday. I'm quickly changing my view on him. He looks rubbish both defending and attacking.

Get rid - or try and get rid.

2112~~~
Yup.  This is common theme across football fans nowadays though. Very quick to elevate someone and bring down based on just handful of games.

2113~~~
Going through one of those spells .We've seen what he can do so no reason for him not to find form again.

2114~~~
They are both better and always were. Darmian isn't a bad player but nowadays fullbacks need to be better in attack than defence. Clyne and coleman would've been much better options.

2115~~~
Coleman yep Clyne not for me. Darmain is going through a rough patch but he'll come good. We should have signed or tried to sign Coleman as we really need someone to give us a threat against the teams that park the bus.

2116~~~
He's very good at defending but we really need more going forward from him. We created so many good openings for him yesterday which deserved better delivery. It just messes up really good moves.

2117~~~
He is in poor form but he's still a good defender. What I dont undertand is why not have him stay back but instead "overload" the right wing with an additional attacker

2118~~~
It's before Christmas and he's already finished here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2119~~~
If we go by the caf philosophy, Rooney, Mata, Darmian, Rojo, Fellaini and LvG are all in the "Throw-em-out" category

2120~~~
This. Judging by these standards, Evra and Vidic would have been gone after a few months as well.

Not saying he's a sure thing to come good, but a new player - who's a very humble, shy individual by all accounts (which might explain his low confidence whilst settling into a new team/language), to a new league....etc.

2121~~~
People overreacting massively on here. 

People who have seen him for Torino and Italy know his quality, he's still adjusting to the league.

He's a very good fullback, he just needs some time to bed in. 

After the way Evra's time went at United, you'd think some people would learn to be a little patient.

2122~~~
You say that but I'm always very wary when players struggle with the basics. Yes, he's in a new league, yes he's adjusting to a new culture but does that really have anything to do with not being able to execute a ten yard pass on a consistent basis ?

2123~~~
Is this a serious post?

Darmian started the season brilliantly for us, he hasn't been as good recently but I put that down to a dip in form. I cant understand why you would want to get rid of him and so soon.

2124~~~
Of course not, but watching him you can tell he's devoid of any confidence right now. Once he's back to his best, we'll remember that we have a very good fullback on our hands. A year from now i might be wrong, but i doubt that having watched him for the last couple of years.

2125~~~
All of your posts so far have been borderline hysterical.

2126~~~
Depay and Schneiderlin (not to the same extent, but there are certainly people who don't think he'll ever be good enough for us).

For the players coming from abroad, it's painfully obvious when the people criticizing them have probably never seen them play before they came here, like questioning Darmian's ability on the ball.

At this point, given the amount of our players that seem to be struggling for form, it's fair to say that something van Gaal is doing is affecting them. Isn't he notorious for very intense training sessions? Combined with being very demanding, and requiring a lot of discipline from his players, I could see new players struggling to adapt.

2127~~~
He started off pretty woefully. Got beaten in a 1v1 on an occasion that almost lead to a goal and was one of the contributing factors that led up to Vardy's goal. He should have shown more awareness of that pass coming in, which is quite appauling for someone who I have praised for his defensive awareness unlike Valencia. He got better and grew into the game, but his crosses were a bit sloppy at times and had 1 or 2 lapses in the second half. 

Clearly showing a dip in form but I am confident he can regain it.

2128~~~
those first couple of pages in this thread makes me laugh, hes absolutely dreadful attacking wise, not convincing defensively at all, he didnt have anything to do today though, not manutd quality, good squad player

2129~~~
He's playing on the wrong side, can you really blame him for not being good at crossing with his weak foot?

2130~~~
He's actually put in 2 great crosses. His average has not been bad at all.

2131~~~
Actually he's got more experience as LB than RB

2132~~~
All Damien's fault.

2133~~~
That was criminal noone even tried to get on the end of that great cross.

2134~~~
I thought he was solid

2135~~~
Fairly mediocre bar the one cross, at times he looks like a CB filling in at fullback.

2136~~~
Yeah, he was alright.

2137~~~
He was not bad today, couple of good and one great cross.

2138~~~
thought he was quite decent.

2139~~~
Got done a few times in the opening 65 mins like everyone else but I thought he was good today. Not just the crosses, of which more should have been done with them, but his covering across defensively at times and reading of situations is his biggest asset. He's the safest full back that we have at the club for that defensive structural mindset.

2140~~~
Honestly, it was an improved performance compared to the last few weeks.

Shame that he finally put in a brilliant cross and no one thought to fecking attack it.

2141~~~

2142~~~
His best game in a while. Worked really hard to get forward and support Lingard.

2143~~~
Darmian was decent enough. 

Criminal that no one was gambling on that ball he put across the 6 yard box.

Full-backs on the other side struggled though.

2144~~~
the most irritating thing about darmian is that he is so hesitant to overlap, he made a good run for memphis pass but Luke Shaw would be clear on goal twenty minutes before.. its just so annoying he cant time his runs well, and he was only slightly better with ball at his feet, hes got touch of dinosaurus. 

he improved in the second half but hes not manutd quality, half the player Clyne is and Im not his fan either.

2145~~~
He looks more at home going forward when playing on the left. A better game. His confidence is his biggest issue at present.

2146~~~
Shocking first half tbh, improved in second half, but still needs to do so much better when helping out our attack.

2147~~~
He is very very good defensively. He could improve going forward.

2148~~~
He was a bit shit again to be honest. He's just so... timid... especially going forward.

The hilarious thing about that was, he was completely disinterested in actually making a run/receiving the ball before it happened. Memphis had to basically shout at him and tell him to make a run.

2149~~~
suprisingly he looks much better going forward on the left than he does the right, he crosses quite well with his left and seems to prefer the dribbling option of coming inside on his right foot.

2150~~~
He was better today than recently but i would hope his performances keep going up in a sharp trajectory. I'm still not convinced he will ever be good enough going forward to be a first choice RB at United.

2151~~~
To be honest as under Moyes, hard to truly assess any player whilst playing under the straight jacket of LVG. Players are more worried bout getting things wrong than taking risks...

2152~~~
It was great to see some of the start of season-form from Darmian, i.e winning every single 1v1 defensively. It was impossible to go past him today, but you could see how hesitant he was to go forward when Martial (?) had to stop playing to point where Darmian should run ahead of his one great cross of the evening. 

I feel he's getting way too much critisism here for some reason.

2153~~~
Bollocks. Hasn't stopped Shaw, Young, Blind, Valencia, even Rojo flying forward from full back this season. Darmian just needs to find a bit more confidence in attack and make sure he doesn't pull up rather than make the run. Nothing wrong with his crossing in my view.

2154~~~
Best game in moths and hopefully this was a turning point for him and he is able to get back to the level he was playing at in the beginning of the season.

2155~~~
I don't know why but the two times I remember him at LB he has appeared to be much more willing to get involved in our attacking phase and offered more overlaps. Not sure if that is my mind playing tricks but he certainly played better yesterday than he has done recently.
In the first half he and Lingard even appeared to be building some sort of understanding and chemistry which is severely lacking in most of our combinations. I'd keep him there for the time being and see what comes of it.

2156~~~
He looked so bloody slow and lost defending against Moses after Blind had foolishly given the ball away. Just like on Vardy´s goal last week. He´s good 1 on 1, but such a liability against quick attackers. We see this same thing time and time again with him. We were very lucky Vic Moses went off injured.

Poor Championship level defending at 12 second mark.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FdM7EjNm1bk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2157~~~
He's the biggest flop in a while. Completely useless, dreadful offensively and defensively.

2158~~~
He was brilliant when he started so why is he definitely crap now?

2159~~~
People love shiny new toys. He could've just come on the pitch and shat a turd and everyone would've still been like 'he's so brilliant'. It was the same for Memphis as well in his few games, before people realise this is actually quite underwhelming. See Falcao and co's average rating at the start of last season too.

2160~~~
Another one bites the dust. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2161~~~
He needs to settle in to the PL, it's not as easy as everyone thinks playing in a new country and a new team. Even Martial went 8 games without scoring till tonight. It happens with new players.

Any news on how bad his injury is?

2162~~~
His lack of composure is very frustrating. Pissed me off with his hoofing of the ball when he could have brought the ball down and played it to feet.

2163~~~
Once again bear witness to his incredibly slow reaction and piss poor reading of the set up for Wolfie´s second goal. Draxler just blasts right by him to set up the goal. Darmian seems to be behind his man on half the goals scored on us. Dreadful defending. I can´t believe this myth still exists of him being a very good defender. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/4plp" width="560"></iframe>

2164~~~
Darmian's stalker is back! Any news on his injury?

2165~~~
What exactly is he being blamed for now (avg rating <5) ? He had no part to play in conceding any of those goals, notwithstanding that ridiculous clip that shows Draxler going past Depay, Schweinsteiger and Blind at lightning pace. The on time he got 1v1 with Draxler he came out on top.

2166~~~
Completely agree. Seems to have zero confidence with the ball at his feet both in attacking positions and when we have the ball in our own half.

In fact I'd argue that in terms of what he's done on the ball he has comfortably been our worst player this season. Needs to improve to make it as first choice fullback here. Didn't he come with a reputation of being quite good going forward!?

2167~~~
He seems to be the scapegoat. Last year it was Blind.

Now, like then, its a good barometer of who simply has an agenda.

2168~~~
Not sure what all the fuss about him was, he didn't do much wrong last night.

2169~~~
He is better than what he is showing IMO. He just needs confidence. He's been in a downward spiral now and just needs to pull himself out of it.

2170~~~
Yep. Likes to get forward and can put in a good cross.

He seems to be doing what a lot of players are doing and just leaving it to the likes of Blind, Carrick and Schweinsteger to build our plays. I can't see what he brings to this team going forward and I think there are questions marks about him defensively too.

2171~~~
Any news on his injury yet?

2172~~~
He's off form and short on confidence. Some of the criticism here is way over the top. 

Poor spell = player is a "fraud" and has never been any good.

2173~~~
The knee-jerks on this forum at times is unbelievable. Player starts very well, loses form and is obviously lacking confidence playing in a completely different country that is played at a much faster pace and suddenly he's shite? The whole team bar Martial, DDG and Smalling are lacking confidence and playing shite at the current time, doesn't mean they're all shite.

2174~~~
Clyne or him were my first choice for the RB position in the summer. He looked a good player whenever I saw him play for Italy. I also think that he started well for us, if only on the defensive side. His decline has been pretty steep, I can understand him still struggling in attack but the defensive side of his game has gone kaput. Which is all a bit strange. Looks like a player bereft of any confidence and struggling to come to terms playing in the premier league. Valencia being out doesn't help as he could have done with some rotation; and now with no LB's, he also has to substitute on the left.

I, personally, have confidence that he'll come good and in the long term prove to be a very good buy. Just needs time.

2175~~~
The strangest one about this transfer was all Serie A residents were singing his praises but from what I've seen he's shite. Give me Rafael any day of the week <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2176~~~
He's not been shite. Yes he has had some poor games the last month or so but to say he has been shite is very unfair.

2177~~~
Rafael who was constantly injured? He is still a good player (and a good defender) but like any other player (maybe except DDG, Smalling and Martial) far off his best form. This typical knee jerk reactions or writing off already is typical though

2178~~~
Draxler is his man. As soon as the ball is switched Darmian needs to go racing towards him and shut him down, and then shephard him down the line or stay with him enough to make the run difficult and not do as he pleases.

Instead he literally stands off him, and lets him run inside with the freedom of an American bald eagle. Only once he skips passed a statuesque Schweinsteiger does he realise "Oh wait that's actually the guy I should be marking, crap". By that point he's already played the 1-2 and he has no chance of recovering. 

It's really frustrating as he could have easily stopped that goal happening, but whether it was lazyness, being a coward of fear of getting a 2nd yellow he just did NOTHING. I dare say Borthwick-Jackson will have dealt with him better, and he did all that 2nd half. 

Darmian clearly isn't rubbish and he's just in bad form, but that just summed our whole night up defensively for me.

2179~~~
Hasnt been the same since Sanchez had his way with him.

2180~~~
Deserves the criticism he is getting but he also deserves a second season to prove himself.

2181~~~
The minutes under the belt wore important, another 5/10 performance though IMO.

2182~~~
I'd rather have Valencia at the moment.

2183~~~
Nothing special.

Out of position a couple of times when we had the ball. Left the attacking to Martial. Was gassed after 70 minutes or so.

2184~~~
i thought he was good today. did his defending well. went to the left side intelligently making sure he had cover behind. Getting backk from injury, i thought that was a reasonable performance. Of course ivanovice at RB was as effective as the ball boy on that side

2185~~~
He was positive getting forward. I'm happy with his attitude as much as anything else.

2186~~~
I thought he was better than a 5/10. Maybe only a 6/10 but there were some signs he was getting better I thought.

2187~~~
Will give him time, at least 1-2 seasons but I can't help but see signs of yet another decent/good player but not United quality.

2188~~~
he played the way he did when we first got him...before van Gaal brainwashed him.

God I hate that man.

2189~~~
Didn't notice him do much other than poor crosses and an unbelievably shocking piece of defending which helped allow Chelsea get completely through on goal by just running slowly up the pitch.

5/10 is generous. Like giving the bad kid in class a gold star because they go 5 minutes without disrupting the whole class.

I will give him time but I'm still trying to figure out what he's supposed to be good at, let alone whether he actually is or not.

2190~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.calciogazzetta.it/calcio-mercato/mercato-juve-si-vola-a-manchester-per-il-terzino/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.calciogazzetta.it/calcio-mercato/mercato-juve-si-vola-a-manchester-per-il-terzino/</a>

Basically, Juventus want him now that the Torino barrier is gone and we're not offering Champions League football.

2191~~~
Juve can feck off.

2192~~~
If we can get a better right back (especially attacking wise) then I wouldn't be against this.

2193~~~
If they send us Pogba and Coman then Darmian is all theirs.

2194~~~
Don't think we are in a good position to sell fullbacks. 

Evra was shocking at the start too so it would be mad to give up after 4 months

2195~~~
He was better in possession yesterday but he's still so limited in that regard. Even watching him in the warm up keep ball sessions and he sticks out like a sore thumb even in that. He wasn't really challenged defensively apart from the Matic chance where he was caught out of possession.

2196~~~
We'd be crazy as well as stupid if we sold him.

2197~~~
thank god someone wants him, #buybackrafa 
Also I like the looks of Concelo from Valencia, he's very skillfull attacking player, Nevs like to play him further forward but he could be made into a great fullback

2198~~~
To be fair he was filling in at left back and putting those deliveries in on his weak foot.

2199~~~
He would be cup tied anyway, makes no sense.

2200~~~
His passing and crossing are unacceptable at this level.

2201~~~
That is not a serious source

2202~~~
I thought he looked pretty lively out there. Maybe he suffers from philosophy more than we realise.

2203~~~
He looks worse when he plays at right back than he does at left back though. At left back he at least looks semi comfortable with what he's supposed to be doing

2204~~~
Interesting that came on as a CB, got roasted by Mo Farah though.

2205~~~
Was hoping he would come on later than he had to given hes just come back from injury (and had started against Chelsea). It also makes a mockery out of those who were hysterical that he didnt start (and then were wondering why he looked a little tired towards the end).

I dont think were helping him playing him both left and right and all the chopping and changing with our defence. He looked more solid when we had consistency of Shaw, Blind, Smalling and him. Think he will be our long term RB if we persist though.

Was weird he was subbed on as a CB though and we kept Blind LB (and then we changed it a while after)...

2206~~~
I remember the concern re: Vidic and Evra when they started, so willing to give this guy a pass. Let's see what happens next season, but Has to improve. Might be a loss of confidence at this point....

2207~~~
I hope his lack of form is just matter of adjusting to the Premier League. Any winger with pace seems to give him problem.

2208~~~
Thought he has been better the last 2 games then was in his shaky spell. At least now he looks hard to beat for opposing wingers again.

2209~~~
It looks exactly the other way around..
Lets hope he becomes at least a good squad player, right now he certainly isn't manchester united quality and looks a bit of waste of money, only sums up how shitty Italian league is..

2210~~~
Weird way to look at it.

2211~~~
He's been an absolute liability since that early burst of good form. Italians traditionally don't travel that well (in footballing terms at least). Hopefully we haven't already had as much from him as we're going to get.

2212~~~
He was all over the show when he came on and he looked very nervy towards the end.

2213~~~
He was absolutely atrocious when he came on. That Swansea attack when it was 1-1 where he repeatedly cleared it back to them because he was panicking, absolutely pathetic. Modou fecking Barrow had him on toast which is not good enough

2214~~~
He hasn't benefitted from a consistent run in one position.

There's a good defender in there, but it's not easy playing RB, then LB, then being benched, etc.

2215~~~
He played CB, RB and maybe even LB for a bit yesterday. He wasn't good but he didn't get a lot of time to settle.

2216~~~
Other than his early form he's been absolutely atrocious.

2217~~~
Another one that should be dropped until he proves himself but we can't afford that luxury right now.

2218~~~
I think I am in the few that think he will turn out good. His early form was no fluke and I am sure that once he is fully up to speed in the league he will be up there as one of the best defensive RBs.

We need to get consistency in our back line though.

2219~~~
It's a pity Valencia is injured, loved when we could rotate them for specific opponents. Also allowed us to take one out of the firing line when they were struggling for form.

He'll get better , and I think he'll play very well next season due to the confidence he'll gain from having a good Euros (hopefully)

2220~~~
This. 

I'm hoping it's a bit of form and confidence. By all accounts, he's an extremely shy and humble fella who didn't speak any English when he came. So generally, confidence & the environment plays a massive role in shy/humble people's performance levels. There's minimal arrogance to pull them out of a rut. I could well be over thinking it obviously, but for the money spent on him, at worst, he could be great cover to have for both RB and LB positions. 

But let's hope, after a season or so of settling in, hopefully having a very good right winger next season, he shows his worth as a starter.

2221~~~
Stop dicking about with his position, play him with a winger and you know what he might perform like a decent right-back.

2222~~~
Yep agree with you but worrying how much his level has dropped. I'd expect him to be more resolute at least.

2223~~~
I really like him. He has good defensive instincts and I think he will be a really solid full back for someone. He made one absolutely crucial tackle at 1-0 which saved a certain goal when Swansea played through United's high press.

He had one shambolic moment with the multiple poor clearances but generally I thought he played well. Hopefully he can get a good run at right back and nail the position down.

2224~~~
And bigoted. 

Tactically, he seems to have a very good understanding of the game, but his lack of athleticism lets him down in a league where almost every single winger is a freak athlete. He's kind of like Blind in that regard.

2225~~~
We have to understand that he is coming from a different league. The Serie A is by far one of the slowest leagues out there and have the highest average age in all the major European leagues. He is having to come up against wide players and attackers who are as described by DesiBD, relatively athletic freaks. His first couple of weeks were great because he was fresh and the games and training hadn't taken a toll on his body.

He will come good. He will be better if like most of our players that are relatively new to the league are given the benefit of doubt.

2226~~~
Fergie was rejuvenating the squad in a managed way though, the presence of other actual defenders allowing them to acclimatise more gradually. But then Van Gaal has made this mistake repeatedly since his arrival at United, be it a new signing or a youngster such concerns bear little weight with him. 

Either he should have kept Rafael, or brought in an experienced back-up who could cover both fullback positions. A contingency plan revolving around Valencia and Young, was unrealistic with regard to the former, and a waste of the latter's potential contribution.

2227~~~
I thought he looked pretty good defensively. He should have done a little better to stop the cross though.

2228~~~
He is a good defender, excellent when on form, but his crossing is awful, he has no culture with the ball at his feet.

2229~~~
If we get a right winger to play in front of him I can see him coming good but the way we set up now with one player handling that whole right hand side on his own his offensive play just is to limited for that role.

2230~~~
I wonder how much his quick accumulation of bookings affected him and his natural game. 

We all agree he was at his best in the beginning of the season, if you remember he was a proper bastard of a defender early on with shirt pulling and the like. When he came back from suspension he wasn't the same bastard.

2231~~~
The Italians made defending an art.  I hope he will come good.

2232~~~
I ll give him another season easily.

2233~~~
Bild are saying Bayern want him and hats he's unhappy. WTF. He plays every week.

2234~~~
He doesn't

2235~~~
Rafael couldn't displace Valencia when he was here. And I hear he has been Poor for Lyon too.

2236~~~
That's a bit out of the blue if true (hey that rhymes). 

Once he finds his groove again he'll be right as rain. But can he find that groove...

2237~~~
Rafael is actually doing well in Lyon and is a fan favourite


Lyon as a team haven't been good though

2238~~~
nope

2239~~~
Some of the people I play FIFA with arent happy though. They prefer Jallet to him. Plus they complain he is injured always too

2240~~~
Don't think he has missed a game barely since early October

2241~~~
They were in direct competition for only 1 season, and LvG decided (after Leicester and Vardy cheated a penalty out of Rafael) that he couldn't trust him.

2242~~~
He is currently injured.

Rafael played games even after that. He was just injured a lot and once Valencia came, he couldn't displace him.

2243~~~
Yes, but your wording seems to imply that this was the case for the 4-5 years Rafael was at the club. Moyes started moving Valencia to RB when chasing games (usually we did worse after that), and LvG used him there regularly. 
The number of big and small mistakes that Valencia made in that position was astonishing and I couldn't believe he was not dropped. 
Under SAF the reserve RBs were Jones, Smalling, and Fletcher, in that order. I think Valencia played 1-2 times at RB under SAF in the 4 years he was his manager.

Hes one of the least of our worries. Hes quick and a very solid defender, he just needs time to adapt to the pace of the league. He has clearly struggled with his stamina after a good start.

The complaints about his attacking ability are missing a huge point - thats not his job right now. When Neville was marauding forward he had Beckham covering him. As soon as Ronaldo came along he became much more selective about when he went forward as he knew Ronaldo couldnt be relied on to the cover the space. Darmian has Mata in front of him.

Next season, once hes used to the pace and he (hopefully) has a better winger in front of him he will be a cracking player.

2245~~~
Spot on, Sir. Once we have a proper RW, Matteo will play much better football.

2246~~~
Strongly disagree.He would do better with a better right winger in front of him, no debate about that.However he doesn't have much offensive qualities to start with.Very ordinary.The main concern still should be to get his defensive nous back though.

2247~~~
My wording was that when they both became competitors, Rafael couldn't displace Valencia. While Valencia did make mistakes, he was overall very good. Rafael had been average since SAF left and injured 80% of the time it would seem. Last season Valencia grew into the role and by the end of the season was more consistent than Rafael had been for 2 years. He made mistakes yes like the pass to Welbeck and stuff but it's not like Rafael wouldn't have made mistakes. Even Gary Neville in his prime made mistakes.

2248~~~
Not only that - Shaw's injury has clearly affected memphis in a similar way. 

Also,  having a RW marauding with the ball will flatten and attract the opposition defenders in a way currently mata is not doing.  It will give space to the whole team RB to LW.

2249~~~
We dont know what his offensive ability is really like yet. Theres no way he will attack freely knowing that if the space he leaves is scored from he will be crucified, as im sure he saw happen to Luke Shaw after Swansea (i think). At the moment he looks like hes not sure what he should be doing.

2250~~~
Seconded.

2251~~~
Rather, he was prevented from displacing Valencia by Van Gaal. That as the season progressed Rafael could barely make it onto the bench ahead of McNair, was suggestive of some irreconcilable problem. But if one had borne a little though for Valencia's own injury record, as well as his limitations as an RB, the expectations of Darmian were clearly too high (a player new to the league).


Indeed he did, and was one of our better players against Chelsea IIRC (his best performances are a level above anything we've seen since). Rafael was not "injured a lot" though, as he spent months either playing for the U-21s or in pursuit of Van Gaal's elusive idea of match rhythm or some such.


Two DMs and a wide player would much sooner be cutting inside when given the opportunity, does not that increase the need for suitably effective fullback in attack?

I'm not blaming Darmian really, he's a victim of his manager's contradictory policies, yet he shall need to improve his contribution offensively to be a success here at United in my opinion.

2252~~~
finding his feet?

2253~~~
You'd hope so considering the level of the opposition.

I'd rather not use lower league opposition to start judging our players. Van Gaal and a few here had decided McNair was going to be our future right back after looking good against Cambridge, then looked shit whenever he played there against anyone decent.

2254~~~
He certainly looks better offensively when there's some runs being made for him. Bodes well for the future imo. Especially when a future manager brings a more offensive play style.

2255~~~
He still looks like a deer in headlights to me when he gets the ball. He has a nervous first touch and doesn't have much of a picture in his head of what he wants to do.

Saying that though when he has time he did pick a lovely ball for rooneys run, and and has been pretty solid defensively so far.

2256~~~
With an actual RW in front of him, we will, hopefully, be able to see the best of him. Both He and Mata lack pace and its hurts us quite a bit on that side of the pitch.

2257~~~
you got it all wrong mate, rafael's been a bright spark for them this season, when fit, and it was always a NO competition between him and Valencia when he was fully fit but there was this short spell after the leicester game when Valencia was given a preference by manager for no particular reason, the same he did with Herrera, Depay etc..

it was shocking decision to replace Rafael with someone as shit as Darmian who is also a year older than Brazilian..

2258~~~
Great player. Had our only shot on target, so far.

2259~~~
Only positive today.

2260~~~
Played much better, Blind and memphis have been decent, other than that.

2261~~~
I thought he was poor much like the rest of the team

2262~~~
he had better of games but the fact is that he didnt have to do ANYTHING defensively having played good old Young there he would tear them apart. For me it's still absolutely shocking how bad Darmian's dribbling is, also is never synced with attacking players, tend to be on his heels alot when comes to attacking moves, but he put in some good balls in today as well as nice little through ball to rooney so hopefully he starts picking his confidence back, that doesn't really mean we shouldn't look into market for a proper fullback of MUTD quality

2263~~~
I thought he offered virtually nothing going forward again today.

No idea what others were watching. Might improve defensively as he settles but i just don't see an attacking fullback in him.

2264~~~
He was dropped because he was injured. Not for no reason. In fact we had rarely not played him when fit. He was injured around New Year and Valencia took his chances and Rafael couldnt displace Valencia from then on. 

As for Rafael at Lyon, My friends who support Lyon complain about his defending and fitness. they say he is unnecessarily too offensive and doesnt support the backline when they need him to.

2265~~~
Really? He was 90% in the opposition half and I thought he overlapped well too. He showed great pace many times and even got in a shot on target, albeit a poor one.

2266~~~
Until Memphis came on he looked the most likely to create something.

2267~~~
I might ask the same question mate, what game were you watching ? He made some good overlapping runs. He completely beat a man for pace in a piece of play (but it could have been just a very slow opposition fullback all the same) Managed to get the first shot on target. I know it is against Sheffield and it can in no way, indicate how good he is. But was decent overall.

2268~~~
His crossing was much better today. Fizzed 3 or 4 great balls in to good areas. We're lousy at attacking crosses though. No wonder most of the wide players cut in side. There's just no point in trying.

2269~~~
He was bloody abject today. Couldn't be arsed to break into a sprint half the time.

2270~~~
Crossing was better today. Still struggles with basic passes and controlling a football. His first touch is horrific, just seems so panicked in possession

2271~~~
We really shouldn't be lamenting a full back for not being a brilliant attacker. That's not his job. It's a small part of it, but he shouldn't be judged on it. His lack of attacking contribution is emphasised by the fact that he's mostly isolated on that side or has to partner with Mata (not a fecking right winger, Louis!) to initiate some form of an attack.

2272~~~
How many good games has he actually had if we discount pre-season?

2273~~~
I thought that was a big improvement over his recent performances.

2274~~~
Better, great pass to Rooney and a couple decent crosses. It's just really irritating to see no linkup or connection between our right sided players.

2275~~~
Him and Mata are not a good combination at all. 

I think he would play far better if he had an actual winger in front of him.

2276~~~
Is anybody else really worried about his low stamina? towards the end of the game he went completely missing and just decided to stay back, leaving lingard 2v1 on that flank. While Rafael wasn't perfect Atleast he flew forwards for 90 minutes, same for Valencia.

Don't think he's used to being so attacking all the time, I guess in Italy he was used to sitting back more and doing his fair share of defending

2277~~~
See that's where I completely disagree. In today's game and for a possession based team like ours fullbacks play a huge part in attacking. Look at other fullbacks in teams that dominate possession over the years and today : Alves, Zabaleta, Kolarov, Sagna, Lahm, Bellerin, Monreal, Marcelo, all contribute massively to attacks.

2278~~~
Exactly. Full backs are basically 2nd wingers these days, If you can't attack properly for a big team you're pretty useless.

2279~~~
Valencia played well as a fullback for a large part of last season, and wasnt just put into the team for no reason.

Look at his thread from last season. It's merely the case that a lot of people wanted him to fail, and when he did make a mistake against Arsenal, people came out with the pitchforks. Just check the general trend of comments yourself

Rafael is a good player, a tad overrated on the Caf though. He's got his own frailities beyound injuries. 

Surely Darmian should get some patience as he's only 6 months .

I fear a lot of the hate stems from the same hate Valencia got last season. It's because of who they replaced. The Rafa love in means that whoever we got in was bound to be scrutinized beyond reason.

2280~~~
Valencias 6/10 performances we all remember, here and there 7/10 and shocker from time to time, we got used to lower standard, if you watch how Rafael played, how proper modern right back plays in fact you would see the difference but I have comfirmed it here many times people have short short memories, and are able to cirtisize players for being injured and in the end just settle for lower standards. I wasn't critisizing Valencia much he did his best there but his inability to use his brain was absolutely unpardonable and I was furious we couldn't use that right hand side even more with Mata and Herrera in form.. If Darmian will ever reach the level what Rafa showed us unfortunately only for two seasons due to injuries, he wasn't struggling with any of the top players, like Ronaldo/Bale, Hazard defensively and showed like three times more in terms of attacking.. if darmian ever be close to that level I will consider a success..

Yes people love rafa for his dedicated etc. but also like to remember his world class performances, it's the other half of people who only remembers one rush challenge there and a lot of time being sidelined.

Anyway it's just a waste of time to explain some people this frustration from lack of quality at fullback position, some people get excited from very little..

2281~~~
Being in the opposition half against a team like Sheffield who were camping in and around their own box really doesn't mean much. He didn't have much to do defensively so obviously he was going to be in their half most of the time.

He contributed a few overlaps and a few crosses fair enough but against a team like this i would expect more. Much more.

How many times did he receive the ball and just turn around and pass it straight back to whoever gave it to him right away. Too many is the answer and it's frustrating as feck. Even against a team like this he didn't offer much going forward, vs better opposition he gets forward even less.

He just doesn't seem like a very attacking fullback, which for me is a big problem. We mostly play with 2 deep midfielders so our fullbacks should be bombing forward all the time and stretching the opposition. Shaw was doing it quite well before his injury, Darmian doesn't. It's at least partly why we are so shit going forward, and have a hard time breaking teams down.

To be honest to me he still looks like a CB playing RB.

2282~~~
It's the 6/10 performances the Caf remembers. They have stuck in their brains the times where he didn't perform as well as a winger and can't forget it even to the depths of forgetting that he was an extremely important player to us a few seasons back. Last season he was a very good right back last season. His Whoscored rating for last season is <b>7.23</b>. Far better than the Caf believes. Compare this to <b>7.05</b> for Rafael the season before last and you see where I am coming from.

2283~~~
You cant argue this because you dont really have a point and are one of those Rafael fanboys I am talking about and where having digs against Darmian even as early as August.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/matteo-darmian-2015-16-performances.406447/page-28#post-17952694">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/matteo-darmian-2015-16-performances.406447/page-28#post-17952694</a>

This is what you were saying about him in August.

This are the kind of "fans" I dont get. Getting so attached to a player badly that they will go on a hate fueled agenda against whoever replaces him. 

Rafael is gone. Let it go.

2284~~~
He seems nervous to me alot of the time on the pitch. Doesn't look very attacking either, maybe it's because he mostly played as a wingback in a 3 defender system.
I still want to see what he can offer next season when he has fully adapted, if his performances haven't improved by this time next year we should look elsewhere.

For now i prefer Valencia who is pretty average, but has the pace and attacking sense to perform with Mata on the right.

2285~~~
and so far I am not ashamed for what I have said, he proved to be an average player for average team not Manchester United, if he progress well I'd be surprised and will in fact like to be proved wrong, as I only want the best for this team, he might become a good squad player but someone younger  with more energy and ability will sooner or later be bought to be a real competition and to take over from him, he was massively overrated here from the beginning like Blind who will soon be seen as a squad player, once we strengthen in position he can play. 

When you see player like Bellerin who is already twice player Darmian is you can see how average he is and what potential he can realistically reach. Debuchy level but as I said lets hope he can prove me wrong in coming years but Id certainly buy him a competition, or give chances to some youngsters like Reid but cant really say atm how ready our younsgters are as I havent followed them that closely this year.

You can buy squad players but you need quality as well, Darmian is hardly an exciting prospect from the beginning..

2286~~~
if you judge players according to whoscored then amen, for me he's still solid player but shouldn't be obviously no1 option for any position. I have no complaints about having player capable of good run of okay games, being consistent but then you need a player who is a bit different quality and Darmian is another 6/7 out of 10, Rafael in his best season had basically MOTM performance every second game and I dont judge player according to teletext, whoscored or anything else..

2287~~~
I'm not judging him based on whoscored. I'm judging him based on how I see him play and they way to back up how I feel is by using this statistic.

2288~~~
How can he prove you wrong when you have been on a witch hunt from the very start?

Your comments are simply that of a jilted Rafa fan who would criticize anyone that did come in.

Rafael is gone, let go. He's was a decent little player for us, but other than one season, was never consistently world class for us either. 

Or just watch the Lyon games instead,

2289~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/10125985/matteo-darmian-insists-manchester-united-are-happy-with-start-to-2016" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/football/n...anchester-united-are-happy-with-start-to-2016</a>

Good read. Lad is working hard and really wants to make a name for himself here. Finding his groove after the hamstring. Give him a season, hopefully him and Shaw will be bombing down our flanks soon

2290~~~
I like that he note he wants to get back to his performance in the start of the season, he was really good in the first few games.

2291~~~
The reason he gives it backwards or sideways so often is because, his supposed partner, Mata completely goes missing in that flank. He drifts inwards and usually it is only Herrera that offers any options.

Also we don't exactly play with two deep midfielders. One tends to stay higher up than the other. In the game against Sheffield, that was BFS who played a little higher up (Since he has a natural tendency to close down opponents). Occasionally, Felli and him swap places.

I agree it is probably not good enough, but you can't fault the poor guy because his supposed attacking outlet is hardly ever present.

2292~~~
A half season and I have seen 1 nice cross. 0 dribbles 0 good link up and some hit and miss defending.

He has been average to slightly below. And it's criminal that a Manchester United fullback either cant attack or is not allowed.

i really want to like him but he is just too vanilla so far. He does. Get a pass because he is new but very underwhelming so far.

2293~~~
Darmian was given easy ride from everyone else, how was he on witch hunt, if you mean by me, then okay. I didn't make it easy for him but latest performances have proved me right that he is nothing special and will rather become someone backing up LB and RB than someone making hte position his own, one more interesting thing is that he doesn't have any competition after Valencia got injured and he still couldn't make apeparances over Young who only just started palying there, it's Valencia's case as well! Varela given a go too. And yes I know he's been injured/suspended for a couple of weeks..

It's not about giving him stick from the beginning for no reason, was a bit harsh I admit but it wasn't as ridiculous as other people's praise for average to  decent performances from the start and even before his start, must have been his likeable Italian face or a fact that our only next rightback is for most of the people here very frustrating Valencia and the second one always injured Rafael, it was the relief we have finally someone else, who atleast can stay fit and of course everybody believed in him from the start, it was almost like with Blind hen we bought him we didn't have midfielders at all, so everyone was excited to see a new player there so even decent games were fantastic performances from him, where is he now, he's last option in midfield and only because Luke Shaw is injured he has a chance to play leftback here and there and centerback which looks like his position now but only until Rojo, Jones get back fit or we actually buy someone of better quality to partner Smalling. 

So I hope for the same situation with Darmian we buy him a young fresh talent with higher potential and let them fight for that spot, Valencia is already that squad palyer on that right hand side, and that doesn't make sense to have two squad players, LAV won't raise his game and Darmian might but we need someone as hungry as Bellerin. But I guess its not easy to find that kind of rightback in todays market or perhaps we identified thw wrong one. I currently like the looks of Joao Cancelo from Valencia btw. 

And I have seen Lyon play three times this year and Rafael was decent and maybe man of the match against Valencia when they knocked them out of Champions league, watch that game if you dont believe me and dont just tell me to watch him when you yourself dont or will you claim you do?

2294~~~
He does the same whoever plays in front of him, including with Lingard in the second half. Yesterday there was at least a dozen occasions when he was given the ball out wide with a bit of space in front of him where he could have taken the fullback on and maybe stretched the opposition. More often than not though he just passed it back inside.

One plays a bit further forward no doubt but both are still pretty deep. Whenever we have the ball one will drift forward but between Bastian, Morgan and Carrick they very very rarely make runs into the box. So when the opposition attacks both our CM's are generally close to our defenders.

In our current set up we have basically 6 out of the 10 players geared towards defence more than attack.

Look i hope he comes good for us i really do. And i don't think it's his fault if he's not very attacking we should have known this before buying him. But i just don't see him ever providing the attacking outlet we need out there or indeed lasting very long here if he can't adapt his game.

2295~~~
Was awful in the build-up late and was far too slow defensively.

Really poor.

2296~~~
Is he carrying an injury or something? Must have lost nearly all his 50-50 challenges today. And he's so fecking soft in his defensive play. Really starting to lose my faith in him.

2297~~~
He was gash again today... but then he's been gash for a while.

Really struggling to adapt to the pace and power of this league. Next season will hopefully be a different story.

2298~~~
he seems really off the pace, like if he played testimonial, he's as quick as carrick, horrible waste of money and people thought it was a bargain

2299~~~
So, so bad. What was doing for the cross leading up to the last goal. Any pace and he's toast.

2300~~~
He cant defend or attack. Every time someone attacks him you know a cross is coming in.

2301~~~
Whenever he plays on the right, he tends to be okay. Not always brilliant, but at least okay. 

Whenever deployed on the left he struggles. I would've carried on with CBJ.

2302~~~
You'd find lads playing Sunday league who have better stamina than him.

2303~~~
He's not that good is he...

2304~~~
Poor at both ends of the pitch tonight.

2305~~~
He's been absolutely dreadful for some time now. Bar his very early season form, he's looked a complete and utter dud.

2306~~~
Why didn't we put Rafa on a pay as you play contract? I still don't get it. He's got more fight and spirit then this lad. He's a nice lad but he's like a deer in headlights. He needs more aggression and quality. His mistake in the second half, was someone not focusing properly on where they are on the pitch

2307~~~
It seems like he has difficulty with clearing the ball, and ends up passing it to the opposition attack.

Just put your fecking foot through it.

2308~~~
Unfortunately <a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a>'s assessment of him so far is proving to be spot on.

He's not really good at anything.

2309~~~
He reminds me of that Liverpool player Dossena.

2310~~~
Reminds me of Paula Ferrera of Chelsea

2311~~~
Another from Serie A. I really have no interest in Serie A, but looking at players like Cuadrado & Darmian I just don't think they translate too well to the English league.

2312~~~
I wonder if more will start to realise that Valencia is actually a very good full back compared to alternatives here or elsewhere.

2313~~~
Strange that he was so good when he first played for us, and now looks not really up to it. Is an Italian international, I wonder what happened since he joined, especially with his confidence.

2314~~~
I wonder if the Luke Shaw injury shook him or something... because he's been an absolute fanny ever since roughly around that time.

2315~~~
Give him time,  Evra took a while to settle.

2316~~~
Shits himself every single time, when we're under the slightest bit of pressure.

2317~~~
This is where I'm pinning my hopes too.

2318~~~
He looked like am absolute bargain at the beginning of the season. Weird how he's regressed,  he looked unbeatable.

2319~~~
Just doesn't look anywhere near as athletic to me. Modern full backs are probably the most dynamic players in a football team, and he's neither quick nor strong.

2320~~~
Although his was fit far more than he was inured last season, i reckon he'd have accepted such an arrangement if that's what it took to restore his credibility in that regard. The guy clearly wanted to stay at the club, and he epitomised those attacking qualities that a fan wishes to see, but was forced out.

2321~~~
Who knows, it could have something to do with it. But I think he is a good player maybe it is a confidence issue. I hope so as confidence can be regained.

2322~~~
When we first signed him.. I mentioned that he looked slow as feck in his YouTube vids and I was worried how he'd adapt to the PL.

He blew me away in preseason so I thought nothing of my initial impression.  Same goes for Depay. Big shame.

2323~~~
We should not have sold Rafael. At least not until Darmian was fully settled in and had shown that he was competent.

2324~~~
I hope so. Doesn't get the recognition he deserves.

2325~~~
In comparison to what Darmian is serving up this season, it's making Valencia look like Cafu.

Valencia did well last season but he shouldn't really be our long term first choice either. Hopefully we can find a really good RB in the near future if Darmian doesn't work out.

2326~~~
I think he has the potential to be a really good player. Some players I don't think will ever make it but I think he is decent.

2327~~~
He was our only solid defender today bar that absolute fecked up pass.

2328~~~
I think it's really unfair that we are on his back without considering other factors. Coming a relatively aged and slower Serie A, Darmian would always need at least a year to find his feet. We saw his potential at the start of the season, before the rigours of the PL hit him. Like all of our new foreign players I say we gave them a season to fully adjust eg Memphis, Martial etc.

2329~~~
Don't know what you're on about mate, like a couple other of posters above me and probably a lot more think: he hasn't been that bad this season.

Sure, he's played a few bad passes and has been caught out of position once or twice in his last few games, and he definitely needs to work on the fact he gives away too many fouls and struggles going forward at times, but he's been okay. He'll probably be very good once he's adapted to a different country, league and style.

2330~~~
To be fair to him he's being played at LB when he was bought as a RB. Having your position changed every other week isn't doing him any favours.

2331~~~
For my money he has been awful since september. I also hope he settles in and vastly improves. But that doesn't change my opinion on what i have seen from him this season so far.

For the most part he has been a non entity in an attacking sense and weak in defence. Thought he was poor again tonight, especially for the 3rd goal. And his panicked clearances are as bad or worse than anything people on here were ripping Evans apart for last season.

All in my opinion of course feel free to disagree.

2332~~~
He's been shite for for a good few months. Completely useless defensively and going forward. 

Clyne would have been a better option. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at those who thought he could get into Bayern's team.

2333~~~
I've held the hope that he will improve and show any sign of being a decent defender and/or even slightly competent on the ball but have to say I'm losing hope.

Just nowhere near good enough.

2334~~~
People are being too harsh on him, he wasn't that bad. I'm sure once he settles in he will become a great player for us.

2335~~~
I can understand hoping he'll become a great player but find it hard to understand how you can be <i>sure</i> he will.

2336~~~
This. Give him 12 months at least, he hasn't been that bad.

2337~~~
I agree. I thought he had a poor game against Liverpool but when I came on here, everyone was raving about him. It all unravelled at the next game where it seems he got blamed for both PSV goals.

I think there were a a couple of games after that where he was either made to swap flanks or taken off at half time for being poor.

There was also the Arsenal performance where I thought he was largely responsible for two goals.

2338~~~
Started well then faded and has not been any better than McNair level. Which considering he's a full Italian international is disappointing, hopefully he kicks on and it's just a case of settling in. But I like my defenders to have a basic level that they just don't go below when playing poorly (getting the basics right and doing simple things properly) and Darmans basic level is way below what I thought it would be.

2339~~~
Rafael needed to be sold to be fair we have been very unlucky with both Valencia (injury) Darmain (being poor). We also have Jones as a third stand in and he's been injury prone. But the biggest injury prone was Rafael. We needed to move on we just haven't bought the proper replacement and for my money that was Coleman all day long!

2340~~~
He alternated between right and left all the time before he came here. He should be used to both positions by now.

2341~~~
Since it's the same story for all our players, I suspect that the tactical work is pretty shit at carrington.

2342~~~
I hope he settles and delivers.

I'm afraid that buying from a Serie A is bound to fail due to the differences of speed and intensity of the Premier League. I struggle to find a player in the past 5-6 years or maybe even more than that who has come directly from the Serie A and found success in England.

Which makes me wary every time we are linked with a player from the Italian League, it seems an easier league to excel in these days, probably due to its slower nature.

2343~~~
I think the club is too big for him. Micky Thomas syndrome.

2344~~~
Not worried about this guy at the minute, he'll get at least a season of patience from me before writing him off. It's not just sides he's switching almost every game but usually the winger ahead of him too.

2345~~~
He spent reasonable time playing LB/LWB in Torino so it doesn't really make sense to make apologies on this account. What's more I reckon he was bought exactly for the reason to cover both fullback positions. It's not helping him much to build some kind of partnership with whoever would play ahead of him but position wise it's exactly the same gameplay, it is much tougher to play a striekr or in the hole next week or CB/fullback than both fullbacks..

2346~~~
I hope that Smalling penalty decision is engraved in his brain. He has gotten away with a few similar, no even more blatant incidents.

2347~~~
Seems to enjoy the PL. Even though he says it's a difficult championship he would like to continue on.So puts those Juve rumours to bed.

2348~~~
Massive mistakes and positional issues in every game now, regardless of which side he plays on. If he doesn't acclimatise and improve over the next few months and start next season well then we'll likely ship him off to Italy post haste.

2349~~~
Nah our most injury prone player is and was Jones. I'm sure Rafael was sold more for other reasons, maybe his attacking nature and risky passing more than his injury record.

If he was discarded for his injury record alone then Jones should have been out the door with him, thats if Phil managed to make it through the door without tripping on the step and injuring himself for 6 weeks.

2350~~~
To be fair he has a hand in conceding a goal in almost every game he plays. Their third goal last night came from a move which he could have easily cleared.

2351~~~
Its the EPL, he's not used to this intensity. He was good at the beginning of the season because everyone was still coming up to speed.

2352~~~
Ok maybe he is just shite.

2353~~~
He's shite and brainless, the level is way too high for him.

2354~~~
Big liability.

2355~~~
He's caused 90% of our problems in defence. He shouldn't be anywhere near the team.

2356~~~
It doesn't help that he is played in the other wing. His worst performances have come while he was playing as left back and also while we were struggling. 

This isn't the real Darmian IMO, he is much better than this and will prove it, given time.

2357~~~
Hopefully he'll be a little more settled now he's on the right.

2358~~~
Looking worse and worse every game.

2359~~~
Positioning and decision making just woeful.

2360~~~
A real worry at times isn't he

Just seems to go missing and isn't strong enough in one on ones

2361~~~
Constantly out of position, I don't know what he's doing.

2362~~~
"One of the best Full Backs in Europe"

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's just shite.

2363~~~
It doesnt look good for him at the moment, but with a settled back line and him on the right side next season, i hope to see the best of him again.

2364~~~
He will never be world class for us if we dont just settle on one position for him and let him have a run there. This whole utility player is great for squad players, not for people we expect to be starters.

2365~~~
Rather poor imho
Reason why no other big team were competing for him

2366~~~
He's not a left back. It's simple, there's a reason why his best performances for us (albeit months ago now) came at RB...

2367~~~
He was dogshite at RB as well, even worse in fact. CBJ looks more composed which says a lot.

2368~~~
Today? Thats going to happen, hes switching from position to position. He basically needs a run of games in one position is what im saying, not LB, then RB, then back to LB, then again RB.

Much like all our players. Imagine if we had played Evra RB half way through his first season, and then switched back and forth.

2369~~~
He was excellent in the second half, for all the shitness in the first. Should just play at RB.

2370~~~
Very good in the second half. Well done to him.

2371~~~
Need to stuck in more and show the opposition that he is not to be mess with. Seem to give too much space to opponent sometimes

2372~~~
Yeah much better second half from him than what he has shown recently.

2373~~~
I think he's struggling with the intensity of the PL a bit but got better when he switched to RB, even though I think offensively he often looks better at LB.

2374~~~
Looked a lot better at RB. With Young injured we'll probably see more of him there and CBJ at LB.

2375~~~
Hmmmm... a RB gets slated for a performance at LB... What am I missing? 

Very good second half performance.

2376~~~
He did that a bit too much at the beginning and was giving away too many fouls and getting too many cards. Him and the coaching staff seem to be searching for the right balance based on how differently he's defending.

2377~~~
Played well in his position. 

wonder what the key words in that sentence are..

2378~~~
He's too good looking for a defender. Just adding my two cents. Needs to rough himself up a bit,  grow a beard,  meet up with Carlos Tevez for a fistfight or something.

2379~~~
Said it in the matchday thread, looks much better on the right. Especially his positioning. Was far too narrow on the left, and every one on one went by him. On the right, he was much stronger, knew where to be, anticipated the one on ones better. Looked more like the Darmian form the first 6 games or so in the 2nd half.

2380~~~
Shave his head like Cannavaro did!

2381~~~
You must have missed that monstrosity of a beard he is attempting at the moment!

I've been a critic, and he was horrific in the first half, worst player on the pitch. Looked better on the right and improved, like the rest of the team. But still got easily beaten a couple of times out wide

2382~~~
Far better in the second half. People should give him some time, he's come into a below par team and I don't think Van Gaal has done him many favours. Up until about 12 months ago Nacho Montral was a similar case: a bit weak, lily-livered and didn't look up to the rigours of English football. But he got  through it and is now probably the best LB in the league.

2383~~~
I'm convinced that's because he was moved to right back.

2384~~~
Poor again today was an accident waiting to happen. Better at RB in the second half.

I was under the impression this guy has played full seasons at left back and was comfortable there?

2385~~~
He's played LB a lot in his career.

2386~~~
Average first half, very good second half.

2387~~~
Playing LB in Serie A is most likely very different from playing there in the PL (Also, I'm certain he played left wing back as opposed to outright left back). He's a right back, first and foremost, and should play there.

2388~~~
Worried that he hasn't looked settled. Hopefully, its just him settling into his first season in the PL.

2389~~~
He's not a patch on Rafael yet. I really wish we didn't sell him.

He just looks so tired all the time? He's chasing shadows quite often and lacks any real aggression in his tackles. Too many times he loses battles or let's his man run inside without any real pressure.

Attacking wise too he is always so sheepish on the ball and hardly gives any supporting forwards runs because of his low stamina, really worrying.

2390~~~
It is a bit worrying.

It just seems he doesn't have anything in his game to be anything more than 'solid'. And while there is nothing wrong with 'solid' for a fullback, it really has to be combined with consistency.

I am hoping it's just that he's being moved from side to side and often doesn't have a real winger ahead of him with movement, but I am worried that it's more than that.

2391~~~
This, basically.

He looks knackered half the time. 

His technique and passing i average, and his positioning in defense, which was fine at the start of the season, is below average. In terms of physical attributes, he is too sluggish off the mark although his top speed is decent. He was outpaced by Clyne who i no more than decent in terms of pace. He's a bit of an old school fullback, but not great at that either. Rafael was much, much better, and I doubt he would/could have been much more injured this season either.

2392~~~
Him and CBJ as full backs worked well

Would allow Young to play right wing so we can drop Lingard and Mata

2393~~~
Was outstanding in that second half. Onwards and upwards, hopefully.

2394~~~
He's been utter wank since September.

2395~~~
I can see Darmian pulling himself together next season but for now it's white knuckles all the time.  I'm happy to have him on the squad but I really don't see him being an upgrade at all on Rafael.

2396~~~
Looked better at RB. Would not have surprised me had LvG taken him off after the first 45 as a LB.

2397~~~
He was better than the first half no doubt but lets not get crazy.

2398~~~
Seemed much, much better on the right.

I'm expecting big this from him next season once we get a pacy, tricky right winger and Shaw is back to stretch the opposition on the other side.

2399~~~
Relax.  Not even been 5 months of playing time here. 

After seeing how shite vidic & evra was -  i would not judge anyone so quickly.

2400~~~
This is somwthing ive been trying to say about our RW sotuation & how it effects memphis & martial alot.  No one on the right side will stretch the line across atm.

2401~~~
Use him as RB and give him a suitable RW (not named Lingard or Mata), and we'll see how he fares.

During the last WC, he and Candreva were tearing up that right flank, and created a lot for Italy.

2402~~~
The same could be said when Valencia was the main focus of attacks. He's good at exploiting space. But if nobody is stretching play on the other flank then he's going to fail when it lands on him to dribble past players.

2403~~~
He's much better at right and that's his strength moving him to left doesn't help any.
Bringing in the CB and move Blind to LB or Shaw's return would keep him play at his natural position.

2404~~~
I think he'll have a good Euros.

Hopefully that confidence helps him adjust better next season.

2405~~~
Definitely played much better on the right. Defensively speaking I don't have any complaints about him. The occasional lapse in concentration or bad pass, but its to be expected for a newcomer to the league and in our team. My only complaints with him is his attacking, which has improved a bit in recent weeks I think. Definitely needs Shaw back so its not all on him though.

2406~~~
He should play on the right. LvG should stop acting like a d**k

2407~~~
I know he's played LB before, but I don't think he should be considered anything but a right back. I think Shaw's injury really did scupper LvG's defensive plans, especially in those wider positions. Would prefer players who excel in one position rather than players who can 'do a job' in many.

When Shaw's back he'll either be RB, or not in the team.

2408~~~
Doesn't look like he's playing with confidence and not aggressive enough. Evra had way  smaller build but in defence he was an animal.

2409~~~
<b>
</b>
That is always likely happen when you knowingly go into a season with only two recognized fullbacks one of whom is a bit injury prone.

2410~~~
just quoting this incase LVG reads Redcafe

2411~~~
Read it? I'd wager he uses it as motivational material.

2412~~~
His ability on the ball is non-existant. If a opposition player gets within about 10 yards of him, he just hoofs the ball to the opposition goalkeeper.

2413~~~
I just think the stage is too big for him. He looked terrified in his first interview for the club and he looks terrified on the pitch. Some players can't cope with the glare and pressure of playing for a major club.

2414~~~
You could also view that as Rooney (long ball), Martial (channel), Fellaini (mid range diagonal) and Lingard (near side) giving him no options.

He seems to suffer away from the right back position though. His versatility is good but his performances away from his main position really suffer.

2415~~~
Sometimes that is the case but there were a few times where he seemed to just panic and smashed the ball forwards to no one.

2416~~~
He's really regressed into one of the worst defenders to play regularly for us in years.

2417~~~
Having a complete meltdown today. What the hell happened to him? He'll be sold soon if he doesn't step up

2418~~~
I could be wrong but I don't remember him being so terrible on the ball at the start of the season. I was actually happy with the way he always looked to pass forward compared to the days of Valencia passing it backwards/sideways all the time.

2419~~~
I don't remember having to say this before for a supposedly solid defender but that was great defending.

2420~~~
Yeah, threw himself right into it. Fair play.

2421~~~
Long might have cracked a rib there.

2422~~~

2423~~~
Once we replaced him with Mcshit I knew that we would lose the game

2424~~~
Another fullback down, even though he was playing CB today. Showed some old fashioned defenders guts on the challenge he got hurt in.

2425~~~
Broken rib and punctured lung according to the Mail...

2426~~~
Really brave header. Shame his effort ended up being for nothing.

2427~~~
A player who started of bright, with energy and excitement and then has over time regressed under LVG you say? lol

2428~~~
Bloody hell that's bad. Possibly at least 5 weeks. Who the feck are we going to play in defense? It's really worrying me.

2429~~~
Valencia is back soon I think.

2430~~~
Makes those caftards giving shit to LVG for not letting him play on look even more cringeworthy...

2431~~~
That will be a load of weeks/months on the sidelines then. Never know it might do him good, as he certainly isn't playing himself into form as it is.

Surely now we have to do what we should have fecking done in the summer and buy a few bloody defenders.

Shaw, Valencia, Rojo, Jones and now Darmian all injured for good periods of time. It was insane to go into the season with only 6-7 defenders.

2432~~~
Broken rib isn't that bad. Punctured lung doesn't sound too good though

2433~~~
Ah we're bad everywhere just now, this is just another problem to add to many others.

I just hope they don't back LvG with a Bruno Martins Indi type signing.

2434~~~
Then we sack him and are stuck with the Bruno Martins Indi signing, namely Bruno Martins Indi.

2435~~~
Suppose that's good news, but even our wingers turned fullbacks are injured for now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I mean in terms of actual first team defenders, we've got Smalling and Blind fit. That's it. McNair can do a job and Borthwick-Jackson has come in and not been bad so suppose that's alright, but we should've definitely gone in for a left back this window to replace Shaw.

2436~~~
Wish him well with his recovery.

2437~~~
Not good to see him injured, and sounds like it could be a serious one. Hopefully he recovers quickly.

If he is out for a decent period of time, we really are beyond bare bones at full back now. Need some players to start coming back from injury, or to bring someone in quickly. Otherwise I can see it costing us points. We are struggling to create chances, so if we give away cheap goals due to lack of quality at the back, then we are going to drop points left right and center. Right now, I can see us struggling to make the top four.

2438~~~
some good news at last.

2439~~~
Glad to hear he's ok, amazingly he looks even younger in that pic than in his banner pic, the facial fuzz is not having the desired effect.

2440~~~
I still have high hopes for him once van Gaal leaves. Was very good at the beginning, then our manager worked his magic and 'improved' our players with his philosophy and process bullshit.

You are not wrong. He was very good at that. I remember replying to someone at the beginning of the season that this will change once van Gaal gets to him and he will start playing shit passes.

2441~~~
I think it's way too early to write him off. First season in a new league, we will know more next season, particularly if LVG isn't here

2442~~~
Good news. I do have time for Matteo.

2443~~~
wish him well he was brave with the challenge but I won't miss him at all, wouldn't mind trying someone like Riley/Reid or Varela again, wouldnt also mind if we tried to buy someone in this window

2444~~~

2445~~~
His best game for us since August?

2446~~~
Much better from him.

2447~~~
Much better, but still looks a little slow. I read that he was very fast - like properly. He looks average at best in terms of pace.

2448~~~
So surprise he's looked better since returning to right back, just seem to have a bit of confidence back.

2449~~~
Yep.

2450~~~
Looking great today.

2451~~~
Really nice inswinger with his left foot. Had been looking forward to seeing that from him after a season of Valencia, the most one footed player on the planet.

2452~~~
Making his presence felt tonight, along with CBJ. We've got so much width and space when the fullbacks do their job. There are other factors for it, of course, Stoke too open themselves being one of them.

2453~~~
He's been brilliant tonight, defensively and going forward, along with BJ he's put in some terrific crosses.

2454~~~
Yes Darmian! Hopefully he's back to his best.

2455~~~
Happy for him. Now keep him at right back.

2456~~~
Highly improved today. Keep him at RB instead of shuffling him around CB and LB please.

2457~~~
People forget that this his first season at Premier League level and at 26 he has time on his side to develop even more.

2458~~~
I like this guy.

2459~~~
He even had his customary booking to top up a good performance.

2460~~~
The most confident game he has had since the start of the season.

2461~~~
Much much better tonight, looked solid defensively. Still not my type of fullback going forward but at least he was putting some effort into getting forward and supporting Lingard.

2462~~~
He definitely grew into the game and was playing very well second half.

2463~~~
Owned Arnautovic

2464~~~
This and Mata and Co should have burried some of his crosses tonight they were sublime..

2465~~~
Now stop moving him across the defence. Keep him RB (and use varela as backup).

2466~~~
Once he stopped wetting himself whenever a Stoke player came within 5 yards of him, he went on to actually have a decent game... not amazing or anything, but definitely better then we've seen over recent months.

2467~~~
He was a bit up down yesterday but the positive thing was that he finally showed some attacking intent and did well going forward

2468~~~
Not surprisingly he did a lot better once he got rid of the godawful sideburns.

But he's not rapid is he?

2469~~~
I think we can all agree he is much much better at right-back. Solid last night and made some good tackles, back to how he was in the first few games.

2470~~~
He's right footed so that's to be expected. But when he was shite he was less shite on the left than on the right, imo.

2471~~~
He's one of the players I really want to do well. 

It's signings like these that we should really be making - players that have proved themselves at lower clubs and are ready to take the step up such as Darmian and Schneiderlin. Neymar, Bale, etc. are never going to come to United.

2472~~~
Aye, this blaming his poor performance on playing LB is nonsense, he has performed quite well at LB a few times and put in absolute garbage performances at RB at other times. He has just been inconsistent.

2473~~~
When he's a LB, he drifts into the middle and out of position. When he's a RB, he stays on his side of the pitch. It's not rocket science what the solution is for the future. 

Once Shaw and Rojo come back, we'll have three LBs in the pecking order ahead of him. If we buy another CB, Blind could play the position as well. Hopefully Darmian never plays there again.

2474~~~
Our best player so far. Very good defensively and going forward.

Good to see.

2475~~~
Having a superb game so far. Owning that right flank.

2476~~~
Great first half.

2477~~~
Glad to see him look back to his best. He's definitely improved recently.

2478~~~
Excellent first half

2479~~~
Looked knackered towards the end. Needs to improve his fitness levels.

2480~~~
A player like Oscar is tailor made for him in truth. A quicker more nimble player would put him off more.

2481~~~
Oscar is pretty useless to be fair.

2482~~~
He did well against Hazard and Oscar, very good game from him.

2483~~~
Thought he was very good today. I much prefer him at RB.

2484~~~
I thought he was great today. Defensively he looked as good as he did at the start of the season and he seems to have really improved his attacking play.

2485~~~
Played well, if not for Dave he'd be the MOTM for us.

2486~~~
Played very well.

2487~~~
Showing his early season form Again, long may it continue.

2488~~~
Man of the match.

2489~~~
Was his best game of the season for me. Won loads of tackles, supported the attack really well and put some great crosses in. That was back to his early season form.

2490~~~
Brilliant.

2491~~~
This is more like what we paid for.

2492~~~
Getting back into that form he showed at the start of the season. He's definitely a good player and one I have time for, it's no coincidence he is one of Italy's very best performers whenever they play too.

2493~~~
Back to his early season form! I've been critical of him lately but if it wasn't for De Gea's heroics throughout, he'd have been my MOTM tonight.

2494~~~
Very good performance tonight!

2495~~~
Better tonight for sure.

2496~~~
He was very good, especially first half. Similar performance to when he first stated in that nobody could beat him 1 on 1.

2497~~~
Back to his early season form. Looking really solid lately and better and mode confident on the ball. Baffles me why some people think Mourinho won't like him, he's basically the same type of player as Azpilicueta who Mourinho always played.

2498~~~
His confidence is back.

2499~~~
Having two competent full-backs has really transformed our game.

No surprise we played well early in the season with him and Shaw.

Then he went off form and we had a bit of a cluster feck at LB with no one doing anything of note.

Now we've got CBJ delivering the goods and Darmian on form, the whole dynamic of the side changes.

2500~~~
That was more like it. Very composed today.

2501~~~
Had a very good game, but am I being harsh in thinking he should have done better for Costa's goal? He's more interested in moving to the right, when he should be filling in the centre with Blind. Also, Schneiderlin's positioning was terrible.

2502~~~
Credit where credit is due. His best game in a United shirt. Was very impressed. Would've been MoTM if it wasn't for DDG.

2503~~~
Terrific game. Much more composed and was up and down all game.

2504~~~
Was he man marking Hazard? Cause he ended up on the left a lot.

2505~~~
He just needed some time to adapt.

2506~~~
Delighted that he's regained his form. Was very good on Tuesday and especially today. Offers much more in attack as well even compared to his early season form. Good to see.

2507~~~
Good game. Needs to stay on the right. No more moving him around. Needs to keep building momentum.

Put a great ball across goal that really needed more bodies thrown at it. Looks very strong in one on ones as he was earlier in the season. When on form, he never seems to lose one.

2508~~~
He's starting to play like how he did earlier in the season which is good to see.

2509~~~
Agreed. In fact, it should be the case for the entire back four as long as we avoid injuries. 

There has been far too much chopping and changing, we need a settled defence.

2510~~~
Played well. I'm sure the dip in form was just him adjusting to the league.

2511~~~
It's almost as if he just hit a patch of poor form and that, combined with being asked to play on the opposite side, lead to him struggling.

Good to see him back to his best, though, hopefully he can maintain this level of performance.

2512~~~
Definitely. It's weird that Darmian was the one budged around to accommodate Young as an emergency full back. Young has played most of his career as a left winger, and has put in a few decent shifts at LB before, but this season, Darmian was pushed to LB to accommodate Young at RB. It's backwards. Then you've got two players out of position rather than just one. Darmian's performances at LB were ropey at best.

2513~~~
Ill be happy if he just stays on as RB now. Even if we get injuries, he should not be pushed to LB cos "hes versatile". Just let him settle as RB and have a good run there.

2514~~~
Not a fan of his haircut though. Preferred it the way it was before.

2515~~~
Best game he's had for us I think. Confident on the ball and actually pretty good defensively, though in fairness Oscar is so useless and pathetic it's amazing Chelsea fans resist the urge to run on the pitch and slap him...but still a lot more encouraging.

Something about his face is getting more and more unacceptable looking with each passinng week. It's like he's got a disease that's slowly turning him into a hillbilly.

2516~~~
I noticed he looked a bit pale today too, but passed it off as down to the weather. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2517~~~
He just looks weird. His hair's gotten strangely farmboy like and he's started pulling faces likke he's trying to impersonate Cledus from The Simpsons

2518~~~
Why is he so poor on the ball, it's unreal really. Would prefer Valencia atm.

2519~~~
sub him off ffs!

2520~~~
Been utterly shite today can't do anything

2521~~~
Looks like he's had the life sucked out of him today. He's been absolutely shocking.

2522~~~
One of those performances that you know it's almost inevitable he will get subbed at half time. In fact, hasn't it happened to Darmian specifically before?

2523~~~
And people don't think we need at least a new right back. No way the new manager should rely on him.

2524~~~
He looks dreadful again.

2525~~~
Absolutele nightmare today for him, hope he recovers soon.

2526~~~
Now got a debutant left back playing right back.

2527~~~
As soon as he went down he knew had a ticket out of the game. Utter shite today.

2528~~~
I dread him getting on the ball. He can't handle the pace of the Premier League. Stupid free kick to give away for the goal too.

2529~~~
Injury capped one of the worst full-back displays you'll see in a while. 

Just woeful. 

A real shame as looked to be getting his shit together last few games. 

When's Valencia back?

2530~~~
Love is a RB/CB he can probably fill in at LB but he's by no means a regular there.

2531~~~
My thoughts as well, I don't think he's up to the pace of the Premier league I'm afraid.

2532~~~
He didn't fancy it at all today.

I don't think that injury looked as bad as he made out and he just wanted to get off the pitch, imo.

2533~~~
Yep my mate phoned to say the same! Would like to hope not but he's been shocking on occasions after a bright start. Looking not good enough on what we have seen! Can't believe he is actually a worse crosser than Valencia (who looks the better player)

2534~~~
I was quoting someone else Stob I've never seen the kid play!

2535~~~
I don't think he can handle pressing at Premier League pace. I think he is so bad under pressure that he opposition teams will start to target him.

2536~~~
Will need to shape up or ship out as his bottom level is to low! When he's good he's good and when he's poor he's abysmal and that's worrying.

2537~~~
Bad day for him, played crap and now looks like he's dislocated his shoulder. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2538~~~
Terrible day for Matteo. Hopefully the injury isn't too bad.

2539~~~

2540~~~
Why do our fullbacks get so many of these injuries. It's mental.

2541~~~
Ffs

2542~~~
Some posters really assumed he wanted to get off and faked an injury? Wow, some of you are as clueless as our manager. He was shit, but be careful what you spread on the Internet.

2543~~~
Wasn't even given as a foul. He got clattered by Khazri who got nothing of the ball.

Just like the one a few weeks ago wasn't given as a foul when Shane Long twatted in to him and he went off injured.


But well done to the men in charge for not buying a full back in January. How many players have we played in the full back positions this season? It must be into double figures. Shaw, Darmian, Valencia, Young, McNair, Rojo, Blind, Borthwick-Jackson, Jones, Varela, Love... Mental.

2544~~~
Hospital pass from Lingard to blame for that. Was about 5 yards and still managed to underhit it

2545~~~
Another cnut made from balsa wood stealing a living.

2546~~~
Jesus <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Standard pathetic performance. It miight be a confidence thing but even if it is, man up for feck sake.

I don't see the issue with him being injured since literally everyone who's had to fill in for him has looked better there, and shown more balls...even McNair. 

He shouldn't be near the first team despite the fact he's the only right back in our squad. That tells you all you need to know about him really.

2548~~~
He's at times been solid defensively, but his quality on the ball is alarming bad. There was so much praise for him before we signed him, and talk about how he had also played at wing back, but funnily enough, he attacks like a centre back.

2549~~~
and defends like a winger lol

2550~~~
Really? You are all losing your damn mind.

2551~~~
Who you gonna call to turn an Italian international fullback into an injury-prone wing back who can't cross for toffee? Philosophy Man.

2552~~~
Philosophy man! Turns everything he touches into shit.

2553~~~
Trevor Sinclar just said Darmian is a massive loss for United cos he has done the business when he had played. The BBC's pundits really are quite poor.

2554~~~
He looked like he was getting back to his best up until today. I think he would've been taken off anyway despite the injury.

2555~~~
I love this side of our fanbase which get so venomous over a player's poor performance that they imply he's faking it, or he's at fault for getting injured.  Back against PSV were some of you shouting "Luke Shaw is a fecking cnut for letting his leg get broken and ruining our season"?

2556~~~
cant decide if I rate him, started great but looks very apprehensive half the time. maybe its the management, style of play

2557~~~
The curse of da silva brothers!

2558~~~
Beware of the hipster choice.

2559~~~
He had been improving but had the made of mares on sat. Fair one I called it wrong and thought he wanted a ticket out of the game when he didn't but can you blame me for thinking that? Its hardly an unknown phenomenon as we saw with Di Maria last season when he clearly couldn't be arsed at the end of the season just going off for anything and Hazard this season.

He had been improving but was awful the other day, despite that hes a big loss as we have hardly anyone left at fullback.

2560~~~
I'm really interested in tracking his progress. He clearly has struggled to come terms with the intensity but that's understandable considering he comes from Serie A. Whether he's got it in him to adapt and come to terms will determine his success here.

2561~~~
Poor first season but i think you have to hope he acclimatises next year. 

Still miles better than Valencia there l, just wish we had a fit Rafael as that lad was great.

2562~~~
He looked like the real deal in his first few games. The game that really turned him was when we played Arsenal in October. He looked like a real chump whenever Sanchez ran into his channel. He had a shocker and since then he's just not been right. I hope he can turn it around and we can put this season down as him adjusting to the PL from Serie A (although I don't really think that is an excuse)

2563~~~
I'd be happy to judge him next season. Think he'll turn out to be a shrewd signing for us.

2564~~~
This guy's the new Skrtel. Gets away with so much shit at corners.

2565~~~
Liability as always. Not only get beaten but commits a blatant foul in the box. I don´t know where this myth comes from that he´s a good defender.

2566~~~
He's shit IMO - play the youngsters instead!

2567~~~
The injuries and playing out of position can't have helped, but bar a few decent games he's been awful.

And yes we have to hope he gets better and settles next year maybe if given time.

But judging him on this season alone he doesn't seem to understand how to defend or attack, which is a bad combination for any footballer let alone a fullback. I hope we stick with Valera for the rest of this season at RB. At least he shows a bit of bravery to get forward and support his winger.

2568~~~
His transformation from someone who looked a competent defender to someone who barely resembles a footballer has been baffling. Not too sure about him anymore.

2569~~~
Needs a haircut, nice Kung-fu clearance.

2570~~~
Plays better on the right I think.
He was lucky not to concede that penalty tonight

2571~~~
Thank feck he didn't give away a pen.

2572~~~
I genuinely don't think he's as good as Varela.

2573~~~
Right now he isn't. I think it will take an injury or a real dip form from Valera for Matteo to even get back into the side.

2574~~~
he read that one situation well when watford was about to counter, I was cheering big time but apart that he showed how hesitant he is his first touch almost got him into the same trouble as before the injury. Comfy with Varela but would like to see us going for rightback in the summer

2575~~~
His positioning as a LB is pretty awful. Gets sucked into the center so easily. 

Second choice RB behind Varela right now. Valencia can feck off.

2576~~~
I'm not at all convinced about him. He isn't really good neither offensively nor defensively, and even with all the injuries I still wouldn't pick him.

2577~~~
He's gotten worse since he's been here. Very weird. Had such a bright start.

2578~~~
He's just come back from a Shoulder Dislocation lads and he's played as an LB. He started the season brightly, then dipped in form and then slowly picked his form up again before those crunching challenges to the ribs and shoulder. I still like him. Positionally, he is as good as they get, excellent on 1 v 1s too. When he came back from that dip in form,his offence improved as well. With regards to the Varela vs Darmian battle, Varela probably has to take it on current form (Boy has that kid impressed me this season!).

2579~~~
He hasn't played LB often for us, but I don't remember a good performance there from him. Wasn't there that one game where he kept getting sucked very very narrow?

2580~~~
His performance today pretty much sums up his time at United so far. Very good defensively but going forward is a different question.

2581~~~
Valencia is the better player

2582~~~
Awful player

2583~~~
He hasn't a clue offensively.

When overlapping, he jogs. Varela/Valencia bursts a gut to beyond the winger and occupy their winger/fullback. Opposition teams know they needn't worry about Darmian overlapping.

2584~~~
It's not even close.

2585~~~
Aye just lacks the ability going forward and with how shite we seem to be at that end of the pitch for the most part we could really be doing with our fullbacks as another outlet. Hope Varela starts our next game.

2586~~~
I'm going to punch the next guy who says he's one of the best FB's in Europe

2587~~~
If by very good you mean "sometimes he's okay", then I'll agree.

2588~~~
I agree Valencia every day of the week!

2589~~~
He's not even one of the best at United!!

2590~~~
He really is terrible this lad, how he got back into the squad begs a thousand questions. I really dont know what he has to offer us for me one our worse signings by a long way.

2591~~~
He has had a sound game defensively. Name one player today who has beaten him 1 v 1 or got passed him?

Besides he is also just returning from injury. Whatever, you guys probably just want to see TFM or someone from U21s just because they are younger and upcoming. Then when they start playing badly you can destroy their  confidence and claim he was never ready in the first place and have him sold.

2592~~~
He just doesnt seem convincing with anything he does. Not quick, not strong, not that good on the ball... hes alright defensively but just so average in too many aspects. Hopefully he improves next season, but there's not really any stand out qualities

2593~~~
No, I want to see Varela because he's a better footballer.

His 1 vs 1 defending is fine, his positioning can be a bit suspect at times though.

2594~~~
Varela is nicer attacking wise but he is rash defensively and can lose his man. If he is not playing with Lingard he is completely exposed.

2595~~~
The amount of people on here during the summer that claimed to be an expert on him said he's a class act. Apart from the first month of the season, he's been pretty terrible.

2596~~~
Seems a bit unfair to single him out after today. Everyone has been crap.

2597~~~
Awful player should be sold in the summer

2598~~~
Varela back in for him. He offers nothing going forward.

2599~~~
Oh it has nothing to do with today; bar the first month of the season, I've thought this guy is a fraud. Today has nothing to do with it.

2600~~~
Dreadful again.

Laughable that there are some who rate him above Verela and Valencia.

2601~~~
Why?

2602~~~
Good defensively but absolutely no composure on the ball and his attacking play is horrible. He really stifles our attack.

2603~~~
I don't understand the logic. As a defender, shouldn't your main job be to DEFEND?

Who cares. Lets get Varela and Valencia back so that our right side can be completely exposed once again and leave us right back to square one. The fickleness of the Cafe is unbelievable.

2604~~~
Varela's a better player. Both ends of the field.

2605~~~
Knew nothing about him before he signed but was basically told by those that had watched him, that we were getting the complete fullback. A game when England played Italy was used as a reference by plenty on here at how good he is not just defensively but also going forward. It's fair to say that he's completely useless going forward and very average defensively. Considering how important fullbacks are these days, Darmian is nowhere near good enough for a top team.

2606~~~
Actually makes me angry. Varela didn't deserve to lost his play to this guy.

2607~~~
Noticeable our width from fullbacks was poor with Rojo and Darmian. The kids are better.

2608~~~
He's ok defensively but offers absolutely nothing to attack - I don't think he is ready or has the attributes to play at United

2609~~~
I completely agree with the sentiment. Some of the reactions on here to his performance today are actually pretty disgusting and some of them genuinely pathetic. This guy is a good player, at times a very good defender especially.

Today he made a number of clean tackles, positioning was largely fine but I would agree that he didn't offer much going forward. But what do people here expect? We had 10 men, basically no threat going forward and switched right wingers 3 or 4 times today. There was no rhythm to the attack.

Also, WBA didn't afford any space basically - 4 CBs and 2 DMs against 10 men. They stifled us and we lacled imagination. I would question Van Gaal today as he had no answers whatsoever once we went down to 10 men.

His performance was fine today.

2610~~~
He's hopeless. Give me Rafael over this guy any day of the week. Even Jones would be better.

2611~~~
Offering nothing in attack and plays as much on the edge defensively as Rafael did.

2612~~~
I know we should learn from Evra, and not write him off just yet... but I never remember thinking Evra was this bad - his debut aside.

Also, Evra didn't have to be our starting full-back whilst he was adjusting to the Premier League... actually, Darmian doesn't have to be a starting full back for us either.

2613~~~
Pointless player. 

I don't know if he is cowardly or lazy with his attacking but he offers zero to us. Down to 10 men we really needed everyone to put a shift in offensively to create something and he just did his usual sitting on the half way line and passing it inside bullshit.

Soul destroying to watch.

2614~~~
Varela is as good defensively as Darmian, or maybe slightly inferior, but miles and miles better than him going forward.

Absolute madness to drop Varela today.

2615~~~
What is he supposed to be good at? What makes him any better than West Brom's right back (Dawson) ?

2616~~~
I think it is unfair to reference him as an average player defensively. I think he does a great job in one and one situations and keeps good track of his man. One part of him that has been caught on now ever since he moved to England was his lack of athletcism. He was never overly quick or fast to begin with, so obviously after moving to one of the quickest paced leagues in the world he is going to be  slow to react and it was inevitably going to cost some goals. We just need to be patient in that aspect and I think he has been improving.

No doubt his crossing is his biggest weakness. That wasn't really picked on as much in Italy because you don't so much crossing in contested situation in Italian football. In addition, Lingard  isn't very good going forward at all on the right hand side leaving him very isolated and both Lingard and Herrera are too slow to pick or sloppy to pick out a decent pass for him, so that is not going to help matters out either.

I was quite shocked as of recent on how sloppy he has been passing the ball in the final third. I think it is a confidence issue because he has done much better in the first half of the season...

2617~~~
He could wear a Sunderland jersey and no one would bat an eyelid. Shocking on the ball and OK at best defensively.

2618~~~
Pointless.

2619~~~
Disappointing today he didn't look interested at all.

2620~~~
I don't know if he is cowardly or lazy with his attacking but he offers zero to us. Down to 10 men we really needed everyone to put a shift in offensively to create something and he just did his usual sitting on the half way line and passing it inside bullshit.

Soul destroying to watch.[/QUOTE]

You do realize that if he tries something We are completely exposed on the right hand side. Who did you expect to cover for him? Rashford, an 18 year old striker?
Smalling, who was pratically a 1 man center back? 

This thought confirms that the general consensus among his criticizers is for us to attack attack attack and pay no mind to the damages on the defensive end it could do to us.

2621~~~
He really isn't. As I have said before, he only looks good when he is playing with Lingard since he hustles his butt off. It makes sense to play him, but don't say he is better than him. After the red card, it would have been open season on our right wing.

2622~~~
i've never seen such a drastic drop in performance from the start of a season to the end. can't pass the ball 10 yards now. if he continues on this trajectory we'll need to teach him how to walk

2623~~~
Thought he was good defensively but absolutely rubbish going forward

2624~~~
LVG obviously wanted his added height in there. We focused on not losing the game rather than what our defenders could add to winning it. Says it all about LVG.

2625~~~
Still dont understand why he started ahead of Varela. Why drop the inform player for somebody who is coming back from an injury, who wasnt even in the best of form before it anyway.

2626~~~
Wow logical reasoning does exist.

2627~~~
Bizarre that Varela didn't play instead of him unless a rest was needed.

2628~~~
Good post.

2629~~~
Has it crossed your mind some of us just wanna see players with the ability to do things with urgency.

2630~~~
Really poor going forward. Great defensively, though. Him and Varela need to be infused.

2631~~~
Varela is better and that has been clear for a few games. Yet Darmian gets the start.

2632~~~
I think he's very average defensively though. Lets take a player like azpilicueta for example; he's very limited in an offensive sense but he's very good defensively. Darmian has shown nothing to say he's above average in a defensive sense. He's ok but I think he's very weak and gets muscled off the ball far too easily. Players like Shaw and Bellerin are what I look for in a fullback; dynamic, quick and good at both ends of the pitch. 

Fullbacks are so so important and unfortunately Darmian kills so many attacks with his sloppy control and ponderous play. Anytime he receives the ball in the final third, he has to basically stop, have a look around and he usually picks the wrong option. This kills any kind of momentum that we have built. 

He's certainly not talented enough defensively to make up for his blatant offensive shortcomings. For me, he simply hasn't been good enough. I wouldn't sell him in the summer and he showed during his first month that he has talent, but feck me he needs to improve.

2633~~~
Maybe he's just the reverse Evra? Looks amazing on his debut, but then will be horribly shit for the majority of his career - getting injured a lot in the process - before finishing with a flourish.

2634~~~
The difference Evra was an attacking minded player struggling to defend. So playing in a team that was likely to be on the front foot, those issues were bound to get ironed out and not forget he's pacy as well.

2635~~~
Like I said, he's the reverse Evra.

It's a bit like the Reverse Flash... except not evil and completely feckin' useless.

2636~~~
What? 

Where is this coming from? He's had numerous brain farts this season.

2637~~~
He wasn't bad today. Over the course of the season, he's been very inconsistent, I agree.

2638~~~
Plenty seen to think he's brilliant defensively? I'm yet to see it myself.

2639~~~
He's been poor on the ball most of the season.

2640~~~
I seriously still can't grasp how van Gaal decided after 10 games that Rafael isn't good enough and yet he starts Darmian whenever he can even though he is inferior in every aspect to Rafael. I am not sure Darmian is any better in terms of staying fit either. Rafael had his brainfarts and maybe Darmian can be better defensively in general over the course of the season, but when he is terrible he is just terrible that even Rafael's worst games for us are nowhere near close. And those games for Darmian happen quite often.

No way we should plan the next season with him as our first choice full back.

2641~~~
It's not like he's great defensively to make up for his pointlessness in attack. As Akash said, he's had many brainfarts since his homeymoon period at the start of the season ended and has been pretty shit since then. He's absolutely useless with the ball at his feet and his brain seems to switch off every time he has to make a pass that's not backwards or sideways.

Varela is much better than Darmian at the moment. His attacking play is on another level and also did very well against Sanchez, who destroyed Darmian at the Emirates earlier in the season. Varela's attacking was one of the things we missed today and when Van Gaal finally decided to sub Darmian, he put Fosu-Mensah instead. The mind boggles.

2642~~~
Don't understand why Varela got dropped, he should be at the top of the pecking order for RB.

2643~~~
Di Maria says "Hello, its me" In fact its becoming a bit of trait of most of the squad these days. The sheer regression back to the primate stage is alarming. Soon we will have players trying to light a fire with two stones and using the corner flag as a spear for hunting. Its truly staggering what we seem to be doing to players lately.

2644~~~
Top analogy.

2645~~~
Has he regressed though or were we just giving him the benefit of the doubt that all new signings are afforded? He was very poor today and I'm not going to blame van Gaal for a professional footballers inability to beat the first man with a cross or make a simple ten yard pass

2646~~~
I really want this guy to be a success here but I don't know, I'm just not seeing it from him at the moment. Seems to be a common theme that players struggle more coming from Serie A than the other European leagues. Personally I would of kept Varela in today, and brought Darmian on as a sub to try and salvage some confidence.

2647~~~
I don't care who covers for him, we were down to 10 men and struggling to create a goal in a game we had to win. He did feck all going forward as usual. You have to take risks in games like this, he takes none while not even being that great defensively.

Since when has it became ok for full backs to offer nothing at all going forward. It's half their job, and don't bore the tits off me with any of that he's a defender first bullshit. He's not even that good defensively.

It's simple he isn't putting enough effort in to help the team offensively, i don't care why. He needs to get his fecking finger out and help his winger, whoever is playing in front of him.

He's basically the poster boy for our pathetic attacking play this season.

2648~~~
Yep, sums up his reign here.

2649~~~
Utter wank, why drop Varela for this loser. His distribution is just plain second class, I honestly think a few of the kids are better than him.

2650~~~
Guardiola wanted him at Bayern apparently. He looked like a steal at the beginning of the season and was subbed a few times for Valencia because he was doing so much running up and down the line that he looked out on his feet, then came that match where he got booked and pulled at half time and seems like he's never been the same since. But as <a class="username" data-user="87644, @Renegade81" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87644/">@Renegade81</a> mentioned there's been numerous top players now get worse gradually after signing for us. I mean he should be able to pass the ball at a minimum.

2651~~~
Resting Varela for the Europa League match?

2652~~~
And through it all lately, something still tells me he's a defender Jose would really love.

2653~~~
Yep, don't think installing Mourinho as the manager will see him being dropped.

2654~~~
Yea,you gonna tell him.

2655~~~
Haha...Let's hope he can develop the evil side, to compensate for his lack of aggression..

2656~~~
When he plays, I'd rather he just stayed back as an ultra-defensive full back. His attacking is rubbish, but he's still a good defender.

On the flipside, Varela is a very exciting attacker, pace on tap and loves to run with the ball, but his defensive positioning is garbage.

2657~~~
He is a good defender, but does he know how to find an open player? His attacking contribution is woeful. He contributes nothing in attack.

2658~~~
In the first 10 minutes, there were 3 occasions where his cross hit the first defender, and after that he started to hide and not cross anymore.

Absolutely unacceptable and cowardly.

2659~~~
How has he been very average defensively. Give me some substance. A hundred RedCafe poster's saying it over and over again does not make it true.
In the air? Superb.
1 v 1 situations? On an average day, every 5 1v1 duels I say he wins 4/5 of them. He struggles against guys with pace, but with more and more Enlgish football he will defeinitely come around.

Positioning has been really good aswell. He holds his ground quite well.

I agree with you that he is weak. I think he could benefit from getting into the weight room a little bit, but that isn't what makes up a full back completely.

Darmain does not kill any play. The reason why he was great going forward at the beginning of the season  was because Mata was always cutting inside all the time trying to make plays, which gave Darmian a lot of space to try and run into taking the pressure away from the right hand side;thus, creating more space.  It was the same thing in Italy I believe(someone correct if I am wrong), they played a 3-5-2 which stretched the game a lot and helped Darmian aswell. When he plays with Lingard It is a different story. Lingard is right footed, and since he is offensively limited in 1 v 1s on the right side, he has to try to put in a good cross in. This makes the right side very congested and puts the onus on Darmian to have to carry on much of the attacking workload. Do you think this is something that would be easy to do in a very stagnant and possesion based system where everyone is standing around? No it would not be. Varela would work better because of his crossing ability and his speed, however, take away Lingard, and you have a championship level defender.

FYI-Bellerin and defense should never be mentioned in the same sentence.

2660~~~
"It is not like has has been so great defensively" " He had his bad moments in the beginning of the season"

Wait a minute, you guys are saying that defenders can make mistakes or have bad games? Wow, I never would have known.

2661~~~
He was absolutely outstanding the first 4/5 games of the season, a proper little gary nev clone.

Now he makes Andre Santos look like Cafu. Hopefully its just a write off season and he comes back stronger.

2662~~~
I must have missed those games earlier in the season, because i don't think i have seen one game from him which i could describe him as great going forward. Ok perhaps but not great.

I was saying even after his first few games when he defended and generally played very well that he needed to offer more going forward.

As the season has gone on he has got worse to the point where his attacking contribution is virtually non existent. Bar a few games before his recent injury notably at Anfield where he defended well. He has been pretty poor defensively as well since that early patch of good form.

2663~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Hes never been great going forward.

Craig Dawson, a CB, looking like fecking Roberto Carlos today compared to Darmian and Rojo for that matter. Its no coincidence that we actually play some good football with some fullbacks who actually offer something in possession and go back to shite with Darmian. We would have been better off with no one while in possession than Darmian and Rojo. He is completely inconsistent defensively too, hes been destroyed on a number of occasions. I'd hardly say he was even good defensively today either, a pylon could have done a job against Chester, another CB, and Sessegnon who has to be the laziest fecker in the league.

2664~~~
You are completely missing the point. Yes he has looked awful going forward, but there are reasons for it that are not entirely his fault!

I would say he has been very well defensively throughout aside from maybe 2 or 3 games here and there. Do you think he was bad defensively this game and why? In fact nevermind why do I even bother. Lets get Varela out there and bench Darmian. That way when we get an actual right winger in the summer and Varela gets exposed for the non entity on defense he is, we can then crucify him aswell.

#TheUnitedWay

2665~~~
This statement is the exact thing that is wrong with certain United fans nowadays. Credit can never be given to our players.

If they defend well today, then we get "oh the guys he was up against where absolute crap anyways he should have been doing that from the start"
If they don't they get crucified.

We honestly don't deserve to have the best players out there when we are so damn spoiled and unappreciative of the players we have already have. I have no problem with people calling out the reality of the situation, but to be on the extreme negative side of things just baffles me. No sense of perspective at all.

2666~~~
Cant see a player with worse first touch than his in our team maybe Rooney. Hope this was just a rotation than anything and Varela will come back to the side next game, I'd like to give the lad a chance next season but I don't see potential there, you can adjust to the tempo of the game but ability to dribble is very hard to train up over short time. That's why I believe Varela can be better fullback easily than him. I said it from the day one Darmian is just not United quality, that was a real nonsense to send younger and twice better Rafael out. The Brazilian also never struggled to get into form after injury. Darmian seems to lack any kind of confidence..

2667~~~
You sound livid.  Which is surprising because most of us are resigned to players completely regressing under LVG.  I liked him so much at the beginning of the season and thought it was actually prudent letting Rafa go.  Man Rafa would have busted a gut yesterday and would have taken out a couple of WBA players' legs with him.

2668~~~
Joe Riley >

2669~~~
I can't really be arsed pulling up stats etc. I know from what I have seen with my own eyes that he's extremely average defensively, that's really not hard to see. As I said, the fact that he is indeed average defensively, means that he doesn't make up for his horrible offensive work with the defensive aspect of his game.

Have you watched any of our matches? He basically kills every single attack when he touches the ball. His first touch is shocking, he is ponderous in possession and he rarely manages to get the ball into the box. If you are happy with him / this form, then feck me, you have very low expectations from what a fullback should be.

FYI - Bellerin is a far better defender.

2670~~~
Hes very good defensively. The only thing he struggles with is getting his body shape right, which leads to fast wingers getting a yard on him. Tackling, heading and positioning is all generally good. He needs to improve offensively but he has shown glimpses when his confidence has been up and it doesnt help when all our attacking talent is down the left. Ill judge him next Christmas when hes had a pre season and a few games under his belt.

We seem to love the kids but what about when Borthwick-Jackson cost us a game by sitting half a mile behind the offside trap, or when Luke Shaw went charging upfield early in the season and left his flank wide open against Swansea? They are all young and/or learning to cope with the fastest and most physical league on the planet.

2671~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2672~~~
Nope, for me he's certainly not very good defensively and he's absolutely atrocious offensively. For me, he's just not a very good fullback at all. I was impressed with him initally but feck knows what's happened to him since. As I said previously, I wouldn't sell him this summer and he deserves more time. But if he played like this next season, I would be happy to see the back of him.

2673~~~
He's been awful going forward no matter the formation, who's playing in front of him or even the opposition (he was crap against Sheffield United). So yes it's fair to say it is his fault for the most part. He's just not willing or able to contribute in the oppositions half. He looks to me nothing more than a decent-ish CB playing at RB.

He was alright but we were playing fecking West Brom, they were playing fairly defensively even after we went down to 10 men. And lets be fair here the cross for their goal came from his side. He wasn't there of course, great positioning indeed.

Yes Valera isn't a top defender by any stretch but he hasn't been bad defensively either while offering us much much more than Darmian does going forward.

And don't start with that United way bullshit. Top fullbacks can defend and attack for their team. Darmian is alright at one (sometimes) and woefully crap at the other. People are going to notice and comment on that glaring deficiency in his game.

2674~~~
To be honest mate i was livid. As bad as it has been watching this team this season. One of the worst parts for me has been watching Darmian plodding up and down the right barely getting over the half way line and offering us nothing. And generally looking not arsed or knackered most of the time. 

As much as a lot of players have regressed under LVG, i don't think it's the case here with Darmian. I just don't see how this guy is ever going to be good enough going forward, i just don't think he has it in his game. As i said earlier he looks like a converted CB to me.

Bringing in a new first choice RB was definitely the right move (though we should have kept Rafa to rotate), we just got the wrong guy.

2675~~~
It would be harsh to blame Darmian for the goal, but I´ve always thought his awareness and reactions are that of a League One defender. Watch him on the goal. He´s like a lost little boy, and by the time he´s gained some awareness of what´s happening, the cross passes right in front of his face and he has zero reaction. Goal for Rondon.

And by the way, what is the due date for the never-ending parade of excuses for why Darmian is shite? It´s getting a bit old. I´ve never seen a United player who needs so many tired excuses. That´s what I love about about Varela. A twenty two year old with zero PL or top level experience, he slots right in, plays tenacious defense, bombs forward, crosses and sets up goals . . . and needs no excuses!

2676~~~
You'd think his performances might make people appreciate Valencia more but apparently not.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/82IYGzS.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/82IYGzS.jpg"/>

Valencia last season vs Zabeleta 13/14, Azpilicueta 14/15 and Bellerin this season.

2677~~~
Tony has been a HUGE miss.

2678~~~
I thought he was the top right back in the league just before he got hurt, and I don´t think there were many better worldwide either.

2679~~~
Darmian was following/marking Sessegnon, it was Rashfords man who put the cross in. Unfortunately he tucked in far too much trying to close off space, but really there was no danger there. He gave the LB far too much room to pick a nice cross, then Blind lost Rondon trying to anticipate where the ball was going. 

Either way you can't really blame Darmian for that goal.

2680~~~
As I said, I was´t really blaming him, I just think his play awareness and reactions are very very poor. He could´ve done better. He has this rep as a great defender, no doubt from his excellent one on one play, but in general I think he´s crap. Poor marking on set pieces. Often out of position. Skinned constantly by pacey wingers. Stupid, dangerous fouls to make up for poor defending. Slow. He has been at fault, or at least suspect, on an inordinate number of goals this year.

And one of the worst offensive fullbacks I´ve ever seen at United. I think even John O´Shea offered more going forward. He does´t even have an assist this year.

2681~~~
How? How the fecking hell is he supposed to mark two people at once. It was clearly Rashfords man was it not? Is he supposed to go help a footballer carry out basic team concepts that were taught to them since the age of 6? Give me a break.

2682~~~
Once again there is absolutely no substance as to what you are saying in terms of his defense. Telling me the same  unsupported bullshit over and over again regardless of the Cafe's stupid opinion does not add any validity towards it.

Crossing is clearly his weakness. It has been his weakness all of his career. He clearly must do better here but as I said before he never really was put into a position where crossing would be a huge part of his game, because you don't see a lot of contested crossing in Italian football. That said it is nothing that can't get better overtime. After all, last year Valencia learned how to float his crosses more and despite what people said he benefited greatly for it. Possession he has been inconsistent. Some games, like West Brom, he can quite sloppy and careless and that can lead to turnovers but most of the times he is quite neat and tidy in posession while also possesing the ability to play very direct forward passes. When we actually play with in intent and quickness Darmian thrives more, when we play very slow and stagnant, it forces him to think too much and make the wrong play rather than having confidence in his ability.

I am not saying by any stretch that I am happy with what he is doing right now. He can clearly be better and end up being a top FB in the game right now, but that faith that you and the rest of the mainstream Cafe put into the young acedemy guys like Riley or Varela, we must put in Darmian as well. He is coming off injury and still adapting to a completely different setting and culture. There must be perspective that not everything is instantaneous, we have seen it happen many times in the history of United where guys have come around with time. Why should the terms be different with Darmian? Are we in such a hurry to improve our defense even though we held the best defense in the premier league for some time now a defense that Darmian has vastly contributed to?

Furthermore what in Gods name could possibly make you think that he is a good defender. First off, he openly came out in an article just before the New Year on how he never learned how to defend. Second of all, virtually every game I watch him play he is constantly getting murdered 1 v 1. FFs Ashley Young completely wrecked him last season when we played them in the 1-1 stalemate.

2683~~~
Looks like Blind's fault to me. Surely he should just be marking Rondon, not betting on the cross going to a specific spot.

2684~~~
Ok, well obviously your opinion is the only one that matters to you. It's clear to see that Darmian is nothing more than average in the defensive department, if you want to believe different, then that's certainly your prerogative. Darmian has done absolutely nothing to warrant being called 'very good defensively' or anything of the sort. He has had plenty of mares defensively and he often lacks the pace to get back into position.

Anyhow, I can't be arsed with a massively long reply, the fact of the matter is that Darmian has been nowhere near good enough in his role as a fullback; he isn't good enough defensively for his shocking offensive work to be overlooked. As I have previously stated, I would give him another season to see how he fares but right now, I would rather we had Valencia back there.

As for Bellerin, he's a far superior fullback. He has massively improved defensively this season and is far, far younger. Is he the finished product? Nope, but he's young and very promising. As I said, his energy and dynamism makes him the kind of fullback that I absolutely love, much like Shaw.

2685~~~
You both seem to be saying the same thing but one of you doesn't get that by the looks.

I agree that Darmian so far has not shown himself to be anything more than an average player.

2686~~~
Who's turned out the better buy so far then, Clyne or Darmian? Clyne was getting a bit of praise from the scousers a couple of weeks back.

2687~~~
Clyne <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> He is decent
Still have hops for Darmian though

2688~~~
Meh, Clyne probably shades it this season but he hasn't lived up to the hype either.

2689~~~
When was this exactly ? I remember Valencia being a very good crosser but that was a few years ago. I don't know why it happened but he suddenly decided to change crossing techniques and its efficiency reduced terribly.

2690~~~
I feel like the 'defence score' doesn't account to defensive characteristics like positioning which Valencia is really bad at.

2691~~~
Darmians performances have definitely made me appreciate Tony more in terms of which one i would prefer in the side anyway. Given the choice it's Tony every day of the week and twice on sunday for me. 

Having said that though those stats do seem a bit misleading to me (as stats often are). Valencia is not a top defender and never will be. Would i be happy with him as back up to an actual RB yes, but we really should have a better player than Valencia as first choice in my opinion. As to be fair Valencia isn't the greatest going forward either, which is strange as he was one of the best wingers around not so long ago.

2692~~~
I don't think positioning can be measured easily by stats, that's the problem with relying on stats - it will be things like clearances, blocks and interceptions

2693~~~
His crossing is atrocious and makes  Valencia  a worldie on that aspect. Heck , even CBJ and Varela have put in better crosses than Darmian. Having said that I'd like him to get one more season before giving a final verdict. Maybe he'll surprise us like Young did.

2694~~~
I ll give him another season, hopefully under a different manager

2695~~~
Don't know if that one's true but it would have been a strange move. 

Darmian is pretty much the antithesis of what Guardiola seems to like in fullback's. They dodged a bullet there.

2696~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he's so underrated on the caf. People keep saying his positioning is bad, but who cares, he makes up for it with pace and strength. I don't care how the ball is kept out just that is. Same can be said with de Gea saving with his feet rather than his hands.

2697~~~
The De Gea part is more of a skill, it is technically actually correct in some situations to use your feet as a keeper (times when attempting to get down to the ball will mean the ball will be past you before you can get your hands/body down)

I like Valencia however Darmian is getting most of his stick for his attacking contribution and tbh Valencia is no better.

As for his positioning, well it does cost us at times, but he is a very good option at RB.

2698~~~
I'm just saying that there are more ways than one to defend. Of course sometimes it doesn't work but also sometimes de Gea doesn't save it. Also I think Valencia is far better than Darmain going forward. He has good chemistry with Mata/Herrera (his link up play in general is very good) and he makes good runs forward with his pace and strength to stretch play.

2699~~~
I think the worst part is his defense. The guy is a certified liability. Just look at the last couple of matches. The one he got hurt in he gave up an absurd foul that they scored on. Comes back a week ago for 20 minutes and gets beaten off a dead ball and gets away with a pathetic penalty which should´ve lost us the match. I still think last Sunday he should´ve done better on the cross that passed right in front of his gob. If you notice, it´s no coincidence opposing sides usually attack his side of the pitch.

I can´t understand why Darmian should be kept around. Varela has obviously won the place and should be fully developed with Valencia backing him up and starting sometimes, while Young or another youth side player moves up. Let´s cut our losses and send him and his 100 excuses for being shite back to Italy. He seems to thrive there and we could still probably get a decent fee for him.

2700~~~
I don't know about that his attacking is pathetic. Though in general i agree his defending is awful. Outside of his first few games and that little run of 3-4 games before his latest injury he has been very poor defensively. 

I'm always up for giving players time, jesus i was still hoping Anderson would come good after about 3-4 years. And if Darmian does stay i hope he does improve. But if we shipped Darmian off in the summer i wouldn't shed any tears. He has been Taibi level bad for me.

2701~~~
He doesn't when he's playing people onside.

2702~~~
Not ready to give up on him yet, but when he plays we need to make sure the full back on the other flank is attacking or our wide play is completely dead.

2703~~~
Comparison between Valencia 2014-15 and Darmian 2015-16

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s27.postimg.org/l46pvnt3n/Screen_Shot_2016_03_08_at_21_47_53.png" src="http://s27.postimg.org/l46pvnt3n/Screen_Shot_2016_03_08_at_21_47_53.png"/>

2704~~~
Which happened about twice or three times last season. Would you care to show me a full back who didn't play someone onside at some point over the course of a season?

Seriously, some of the things he got pulled up for are ridiculous. It's the equivalent of beating a striker with the stat that he missed 5 or 10 goal scoring chances last season as if all other strikers he compares to never make mistakes.

2705~~~
Valencia can't cross for shit and is dodgy positionally. Darmian can't cross for shit and is erratic defensively. Basically if either are our starting RB next season that position will be a weak link as it stands. Varela is dodgy positionally but that may be due to how good he is in attack, leaving himself short now and again, plus this is another level for him and he finished most games defensively stronger than he started them.

2706~~~
I wouldn't say any of the summer signings have been great but Darmian is the only player I'd happily see gone. Weak as shite for me, he doesn't seem to have the physically attributes to make it in England.

2707~~~
Not to excuse Valencia, but if you look closely, the stiff on the other side, the one who should be marking the goal scorer, is also playing him onside. Thus making Valencia irrelevant. No one seems to remember that.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQLDQEoW8AAx83P.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQLDQEoW8AAx83P.png"/>

2708~~~
Martial?

2709~~~
IIRC, he was the CB's man.
Yes, it's Darmian's mistake, and a common (but bad) error from a fullback.
With the position Valencia has taken, that's not a slight misreading of the situation or bad coordination. He's on a different planet.
You can look at how many times a cross or opening arrives from our right when Valencia is RB. It's something that won't affect his "stats", but it shows the issues he has as a defender.

2710~~~
He is defensively good but need to improve his attacking game.

2711~~~
He's been really good in the first couple of months, then he turned to shit. I wonder what happened?

Still, he's a better defender than Valencia and at the end of the day it's easier to teach him how to cross than to get Valencia a brain.

2712~~~
Crossing is the least of his worries right now if we're honest, he would have to start getting near the oppositions box more than once a half to have an opportunity to cross.

Lets see if he can work on his first touch, passing and stamina first before we worry about his crossing.

2713~~~
For the third time nothing you said has offered any substance or any perspective to back up what you are saying. I will call this a stalemate and not pursue this argument any further.

2714~~~
Defensively he's looked impressive at times this season but on the ball he's been an absolute mess. Appears to be extremely uncomfortable with the ball at feet and he rarely seems able to even put on a cross let alone put in a good one. I wonder if he'd be worth a try at centre back once in awhile.

2715~~~
It's not just crossing that's his problem. His overall passing is poor and he has no composure when facing any pressure.

2716~~~
You're being too kind, he is aboslutely crap when in possession of the football. He's one of those players where you can see the cogs attempting to turn in his head whenever he has time to think about what he's doing...  and then it usually turns out to be shit.

I would go as far as saying he is worst player in the entire team with the ball at his feet.

2717~~~
Like Valencia. I guess at least Tony while limited and unspectacular doesn't feck many things up

2718~~~
Varela should be our first choice RB for the rest of the season

2719~~~
I'm sure that a lot of full-backs make careless mistakes/aren't quick enough at times but when he's been out of position it's been catastrophically bad. It's not just playing people onside though, there were times when it wasn't tracking players properly or standing off them too much. I don't blame him for it as he's not a natural defender but he really shouldn't be a starting RB at a club with CL or title aspirations. A squad player for his versatility at most.

2720~~~
Completely slipped my mind whilst making that post, of course he's been fantastic.

2721~~~
He looked absolutely class when he first joined. A few months of LVG's training sessions and his form turned to shite.

2722~~~
This. The same goes for a few other players. Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin were mostly solid up until November. Memphis looked bright and confident for the first few months. Even Martial and Smalling are looking poor in recent weeks and months. I don't think it's a coincidence that such a number of good players have turned to shit all at the same time.

2723~~~
One or two maybe, but half a fecking team? Why can't the board see that Van Gaal is the issue? 

Schneiderlin is a really good example actually. He was brilliant for Southampton, to the point where everyone was saying that he was the final part of the jigsaw to turn Arsenal into world beaters. Yet under LVG (surprise surprise) he's been very underwhelming.

2724~~~
First half dozen games looked a solid signing since then has been one of the worst players I remember playing for United.

2725~~~
I think Schneiderlin started very well for us too. He wasn't a stand-out player, but he did a steady job winning the ball back and playing the simple pass. Then December hit and everything went to pot.

I just don't think many of the players are playing in a system which plays to their strengths.

2726~~~
Couldn't agree more mate.

2727~~~
I think he like most foreign players need adjusting to the PL. The Serie A is a big step to the PL in terms of pace and intensity!

2728~~~
A lot of the poor form of players in recent months is probably more to do with players not getting rotated and rested, due to us having such a small squad to begin with and then the ridiculous injury list we have been dealing with.

This is of course still down to Van Gaal for deciding to go into the season with such a thin squad.

2729~~~
Well seeing as he's gone in the summer I'd say they can.

2730~~~
He did look much better for the first few games, his stamina has been shit from day one though. And it doesn't look like he's been working on it.

2731~~~
To be fair. There's nothing to prove it was Van Gaal's doing.
It could just be that Darmian's not actually very good. And the initial 3/4 good games might have just been a case of 'well, every player in the Premier League will play well at least 3 or four times. Even if they're average.'

I also feel there was some overrating going on when he first played. Perhaps as a response to the joy people felt of not having Rafael/Valencia playing.

2732~~~
He is? Or, more so you hope he is.

2733~~~
No. He's gone.

You can quote me on it.

2734~~~
Thats not certain though? Just because Di Marzio keeps on spouting the same Mourinho stuff....he is the only reliable source on that one? Another season of van Gaal and i will take a year out from football after the Euros.

2735~~~
Hopefully but I'm not banking on it.

2736~~~
Of course its certain. 

I can understand the anxiousness whilst its not official, but absolutely no one thinks this season has been acceptable. The board might go about things in ways we do not like, but they're no where near as stubbornly blind to whats going on as people would have you think.

2737~~~
If we don't qualify for the CL which is now looking very likely then he will 100% be sacked in the summer.

2738~~~
If anyone took joy out of Rafael not playing for us anymore then they fecking deserve a player like Darmian.

2739~~~
Fingers crossed as he's the current target of my hate campaign. We're carrying far too many shite players and he's the shittest of the lot.

2740~~~
I was talking about LVG, not Darmian. Virtually no chance we sell him this summer imo.

2741~~~
Don't believe he's good enough myself, strikes me as a guy itching to get back to Seria A.

2742~~~
That would be idiotic..  Mou will park the bus and he will fit right in..

2743~~~
Looks like his days are numbered if Van Gaal stays.

Edit - I'm talking shite.

2744~~~
What the feck hopeless

2745~~~
Guys a pussy, clubs too big for him he can't handle it.

2746~~~
Wallflower.

2747~~~
I'm not sure why he came on.

2748~~~
Don't think he really did anything? At least I can't remember anything.

2749~~~
If only he could cross the ball!

2750~~~
To be fair, he'd still be pretty shit.

2751~~~
It worries me that absolutely everything he does looks like it requires his maximum concentration/effort.... even basic things like passing or heading the ball... it looks like he's having a massive internal dialogue with himself over every little thing.

Oh it also worries me that he's a bit crap too.

2752~~~
Luckily Sterling got taken off and Clichy is almost as bad going forward as Darmian.

2753~~~
Horrible offensive display...sigh. 
Considering the fact that Sterling is now out of the game and Juan Mata is putting on a great team display defensively, it may be best to get Varela in there.

2754~~~
Worst player we have this guy.

2755~~~
That's a lot of negative feedback for a single bad cross. He's been bang on in defense and looks very sharp.

2756~~~
Had some nicer moments. Made a good run to put in a good cross for Rashford.
Also did a great job of tracking David Silva's movement to stop him from scoring.

Lets see if he can build off this confidence.

2757~~~
Yep, been okay in the second half mostly.

2758~~~
<a class="username" data-user="28053, @Snow" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28053/">@Snow</a>
Yep, he's made a lot of important interventions at the back. Surprised at the criticism. Can definitely work on his (almost non existent) offensive output.

Should or could have had an assist as well.

2759~~~
I like him and don't oppose the idea of him having a second season. He has a lot to prove though, and he really doesn't have the pace and attacking ability to be a modern full back. 

No reason why he still can't be a Wes Brown type solid fullback with a more attacking player on the other flank (Evra / Shaw)

2760~~~
Superb defensively

2761~~~
He was superb defensively

2762~~~
cant believe we paid 13 fecking milion for him, it is just money thrown away, could easily promote one of the youngsters... same with rojo, just shocking going forward

2763~~~
One or two shaky spells but played his heart out today. Well done!

2764~~~
Felt so much better when Tim Fosu-whatshisname came on for him.

An Italian defender who can't actually defend.

He's their starting right back isn't he?  

How?

2765~~~
Fecking brilliant defensively, covers so well.

2766~~~
Had good moments, but there is still something missing. Where is the drive and determination? Especially offensively. Looks a bit heavy

2767~~~
Very good defensively today.  Let's give the kid some credit.  Still can't attack worth a crap but hopefully he will have more confidence going forward next year.

2768~~~
When he swtiched to the left he looked slightly exposed to be honest. Defended really well on the right and gave a good moment going forward.

2769~~~
Excellent on the right , was torn apart by Navas on the left.

2770~~~
Very good, strong defender, just a bit pony going forward

2771~~~
Looks like he's struggling a bit with the physical demands of the league, I've seen enough of him to give him another season. Him and Varela should be our rb options next season IMO.

2772~~~
You didn't watch the game.

2773~~~
Fair comment. I think part of it is due to his confidence levels. I notice that the more good plays he makes, the more confident he is in passing the ball or going forward and vice-versa.

2774~~~
Defensively he was excellent 

Going forward very poor

2775~~~
I don't think he put a foot wrong defensively today

Not sure what game you watched buddy

2776~~~
He did get skinned a couple of times by Navas. But then when he was at LB. Otherwise good defensively but hopeless offensively.

2777~~~
Good defensively at RB today though he wasn't up against much. Poor at LB which is fair enough i suppose.

Going forward pathetic as usual.

2778~~~
At LB he was terrible, awful attempts at tackling Navas, out of the three left backs today only TFM could put  a lid on Navas.

2779~~~
I thought he played ok today, certainly doesn't warrant the criticism he has got here. Still has a lot to prove long term though.

2780~~~
Defensively he was very good at right back but he's really not suited to play left back. I hope LvG ends that experiment soon enough.

2781~~~
Might be better as a CB option.

2782~~~
Was decent defensively. I don't think his all round games is worthy of a starting spot ahead of Verela and Valencia.

Was probably lucky Sterling went off early with an injury too. And why was he suffering with cramp?

2783~~~
Neither knows how to defend, so he definitely does deserve to start ahead of them.

2784~~~
Seems to have very poor fitness in general no real stamina which is strange for a career fullback. Could be why he's so poor going forward. Doesn't seem willing or able to get forward and provide width. 

That incident in the first half where Martial was keeping the ball and looking for someone on the overlap but Darmian was nowhere to be found sums him up really.

2785~~~
Neither are great but lets not act like Darmian has been a defensive rock all season either. He's veered between alright like today and awful for the most part after a few promising performances at the start.

There's little difference between playing Darmian or Valencia there really. Both offer little going forward and both defend well enough at times.

2786~~~
Aye, that's the only conclusion you can draw. Can't believe his defensive display is being criticized.

Going forward, yeah, that's another story

2787~~~
Hope we can stop using him on the left. Played quite well enough on the right and needs to be used there only.

2788~~~
Oh yeah. He's been inconsistent, however, it's his first season in the league, England etc. He's also shown himself to actually be quite competent. 

Varela is still young, so I expect him to improve massively. Valencia, on the other hand, isn't a full back and should be back up to Darmian.

2789~~~
I hate when he gets shifted around tbh. It really shouldnt happen to your defense unless its an injury or sending off causing it. He looks better on the right but hoping he improves his attacking play.

2790~~~
Good defensively today but terrible offensively as per....

2791~~~
Seems tired. Willing to give him a chance next season, but has looked very average for the most part this season. Might be a problem for him that he doesn't have one attribute that sticks out really. Valencia at least has his beastly physique and pace, and that's a big part of the reason of why I prefer him so far. Darmian will hopefully improve. He's a smart player, and did alright, but he shouldn't be starting as of right now.

2792~~~
Yeah at times he has, with the emphasis on at times.

I really don't know what to make of him. When he's been poor defensively it just looked to me like a player having difficulty adapting or low on confidence. I thought and still do think he would become very good defensively in a second season here.

But i just don't see enough attacking talent in his game to be a first choice full back at a top club. He could improve yeah but it would have to be a hell of an improvement going forward, maybe unprecedented. I just don't see that side of his game ever being good enough. 

P.S. Valencia isn't a fullback i agree and neither is Blind a CB or Rojo a fullback. Next year i hope we have better options at the back.

2793~~~
It's true, but odd... I swear he played right mid at times for Torino/Italy? Mustn't be that bad going forward

2794~~~
Very good performance.

2795~~~
I never seen him play when he was in Italy but apparently he played wingback at times and was good going forward.

2796~~~
Defensively he is pretty good but going forward he needs some serious work.

2797~~~
His composure on the ball in tight spaces or being closed down really worries me.

Defensively he's pretty solid and made some good blocks and tackles today, but also gifted the ball away often and some of his forward passing made Smalling look like Xavi. 

I think he like Memphis struggles to process things quickly, which in a league like ours isn't good. He can improve that though I'm sure.

2798~~~
Really? If that's a good performance then standards are low!

2799~~~
Agree both Darmain and Rojo have stunk this season.

2800~~~
I thought he had a good game. Honestly I want a better new right back but we can't get everyone so I'm hoping a more consistency performance from Darmian. Hopefully this is going to be the start.

2801~~~
Made quite a few important blocks and interceptions. However, the thought of him going forward appears to make him shit the bed.

2802~~~
I thought he was quite good defensively. First season in England, Italian players peak later etc. I think he'll turn it around sooner or later. Anyone who starts for Italy as a defender <i>must</i> be good.

2803~~~
Is it me dreaming or, I'm sure in pre season he actually attacked?

2804~~~
Both Verela and Valencia offer more overall and can get the job done defensively, where as I don't think Darmian's defensive game would hold up if he were to push forward more.

At the moment, Darmian offers nothing going forward. Not even a presence.
Anything he did that was half decent was over hyped to push the idea that he was better then Valencia. That's how I remember it anyway.

2805~~~
I remember him looking immense in pre-season in general, thought he looked like a brilliant addition. Can be deceiving, I guess.

2806~~~
McNair looks good at right back on pre-season as well.Doesn't mean anything much.

2807~~~
Really isn't a LB so I hope we opt for whatever young option we have on the bench next time instead of him if we want to shift things around.

At RB today he was solid defensively.Still personally would play another RB with better offensive quality in most of the matches.Having two fullbacks who are both useless going forward really limited our offensive play.

2808~~~
Pre-season games are easy. He looks like he's still coming up to the pace of the league. When you're not confident you tend to focus on sitting back on not making mistakes rather than attacking. I think he'll be a different player next season.

At least the fans have gotten over the idea Varela should be starting every week now.

2809~~~
He started the season in fine form and with a fantastic hairdo. Both seem to have abandoned him recently.

2810~~~
Only the fresh player coming on versus the guy who had been playing for 85 minutes.

Navas is always going to get past a player some times when he gets so many 1v1's. Rarely anything comes off it. Better to play it tight and close down the space for Aguero, Silva and Yaya and allow Navas to get some more of it.

2811~~~
How can anyone say he was good? Anytime he had a winger to defend against he got ripped. Sterling had him until he got injured and navas also. Terrible 1 on 1.

2812~~~
He doesn't seem to have the instincts of an attacking full back - there was one instance yesterday where Martial / Rashford (can't recall which) was waiting for him to get forward to receive the ball to cross it in and he just stood there.  Valencia or Shaw would have been bombing forward at that point and we would have created a chance

2813~~~
He was better as LB in the second half with Martial in front of him, I don't think he has enough attacking drive to play with someone like Mata ahead of him on the flank, you need to be able to do more yourself in that situation.

2814~~~
The most balance I've seen from our wings all season.

2815~~~
I would not expect him to be an attacking threat but he does a good job when called upon defensively at RB or LB.

2816~~~
Agreed with that. Defensively he did well.

2817~~~
It was strange. Previously he's always struggled quite a bit on the left, but in this game he instantly looked quite a bit better after making the switch.

2818~~~
I don't think he's particularly good at attacking however having Mata in front of him does him no favours. Mata provides no threat out wide and the opposition knows that so it's very difficult for Darmian to overlap as their attention hasn't been diverted. I'd say that the reason Valencia does a far better job is that as a former winger he is used to having to go past and attack players on his own. Going forward, the two of them should not play together on the same side.

2819~~~
Terrible terrible facial hair from the lad.

2820~~~
Normally I moan about the usual full back changes, but it was a good change. If Everton weren't longballing it, they were going down our left. Rojo was getting roasted every time. Darmian is flawed, but his best strength is his one-on-ones, IMO. He wins more than he loses, and Deulofeu wasn't getting much joy after that.

2821~~~
He was ok defensively and as usual a non entity going forward.

At this stage i think its safe to say this isn't poor form, this is just how he plays. Don't mind him staying as an option but would really love it if we either sign a proper RB who can offer something going forward or at the very least try to develop Varela next year.

2822~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Its embarrassing isn't it? What exactly is he going for with that. Just random triangles on the side of his face.

2823~~~
The struggle beard / side burn thing was horrendous, but his performance was quite good today. A performance similar to the start of the season when he looked solid.

2824~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The mustache as well. It is like two lines of hair at the edges only. It just makes no sense.

2825~~~
He just doesn't inspire anything in me at all... and his sheer reluctance to attack at times is incredibly frustrating.

I think the nicest thing I can say about him is that he's better then Marcos Rojo.

2826~~~
he makes Valencia look confident

2827~~~
He makes Valencia look like fecking Cafu.

2828~~~
What the F is going on with his facial hair? He looks like a prize winning gimp

And he was found wanting for that goal...

2829~~~
Van Gaal this week

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oi_5lXIT5AY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2830~~~
Him and Rojo<<<Bo-Jack and TMJ.

2831~~~
So useless, its insane.

2832~~~
Valencia is also <b>far</b> better.

2833~~~
Well i'd say Blind was more of an idiot there for ball watching. Still terrible defending by both players.

2834~~~
He's not good enough. Another bad purchase.

2835~~~
USELESS

2836~~~
Darmian in>3 goals

2837~~~
Deserves his place on the bench behind the academy players. Comes on and we get torched for three goals in the next five minutes.

2838~~~
Oh my, that's a shocking sub.

2839~~~
Two of the goals came from his side, and the other goal came from the free kick he conceded...

2840~~~
All three goals were entirely his fault.

2841~~~
Honestly one of the worst players i've ever seen play for United shocking.

Complete and utter useless tosser with shit facial hair a 15 year old would be embarrassed by.

Has to be the first out the door in June.

2842~~~
Must be the last time we see him under Van Gaal? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2843~~~
God I hope so. What reason do we have to keep him? We have several better players on lower wages from the academy.

How can he be starting for Italy?

2844~~~
Get rid. Literally no reason to persist with him. He's got nothing going for him athletically, defensively or in the attacking third.

2845~~~
Get Darmian on they said...

2846~~~
Woeful player.

2847~~~
Other than the first game of the season, he's been awful.  I can't believe that he's an Italian international defender.

2848~~~
I saks Darmian on for Rojo at half time. Damn I was wrong. Excellent for Tottenham tonight

2849~~~
Rather have Valencia at RB...

2850~~~
Surprisingly he's one of their best players. Made the XI for best players throughout the Euro qualifier matches too.

2851~~~
Valencia, Varela, Young, Fosu-Mensah... List goes on.

2852~~~
Is it possible... is there someone actually worse than Rojo?

2853~~~
The guy is useless. 

The "its his first season" excuse doesn't work either. He'll be just as shite next season

2854~~~
I'm better than him. Woeful

2855~~~
But we got rid of the deadwood such as Rafael so it's okay!

I said that at least after 10 games this season.

2856~~~
The moment he came up on, the game completely changed. Should have been Valencia subbed on, it was an obvious choice which, no surprise, LVG fecked up.

2857~~~
Not good enough. Darmian, Mata and Morgan are all nowhere near United level.

2858~~~
Hard to say which is worse, his performance or his facial hair.

2859~~~
Shitehawk.

2860~~~
I would rather have at RB in the following order.

Valencia
Mensah
Varela
Jones
Young
McNair
Smalling
Lingard
Rooney
Mata
Carrick
De Gea
Giggs
Van Gaal
Me 
My Mum
Play with 10 men
Darmian

2861~~~
I don't understand it. Bizarre and awful... his facial hair that is. His performances match that description also, however.

2862~~~
Jesus we can only hope, it looked like today the management preferred TFM to play on injured rather than bring Darmian on.

2863~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2864~~~
Slow

2865~~~
I kind of keep wanting to think he'll improve with another season, better manager and more settled side but the more we see him, the more it might just be the case that he isn't remotely good enough.

2866~~~
I miss Rafael so much <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2867~~~
Was he really the best fullback/wingback in Serie A?

2868~~~
People are so fickle. I'm not a massive fan of Darmian, but people blaming him for all three goals is ridiculous. It was just a massive coincidence that we concede three when he come on. 

<b>First goal</b>

For starters, Smalling and Blind went for the same ball, meaning one of them were out of position when Alli broke through the middle.

<b>Second goal</b>

Set piece. Rojo nowhere near his man

<b>Third goal</b>

Darmian may have got closer to Rose, but lets not go on like Spurs weren't putting in crosses when Mensah was on. Lamela with a great finish. Blind should have been tighter to him.

2869~~~
All 3 goals came from his side.

The first goal he was flat footed and didn't react, Eriksen is hardly the quickest player around.

2nd goal, who gave away the freekick for the goal with a late, brainless challenge?

3rd goal was from his side but a good goal so no real blame.

He is just an awful player, needs to go

2870~~~
Out of position for the first goal, Eriksen didn't have much influence when TFM was on him.

Gave away the free kick for the second.

Third goal came from his side.

Was he completely at fault for all 3 no of course not. But he was the common fecking denominator. Comes on in the 69th minute and 7 minutes later we are 3 goals down. Thats more than a coincidence mate.

2871~~~
Okay... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2872~~~
Torino fans were glad we bought him because it meant they wouldn't have to sell him to Juventus.

2873~~~
He's really good at tackling, but pretty ropey at most other stuff.

After a good first couple of months, it's looking like the journalists who said "be honest, can you see him as United's 1st choice in 2 years" are ver correct

2874~~~
He was beside Eriksen. Eriksen crossed it and Alli was free. When Mensah was on, there were plenty of crosses that come from that side. It just so happened that they scored off two of them. 

Plenty of players give away free kicks. As a team, we still have to make sure we mark up. 

Darmian's played in our last couple of games and has done well, where he's been part of a back four keeping a clean sheet against both, City and Everton. People were questioning his omission from the team today.

2875~~~
The guy was pretty good that first month( player of the month award), but it's been steadily down hill from there.

2876~~~
Even in his first month he was only slightly above average, he was still easily our worst defender let alone deserving player of the month.

2877~~~
I wouldnt be surprised if he looks awesome under a manager like Jose.

2878~~~
For a guy who is suppose to be great at tackling, he does give away plenty of fouls away, i am just surprised how poor he is, given his reputation when we bought him. He and Rojo are both so shit its unthinkable. We have been robbed with these two players, and to think we have given Rafa away for these two jerks.

2879~~~
Mentioned it in the match day thread. Sterling gets stick for his beard, but Darmian's is pathetic.

2880~~~
Those sideburns are absolutely terrible.

2881~~~
Best full back in Europe they said...<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2882~~~
Loses his place to an 18 year old; 18 year old gets injured; replaces 18 year old; concede three goals from attacks down his side in 6 minutes! Ouch.

Feel a bit sorry for him though, he looks like a nice boy.

2883~~~
Just another one of Dr LvG's successful experiments. Somehow turns Italy's best right back into a fecking blind donkey is one season.

How can he go from brilliant in his first 6 or 7 games to this...? How is it possible?

2884~~~
Easy, he wasn't brilliant in his first 6 or 7 games.

2885~~~
Bollocks.

2886~~~
I don't want to make excuses for him, but the drop off in performance is alarming.

I wouldn't say he was brilliant per se, but he certainly looked solid and not completely clueless like he is is now.

2887~~~
I blame his performance today purely because of the "beard" on his face.

Shocking stuff, Matteo.

2888~~~
He gets beaten by anyone with decent pace, and lacks in a lot of ways, but close up tackling he's good.
for some reason I then thought about Jonny Evans, who I thought was sh!t at most things, but good at interceptions!

Rojo is just average I think, and zero attacking threat. I don't especially understand the "sh!t" business, but do understand when you lose, it's very easy to call everyone it.
I think bar Martial, De Gea and Rashford everyone has been labelled it at least once this season!

2889~~~
It isn't bollocks at all, the attacking game was nonexistent as it always was and his defending was pretty good but still worse than Smalling, Shaw, and Blind. He was decent, certainly not brilliant. He was overrated due to being a new signing and was nowhere near as good as people were going on.

2890~~~
It is bollocks. Look around page 21 of this thread for proof of opinion of him when he started out. And its no surprise hes not the only one whos suffered as a result.

2891~~~
Came on to show Rojo what truly shit fullbackery is all about.

2892~~~
He was excellent the first month, but it's gone rapidly downhill from there. IF we get a new manager I'm hoping they can kind of salvage something from the guy because if he keeps this up he is gone.

2893~~~
Beard? What the feck? I was certain that was a tarantula on the side of his face.

2894~~~
As soon as he came on i knew the game was over that's how lowly I rate him. Never got the hype of the pre season.

2895~~~
That doesn't mean shit, people were wanking themselves silly every time Schweinsteiger touch the pitch without doing shit. New signings are always overrated on here, threads were made because Memphis was so great and complaining he wasn't getting to play every minute of every game. He was pretty good for the first month in a really strong backline in which he was the worst member of. Hardly that impressive and certainly not brilliant. Once the rest of the backline's levels dropped he has turned to absolute shite.

2896~~~
Darmian has had about 2/3 good games in his United career and even in those he was rather shite going forward. His rashness and poor positional sense was fairly obvious even in the initial games. He's a bit shit. Nothing to do with LVG.

2897~~~
I agree. I didn't get the early plaudits.

Some average performances were hyped up because a section of the support were eager not to have Valencia as the starting right back.

2898~~~
I dont get your bolded part when your next line is about Darmian being pretty good for the first month. Whether he was the weakest part makes no difference either. Its like me saying Scholes was really good but the weakest in our midfield of Scholes/Keane/Beckham/Giggs. It doesnt diminish his own levels.

His defending was more than decent as you said in another post.  In fact you just said he was pretty good. Fine line in opinion between pretty good and brilliant.

Plus if he was a one-off player that has regressed I could buy that. But its no shock hes not the first one that has struggled (especially with the whole crap of switching him from LB to RB back to LB back to RB stuff we did). His defending has certainly regressed and I blame the manager for the most part (but he should take his own responsibility).

2899~~~
He wasn't tight enough on Eriksen, as usual he was slack in his positioning.

Plenty of players give away free kicks but it's a regular feature of Darmian's game, it was a brainless tackle as well that conceded it.

He's just an awful player, it's great that people still want to support/defend him and only see the positives but even at his best he is just ok defensively and going forward well.. he doesn't.

All in all a rather pointless player, we should have a much better RB.

2900~~~
Brilliant is a bit of an overstatement. Played well, looked solid defensively yes, brilliant hell fecking no.

2901~~~
The bolded part is that people wank themselves silly over every new signing so what they post after a signing means absolutely nothing so there is no point referencing back to it.

I'd disagree, there is a huge line between pretty good and brilliant. Pretty good is slight above decent. Brilliant is one of the best players on the team and in the league, that he certainly was not. Him being the weakest part does make a difference because he was playing off the strength of the other players and when it came time for him to step up and support them he turned to shit. He hasn't shown an ounce of attacking ability from the get go which is embarrassing. The whole excuse of being shifted around is bullshit imo too as he has hardly been shifted around at all and 2 of his better performances have actually been on the left.

2902~~~
Needs to deal with whatever his "beard" is before he fixes the footballing side I think. Awful.

Performance wise I'm hoping he'll be a lot better next season to say the least. I think he will be though. Italians are pretty intent on saying he's a very good player and United fans don't know how good he is yet and all that. Definitely plays better for the national team then for United. Would probably help having a good winger in front of him to mask his attacking deficiencies instead of having Mata there too.

2903~~~
Fully agree with this. Hes pretty damn brainless with that. Hes worse than Valencia at hitting opposition ankles.

2904~~~
He's terrible offensively and very average defensively (and saying average is being kind).

2905~~~
I've defended both him and Rojo in the past, but feck me he looks an appalling player. 

Blind, Rojo, Darmian, Jones should all be nowhere near a United defense. Requiring time to develop is no longer acceptable when we're in such dire straits in the present.

2906~~~
we need a thread about his facial hair. its more offensive than his performances

2907~~~
That was one of the worst displays by a United full back that I've seen - good job it was only for 25 minutes or whatever!  Colin Gibson - all is forgiven!

2908~~~
Only United fullbacks?

2909~~~
The weirdest thing is that, despite what we have seen from him since arriving, some on here still think he's great defensively and only poor in an offensive sense.

2910~~~
I think standards have dropped to such a low level some don't know better any more.

I seen his early form described as brilliant a few pages back. If Darmian's displays in August were brilliant then what the feck were Neville, Irwin and Evra?

2911~~~
Your first paragraph answered your second there really. A-lot of fans have accepted blatant mediocrity and when a player has anything that resembles an adequate performance, some on here praise them to the hilt.

I've read some in the Lingard thread this season call him brilliant and describe some of his performances as excellent; there's also posters in here that think Darmian is 'excellent' in a defensive sense. I mean, that just says it all really.

2912~~~
Yeah standards have really fell off a cliff among United fans.

I went into the Lingard performance thread for the first time a few weeks back. Wow couldn't believe half of what i was reading, as you say loads who think he's been brilliant. All i see is a kid who fair play to him tries hard but is mostly a passenger. 4-5 years ago under Fergie a player like that would have been on the outskirts of the squad like Obertan, Bebe etc. but under Van Gutt-a-squad he's a permanent fixture in the first XI.

2913~~~
Don't think hes been great but seriously who do you play instead?

2914~~~
I thought he was good initially. But he really has just turned to shit. He has 20 odd caps for Italy though, obviously as a defender, so he must have something going for him. Maybe he will improve under a different manager. He obviously has a lot more to his game. I wouldn't give up hope just yet. He's no Denis Irwin though.

2915~~~
As opposed to Lingard? Herrera, Memphis, Young, Januzaj and Pereira more or less in that order.

2916~~~
Instead of who Darmian?

2917~~~
No Lingard, but wrong thread anyway.

2918~~~
The initial positive reaction to Darmian was mostly fuelled by 'shiny new toy' and 'I hate Valencia so I want to big up the new guy'.

2919~~~
For Lingard in no particular order at AM Mata, Herrera, Rooney, Fellaini. At RW Young, Valencia, Januzaj, Depay.

2920~~~
Mainly been unavailable, not sure about Valencia either tbh. Also Memphis doesn't deserve to be starting ahead of Lingard (or at least didn't)
Like I said before don't think hes been good, but hes been better than Memphis (despite the latter being more talented)

2921~~~
He looks absolutely clueless and like he doesn't want to be here at all.

2922~~~
Was going through all the leagues full backs (including villa) and I genuinely think Darmian and Rojo as a pair might be the worse full backs in the league. 
With fullbacks they're either good defensively or crap going forward, vice versa . Rojo and Darmian manage to be shit at both. There are other terrible full backs like Hutton and Bardsley but at least they have the decency to mask their lack of ability by kicking the shit out of people and letting them know they're around . 

Both Lvg signings also, and bare in mind he let go of evra and rafael.
Which links into my other theory that Lvg is the worse manager in the league .

2923~~~
I agree with the clueless bit, but where do you get the idea that he doesn't want to be here?

2924~~~
Well i don't know about him not wanting to be at United but he certainly doesn't look like he's enjoying his time in England so far which is understandable.

I think some people might think he doesn't work that hard during games to get up and down the pitch. But i think that's more down to him having terrible stamina. Honestly i don't think i've seen many career fullbacks with such a poor engine.

I wasn't worried early in the season when he had to be subbed a lot of the time towards the end of games, but 8 months on it doesn't seem to have improved much. After 60 minutes he always looks gassed.

2925~~~

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2926~~~
I've been his biggest critic but what a strike! Set up the first goal too...

Seems to have had his better games at left back in recent months

2927~~~
So... it turns out he can use his left foot.

2928~~~
Poor positioning from the keeper, unstoppable strike though. Hopefully this helps him really push on, I'm sure he will.

2929~~~
Great goal. Really happy for him.

2930~~~
Well I didn't see that coming. Brilliant shot. Even his cross for the assist was better than usual. Zaha did get the better of him a few times.

2931~~~
His best game this season?

2932~~~
He had a good game, much better than Rojo has been at LB in the last few weeks.

2933~~~
What a goal that was, shame the Man Utd goal of the season nominations have already been set because that would have been a close winner. 

So with that goal, does that mean all of our summer signings (excluding Romero) have scored for us?

2934~~~
Good game. Hopefully he continues in this vein and pushes on for next season.

2935~~~
taking tips from Varela. #notbad

2936~~~
Absolutely wank sideburns. Just atrocious.

2937~~~
So even Darmian is better than Rojo these days...

Gave keeper zero chances. Overall dynamic performance without bigger mistakes.

2938~~~
Great goal not to take away from it but his technique looks like he's just wildly swinging a leg at it, his intent was there therefore was such a sweet goal but just looked quite awkward. 

Side note that is the biggest issue with watching it live is you can only think for a second what a great goal, but then really wish for a replay

2939~~~
The technique is sensational, the ball is on the bounce slightly out of reach so he has to lunge at it and leave the ground with both feet, it was like an RVP goal.

2940~~~
We signed the guy to be our starting right back, yet he's much better on the left <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Great goal though <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Hopefully it'll give him some much needed confidence.

2941~~~
Channeled his inner spirit of Scholes right there.

Actually do recall him scoring a few of those for Italy and Torino tbh.

2942~~~
Cracking goal and good work for the first. He attacked more in this game than he probably has all season.

Didn't have much to do defensively but he was ok there as well. Probably his best game for us so far.

2943~~~
Fantastic goal, no idea how hes got MOTM mind

2944~~~
He had a few good games at the start of the season tbf.

2945~~~
Great to see him get a goal. He couldn't stop smiling after the final whistle. This guy drives on confidence. More and more good performances will make him a really really good player for the future.

I was also surprised how good his first touch was. More often than not, his first touch was class. That first time layoff from a diagonal pass was incredible even for a forward, let alone a defender.

2946~~~
No one really stood out today, Darmian had a hand in both goals so it's only natural that he gets it.

2947~~~
That was some strike from him, nearly broke the goalpost with the power on it.

2948~~~
It was quite fitting for him that after a few posters were calling for Varela to replace him in the team after GV scored that goal last night, that Darmian scored a similar but better one the day after.

His best performance for us. I won't mention his triangles tonight.

2949~~~
Best performance in a long while for us, he needs to build on this.

2950~~~
Fair enough i thought smalling was probably better throught the 90 mins and possibly Rooney as well but yeh certainly a better game from Darmian today.

2951~~~
And it was a damn good goal to score for your first Man Utd goal!

Now if only he shaved off that fluff he calls a beard.

2952~~~
Haha, yeh a truly brilliant goal but agree on those burns, no no no...

2953~~~
I actually thought he was having a poor first half, assist aside <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Great goal though. Needs a shave though.

2954~~~
If so many dont like his facial hair thats a great reason to leave it as it is.

2955~~~
Yeah was an incredibly hard ball to hit but that technique always looks quite awkward because your hitting a ball just out of reach so the leg is overextending, like he's just taking a big swing

2956~~~
That facial hair, a full moon out tonight.....Get's a goal and assist..

Interesting

2957~~~
Happy for him, think there is a quality player in there

2958~~~
Yeah that's the thing with it, definitely looks a touch awkward the way he goes for it but really really hard to pull off.

2959~~~
he started very well for us....then sort of lost his way.

lets hope he gets his mojo back..

2960~~~
Scores and assists in a 2-0 win. Gee I wonder why

2961~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2962~~~
Its amazing how he plays well when he has someone half decent ahead of him. Noone shines when they have Mata as a winger ahead of them, and Lingard is not much better. Valencia does OK because hes not as defensively aware and is happy to leave gaps.

He hasnt played well recently but hes still got the ability.

2963~~~
Yeah, that's it...

2964~~~
Valencia is a winger by nature and much keener to get forward at the expense of his defensive positioning. Mata or Lingard are not going to keep the opposition wing pinned back, or cover as quickly when needed as Martial will on the other side. Look at a heatmap of the game and Valencia is 10 - 20 yards further forward than Darmian, and Schneiderlin was dropping in to cover him. As a result Sako and Soure were having much more freedom to pass and shoot down our right.

2965~~~
I just thought it was a weird critique of Valencia. I actually think (or hope) Darmian will come good, but he was a bigger defensive liability than Valencia today.

Edit: I've not actually looked at a flippin heatmap tho

2966~~~
Considering most of Palace's threat came down Darmian's side, it shouldn't be a surprise. Zaha was the only player threatening to trouble. That doesn't make him a liability. He needed Schnedierlin's assistance in the first half on a couple of ocassions, but was solid in the second half.
Valencia pretty much had nothing to do defensively.

2967~~~
And Darmian allowed exactly 1 cross from him in the 90 mins.
For that 1 cross Valencia was in the box, and had 1 runner to track. He didn't, the player won his header, cushioned it for Adebayor, who missed. Palace's only chance.

In games like this it's ok to play him but he's a positional nightmare.

2968~~~
I still back him to be a top RB for us in the coming seasons if Mourinho gets appointed. Van Gaal sucked the life out of him. Such a negative transfirmation

2969~~~
I think same can be said about many of our players.

it's why I want to give these guys a chance with next manager, and it's also why I want LVG out ASAP (not the only reason, mind).

2970~~~
With LvG (hopefully) gone, do we back him to see somewhat of a, "Evra-ish" transformation? Patrice wasn't that much thought of during his first (half) season, but grew into it. Hopefully the same can happen with Darmian.

2971~~~
Im just pointing it out for everyone who moans about Darmian's attacking ability. Its impossible to attack as a full back when you have lightweight players ahead of you unless you're happy leaving acres of space in behind, which no defender should be.

2972~~~
Goal and assist. It had to be him.

2973~~~
He wasn't even the best full back yesterday never mind man of the match

2974~~~
Defensively he was poor, but he still won the game with his contribution. How could it be anyone else?

2975~~~
Aye, time and again any striker scoring a goal or 2 to win a match, even though he'd have done very little else, will be voted for as motm. Don't really see any issue at all with a defender getting the nod for a match winning contribution in terms of an assist and a goal.

2976~~~
Still highly rate him, he'll come good next season under Jose.

2977~~~
Well, he is Italy's first-choice RB isn't he? 

Can't be too bad.

I find it hard to fairly/seriously judge anybody playing under Van Gaal.

2978~~~
Did he play well though? Or did he just play like Darmian but score a goal? 

I mean, the most impressive thing he did in this game was managing to somehow throw a throw in directly off the pitch for a throw in to the other team.

And he always looks more comfortable on the left, though this might be because we actually have a wide player on the left wing, as opposed to the right where we usually have no one.

2979~~~
He played to a consistent Darmain performance but set up the first and scored the 2nd. He was nowhere near man of the match in my opinion.

2980~~~
So much controversy for a Man of the Match award. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
United fans just can't stop finding faults even for the smallest of things.

2981~~~
Good goal and was involved but he got skinned several times by zaha easily. He is still a complete liability and I never feel comfortable when he is on the ball.

2982~~~
This

2983~~~
He's been dogshit going forward all season no matter who plays in front of him. Palace were fecking horrible last night and had a virtual reserve side out thats why he got forward more.

Mata and Lingard both do their fair share of defensive work, look at Mata the other week against Spurs.

2984~~~
Bit harsh but even after his goal and "assist," I still don't think he should start at Wembley.

He's ahead of Rojo but that's not saying much.

2985~~~
The fact he came back to sit on the bench in that air boot thingy hopefully means it's not as serious as first thought.

2986~~~
Feel bad for him but he's absolutely made of glass. It seemed such an odd way to injure your ankle, it was pretty much a shoulder barge?!.  unfortunately he seems like another injury prone defender we've managed to get.

2987~~~
The player who he tackles, his studs go down Darmians achilles and heel. Think that's how it happened.

2988~~~
When he's not shit, he's injured. What a signing.

2989~~~
He's shite so I'm not really bothered if he's injured. Hopefully the club will give him a return ticket to Italy this summer.

2990~~~
There was a stamp/kick on the top of his ankle. I caught it on one of the replays.

2991~~~
No upgrade on Rafa at all in the end then, shame. He looked decent in the first few appearances with his reading, less impulsive than Rafa. But as the season has gone on his weaknesses have become evident and to top it off he spends just as long on the treatment table - not to mention seemingly receiving a yellow every time he steps on the field.

He may be a useful bench option as he can play multiple positions but surely we are going to be looking for a RB yet again this summer.

2992~~~
Yeah just saw a replay, I can see now. I dunno I'm sure it hurt but he was acting like he broke his ankle, apparently he's walking around on it now?.. I dunno he just seems a bit soft at times.

2993~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://oldtraffordfaithful.com/manchester-united-handed-boost-as-injury-not-thought-to-be-serious/?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://oldtraffordfaithful.com/manchester-united-handed-boost-as-injury-not-thought-to-be-serious/?</a>

Manchester United’s Matteo Darmian was stretchered off the field during the 1-0 win over Norwich City this afternoon, with a serious looking leg injury. After the game, Louis van Gaal remained tight-lipped on the situation, but now we’ve been given a positive update.


According to Sky Sports Italy via<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football-italia.net/83964/darmian-injury-scare-euro-2016" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b><i>Football Italia</i></b></a>, that <b>injury isn’t thought to be all that serious, and Darmian has already told his family that he shouldn’t be out for that long.</b>

This will be a huge relief to Manchester United, who have their FA Cup final to play in just a couple of weeks. It’ll also be good news for the Italy national team, of which Matteo Darmian is a crucial part of as EURO 2016 nears.

Darmian started life at Old Trafford like a house on fire earlier in the season, putting in brilliant performances week-in week-out. However over the last few months he has looked short of confidence and those levels have dropped. Missing the European Championships would have shot that confidence further, so hopefully he will be back playing as early as Wednesday.

2994~~~
Overstatement there. He played well for yes, brilliant no. Week in, week out. Yeah for about 3 weeks in total.

Followed by a massive understatement. His levels dropped alright, the fecking arse fell out of his performance level in September and it's still on the floor.

2995~~~
Did i imagine it or did i read somewhere this guy only missed like 2-3 games in the last 5 years or something in Italy.

Since he's came to England he's been made of Chocolate.

2996~~~
Hopefully he can go to the Euros. Hate it when players get injuries just before a tournament is about to start and miss out on it.

2997~~~
Did fine in both roles when he came on, he's one I'm interested in seeing next season to see if he can improve.

2998~~~
I actually think Jose will like him and i can see him being used for the bigger teams for his defensive stuff. Would like to see him work on his attacking play (mostly his crossing and linking up with players up top). Hope he stays clear of injuries as well.

2999~~~
kep him because he can play rb/lb but get someone better so he is 2nd choice at each position.

3000~~~
Was nervous when i saw him coming on, given his recent horror show vs Spurs.

But he didn't make any major howlers or cost us a goal. Well done Matteo.

3001~~~
Just read article linking him with the move away. I personally is for it. We can sell him without any loss, well minus amortization, all in all i think he is decent right back, but extremely average and i think we need someone much better to be or starter and compete with Valencia. Especially in attack. You look at Arsenal full backs, at Real's, Barca's, Munich's, PSG's, just name any top club here, even Spurs that maybe are not top but had a top season. And every right back is way better in offence than Darmian. It's not even a comparison, of course some as Alves are overly attacking, but that's just Barca. There are maybe 10-15 right full backs that we can get and who are much much better in opposition's half.

We must buy a more attacking option, in modern football players like Darmian is simply dinosaurs.

3002~~~
Italian press today saying Mourinho has made it absolutely clear to him that, he isn't going anywhere.

3003~~~
Good.

3004~~~
Of course he isnt, Mou is a fan. Some on here really think he is shit, but van Gaal and injuries + first season have dragged him massively down. In form, he is fantastic.

3005~~~
Good player, struggled adjusting to the league after a bright start, but I have absolutely no doubts he is good enough to start for us. The good thing with Mourinho is if you do your job you stay in the team which hasn't been the case this season, players start to hit form, get dropped and then come back useless, if Darmian impresses pre-season I fancy him to have the right fullback spot locked down, not an easy task as Valencia is a very good right back but we'll see.

3006~~~
Had some bad games but far and away our best RB.

3007~~~
Good back up for Tony V.

3008~~~
He's a lot better than Valencia, shame he had a disrupted season in a stuttering side. Jose will get the the best of of him though.

3009~~~
Darmian is talented, intelligent, and runs his ass off. 

I would have been surprised if Mourinho didn't want him.

3010~~~
I'm gonna say now that he'll improve in a big way under Mourinho and will be our nailed on first choice RB by the end of the season.

He's obviously a lot stronger in defence than attack, something that won't displease Mourinho given how much he loved Azpilicueta. Even his attacking game could improve if we assume that (like many others) he just didn't react well to LVG's rigid philosophy. It certainly seemed like his confidence went for a while too.

Plus it was his first year in a new country, which can always have an effect.

Of all the underwhelming signings who need to step up next year, he's the one I have most faith in.

3011~~~
I've seen more attacking intent from a rubber sword than this guy. His crosses have been worse than Valencia's this season and Valencia puts in more crosses because he can actually attack.

3012~~~
Disagree, emphatically.
Valenica offered us much more when fit last season, and until Damien actually starts putting in some performances for us it should be Valencia's spot to lose.

3013~~~
Valencia's performances at the end of the season were better than Darmian supposed 'brilliant' matches at the start of the season.

3014~~~
He's terrible. Should be miles behind Valencia for Mourinho.

3015~~~
One can hope but I don't think he'll become good next season tbh.

3016~~~
cant believe some are saying Valencia is better. He simply is not. Darmain is a proper right back used so poorly by van idiot.

Mourinho will get the best out of him I'm sure.

3017~~~
Mou knows his shit.   He will stay.

3018~~~
So van Gaal told him to do absolutely in an attacking sense but not the other RBs, did he also tell him to consistently get skinned? Nah, he is just not that good.

3019~~~
having Mata in front of him hardly helps. Get a proper winger and Darmain will be fine.

3020~~~
Why didn't it stop every other RB from attacking? Won't help much because he simply doesn't even try to venture forward. A proper winger will just mask how shit he is getting forward and his extremely limited ability on the ball. The only thing he has on Valencia is that he is a 'proper' right back.

3021~~~
Same is said for Mata, just replace the word winger for full back.

3022~~~
Mata isn't a right winger though, even with Valencia behind him he's subpar. He's a good footballer with some brilliant moments, but he's not cut out to be a winger, or a wide playmaker. It's beside the point though, Darmian is a good player, and I expect him to be given a chance under Mourinho. I think we're jumping to conclusions here considering the shit football the player were instructed to play. I'm going to trust Mourinho on this. If he keeps him, then it's fine by me. If he gets rid, it's fine by me. Best to wait and see.

3023~~~
Absolutely ridiculous that people think Valencia is a better RB. It's laughable really. 

Do people forget how shaky Valencia is defensively? No thank you.

3024~~~
Valencia played well in his absence because he is a fast strong and hard worker. Darmian, however, is not a bad player. He was Van Gaalised and like most of our players will for sure improve under Jose I am sure. He started the season excellently, people seem to forget this. He deffo has the ability. We can't rely on Val forever as he is getting older and slower.

3025~~~
I'm just pointing out the fallacy in the argument used. Ones defending Mata say he needs a better fullback, ones defending Darmian say he needs a better winger.

3026~~~
Him and Valencia are sufficient cover for me at RB and I wouldnt be looking at bringing anyone in.

3027~~~
Fair enough, it is a bit silly to use it as a comparison.

3028~~~
Definitely this ^^^

I´m sure he´ll get the same he magnificiently got out of Paolo Ferreira, Asier del Horno, Khalid Boularouz <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> and Shevchenko, Falcao, Cuadrado, Steve Sidwell, Nuri Sahin, Tel Bel Shite, Fabio Coentrao, SWP, Kezman, the list goes on and on . . . the man knows his shit.

Our attack was laughably boring and shite last year, as perfectly symbolized by Darmian. Why on earth do we want this guy around. I´m sure that attacking genius Mourinho will love him. This appreciation for Darmian is beyond delusional. Has there ever been a worse attacking fullback at United than Darmo?

3029~~~
Valencia was quite comfortably better than Darmian last season. Not even particularly close. When Darmian wasn't injured he was shite.

3030~~~
Nobody is saying Valenica is Cafu MKII, but Darmian was shite for 3/4ths of the season, until he starts putting in performances for us I don't see why anyone would consider him our automatic first choice.
He may well be better next year, after a year to settle in Englsih football, and under Mourinho, but lets actually see him put in a couple performances first, beceause at this particular moment in time, Valencia gives us more at RB.

3031~~~
Yeah, did you see that first match against PSV and the first half against Arsenal and his first 5 minutes against Spuds and his like 10 yellow cards and those times LVG had to yank him at halftime. I somehow forgot how shaky Valencia is defensively.
<i>


"He [Darmian] gave too much space to <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dusan-tadic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tadic</a> in my opinion, so that's why I brought on Valencia," declared the United chief.

“I didn't see Tadic in the second half, did you?</i>

3032~~~
Do you forget how shaky Darmian was defensively?

3033~~~
I am not Darmian's biggest fan (obviously) but i also think he could improve under Mourinho, well i hope he does anyway. But when i read some of the opinions on him in here i honestly have to wonder who some people were watching last year. Because going on this thread it wasn't the same Darmian i watched.

Jesus thats an understatement if ever i saw one. Some bad games?

He had some diabolical games, some terrible games and some good games at the very start. But for the most part he was awful lets not beat around the bush here. 

He's possibly the best RB in this squad but only because he's the only actual right back in it. Outside of his first few games Mensah, Valencia and Young had better performances there despite not being actual right backs.

I doubt they do, they also probably don't forget Darmian was as bad or worse while also providing nothing going forward. At least Tony gets forward and tried to help the team out in attack.

Thats an interesting question actually, despite us over the years playing centre backs, wingers and midfielders there due to injuries and suspensions i honestly have to say yes. He has definitely been the least attacking FB i can remember, there were games last year where he didn't venture over the half way line at all.

3034~~~
Needs more time but Valencia was comfortably better last season when he played. 

I think Darmian got LVGed as he looked very good in his first few games. As I've said before it is very hard to judge any of our players based solely on most of the last two years simply because of the weird tactical instructions coming from the top.

3035~~~
He wasn't used poorly, that can be said about attacking players.. It's not Van Gaal's fault that Darmian can't control football, his defending is just not good enough but there maybe space for improvement in this department as he was new to the league but attacking is always harder to develop, you either have it in you or not, he's 26 he will hardly get faster and learn how to dribble which is essential for modern day fullback. He's quite useless for today's football - we of course want to play and match the best teams in the world. I don't think he's one of those players who should get another season, it's just waste of space and money, it's clear from the moment one, he will struggle like Buttner struggled with defending.

I'd rather give chance to Varela who showed he can be a great attacking threat, yeah some occasional lapses in positioning let him down but Darmian himself was barely better in defending and was given much more chances to prove himself..

TBH I would spend money on a new fullback, someone like Cancelo

3036~~~
I think people also forget that Darmian was blatantly our best player for about the first month and a half, then he got injured and subsequently LVG'd like 95% of the squad.

He's going to thrive under Mourinho.

3037~~~
my point was van gaal drives confidence from players. I would honestly give players like Darmain and Herrera a hard second look...at least I hope Mourinho would do it.

EDIT: both these players started so well for us.

3038~~~
They haven't because that was never true. He wasn't even our best defender for the first month, heck he wasn't even our best fullback.

3039~~~
Thought he started the season off well, before LVG "philosophized" him.  Hopefully, playing under Mourinho will return him to the form that made us buy him in the first place.

3040~~~
That has to be my favorite one of the 157 excuses of why Darmian is so shite

3041~~~
You only have this intense dislike of the guy because of your odd obsession with Valencia.

3042~~~
Lazy response. I think it has to do more with the fact that he is absolute shite, as most have finally figured out. If anything, the odd Valencia obsession was the unbelievable bandwagon of criticism of the lad.

3043~~~
I agree. He is good with Torino & Italy NT, after one season with LVG, he became shite...

3044~~~
If Mourinho can iron out his inconsistency then he'll be just fine.

3045~~~
Not at all, he is a fecking Italian international, the idea that he is "shite" is daft and comes from the fact he plays in the position where you idol plays, so you have torn him a new arsehole after nearly every game, it's transparent.

3046~~~
It was actually more like 3-4 games and he wasn't our best player. He was good nothing more.

That little run for Darmian at the start of last season must have now surpassed the great Anderson/Cleverley combination at the start of 2011/12 in terms of exaggerated performances.

3047~~~
This is a strange one. The fullback who played for Torino and who plays for Italy (mind, I haven't watched much of Italy recently at all) seems a different player from the poor imitation at OT.

I hope he comes good, but I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't settle in England. I think the flaw is in his mentality. By all accounts, he's a humble - shy guy. And this is evident when things get tough, instead of rising to the occasion, he seems to shrink/hide. Not the leadership mentality for a big club. 

He does well for his NT though. I suppose he could feel a bit more "at home" etc. Ones things for sure, he's not as bad as he's shown at OT.

3048~~~
Does that even mean much these days though?

When was the last time Italy produced a great defender?

3049~~~
I think he deserves another chance for the simple reason that he looked amazing at the start. If Mou thinks he can right his wrongs then you can't really argue with it.

3050~~~
He was better than what you are stating. And don't we have players that have survived a few seasons of the back of a 3/4 game run and yet an Italian international who has been doing very well for club and country prior to joining a United side under LVG, does not get a chance?

3051~~~
It matters in as much as you still don't make international teams and be utter shite, it's hyperoble. Darmian wasn't good last season no doubt, and I have no preference for him over Valencia, I just think Nobby has shown his hand one too many times with agenda posting.

3052~~~
In my book in terms of performances you are either awful, bad, decent, good or brilliant. In his first few performances he was good but not brilliant, so yes in my opinion he was good and nothing more. For anyone to say he was brilliant would be wild exaggeration for me. You are of course entitled to your opinion on how he played.

Also where did i say he shouldn't get a chance? I just said a few posts back on the last page that i think and hope he improves under Mourinho. We shouldn't bin any player after only one season, i've said the same about Depay and Schneiderlin.

3053~~~

I guess that makes sense based on how you categorise performances. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3054~~~
Fair enough mate, just over the last 6 months or so i keep seeing people make similar statements ''you don't play for Italy unless you are a good defender'' etc. as if playing for Italy is some sort of stamp of approval of defensive excellence.

That may have been true 10-20 years ago but the current standard of Italian defenders is at it's lowest that i can remember in my lifetime.

I don't think Darmian is a truly horrible player, he was awful for us last year yes. I hope he improves massively next season i think he's capable of it if he shows a bit more bravery in getting forward. But it's also possible he's not actually as good as he appeared to be in Italy.

3055~~~
Should be Valencia's spot at the start of the season. He's better at right back than Darmian, simple.

3056~~~
He defended quite well for 3 games but offered absolutely nothing going forward. Our 'best player' for a month <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

3057~~~
The 3 Juve folks are pretty good. Barzagli, Chiellini, Bonucci. But I agree with that it doesn't really mean much and Darmian has much to prove.

3058~~~
They are mate Chiellini especially has been very good over his career, but all 3 are 30 and over (i think) so Italy aren't exactly producing much these days.

And even though those 3 are good they are no where nears as good as Italy's best defenders of the past 15-25 years. Baresi, Maldini, Costacurta, Cannavaro, Nesta, Panucci, Zambrotta etc. I think some people remember how good Italy's defence used to be and assume even today anyone who is a regular for the Italian side must be a top defender.

3059~~~
Should be a first choice RB. THat is if he gets back into form which I'm sure he will.

3060~~~
Darmian at his best is better than Valencia but that is his very best, I really don't get how Valencia is so underrated on here, its criminal. He makes two or three mistakes a season and everyone decides he is rubbish. Valencia can get the ball forward very quickly even if his end product isn't great, although it was in the last month of the season. He also never gets taken on, he is faster and stronger than any winger he comes up against and his short passing is to a very good standard. With Valencia and Darmian I would argue it's the only position we have genuine competition if they are both on the top of their game.

3061~~~
Our right back, playing left wingback tonight. 

He's not doing too bad either. Not that he's had much to do so far.

3062~~~
It's amazing how bad some players can be under certain managers, times last season he couldn't string a pass together.

3063~~~
Don't think he's doing that well to be honest.

3064~~~
Impressive.

3065~~~
That's LVG for you. He'll be immense for us next season, calling it now.

3066~~~
He is a good defender. And he wasn't as bad for us either as made out by some.

3067~~~
Said and will say it again, he'll flourish under Mourinho.

3068~~~
Happy to hear he is playing well.

3069~~~
Absolutely, he'll be played to his strengths.

3070~~~
Yep pretty much this, the criticism went overboard.

3071~~~
Defensively he's really had nothing to do and up the pitch, I think he's been about as productive, as I'd expect a defensively minded right back to be.

3072~~~
Our Darmian is not as bad as people made out. Under a good manager, he does well.

3073~~~
Speaks volume about how fecking stupid LVG was.

3074~~~
He was as bad as made out but there was a reason for it: Louis Van Gaal. We actually have a really good squad, we have just had two confidence vampire coaches since Fergie.

3075~~~
He's clearly going to do a Bale and turn into one of the best left wingers in the world.

3076~~~
Where you been all season, Matteo? 

Had a really good half.

3077~~~
LvG had many faults but blaming him for Darmian's shit season is a bit silly.

3078~~~
Well attackingly he has been nonexistent although he is playing as a Wingback their Right wing back Crandela(Spelling) looks far better going forward, and defensively De Bruyne keeping getting inside or pass it backwards, he struggles against wingers who are pacy and go outside or take him on.

3079~~~
Sorry, LVG was like so totally amazing. He brought the best out of players. I wish he stayed! Where did I lay all the blame on LvG?

3080~~~
Valencia outperformed him and deservedly got the nod, but Darmian had some good games at left back and was then dropped for Rojo the next game. If i remember correctly he had a great game towards the end of the season when he scored that screamer and after that he didn't get to play again.

3081~~~
You lot jinxed him

3082~~~
He has done absolutely nothing this game apart from that bad pass that nearly made a Belgium goal.

3083~~~
One bad pass and now he's crap. The cafe never fails to amuse.

3084~~~
I said this in the first half:

He's done nothing. Conte clearly agrees with me.

3085~~~
Looks like his bad form can't be blamed solely on Van Gaal.

3086~~~
Looks a bit unfit, slow and laboured. Plays like a 35 year old, needs to do something about his fitness.

3087~~~
That's the cafe. Subed off now, but apart from that pass, he really didn't do anything wrong. More or less kept KdB completely quiet down the Italian left side.

3088~~~
he was solid. No way he was crap or he would be getting beat by De Bruyne every time. However, I really hope he gains back his form at the start of the season, he was unstoppable back them. He has it in him just needs to unlock it again, thankfully we have Mourinho to help.

3089~~~
"Under a good manager, he does well". Lets completely ignore the very good seasons from De Gea, Smalling, Martial, Rashford, Fosu Mensah, Shaw (up to injury) and decent showings from Fosu Mensah, Blind, Valencia... have you considered that Darmian might have played shit because he's shit?

3090~~~
If his confidence is damaged it's unlikely to be magically repaired just because he's playing for someone else now. It can take time.

3091~~~
And I repeat, I did not solely blame LvG for his season but he did not get the best put of the player. Darmian is not as bad as people are saying having watched a bit for 2 seasons at Torino and for Italy, prior to joining United. Conte is a better manager tactically and he somehow gets out good performances from Darmian.

3092~~~
Interesting how Belgium had a field day down the that side, once he went off. Not claiming it was the only reason, it is rather eye catching though.

3093~~~
looks like he's put some weight on & he's definitely lost some of his pace.
if he's staying he needs to put in a decent shift.

3094~~~
I agree with you there mate, I was just replying to the idea that he was complete shit. The jury is very much out on if he can make it at United and right now I think he'd be behind Valencia when the season kicks off unless he really impresses Jose in pre-season.

3095~~~
I thought he was pretty good tonight, and was definitely part of the reason why De Bruyne was so quiet. One misplaced pass aside, it was a promising performance.

3096~~~
Very good first half
One bad pass second which almost cost a goal and then got hooked
Suspect he'll start the next game though and rightfully so

3097~~~
Second only to his total unwillingness to contribute anything going forward most of the time, my biggest worry about Darmian is his fitness.

All last year his fitness was bad despite playing game after game in a row. So it wasn't a match fitness problem, he may just have really poor stamina that the slower Italian league masked.

Hopefully he can improve on it for next year.

3098~~~
Common theme of being Vangled. "Don't mess up or you are dropped.." You could deduce three or four players playing like this last season. Darmian especially being a fullback.

3099~~~
Well no, a multitude of bad passes over the season, countless poor positionings, numerous times outmuscled, various times out paced, frequently falling to attack with the ball and umpteen times lacking an intelligent supporting run is what has lead us to the opinion that he is shit.

3100~~~
Didn't catch the game but one question I think has been overlooked, and is probably the most important, is has he shaved that shite bit of fluff?

3101~~~
Sell him. United have 10 players on their books who play right full back for the first team or reserves (more if you include the other U-18s). Some of these are highly rated. I've heard good things about Reid, Olosunde, and Williams. Joe Riley had a game where he played flawlessly (even at LB). Some people rate Varela better than Darmian, and he certainly attacks more, and is to my eyes clearly more skillful. If we keep Darmian as second choice, these other players have their careers hindered. Surely one of these prospects will turn out better than Darmian?  Mourinho might not think like me but even he must know that he can't bring another player in while Darmian is paid £60k/week. 
---------------------------- D-o-B -------- Age ---- Pay
Antonio Valencia ------ 04-Aug-85 ----- 30 ----- £70k/week 
Matteo Darmian ------- 02-Dec-89 ----- 26 ----- £60k/week
Guillermo Varela ------ 24-Mar-93 ----- 23 ----- not that much
Sadiq El Fitouri -------- 10-Oct-94 ----- 21 ----- even less
Donald Love ----------- 02-Dec-94 ----- 21 ------ ..
Joe Riley --------------- 06-Dec-96 ----- 19
Charlie Scott ---------- 02-Sep-97 ----- 18
Tyler Reid ------------- 02-Sep-97 ----- 18
Matthew Olosunde ---- 07-Mar-98 ----- 18
Ro-Shaun Williams ---- 03-Sep-98 ----- 17

All this talk about £200m available in the transfer kitty, really means: Up to £100m plus another £100m from what can be raised from transfers out.

3102~~~
Was this guy actually good before joining us?

If yes- why give up on him so fast? He might have been Vangled.
If no- why was he so overrated?

3103~~~
Sadiq El Fitouri is the worst player I've ever seen represent Man Utd at any level. Darmian ruined England's left side and built up enough goodwill at Torino that most fans were happy for him. 

There's clearly a very, very good player in there and he might never adapt to the English game, but he's well worth another shot as there are no great rightbacks on the market and the ones we do have all have injury issues.

3104~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69130, @limerickcitykid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69130/">@limerickcitykid</a>

3105~~~
What do you mean by good? He never had outstanding attacking stats. He's a defender. Watching his clip at Torino, it looks like he was never an attacking full-back. He defends. When we're playing against a team who've parked the bus is it really useful to have 5 players who'll play no part in attack: RB, 2 × CB, LB, and DCM?  I don't hate Darmian. I just think the team needs more creative full-backs who can support their winger. Maybe not both at once, but one at a time on which ever wing the ball is. Is it really asking too much?

Before I agree he was "Vangled", tell us when was he so much better than he's now?
youtube <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/Mt5NEHV.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/Mt5NEHV.png"/>

3106~~~
He looked so good at the beginning of the season, was jealous of a mate who had snapped him up at Comunio. Won 'player of the month' against the likes of Shaw and Smalling, had the right mix of attacking and defending in him, no one could take him out. Don't know what  happened...

Mourinho always liked having around a strong physical presence at one of the two sides. I think Shaw has shown enough to be considered as a starter, but i really don't know what to make out of Darmian. I'm under the impression that you can't give away the ball the way Darmian did, that mistake could have been quite costly for Italy. But if he's happy with a backup role, why not?

3107~~~
I'm just glad Sadiq is finally getting some recognition.

3108~~~
Any idea he was playing as left winger? I think that he was playing more advanced than Giacherini, though I wasn't that concentrated on the match. Still weird to see him playing there, considering that attacking isn't his strongest ability.

3109~~~
Italy set up 5 3 2 when defending then went 3 3 4 when attacking.  he played as a wingback and was mostly used as an outlet to help bring the mids in play or someone for the strikers to knock down balls towards so that the rest of the team could transition into attack. Was actually well done from conte

3110~~~
Don't think the caf seems satisfied with that. From the posts about fullbacks on caf, I could deduce that many caftards will only appreciate a full back if he is bombarding the side regularly. It is as if defending is secondary. 
Some caftards even seem to be fine if the fullback's sudden burst forward creates a feckin hole in defense, as long as the player is running full speed into the attack.

3111~~~
I think Italy were playing 3-5-2

3112~~~
They were playing with wingbacks, yes.

3113~~~
Yep that is strange. I think Darmian is a good Defender. Wingback did not suit him that well but he was quite ok.

3114~~~
Nope many just realize that in the modern game, especially if you are a big club who will play against many teams that just sit back and defend deep you need your fullbacks to be able to attack as well as they defend. Teams parking the bus need to be stretched to create space, fullbacks play a part in this.

Also when we are the team under pressure the fullbacks need to be able to help the side attack on the break.

Go look at the recent Nani or Depay threads and see all the moaning about them being lazy and not tracking back to help their fullbacks defend. Well it's the same the other way around.

Theres no point having another very wide centre back who is good defensively but provides little of note going forward. Without a fullback making overlapping runs the wide player in front of them is constantly double teamed. 

This happened to Mata and Lingard last year with Darmian behind them, he rarely ventured over the half way line in many games. I do hope he improves next season, but he will have to put way more effort into getting forward and helping the side attack. If other top fullbacks can contribute in attack and defence, then so can Darmian.

3115~~~
Dropped against Sweden. Was useless against Belgium and Florenzi is a better player.

3116~~~
Italy were going to go more defensive against Belgium. I'm not surprised he'd go for a more attacking minded player against the Sweeds.

3117~~~
Or I don't know it's a tactical decision. Not every time a player gets dropped it's cause he's 'useless'.

3118~~~
Would suggest that, since he was also taken off against Belgium as their first sub.

3119~~~
Florenzi is the better player, should have started the first game anyways.

3120~~~
Hope our interest in Fabinho is 4realzies. Darmian is very underwhelming.

3121~~~
That sub was pre-planned, Conte said he would change a wingback on 60 minutes. Darmian wasn't that bad the other night.

3122~~~
To be fair to him, he is not a left winger. Florenzi is one of the most versatile players around, and while he started playing as a winger, he has played right/left back too.

3123~~~
Florenzi has been just as shite. Italy are dreadful, and Darmian wasn't even that bad against Belgium.

3124~~~
Didn't say he was bad, just said he was useless (did nothing of note for people to praise him).

Fair point

3125~~~
I thought that was Darmian's best game I've ever seen from him against Belgium...not enough cutting edge perhaps but he was full of energy and always providing a good option in both attack and defence.

3126~~~
Why all the hate for Darmian on this forum? Why do people want us to sell him? The fact that he's being linked to Barca, Juventus, etc should be a sign how well he is regarded.

It would be a stupid move to sell him after just one season where he showed flashes of good play and also was unfortunate to pick up injuries everytime he started to get a run of games in the team.

3127~~~
More about his agent knows that his position in this club is not that safe.

Everything can happen for him this season tbh.He might improve and do enough to convince Mourinho that he deserves to be first choice or he might even fall behind our younger options if he continues to disappoint.Let's just wait and see.

3128~~~
I agree, we should give him a second season atleast before deciding he's shit. Mourinho's known to bring the best out of his defensive players. 

Also, we shouldn't forget how underwhelming Shaw was in his 1st season at the club too, esp. with all the niggling injuries that kept him out at the wrong times

3129~~~
don't worry, if he has a good game in the euros we'll want to give him another season to prove himself, like halfway through page 77.

not disagreeing with any of it, we should at least give him another season to prove his worth.

3130~~~
It's a little harsh but I think 90% of us expected him to miss that penalty. Very weak mentally.

3131~~~
Needs a shave.

3132~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Edit - hope Mourinho can build him up after that

3133~~~
He looked to be absolutely shitting himself on the run up. Not exactly a surprise to see him miss.

3134~~~
Lets hope he recovers. Could have an effect on the guy, seems very sensitive and soft

3135~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> poor lad...

3136~~~
Extremely harsh. He is not a good pen taker and that is why he was 9th in line. Would you call Schweinsteiger mentally weak or Muller for that matter?

3137~~~
Apparently, Mkhitaryan is quite sensitive.

3138~~~
None of us know what his mentality is like. Are we engaging in armchair psychology again?

3139~~~
Just knew he'd miss.

Hopefully it doesn't affect him too much.

3140~~~
Feck sake, I'd sell him after that. Pathetic penalty, if your that nervous then just blast it down the middle

3141~~~
Yeah, it was poorly taken but it shouldn't have gotten to him.  Both teams were awful in that shootout.

3142~~~
Yup, as soon as he stepped up I laughed, because it was completely obvious he was going to miss. He's pure garbage, I don't even know why Italy took him to the tournament, but most importantly in a shootout he's extremely weak mentally. You could tell he was shitting it the moment the camera cut to him. Reminded me of Anelka in the '08 Champions League final. They'd missed the penalty before they even put the ball on the spot.

3143~~~
Missing a penalty is now a sign of weakness?

3144~~~
I've bottled a fair few penalties in my time, so I can't believe the pressure in a EURO QF. Really feel for him.

3145~~~
I'd call Muller mentally weak, yes. He's a great player 99% of the time, but he bottles it with alarming regularity with the going gets properly tough and the pressure is ramped up. He missed a penalty and an amazing chance against Atletico too that would have sent Bayern through.

3146~~~
Some couldnt wait for this so they can throw some more abuse at him.

3147~~~
Ronaldo misses quite a lot of penalties as well and so does Messi. It's not a sign of being mentally weak at all. 

It's a pretty daft criticism.

3148~~~
Very harsh to judge him after that. I look forward to see what he can do under Mou this coming season.

3149~~~
Yup, the guy who's scored 10 goals in 2 world cups, being the top scorer at one of them is mentally weak...

3150~~~
He is weak mentally. We saw that this season already. Him taking a penalty was always going to end in disaster because of that. He couldn't even lift his head.

3151~~~
Darmian definitely lacks composure.

3152~~~
We did?

3153~~~
Yeah but Mkhitaryan is in form. Darmian had a shit season and missed now a decisive penalty

3154~~~
Mental weakness yes...

3155~~~
We can be critical of him but he hit the target - which certain other lads failed to do. I think they made a point that Neuer was always diving the one side seemingly so he was out guessed. I'm sure he'll be alright and come back stronger. Zaza and Pelle on the other hand will probably get hit harder.

3156~~~
Him missing a pen was the most obvious thing. Thought de sciglio was him at first and told my dad he'll miss until i saw it wasnt. Then when it was him I said it again.... Doesn't have the mentality for something like that. Which is fine, but I don't think he has the mentality to succeed at a big club like United either with the expectations.

3157~~~
Predictable, run of the mill, kneejerkism around here. If they liked him before they will defend him, if they didn't they will question him even being here.

3158~~~
I knew he would miss. Simple as that. More, i belive he also knew he would miss.

3159~~~
Missing a pen is a mental weakness. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Hate for Darmian is strong here. So sad to see.

3160~~~
Not many mentally strong players playing football then

3161~~~
Harsh to scapegoat him. Zaza's and Pellè's penalties were worse IMO.

3162~~~
Messi and Ronaldo are mentally weak then.

3163~~~
I will translate your post: It's a completely moronic criticism.

3164~~~
Feel for him, and for us. He was already low on confidence you'd assume after his season with us, he won't be in a good place when he comes back now either.

3165~~~
C'mon... That's why he was 10th to take a penalty. It's obviously not his strength. Hopefully he forgets it quickly especially as he was not only one who missed...

3166~~~
I bet some on here would have pissed themselves if they had to take one

3167~~~
Indeed.

3168~~~
Daft criticisms. He's obviously not a pen taker, which is why he was last.

3169~~~
Is not about the penalty,  just can't warm up to him as a player. He doesn't inspire confidence at all .

3170~~~
What's he supposed to do?

3171~~~
Penalty taking requires strong mental strength. Darmain clearly buckled under the pressure. Messi and Ronaldo have scored endless crucial penalties.

3172~~~
Can you elaborate? Do you think certain players are less confident and lack composure? Do you think that has an impact on their ability to take a penalty?

The general consensus is yes. As a result, many people expected Darmian to miss the penalty. There's plenty of evidence of that.

3173~~~
Smoke a cuban

3174~~~
Not piss, but obviously shitting it. You arent as defensive to Schweini though. You always defend the weak/unpopular. I expected you to tear him apart here, like the German

3175~~~
shit penalty, sell him.

3176~~~
Good thing Ronaldo,  Messi and Muller don't miss penalties in crucial stages.

3177~~~
It depends on the frequency or context I guess but Gary Lineker always said it was 'the ultimate test of bottle'.

It depends on different factors but I would say it is harder for defensive players as they are not used to taking them and going into a high pressure situation to do something outside of their remit will be a factor.

You would probably have to look at a series of penalties to get a picture. C Ronaldo has missed in a CL final shootout but also scored in major tournament shootouts and scored the winner in this years CL final shootout.

As for Darmian, I would tend to say that he lacks confidence i.e. is mentally weak generally.

3178~~~
His penalty was like one of his crosses. Shit.

3179~~~
tbh I don't really give too much of a feck about how our players do for the NT. Tt's more the criticism of him him being mentally weak made by posters on the internet on the basis of him missing a pen that I'm defending. As  player I think Darmian was dogshite last season

3180~~~
I didn't see a mentally weak player. All I saw was one who was finding it difficult to adapt to a different league. Not the same as mental weakness.

3181~~~
Hitting the target where he did is as bad as missing it IMO. A weak shot to a position and height where the keeper saves if he guesses right is worse than blasting it over. At least when you blasting it over your are being overly positive rather than too timid.

3182~~~
Caf continues to amaze me. A defender who has shot no penalty in his professional career and who was shooting the ninth penalty, misses the pen and apparently is because he is mentality weak.

Guess what that makes Schweinsteiger and Muller. Or two strikers like Zaza and Pele. Or Bonucci who scored before.

3183~~~
A tit.

Too easy.

3184~~~
Missed pen or not he should be one of the first players out the door this summer if anyone wants him.

3185~~~
A hilarious tit though.

3186~~~
Score?
Already said is not about the penalty but more about what he has served up in the past season. He lacks composure for someone playing in a top club and watching Italy nothing has changed, hence the LVG criticism unfair. 
May be it had work.

3187~~~
Other mentality weak players:

Roberto Baggio
David Trezeguet
Cristiano Ronaldo
Lionel Messi
John Terry
Clarence Seedorf
Andrei Shevchenko

All have missed more important penalties than Darmian today.

3188~~~
Some of the posts on here are laughable. I am shocked no one has used the same logic to call Messi mentally weak as not only did he miss the penalty which cost his country a trophy,he retired immediately after that.

3189~~~
He barely played for Italy in this Euros....

3190~~~
You can hardly look at series of pens with Darmian to get a picture.
Ronaldo missed, Ronaldo scored.
I don't think Darmian will shoot a penalty in the near future.

It's funny how you and others now think he's mentally weak just cause he missed a penalty.

3191~~~
Because he had a bad season? Did you ever watch him before he came to the Premier League?

3192~~~
Hopefully the Italian speaking Zlatan will make a big impact on him and raise his confidence next season.

3193~~~
Christ, he's obviously not comfortable taking penalties and that's why he wasn't included in the first 5 takers. It's got nothing to do with being mentally weak or strong. Not everyone has to be able to take them like Messi, Ronaldo and Baggio and even those players were/are missing them in crucial situations. 

Neuer read him and saved it. At least he hit the target, unlike those arrogant clowns Zaza and Pelle, who were supposed to be good takers. 

No need to make a mountain out of a molehill.

3194~~~
Ronaldo scored a lot more than he missed to be fair.

But yes, you can't judge Darmian the penalty taker here with any great certainty but I though from quite shortly into his United career that he lacks confidence at the top level.

3195~~~
Redcafe <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3196~~~
Bet Mou wrote "Practice penalties" with a double line underneath on his notepad while watching Matteo and Bastian

3197~~~
Regardless of his pen.. just looks like a guy who lacks the mentality to play at the highest level.

3198~~~
Not much but I wasn't that impressed from what I did see.

3199~~~
Messi recently missed a far more crucial penalty which cost Argentina the Copa America. He then decided to retire from international football. What does that show about his mentality?

3200~~~
We had LVG. Most of the team was crap. He deserves at least one more chance. As others.

3201~~~
He was highly regarded in Italy. I am suspect of his offensive capabilities, but give him another season to impress you, all players deserve two seasons (except Bebe).

3202~~~
I wish he had scored it, just so we could witness Neuer and Buffon taking the next ones.

3203~~~
Neuer guesses the wrong way and the narrative will be how Darmian calmly dispatched his penalty.

It always is that way with penalties. Captain Hindsight runs the rule.

At least he hit the target which more qualified takers failed to do.

3204~~~
Yeah but he lacks the mentality and stuff..

3205~~~
Not an awful penalty, and not a dodgy run up, Neuer had him with the little feint. No blame at all can be attached to him, just isn't a good penalty taker.

3206~~~
Are we meant to be concerned that our right back isn't a confident penalty taker? It's almost certainly never going to affect us.

There's hardly a strong link between a right back not wanting to take a penalty and being mentally weak. I don't recall Gary Neville was ever stepping up during a shoot out and calmly slotting one home?

3207~~~
Referring also to his pre tournament performances for example qualifiers.The point is he isn't a good full back.

3208~~~
Imagine a keeper remaining upright when the penalty taker hits it the middle. That will be more humiliating. Would anyone here then say that the player lacked bottle?

3209~~~
You watched all of Italy's qualifiers?

Conte is mad then to have him called to Euros.

3210~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> logic

You're taking a pen and beforehand you're given only 2 options on how you take your pen. You either blast it over the bar or put a weak shot on target. And you choose to blast it over the bar. Nice one.

3211~~~
Really? He visibly went into his shell when things went badly. He was terrified to receive the ball.

I think it's funny that you're completely misunderstanding. People are not saying if you miss a penalty, you're mentally weak. They're saying if you're mentally weak, you'll very likely miss the penalty. Hence why people said he would miss a penalty <i>before</i> he took it, regardless of what people want to say about captain hindsight. I'd have taken off Darmian rather than Chiellini every day of the week.

3212~~~
You can't blame the loss on him.. Penalty misses happen.. Zaza and Pelle had far worse penalties than Darmian.. 

Hopefully he now gets a break and joins back for a full pre season..

3213~~~
It's not like that. It's exactly captain hindsight stuff. Some want get rid of him, think he lacks composure or whatever, he's mentally weak and this just made their point stronger in their heads.
You had posts like, penalty or not he's crap, he's garbage, sell him, whatnot.

3214~~~
Wow, you want a player sold because he missed a penalty for his national team?Wtf?
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I hate Müller with a passion but before this tournament he's been widely regarded as a big game player and now suddenly he's mentally weak?

Some on here love to get their knives out, I'd keep in mind that Darmian was actually on of the few United players to take part in those late stages of this tournament, most of the squad have already been send packing or weren't there.

3215~~~
Seems like a majority of the Caf are Psych majors.

3216~~~
It isn't hard to say that he was going to miss. A few minutes before I said that I hope he isn't taking one as he was holding his hands to his face and lost colour in his face due to nerves. Never in a million years was he going to score that peno

3217~~~
People going overboard on his penalty, yes it was weak but was absolutely nowhere near the worst out of all of them, pelle and BFS nevermind zaza Gabor were absolutely shocking pens, also he went the opposite side to where Neuer kept diving, it was just weak, but at least he kept it in the stadium!

3218~~~
Yup, as soon as I saw him stepping up, I felt it was inevitable that he was going to miss. He then went on to hit a very unconvincing peno.

3219~~~
Kind of a bad thing that we expected him to miss it. Just goes to show our expectation for him is to feck up things regularly.

3220~~~
Oh Pelle's penalty was probably the worst I've ever seen. Darmian far from the goat of the shootout.

3221~~~
You could see on his face, as it was getting closer to his turn, with the cameras panning to the Italy team, just how scared Darmian looked.
I also expected Schweinsteiger to miss, and he duly obliged.

3222~~~
Ronaldo who is a great goal scorer has missed some penalties. Against Barca, against Chelsea, against Bayern in the shoot out 2012, has already missed one in this Euros. Of course he has also scored a lot but he is expected to do so whereas Darmian really is not expected to take penalties.

3223~~~
Our potential new signing Mkhitaryan refused to take one a few years back. I can't believe the criticism he is getting. It is perfectly normal to be shitting it when you a fullback in those situations unless you Alves, Alaba or Roberto Carlos.

3224~~~
Spot on. Which is why criticizing penalties is always the worst kneejerking. It becomes doubly bad when some attempt to link a missed NT penalty with their regular season club form.

3225~~~
He needs to get rid of those sideburns, him thinking that it looks nice is far bigger concern about him than his penalty miss.

3226~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Penalties don't tell you shit about a player's mentality. It's a complete gamble the majority of the time. The most you can do is hit it on target and hope the keeper gets it wrong.

3227~~~
I couldn't disagree more. If you hit it hard enough and low/high into the corners, the keeper is never going to say it... it's very much a skill, not a gamble.

I agree it probably doesn't tell you as much about a players mentality as people would have you believe (and Darmian looks like he's going to shit himself every time he passes the half way line, so obviously he's going to look shit scared when faced with actually taking a penalty) but yeah... it's way more then just a gamble/hit and hope.

3228~~~
LOL good one.

Let's see if CAF is going to call him a spineless shit and what not.

Darmian was not supposed to take one normally.

3229~~~
Said to my mates this is over as soon as Darmian is up. Couldn't see him scoring it, in any case.

3230~~~
So are you agreeing with <a class="username" data-user="51833, @Bojan11" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51833/">@Bojan11</a> or not? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The "LOL good one" bit has thrown me a tad

3231~~~
No, I was being factious but feck me he was in bits before taking that so I like others worry about his temperment.

3232~~~
Expected to see people on here sympathize with Darmian but instead i see posts questioning his mentality. Give the guy a break.

Some of you talk like it's a walk in the park to take a deciding penalty in the QF's of the Euro's where you have to score against the best GK in the world. Especially after you've had to see Pelle's crappy excuse for a pen and Zaza's chicken dance! It's nerve-racking stuff and not everyone is capable of taking exceptional penalties. There is a reason he was so far down the pecking order for pen takers

3233~~~
Did you see Muller? I was certain he will miss. He looked like he had already shat his pants.

3234~~~
I felt he was struggling big time and it ultimately hit his confidence and whether we like it or not, confidence will always affect a player especially one who had just moved leagues to a new team and the whole team was massively underperforming. If the team was playing well then I feel it would have released some pressure off him.

If you see Valencia or Young, one who will rather jump off a cliff than use his left leg to pass and another is "Mr. Pass to his full back rather than take his man on", then the same allegations of being mentally weak can be levelled at them for these reasonsw. 

Some players are not very gifted with the ball at their feet but Darmian never shirked from his main duties as a defender and always looked confident (apart from that game against Sanchez) when he was defending. Just feel that his lack of skills as a rampaging full back is coloring a lot of opinions here who are taking it as a lack of bottle.

3235~~~
Bayern should sell him for being mentally weak like that...

3236~~~
Yeah, people need to realize that players are human and sometimes pressure gets to you. That does not mean you are generally mentally weak. Darmian is not a regular penalty taker and his team's destiny riding on his pen taking skills in sudden death was obviously going to have some effect. Not everyone can hide their emotions and act like a robot.

3237~~~
The thing is Darmian has been mentally feeble ever since he joined us.. bar the first few games he looks absolutely clueless. This just enhances that viewpoint. 

Muller is just having a shite tourney. Its a different kettle of fish.

3238~~~
Are there this much Italy fan on RedCafe? Or just losing better? Or just scapegoat hater?

It's a great game for neutral fans. It's not like United is losing...

3239~~~
Well I was agreeing with him in general. Since he is a new shiny toy which hasn't had a bad performance yet, so people would not judge his mentality and what not. Which is a good thing of course. It is just a bit over the top that our won fans going ridiculous on our own players in convincing that they are shit. 

I mean might as well read pool's forums instead for it.

3240~~~
Yeah, but that doesn't make him mentally weak. It just makes him a bad (unconfident) penalty shooter.

I knew that Trezeguet was going to lose it in 2006 the moment I saw him going to shoot. I was saying yesterday to my brother and his wife (Italian), 'don't worry, Schweinsteiger is going to lose it'. Does that make these two players mentally weak? Muller is one of the top big match players in recent history and he lost it yesterday as he did in UCL' semis. Pelle was so confident that he was saying to Neuer that I am going to do a panenka and then completely missed the target.

I think that people are over-analyzing this. Darmian isn't a good penalty taker and it seems he knows it too. There were other players yesterday (Germany's right back and Italy's left back) who looked as unconfident as Darmian in the run, and they scored the pens.

3241~~~
That's pretty much it. I have watched football for ages and hardly have seen a very very few penalty takers looked confident unless their teams were already comfortably winning.

It is pretty much hindsight shit. I thought pretty much all penalty takers last night on that shoot out seemed nervous as feck. Why wouldn't they?

3242~~~
It's small margins. Hector's pen was just as bad but Buffon fecked up the save and he's now the hero.

3243~~~
Agree. And Bastian had a shit penalty too! Imagine if Germany lost the penalty shoot out.

Bastian for all the talk of his mental strength had quite some notable penalty miss. A notable one is the penalty miss vs Chelsea in CL final.

3244~~~
Jeez, have any of you ever taken a penalty in a meaningful scenario? I have, and it's pretty scary, especially when you barely have the energy for the run up. Give the guy a break.

3245~~~
Blaming Darmian is caf at its finest. He missed a pen, big deal. He isn't a pen taker- thats why he was 10th in line. You can blame Zaza or Pelle as these are forwards and you expect them to finish from 12 yards out. But there is nothing shameful for a defender who is believed to be the worst outfield pen taker in his team to miss his penalty against the 2nd best GK in the world

3246~~~
He's awful.

3247~~~
Its normal business around here. Being negative is a great way to get noticed.

3248~~~
Hopefully he'll be so hideously embarrassed by that pen that he'll immediately retire from international duty !

3249~~~
Ffs, Darmian is nowhere near similar to Denis Irwin.<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

3250~~~
so you base you assessment of a persons mentality on his how he looks on your tv during a football game?

3251~~~
It was a normal safe bet pen which went wrong because goalkeeper jumped in the right direction. You often see that kind of pens when goalkeeper go in the wrong direction and a sure goal because it is not right in the corner so you can't miss a target.
And as someone else said, Hector penalty was the same with only difference that Buffon didn't save it.

3252~~~
He's been in and out of the side throughout the season and at times when he started looking settled he got injured.

IMO defensively he is solid, but at the moment he seems short on confidence and lacks any sort of aggression when defending. Hopefully Mourinho can help him with that.

 (A defender is not judged by his penalty taking abilities, especially if it's one pen in a one off game. Don't understand why it's even a topic for a discussion)

3253~~~
Absolutely this. Hate it.

3254~~~
Looks? based on how he plays obviously. He has never filled me with confidence apart from the first few games he played for us. A guy like Mourinho doesn't like putting much effort in to change weak players mentalities. He won't last the season. He just got called Denis Irwin FFS on the basis of what.. what has he shown in his career to date to be called Irwin?

3255~~~
Hummels's pen was pretty much the same, even he couldn't believe that it went in.

3256~~~
Sorry you don't agree but I think he could turn out to be a Denis Irwin type fullback in time. FFS

3257~~~
I'm going to agree with LazyBones here. I don't see a single similarity between them.

3258~~~
Last I knew Denis Irwin wasn't a complete non-entity going forward and wasn't average defensively either.

3259~~~
Could score penalties too...

3260~~~
Dennis Irwin is seriously being compared to this bang average lad? Christ. One of the finest fullbacks of the PL era compared to a player that had a pretty poor first season for us. Wow.

3261~~~
No he isn't mate seriously.

Irwin was great defensively and very good going forward. He rarely ever had a bad game, Darmian rarely had a good one for us least year.

Darmian might get better defensively next year but he'll never pull his weight attacking wise in my opinion.

3262~~~
When Alex Ferguson was asked to name his best team from his 26 years in charge he said Denis Irwin would be the first name on his team every time. After that he couldn't say who else would make the team. Think about that for a second. And you compare a player who had a below average season to Denis Irwin?? Please Stop.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://m.independent.ie/sport/soccer/denis-irwin-the-first-name-on-my-list-of-greatest-team-ever-says-alex-ferguson-29711450.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://m.independent.ie/sport/socce...st-team-ever-says-alex-ferguson-29711450.html</a>

3263~~~
Worth keeping him around as he covers a few options but I would prefer Valencia and TFM ahead of him at RB and Shaw/CBJ ahead of him at LB. He's just nowhere near good enough on the ball

3264~~~
If we sold every player that came from a foreign league after one poor season,  we wouldn't have had the best CB,  LB and GK in the league in the last 10 years.

3265~~~
People have such short memories. Last year in pre-season he looked like an absolute steal for the money we paid.
A no nonsense defender that was impossible to get past.

Slowly and steadily his form declined as LvG stifled him (and many others).

He will no doubt shine again, given the chance. I have full confidence in Mourinho when it comes to bringing the best out of him.

3266~~~
Very good point. He's far better than he gets credit for on here. I'm sure he will be much better under Mourinho next year.

3267~~~
Agree.

3268~~~
Just look at the club's linked with him. Juve, Barca and Chelsea. Would be ridiculous to bin him.

3269~~~
He definitely deserves another season. He started out well and was obviously very highly rated in Italy before this season as well. If we got rid of every player that played poorly last season we'd basically just have DDG and Martial.

3270~~~
Selling him would be silly alright. However, he really needs to step it up big time next season. He started off well and then his form drastically dropped off.

3271~~~
i think Rashford deserves a 2nd season perhaps <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3272~~~
In his early games, he was really very good. Then he declined, just like 80% of the team. Same reason why Di Maria looked so freaking good for us early on then became dog shit - LVG's man management.

3273~~~
Assuming the fourth signing is Pogba, I guess we'll be starting a bit like this:

De Gea
Darmian, Smalling, Bailly, Shaw
Pogba, Schneiderlin
Mkhitariyan, Rooney, Martial
Zlatan

If we think our new signings won't do an Evra and take a season to adjust and that the likes of Darmian/Schneiderlin did do an Evra and will improve this season, then that isn't too shabby.

3274~~~
Why is Darmian rated so highly on here?

He was absolutely appalling last season and got progressively worse as the season progressed.

He is poor offensively and defensively. 

He has no pace, strength or heading ability, he is a poor passer and crosser of the ball.

He has little composure and seems to wilt on the big stage.

His performance against Spurs sums him up, he replaced a young kid in TFM who was playing out of position and within 10 minutes we had conceded three goals.

Valencia has his weaknesses but is vastly better at RB than Darmian.

Varela and TFM are both better at RB as well and have a large scope for improvement in the future.

We should sell now before his value plummets even further.

3275~~~
Don't hold back, say what you really feel..
But no, there's a lot of us who have mostly similar thoughts but we're willing to give Darmian another season given it's his firist year in a new country/league and let's be honest, many players underperformed under LvG and we hold hope the new manager can get more from a bunch of them this season.

3276~~~
You must have posted on the wrong forum then.

3277~~~
He has none of the attributes to be a top right back.

Physically, technically and mentally he is poor, Jose is not a magician.

Varela and especially TFM have massive potential and are currently better than Darmian.

Keeping him is harmful to their development. If an experienced option is needed at RB Valencia is the vastly superior choice.

3278~~~
I don't blame him for anything but when I saw he stepped up for that penalty, I said to my dad, I just know he is going to miss, I'am 100% certain and he did.

The guy oozes doubt, fear, doesn't look confident at all. Been very poor this season for us and never shined through except maybay in his first games.

If Jose can fix him, he is welcome to stay but if not then we simply have to sell. He looks one of the poorest players I have seen in a united shirt for a very long time.

People on here like to bash Rooney and Fellaini and I don't like the way they are playing either but imo performances of Darmian and Depay have been ones that are truely unacceptable at this level. They will have to step up massively under Jose, starting first game in pre-season, if they don't they will go out very soon.

3279~~~
I also much prefer Valencia at RB, despite how many people on here seem to have an irrational dislike for the guy, but Darmian has shown previously for Italy and Torino he has <i>some</i> talent about him. In preseason he looked very good, and the first few games he also put in some solid performances before he lost all confidence the longer the season went on.
He didn't cost a bomb and we wouldn't get a massive amount from him anyway you'd feel... so I don't see the harm in keeping him around another year to see if he can progress. Thats just my take on the situation anyway.

3280~~~
I did exactly the same thing. I just knew after this season he had, he would be the 1 to blow it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3281~~~
He started off well, then regressed alarmingly, but how many United players DID have a good season last year ? I think he COULD be a steady and consistent performer in years to come, but  then again he might not. He deserves a chance same as everyone else. Jose likes steady and reliable fullbacks like Ferreira and Azpilicueta. Their are plenty of options at right back currently. Hopefully the majority of the squad will start playing under again Jose.
This is a forum where people give their opinions and discuss things, if you totally disagree with something I say, that's fine, no worries, but don't tell me or anyone else to stop expressing their opinions. Ever.

3282~~~
doesnt really matter how well he started, I said it right away he's not good enough for Manchester United and hardly has a potential to get to the needed level. No pace, zero skills, horrible dribbling, atrocious first touch and very dodgy at defending. The missed penalty is sign of no confidence as well which is a must when you play on a big stage. Must be one of the worst transfers we made for a while, at least Bebe had somehow potential to get better. We will be in for a right back in January. Think Jose will only go for Pogba or a midfielder in the summer thinking some of the three Varela, Valencia, Darmian will do the job. I think he will be disappointed with the options. Valencia could be his no1 RB and he's very average and former winger. Varela is very raw, so I'm not sure how many chances he gets and you have this fella who can't do basically anything, neither defending nor attacking.

I want Cancelo from Valencia he won't cost much and has a great potential. Agent Nani can have a word with him...

3283~~~
That is all fair enough and I agree we have to give the lad a chance, but comparing him to Irwin at this stage of his career is ridiculous.

3284~~~
What specific qualities do you think Darmian has that could make him this in years to come?

3285~~~
Jose said he likes specialists so that might give Darmian a shot ashed of Valencia at the start of the season.

3286~~~
Valencia is a far better RB than people realise. He dominates the right flank with his stamina, speed and strength and is always available for his right winger as an option. 

Mata despite his limitations was always much better with Valencia behind him as he allowed Mata drift inside. I could see the same happening with Mkhi who likes to drift inside in a similiar fashion.

Valencia also has an excellent first touch which is often overlooked. His defensive positional sense is poor for a RB but his overall contribution to the team is undervalued. I could see him being a mainstay of Jose's team next season unless TFM or Varela show rapid progress.

3287~~~
By Summer 2017, neither Darmian or Valencia will be playing for this club.

3288~~~
He's a good defender and no, neither TFM nor Varela are at the moment better than him.

3289~~~
How is he a good defender?

What attributes does he possess that make him this?

He is literally good at no aspect of being a RB. I would even prefer Riley or Young there even though they are relatively poor in this position as they have some qualities. 

Darmian has none.

3290~~~
Mother of god you should be disgusted with yourself back your teams players you bloody disgrace.

3291~~~
Swap for Azpilicueta? Conte likes Darmian. Mourinho loves Azpilicueta. Azpilicueta wouldn't do great as a wing-back in a 3-5-2 anyway which Conte will likely utilize.

But player swaps, very unilkely

3292~~~
Darmian an schneiderlin are two players who will thrive under mourinho both destroyed by van gaal.Darmian was great at the start of the season one bad game and a injury and van gaal didn't play him again destroyed his confidence going to be interested to see Memphis as well van gaal was an expert at demoralising players.

3293~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What is the point backing a player who is not good enough on an internet forum?

I back Valencia, TFM and Varela who all better than Darmian.

3294~~~
One bad game<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Try 20.

3295~~~
I'm sure you're an avid watcher of our U21, U18 games and so on but other than just athletic characteristics defenders need to possess skills such as decent tackling and more importantly good positioning and anticipation. The latter often comes with game time and experience, the younglings have none of.

Hype surrounding TFM is really baffling at times.

3296~~~
I watch a lot of U21 matches and TFM has the potential to be world class. He does lack some of the mental attributes you mention I agree.

These will improve as he gets older and more experienced with game time.

If Darmian was a good tackler and had good positioning and anticipating I would agree he should stay, however he does not have these qualities imo certainly not enough to make up for his appalling lack of physical attributes and technical abilities.

He is also weak willed as is shown by the amount of times he had to come off with a minor injury last season. 

Valencia played half the derby against City with a badly injured foot such was his desire to win. I would rather players like him than players like Darmian.

3297~~~
Varela better defensively than Darmian? He's not strong in the tackle, poor aerially, easily dribbled past. All he has is recovery pace which can only go so far in compensating for the rest of his weaknesses. He has more potential in an attacking sense than Darmian, I'll give you that.

3298~~~
I didn't actually mean he is as good as Irwin was in his prime just now, that is a stretch, no doubt, I  just think he could go on to become a very solid performer in both fullback positions, and I don't think he is the only player at OT who might well look like a much better player once Jose gets his feet under the table in the coming months.

3299~~~
tbh I am actually not satisfied with his attacking side of play, maybe it's because I expect more from him as a former winger.. 

what I don't like about Valencia:
his crossing to players' shins
his lack of vision 
he plays it too safe, a lot of backward passes, he can't play a through ball to the middle even if it's super close. He's too scared to feck up a pass
he's too monotonic and one dimensional 
he's a robot
he's no Rafael

what I like about Valencia:
working hard
strong, never pushed off ball
playing for the bedge
always available for a pass to a winger, likes to overlap
amazing stamina and great pace

It's not like that I don't like him he's a good option and perfect squad player, won't bitch out about his playing time and always gives his everything but he has too many average games when he does absolutely nothing, not wanting to feck up. I am not worried that much about his defensive contribution, marking and positioning is horrible at times but we've seen it with other defenders in the league whose primary position is actually fullback.

I hope Mourinho will pump him up and push him to attack more and we will see vintage Valencia, otherwise it will be disappointing at the position, in contrast to the left side where brilliant Shaw plays, Varela is quite unlikely to get many chances as he's still learning, opposite the player what Jose likes, short as well.. Darmian is just fail, surely he will get his chances and will be off in January after Mou finds out that he's not good at anything. Maybe our Alaba gets the chance to play there too even though he'd be better off as midfielder (TFM) Well Micky T will make a difference I guess, running all day helping out in defending too

3300~~~
I agree with most of this, Valencia is not perfect at RB.

However the criticism he receives on this forum is unjust and unfair particularly for a player who has always given everything for United.

LVG selling Rafael was a heinous act. He would die for the shirt.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Bring him home. We sold him for 2 million<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3301~~~
People should realise that the last 3 seasons have been the worst United history, all things considered.

Next season should be a clean slate for most underperforming players. Let's not be quick to criticize based on 1 season when everyone bar DdG, Martial and Rashford have been average

3302~~~
And there were quite a few games when Martial and Rashford also looked fairly average....Huge talents, and huge potential, but still not at a level where they can be trusted to be better than the others every game....

3303~~~
Conte chose Florenzi at RWB over Darmian all tournament, so I'm not sure he likes Darmian all that much anymore.

3304~~~
Last season, Martial has played better than expected and then some. Next season, the older players should wise up and take responsibility

3305~~~
Darmian started the first match, so he was obviously out of the team due to poor form and not because the coach didn't rate him.

3306~~~
I just meant that clearly Conte doesn't love him so much that we should assume he'll look to bring him to Chelsea. A lot of decent RBs and ones even better suited for switching between 5 at the back or 4 at the back by virtue of being better attackers than Darmian. Guys like Mario Gaspar, Fabian Johnson and Seamus Coleman are all at selling clubs, for instance.

3307~~~
To me Darmian's performance isn't good enough last season. He's too awful. Valencia is still a better right back, and if people still think he's worse than Darmian as a right back then Im starting to question these people if they even watch Valencia 2014/2015 and Valencia 2015/2016 (towards at the end of season matches after he removed the steel from his feet). 

Although Darmian is a specialist right back and Valencia isn't, it shows how awful Darmian was last season when a non specialist right back performs better than him. I will still give him another chance but as a backup player and if somehow he can force himself as a starter I will congrats him. But at the moment I'm more fancy toward Mensah or Valencia since they are better.

3308~~~
I have no problem giving Darmian another season. But people thinking he should start over Valencia in the first match of the season are just mistaken. If he gains his place back then well done to him, but Valencia showed in the last 2 seasons that he is a capable right back, much better than Darmian. Also, Valencia is a Mourinho type of player (strong and fast) and he has also developed into one of the best full backs in the premier league when dealing with 1v1s.

People seem to always say that he's out of position and say that only his pace gets him out of trouble, but he has pace and he is going to use it. You can't just ignore a big part of his game and big part in why he is a good right back. Also, the people who say he's out of position and he only relies on his pace where the same people who were praising TFM for those last ditch tackles when he put himself in those positions because of his naive positioning.
