Best to start one of these for Mata as pre-season is here and it will be very interesting to see where he plays in our 4-3-3 system.

I hope that he can get around 7 goals and get at least 10 assists.

2~~~
For us, he's more likely to get 12 goals and 5 assists..

3~~~
Not sure if he'll be a starter, but if he is and if he plays as a 10, there's no more excuses for him and he should come close to his Chelsea heights imo. Where he managed to be directly involved in 50 goals a season.

4~~~
No pressure then....

Think he'll get something like 15 goals and 10 assists (maybe more) if he plays consistently as the right winger like I think he will. Think it's unlikely that we will have 1 player with far more goals and assists then everyone else, because Van Gaal's style is always about the collective rather then making someone the main man.

5~~~
Have to say I don't think he's ideal in that right wing/inside right position 

An outstanding display at Anfield and a few other good games aside I just feel he lacks the pace to stretch defences.... this lack of pace from a few of our attacking players contributed to the slow predictability of our attack on a number of occasions 

I can see him battling with a quicker Herrera to be part of a midfield 3

6~~~
Think he'll start the season in the first team. Whether he stays there or not is down to how he performs.

He'll certainly get plenty of game time though.

I can't help but have high hopes for this guy. Of all our big name players (Rooney, Di Maria, Schweinsteiger, etc.) he's the one with the greatest capacity to step up to a level we haven't seen from him yet. At his age and with his talent he should be a key player for us....

7~~~
I really hope he has a great season. He's a fantastic player when on form, and one of the most humble footballers out there.

Considering the heaps of talent he has, and the solid midfield we can play him in front of, he should be one of our star players this year.

8~~~
We will play a lot more matches next season so the productivity of players will inflate though. Mata has proven in recent years that his biggest threat is his productivity, he scores quite a lot of goals and used to assist many too. Maybe 50 is over the top, but 30-40 could really be expected of a supposed world class player playing as a no 10 in his favourite position. De bruyne for example had 46 goals + assists last season, Ozil 51 in his best season at Real. With the new additions to the squad, we should improve as a team massively, and that should give room for individual players to improve too. But that's if he plays as a no 10 with close to no defensive duties.

Reus had 40+ goals and assists in the 2 seasons before last one, James had 44 last season, Muller has had in the 40's for 3 seasons in a row. Attacking midfielders with a free role at world class level mostly are prolific bar the likes of Iniesta, Hazard, Silva. It's something we should have too I think, it lifts off weight of our striker.

9~~~
I think he's the best finisher at the club. I'd expect 10-15 goals this year, he got 10 last year with no Europe and little involvement in the cup.

He's my favourite Utd player by miles though so maybe I'm biased. I hope he plays a big part this season.

10~~~
Between him and Memphis, we must have the right and left foot free kick takers covered. I hope Van Gaal keeps him in that right sided position, his off the ball runs were magical last season.

11~~~
He did well last season particularly in the second half, and while he's always technically so sound and reliable in possession, I still want to see his Chelsea form in a United shirt. He was just a much more impactful player with them. With us he seems like a less confident, less adventurous, more safe version of that player.

12~~~
I think 30 would be a great season, but it's unrealistic to expect more I'd say. We'll have Depay, Di Maria, Herrera all providing a decent amount of goals and assists without looking at Rooney. De Bruyne had that many and people saw him as the best performing attacking midfielder in the world last season because of that. I'd be delighted of course, but to get that many goals and assists out of Mata, the team needs to be built for everything to go through him as it was at Chelsea that one season, and that won't happen under Van Gaal. Unlikely he'll play as a #10 as well but we'll see.

13~~~
It's fair enough, although in the situation I think he should be getting high numbers, Herrera wouldnt be a starter. And I dont think we can expect too much of Depay that season. Above I placed some other examples of players who are getting very high numbers, and some of those players play alongside others players too who produce some numbers. James plays alongside Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema. Muller alongside Ribery, Gotze, Robben, Lewa. Reus played alongside Gotze and Lewa at that time. But Mata himself played alongside Hazard and Oscar at that time, he was the star but Oscar and Hazard managed to get almost 70 goals and assists between them in all competitions (included national tho, which contains about 10 goals + assists combined). So I dont think it's impossible for him, although 30 would be a nice aim for him.

14~~~
I will be camped in here throughout the season. Hugs.

15~~~
If we do move to a 433 with the point facing forward as LvG says, I hope we use him as a #10 more often next year.

16~~~
I imagine he'll be thought of as, above anything else, Herrera's main competition in that position. I don't expect he'll see much game time on the 'wing' unless someone like Di Maria is badly underperforming there again. That said, as things stand I'd say he's fairly firmly second choice behind Herrera. As good as Mata was later in the season, Herrera was absolutely integral.

17~~~
Think Mata will still stay on the wing primarily. He firmly established himself as first choice right winger last season, because even when he doesn't score or assist, he still has a huge impact on us dictating the play. Don't think Di Maria will be here at the start of the season anyway so it'll be Memphis, Herrera, Mata as the more advanced midfielders/wingers behind Rooney I'd say.

18~~~
He'll stay on the wing, but will be given freedom to roam especially if we sell di Maria. He'll work triangles with Herrera and Darmian on their side. Guessing Shaw, Memphis and Schweini on the other side.

19~~~
Even if he's used as a Right forward, he will get a lot more freedom to cut inside with Darmian backing him up.

20~~~
I doubt it. LVG kept him there at the end of last season because it was working at a time when we just needed to win games. But fast wingers are something he's used throughout his career, and I highly doubt it fits his long term vision to be playing a slowish #10 out wide. Judging by Van Gaal's comments, I expect us to keep hold of Di Maria, and with Depay adding to our list of actual wingers the slot for ADM is very obviously now on the right. Mata might get the odd game there, or might be called back there if Di Maria's form doesn't materialise, but I'd be incredibly surprised if Van Gaal is planning to start him there.

21~~~
It doesn't Mata where we play him, if he gets chance, he will bury it.

22~~~
Yes, he's an absolutely clinical finisher. But, he's not as creative as one would expect. I think he's better as the inside right forward with Herrera through the centre.

23~~~
It'll be interesting to see where he plays this season, and where he fits in. A lot of us expected him not to be here at certain points last season, but he really improved, managed to make himself fit into our system, and showed his class. He could potentially be key for us, although where he'll be being key from is another matter. I could see him in a fairly advanced role if we don't add too many more players up front.

24~~~
He has done well enough for me on the right to justify keeping his place there.

25~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

26~~~
He will always get game time because he is great in possession and a very good finisher.

27~~~
Right in front of van Gaal, well in Juan. Hugs.

28~~~
"They told me 'you are very important, you are one of the first'," Mata said.

"I knew the club was going to have these kind of signings," 

"It's not just about bringing good players in. It's about playing well and winning trophies."

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33584202" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33584202</a>

29~~~
When you say a player is creative or not creative what do you mean?

30~~~
His ability to play through passes, directly play in the forwards for goalscoring opportunities - if I had to brand it with a stat to compare; it'd be more 'chances created' than tally of assists. I just feel that Mata normally lacks that aspect of the game when we're crying out for something to be made out of nothing, he normally prefers to pass the ball around and keep retention rather passively.

31~~~
I see this too, however I didn't get that from him before, I'm not sure if its him or its LVGs influence...

32~~~
That's what I thought. Watching the game from a tv screen you have a clear picture of where most of the players are during the attacking phase. Most of the time I look at our midfielders, not just Mata and think that there's no real options ahead of them and they pass the ball side ways. Creativity isn't something accomplished by 1 player, the other players have to make the right movement and create space in which to pass the ball for creativity to exist.


At Chelsea he created the end highest number of chances from open play after David Silva. If Mata had Ronaldo and van Nistelrooy ahead of him, he would create chances for fun. Our movement in the final third is sometimes too static and that is what's hindering our creativity as a team not just individually.

33~~~
I think he will be great this season, I also think we will start with Young and him and slowly rotate them with Januzaj/The Pie and Di María

34~~~
I agree - for me Mata should be our equivalent to Silva or Hazard, the primary playmaker who can change games on a regular basis.

35~~~
But that's the thing, his play at Chelsea was over two years ago. We of all people should know how much can change in two years with RvP. I'm not saying Mata is finished or anything, but the butchering done by Mourinho and Moyes have really taken their toll. He's definitely had some decline as a player. Like <a class="username" data-user="38175, @Walrus" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38175/">@Walrus</a> said; he should be, and once was, an elite, top-tier player, but at the moment he isn't showing that. 

Hopefully he turns that around, but at the minute he is just a very clincial player with deft movement and an excellent first touch.

36~~~
I really really hope he is moved into a #10 more often this year. Absolutely majestic in that role.

37~~~
Problem is a 2 of Rooney and Mata is pretty slow and unagile. Will allow us to be pressed high which isn't good.

38~~~
I'd far rather Mata in a side than Rooney but that's a conversation for a different topic.

39~~~
I get that too but players in his position normally find it difficult to shine in a dysfunctional setting like we've had over the past couple of years. I, for one, would be interested in seeing what he can do when flanked by the pace that Memphis and Di Maria bring to the side and being propped by a Schweinsteiger/Carrick - Schneiderlin midfield axis. If Memphis and Di Maria cause grief on the wings I can see Mata thriving in the middle because teams will have much more to worry about on the flanks and so will be less inclined to double up on him.

Mata is great in that he is a very good finisher and thus can provide us with a significant number of goals - enough to match most support strikers around. He has regained his confidence after the Mourinho and Moyes episodes, we now have a balanced squad, the onus is upon him to take the chance and reclaim his place amongst the elite playmakers in the game.

40~~~
Mata was passive when used in cm last season too, but I think its mainly the role he plays on the right where he doesnt feel he has freedom like he used to in the hole where he would consistantly create for Chelsea.

In the end it doesnt feel like he gives much from the right hand side, other than when he pops up and scores a goal like he did in several important matches last season. Overall the performances are underwhelming

41~~~
The #10 fantasy is all well and good but there's no way I'd be happy with Ander being dropped out like that.

42~~~
His best performances for us have come playing on the right in a 4-3-3 and that's where he should remain in my opinion.

43~~~
I think he's more of a natural #10 than Ander, and he would play well there with a stable, solid pairing behind him,which we can now offer. 

Ander has earned play time though and it looks like he will be battling for the #10 role as well. 

Either way Mata will get plenty of games this season so hopefully we can see his 'real' top level again.

44~~~
Hoping to see improvement from Mata this season. He's shown glimpses, but hasn't exactly reached his Chelsea heights on a consistent, regular basis. I don't believe that player is dead and buried, but perhaps to recapture that vein of form he needs to play as the #10 and he isn't a player we should build the team around.

45~~~
He's fine on the right as long as there's a physically dominant right back behind him. Mata's obviously not a winger in the traditional sense, so if you judge him by those standards he'll fall short. If anything, he's playing more of a Zidane role - a #10 in all but starting position. I think he'll be an important player for us this season from that part of the pitch.

Picked up a lot of good positions in and around the box against San Jose. We'll need more of that from him this season.

46~~~
I would like him to shoot more from outside the box. Scored a couple of screamers for Chelsea.

47~~~
Think he's been quite good in these 2 games, a lot of our play going through him and he's been amongst the goals and assists as always. We'll see if we sign Pedro what happens, but think he'll be a key player for us this season, either on the right or as the #10.

48~~~
I think Mata's got the right wing spot nailed down. He gives us something unique that not many players in world football can match (creativity + goals + 90% passing). It's Young on the left who's most like to be replaced by a new signing. There are loads of players who are capable of doing what he's doing and more.

49~~~
Agreed... Though if we bring in Pedro, then I can see Memphis going to the left, Mata in the middle and Pedro out wide. Could work brilliantly, having those 2 running in behind from out wide while Mata provides.

50~~~
That's what I think too. Pacey options for him to thread the ball too out wide, and Mata can get forward and score himself too.

4231 suits our squad better than 433 imo.

51~~~
Yep. Will definitely help his creativity as well. The past year and a half here he hasn't looked that creative, but we had incredibly slow players up front and nobody at all running in behind. If you add in Memphis and Pedro, then that should stretch teams a lot more and we'd see a similar Mata to the one that was at Chelsea.

52~~~
Herrera has never really played the number 10 role for us, though (certainly not regularly). The fact is that we could have any combination of: Carrick/Schneiderlin/Schweinsteiger + Schweinsteiger/Herrera + Herrera/Mata. If we were at home against a mid-low table team I think Schweinsteiger-Herrera-Mata would be fantastic. Against a more difficult team though I'd have Schneiderlin (or Carrick)-Schweinsteiger-Herrera, with Mata on the right hand side.

The fact that Mata & Herrera can all play 2 positions to a very high level is a big positive. I do think that we need to keep the chemistry between the two of them at all costs though; De Gea-Smalling-Herrera-Mata-Rooney should be permanent fixtures in the team almost regardless.

53~~~
I have to disagree with Mata being more natural as a number 10. I think Herrera's better suited. Holds the ball better, turns better, rides challenges better, injects pace into the attack better, and I think he's  better at threading the ball through a defence (whereas Mata has better delivery when it's not through the lines - ie. a cross or cut back)

I don't mid Mata at right wing. In fact, I think he's better there than at number 10. And, personally, I'd be annoyed if Mata played as the 10 in place of Herrera. 
Ideally, for me, we buy a better right winger and use Mata's versatility. And then he can still play lots of games in various positions (both wings, number 10, and even striker) without dropping the quality much from whoever he replaces.

54~~~
I don't think Mata's physical enough to be #10 under LvG (or Mourinho, for that matter). Coming off the right wing and away from his opposing fullback gives him more space and more options. But it does put a huge burden on our rightback. Valencia is quick and strong enough to match up to it, but I don't think Darmian is yet.

55~~~
I have no zero problems with Mata playing as a right winger all the time. I mean, our best indivudal outfield performance of the season came from Mata, on the right wing! 

I doubt Mata minds much either, the bloke just seems to love playing football.

56~~~
Bold is key, for me. He'll never get the space he requires, if he plays number 10. Herrera is much better suited to playing in that tight, physical area. His ability to ride a challenge, shield the ball, and turn his man trumps Mata.

Right wing allows Mata to isolate and/or avoid his man, so there's more logic to him playing there.

57~~~

58~~~
Mata is a conundrum, I think he's always going to struggle centrally but when he plays wide his lack of pace is an issue and the way he is drawn to the center like a magnet means we lose shape a lot. Ideally your two wide forwards are making darting runs in behind for midfielders to find, Mata doesn't do that much.

59~~~
Don't think he's going to give us what we need. We need to hit the market and get us a wide play maker that's going to give us more drive getting forward. He's going to need the team to play really well to get the best out of him and he's just not enough of a contributor to our transition play. Against the likes of Barca and Bayern I don't expect us to have the majority of the ball and our attacking trio will have to have the ability to hit spaces quickly and make things happen, he's to slow to get there. I just prefer virtuoso's as no10's as opposed to these types of link up players. In essence I'd rather have a dinho/baggio type player than a Platini/Zico.

60~~~
Looked good in pre-season so far.

With most sane managers we'd start the season with Pedro on the right, Mata in the centre and Depay on the left. As is it looks like Mata has at least nailed down the RW spot for the start of the season.

61~~~
Not really impressed today, he's tidy and smart but too slow for that position, easy to get the ball from and today a bit slow in the final third.

62~~~
I'd say anyone leaving Young out is pretty insane. Been excellent in 2015.

63~~~
He has but even still, if we're thinking long term then you'd have to say all of Depay, Mata and (if we signed him) Pedro have more of an upside.

I'd start off playing Young given his form but I'd certainly hope the other three can step up to the point where he gets displaced on merit.

64~~~
Thought he was class today. Helps so much against Barca having players as good technically as Mata is. Some great passes like the one out to Young especially. He has played pretty well all pre season, so hopefully he has a big season.

65~~~
some good moments, some real frustrating ones

66~~~
He does tend to slow things down when it matters most which is frustrating. He needs to shoot/find a pass more often.

67~~~
Did good today, that pass to Young was great, looked like it was floating.

68~~~
He had some good moment and his technique was silky as always, but to me he's not a fit on the right over genuine pace and his lack of strength on the ball can see him get caught on the break too easily.

69~~~
Didn't catch the match but just watched his YouTube highlights of the match. That pass to Young was out of this world, firstly the bit of skill and link up play with Darmian but the way he strikes the ball enabling it to swing around to Young was just class.

70~~~
I wish he'd just be more adventurous with his passing, Depay did make some good runs behind the CBs and none of them were picked by Mata. Those are the passes we know he can make easily.

71~~~
Might have to do with LVG's instructions. From what I recall, Mata was more adventurous with his passing during his time at Chelsea.

72~~~
Even under Moyes he was like that, hesitant and all. I don't think LVG would tell the players not to attempt a good pass when they see one.

73~~~
Well, we do know that LVG stresses possession the most in his "philosophy". For example, he didn't give Herrera much playing time, until Herrera adapted and become a more cautious player. I think Mata slowing our attacks down, and picking easier passes over more risky ones is a direct result of that. Under Moyes, the whole team was devoid of creativity tbf.

74~~~
It doesn't stop Young from making dangerous passes when he thinks he can make them and Mata is a much better passer than him. While I agree that LVG's tactic is making the players more cautious, I'm still disappointed to see Mata being so useless with his passing when we know he can open teams up. Young shouldn't be our most threatening player but he is.

75~~~
Surprised at people saying he was class etc. because I thought he was quite poor in all honesty. His severe lack of pace really hampers him when he plays in that position. Still, only pre season nothing to worry about massively.

76~~~
Pefer Herrera to start over him

77~~~
Agreed. Too many times he turned back and played passes backward. Far too slow in general.

78~~~

79~~~
Nope. He just played for Chelsea at a time when they were poor in the league, had a number of managerial changes, played with a complete lack of discipline/stability.

People think he was so good despite Chelsea being poor. I'd say it was partly <i>because </i>Chelsea were so poor.
I've always believed that a top team does not feature Juan Mata in it consistently. He'll always look better in a lesser team, where his pluses are worth more than his negatives, and he has the freedom to do what he wants. A top team would/should have him as an impact sub/rotation option.

80~~~
Mata interview saying he's comfortable playing on the right. Saying he's always aiming to score at least 10 goals.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/27/juan-mata-double-figures-goals-manchester-united?CMP=share_btn_tw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...ures-goals-manchester-united?CMP=share_btn_tw</a>

81~~~
It'll be interesting to see what LvG does with Mata if we get Pedro.

82~~~
Maybe, move mata central and depay on the left and pedro right or keep mata where he is and move pedro to the left. If lvg feels young can be improved upon he is brutal enough to do so

83~~~
I don't get why Mata isn't played as a number 10. He has no pace and it's obvious what he is going to do on the wing. If he must play, play him in his best position ffs.

84~~~
Silky touches and keeps it tidy but just doesn't add enough as a wide player IMO.

I think LvG is of the view that he is too weak to protect the ball centrally in attack, that's something Memphis has done well even though the position is not a familiar one to him.

85~~~
Thought he was pretty good in the first half, and among our best players. Faded in the second half.

86~~~
very good today. glad he covered rb at the end. may have saved the game.

87~~~
He was ok. I still think he'd be far better in the middle.

88~~~
Was grand. Our attack in general was a bit meh.

89~~~
Our best attacking Player today.

90~~~
Very enjoyable player to watch.

91~~~
Very good performance, shame about that free kick, hassled everybody around the pitch, nothing new from him as he's always running plenty but it was an impressive display of hard work done on the pitch.

92~~~
Really needs to be playing as a #10. It sounds crazy, and probably hasn't been suggested by everyone ever.

Davies was there for the taking, and Young couldn't beat Walker for pace. We should have put a quicker player on the right and gone at them.

93~~~
Did ok. That touch at the end was sexy. Still no winger though.

94~~~
He was brilliant defensively and filling in at LB when Shaw burst forward.

Very average offensively, as was the rest of the team.

95~~~
Not so impressed, very off the pace first half but he got better later on. He had some very good actions though and that shows his potential. Still would prefer Pedro on the wing, we need speed and dribbling over there.

96~~~
Did OK, after an iffy start where he gave away the ball a couple of times too many.

97~~~
Sometimes he will have a brilliant game in which he scores goals and plays amazing passes. This was not one of them and it makes him look very average. Especially when played on the right wing and being incapable of putting in a cross. He should be playing where Depay is playing.

98~~~
Mata worked his socks off today, clearly a different player than the one we've signed, his defensive contribution was very good.

99~~~
He was ok, very tidy I guess the word is, needs to look for Darmian on the overlap more though, not a long term solution out there though.

100~~~
Anyone has a gif of his touch near the end of the game?

101~~~
Hopefully continue to play him and drop Young.

102~~~
Depay was dispossessed 6 times today. I wouldn't say he has done very well in that specific regard and I think Mata would do better with his technique. If Depay learns the role he will definitely provide a lot of penetration and dribbling which Mata will never do though.

103~~~
For me, he's not like David Silva.

He's primarily a scorer, not a chance creator.

He should be behind the striker. He's only shined on the right with Herrera there.

104~~~
What is strange today is that I thought he was fantastic today and yet he still remained totally ineffective on the whole... he doesn't make us a more threatening team when in possession he just makes us more likely to keep the ball. 

Depay might be less efficient but he looks dangerous every time he gets it, Mata no matter what position he plays, he doesn't look dangerous. Maybe if we had a more dynamic striker he would be able to  pass forward more and get more assists on the board.

105~~~
Thought he had a rubbish first half and a decent second half... so not bad overall.

106~~~
In 4-3-3 he had a lot of freedom to come inside, but van Gaal has come up with this weird formation that suits nobody bar Rooney maybe. Now he's asked to stay out wide, his role is very restricted. I don't understand why are we playing that way. 
He had a lot of very good touches, was very tidy and did well defensively but IMO he doesn't do enough in attack. Once we get Pedro he will probably find himself on the bench as lvg clearly doesn't rate him in no 10 position.

107~~~
In fairness I made the comment after the pre season games where he was more effective than today in the role. It wouldn't hurt to try Memphis on the left and play Mata as the #10 for a game and see how it went but LvG seems resistant to play Mata centrally, choosing Fellaini and now a winger to play there instead of him.

108~~~
It's simply because he is not very creative. I've said it countless times before on here - he isn't the player in the side that's going to play defence splitting passes, because it's simply not in his repertoire.

109~~~
Worked really hard and had a few good moments that showcased his skill and control but produced very little in regards to actual end product. Not really a dig at him its just that he doesn't possess the skillset to be consistently dangerous in the role he was played today. He had all the defensive duties of an orthodox winger (and fulfilled them surprisingly well) with a little bit of leeway to drift inside once in the opponents half but he simply isn't suited to the right wing. 

He invariably slows the play as he doesn't have the pace to burst past his man (or even force them not to get as tight) and isn't the crossing type which all makes the overlap so predictable and easy to counteract. Despite being an inferior player, Young provided (and regularly did last season) the more threatening supply in to the box. He'll have good games there over the course of the season but most of his good moments will come from drifting in to other areas (more central) rather than playing his position. Such a waste IMO and hard to make sense of.

110~~~
He's a tidy second striker who takes a good set piece. Nothing more, nothing less.

He's lacking so much that's needed for a '10' in a possession team.

111~~~
Who would you pick ahead of him as a #10?

112~~~
I agree a bit.
He is not suited for a number 10 role in the PL neither though I fear. Not for a possession based ga,e like ours anyway. He is too lightweight to play in the centre of the park where all the action takes place. I rate him but I am just not sure whether Mou actually had every reason to sell him. There just doesn't seem to be a position in the EPL that suits him perfectly.

113~~~
This. Many people are under the illusion that he is a creative, David Silva kind of player. As someone else said his biggest assets are in keeping possession and the ability to finish/take brilliant set pieces. He doesn't possess the creativity, nor the skill set, to shine in the no10 role. As a second striker(which is where he played at his best for chelsea); is a completely different role and he would shine there no doubt but LVG doesn't play with such a formation. I would even argue that his creativity is largely overrated. He is very capable of putting in good balls and his passing accuarcy is sublime but his ability to read between the lines and see potential runners is actually quite poor on the whole and this is what I mean by creative.

114~~~
Nah he's grand in the right system - for instance, he'd thrive in the Arsenal system IMO. He needs the team built to his strength though which is my whole irritation with our transfer policy post SAF.

We seemed to have been desperate to just buy "big name" players because we could, without actually having a plan of building a team - resulting in good, expensive players often forced out of position. When we decided to fork out £37m for Mata, we should have been prepared to build the team around him at  #10.

But yeah, he's too slow and lightweight for our current setup. We don't have a CF  who's able to bring the best out of mata (pacey/strong). Its criminal how much we've spent on players, only to still constantly play them out of position the last few years. Kagawa, Mata, Fellaini and AdM £130m+ worth of talent & sort of not used in positions they thrived which made us fork out that amount of money in the first place.(barring finding Afros bets use last season).

It might be a controversial opinion, but if mata isn't first choice #10, he should actually be sold for a pacier winger.

edit: #10 being further up the field "support striker" type position and not an attacking mid

115~~~
For all his obvious qualities I struggle to see a place for him in this team. He could play as #10 (which seems to equate to a support striker in this LVG system) but would need a more dynamic striker than Rooney in front of him. 
I do think he is PL proven though but clearly requires certain allowances or a team shaped around him to get the best out of him.

116~~~
Pretty much agree. Especially about the passing. He puts final touches on moves, from a very advanced position. But his ability to play the ball behind a defence isn't particularly great. Whereas how often do we see Silva play that inside channel pass to his full backs? The 'assist bedore the assist'. 

I'd disagree that he's great at holding possession, though. Keeping possesion, yes. but holding it himself? Not so much.
Thats probably what you meant though.

But we pretty much agree on Mata.

117~~~
He gets dispossessed really easily which annoys me a bit. He was good otherwise though.

118~~~
Agree with everything you said, especially about the 'assist before the assist' and yep by holding possession, that's what I meant. Edited. Living in a foreign country has taken a toll on my English <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

Indeed, Silva essentially controls and commands City's attacking play through such qualities and hence why he is so good in that position. It's clear as day Mata is not capable of the same and possesses a different skillset. Those qualities are essential for a no10 in a possesion oriented game no10, and are essential in breaking teams down. People keep banging on about how many we have; they ignore the fact that we don't have any with the required skillsets like that of Silva, Isco, Coutinho etc to really provide the required creativity/penetration from the middle. Getting assists and being creative are two totally different things, although they often coincide. Silva is extremely creative yet never seems to get brilliant assist tallys. Go figure. I actually think the closest we have to this is Herrera and I am curious to see if he gets some game time there throughout the season. Is that where he was playing today?

119~~~
I thought he did well, if a bit quiet. He is a ridiculously talented player, so much fun to watch.

120~~~
I expected him to be a player who can make lots of defence splitting passes when we signed him. Perhaps because I wasn't paying attention when he was at Chelsea. Whatever, it doesn't seem to be part of his game at all. Which is a problem. Presumably Van Gaal thinks Depay can be the man to open up defences. Big ask for a young player with a lot of adapting still to do.

121~~~
I like Mata, and I hate to say it, but I'm slowly starting to think he's a bit of a luxury player.

The type that will look good when everything is going well, the team is playing well, or if the whole team is set up to accommodate him. But when the chips are down, and the team isn't on song, he'll rarely stand out or be the guy to turn it around. 

I think the only way we'll, consistently (and thats the key) see the best of Mata, is when (and if) the whole team clicks.

122~~~
We're singing from the exact same hymn sheet.
Yeah, Herrera came on for Depay.

123~~~
I don't think the team even needs to play well, particularly. Chelsea weren't lighting up the league while he was doing well.
It's about playing to his strengths.
However, the reality is, very few of the best teams will play to his strengths.

Most of them dominate the ball, which requires strength and holding the ball - which he lacks.
Most of them require pace on the wing - which he lacks.
Most of them require some form of defensive shift - he's not great, but he tries.
Most of them don't want their number 10 playing as a second striker - which he does.

The better we get, the less likely he is to keep his place in the team, in my opinion.

124~~~
Anyone got a gif of that touch and skill towards the end of todays game? It was easily the highlight of the game.

Whilst I agree that he should be doing it more, it is difficult to make defense splitting passes when there's no one making the runs to get on the end of such passes. I swear I moved around more stood in the stand then Rooney did up front today.

125~~~
It's as much to do with Mata as anyone else.
I'm almost certain that Silva wouldn't suffer in the same way in this team. He'd make us look more threatening, but would probably end up with fewer assists to his name.

Because he'd hold the ball that bit longer, and go round people to take them out of the game, and he'd be able to make better angles, invite his fullbacks forward and invite his teammates to make more runs. He generally spots runs and gaps better than Mata too. 

Whereas Mata generally plays the way he's facing, and passes it off as soon as someone closes him down. It's all pretty and keeps us 'ticking' but basically does nothing to move us forward.

126~~~
We had two of the best strikers in the world in terms of movement here last season and he couldn't do it then either. Yeah their other qualities were/are in fast decline but no one can deny that their movement was still on another level. The treacherous rodent was pretty much the only one in the team providing them with any penetrating passes that they frustratingly couldn't finish most of the time. With him gone, we really suffer from lack of creation but I agree Rooney is not up to par.

I've mentioned before, his(Mata) final ball and passing accuracy are exquisite and one of his strongest qualities but his ability to spot out runners and see the gaps that aren't there so to speak is quite non existent. We need that player who can penetrate the defense through their vision, especially when it comes to breaking down teams who park the bus or are generally defending well and it is often in those games that mata coincidentally disappears.

To sum up my point shortly, once theres a clear gap, there's no one in the team I'd rather  have on the ball than Mata due to the quality of his passing and this is why he puts out decent assist figures every year. He's lethal on the counter attack and takes great advantage of bad positioning by opposition defenders. My problem with him is that he doesn't have the vision or creativity to find that gap unless its generally obvious for all to see, and he will revert to keeping possession 9 times out of 10. We need someone who can provide that ball through even when the other team are defending well but that also requires good runs on the part of our strikers which (this season ) I feel is another important issue.

127~~~
Exactly, why could di Maria do it but Mata couldnt? I think it was rather to Mata himself than our strikers. RVP and Falcao arent the same, but they still made plenty of runs.

128~~~
The "no movement" excuse? Been trotted out for Kagawa and Mata with - at various times - RvP, Hernandez, Falcao, Rooney, Welbeck and Wilson up top and a bunch of different players in wide areas. Not sure I'm buying it tbh.

129~~~
I'm almost 100% certain this isn't true.

130~~~
I'm talking about today's game - hence the Rooney comment.

131~~~
I know. I'm not judging Mata just on today's game though. My comment that you responded to was about his entire United career to date.

132~~~
Then I'm also almost 100% certain you have no idea of what good movement means. By all means, their other qualities and what made them truly world class had greatly declined(shooting/finishing, pace, dribbling and reactios). Butt anyone who knows their 2 cents on how a striker is supposed to make runs, knows RVP and Falcao are still amazingly sharp in that regard. Unfortunately finishing, reactions and not falling over <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> are also just as important for any striker.

133~~~
well, you can use the same logic reverse....its our strikers fault as they had Mata, Kagawa, Scholes, Carrick, Young, Valencia, Nani that provided service. Reality is, its not that simple.

134~~~
And there it is.

Falcao's movement is god awful now. I went to Old Trafford with the specific mission of watching him to see whether this "Oh but his movement is great" thing was actually true, and it wasn't in the slightest. He spent the majority of his matches hiding behind defenders when our players were actually looking for passes, and these so called "runs" would generally be at times when the pass would be incredibly unlikely to come, or they were back towards the play, making them utterly pointless.

To say Falcao's movement last season was fantastic is factually incorrect.

RVP <b>at times </b>had great movement, at other times he was a statue.

135~~~
There's a direct correlation between Scholes' waning powers and our lack of penetration. Which speaks volumes about the creativity of the other players on that list. I don't see the same drop off in quality with our strikers.

Of course, you can't ignore the managerial changes either...

136~~~
Then, I guess we will have to agree to disagree. I paid particular attention to both of their movement and was smacking my head on the wall at all the times no one even attempted to thread a ball through to them, save for rat face. Infact, I would argue that the only part of Falcaos game that has truly remained is his movement. You think Jose would sign him based off his other qualities, even as a 2nd/3rd choice striker? Anyway, different people see different things and I respect your opinion. The truth lies somewhere in the spectrum between our views.

137~~~
Welbeck - played 90% of the time on the wing and even if he had played as a striker, his movement as a striker in the final third is not the best. And i love the guy, probably my favorite player now.
Wilson - as Danny, like him and rate him very highly but his performances and his movement for first team are pretty bad
Falcao - once a great player, now a donkey
RVP - the minute Fergie left, the boy inside him died <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Chicha - barely played since Fergie left

So while on paper we had great strikers, in reality we didnt as Van Persie and Falcao only offered a big name presence and Rooney was moved all around the pitch for who know which reasons....pretty much the same things can be said for majority of my "creators" and thats why i said its not that simple.
We play awful football and our players look much worse then they actually are, the quality is there(we need one or two more) and we should play much better football, im not blaming players because manager is responsible for them and how they play.

138~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

139~~~
Another good performance but we need to get him on the ball closer to goal more.

140~~~
Poor first half

141~~~
Was alright. Will have a Blinder in a game and y'all will love him again

142~~~
I think it's pretty obvious that he isn't being utilised in a way that gets the best out of him. Played out of what I'm sure is his favourite position and in a system/style that doesn't seem to suit him much.

As is he's a tidy footballer who will get quite a lot of goals and assists. Which isn't a bad thing and actually makes him one of our better attacking players as he will continue doing that pretty consistently. However, when you consider the talent he displayed at Chelsea it really does seem like a waste....

I guess his future comes down to a few things. For one, how much more he can adapt and improve to suit the system. I think it's fair to say his game has changed a bit in the last while? Seems to do more defensively and is more possession focused, I think. I know some people complain about him being too cautious but that may well be him attempting to fit in with Van Gaal's philosophy.

The key point though is how happy Van Gaal is with how he plays. Maybe he is actually doing what the manager wants? It wouldn't be the first time LVG's view of what's right for the team is at odds with the caf's.

I guess we'll know when Pedro arrives and we see who he replaces in the starting eleven.

143~~~
Could just insert a random name there and you wouldn't be wrong.

144~~~
Not really. We've seen iplenty of players down the years stand out and play at their best, even if the team around them hasn't been playing great. RVP, Aguero, Hazard all do it. Kane did it last season.

Mata only seems to play really well, when everyone else is. I think the main reason for that is that he lacks that individualism to stand out. He's not fast, or strong, nor does he have great dribbling skills, or the ability to dictate the play. So the only way he can get into good positions is with clever movement and good passing. If his teammates don't provide either of that, then he comes a bit of a passenger, as he doesn't have much else to hurt the opposition with. 

On song, I think he's a wonderful player to watch, he really is. But he can't do it on his own. He's just not that type of player.

145~~~
I was actually only talking about our team. We don't have a player like that I agree. Although he was great at Chelsea when they were playing some really poor football but those performances will just be dismissed as him being good only because the whole team being set up for him so he can't win really.

146~~~
You know I'm right there with you on the Mata-man-crush, but I really do wish he'd be a bit more assertive in his passing. It might be down to lack of movement, or more likely, strict programming from Van Gaal, but the amount of times he skates infield with the ball, displaying that ever-silky control, only to lay it off to the player behind, is a bit frustrating. I really would love to see him playing more centrally in his natural position (I guess what the number fetishists around here would refer to as the #10 position.)

147~~~
I agree, but he's so good when things are clicking that I really think it is worth building up the fluency of the rest of the squad and enabling Mata to provide the aesthetic icing on the cake, as it were. Of course, I think there will be certain fixtures for which he might not be best suited. That's why I love the squad depth that we are building (hopefully with added Pedro in the coming days.)

148~~~
I think that's the thing with his passing though, when he gets it out wide and facing inside, he has those options. Put him in the middle and you double his options as he can go both ways.

149~~~
I'd like to see him given a go centrally again. Just to change the attack up a bit and see if we can create more chances.

150~~~
We'll be here in months talkimg about how 'when Mata's played here' or 'this player is signed' or 'once there's movement' we'll see the best of Mata. People still won't have realised/admitted he's just not actually very creative.

151~~~
Does anyone have video/gif of his amazing ball control when everyone saw the ball going for throw in? 

cnuts never showed it from closer view, but it's important that they showed foul on Young at least five times and Schweini clipping one of Spurs' players at least from 3 different angles. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

152~~~
He needs his mate to link up with in the attack. Had nobody to play those one two's with yesterday. Almost a full right hand side to himself with the odd run from Darmian, but with no link from midfield and no runs in attack he will struggle. Either play him off the striker or play a box to box mid who can link up (Herrera, where are you?)

153~~~
World class number ten and he is playing as a RW and is losing his position to a 21 year old who has no experience playing there. sometimes I just really really hate LVG. It is nice to.see that he making the most out of his limited role.

154~~~
Or conversely, he'll have a great run of games followed by one indifferent one, and then all the same criticisms will be trotted out again.

155~~~
The criticisms are all valid. They aren't just plucked out of thin air.

156~~~
Hey I've said much of the same, but I think they're exaggerated at times. He's shown with Chelsea just how dominant he can be.

157~~~
He made the most out of playing RM, it wasn't even a RF like last season he was too deep at times. His touch and ball retention is world class, he needs to play behind Rooney with 2 pacey wingers ahead of him. Solid performance yesterday and I'm certain he'll hit double figures in both goals and assists this season if he plays.

158~~~
He needs to come off the wing, too easily knocked off the ball by speedy full backs.  Was guilty of losing the ball 3-4 times in the early stages with one leading to the great chance that Spurs had in the first half. Played much better for the rest of the game but really needs to play centrally going forward.

159~~~
But the same criticisms will hold true. A blinder for Mata would probably be scoring a few goals because of how clinical he is in front of goal. It won't be him completely dictating play, creating openings and holding possession for himself with guile in the way other top playmakers in the league do.

160~~~
He needs to play behind the striker for that

161~~~
But as others have mentioned, it's always that same excuse. Kagawa had it and now it seems Mata will. van Gaal seems reluctant to play him through the middle he just seems too weak and immobile to really get a good grip on the game.

162~~~
He still wouldn't do it. It's him and his limitations that hold him back. Not so much his position or other people.

163~~~
He was a magician all over the pitch if you ever watched him at Chelsea. Wasn't limited in any way there.

164~~~
They played a completely different way, and his limitations weren't exposed.

165~~~
I was all for Mata playing on the right last season, where he had Herrera to link up with, but if we're going to continue playing a 4231 system, with two defensive mids, we're going to need quick wingers who will keep the width and be able to take players on. 

If we get Pedro, we should put Mata as a 10 or just drop him because he's just not effective enough on the wing, in my opinion.

166~~~
This. It's quite funny how many just assume putting Mata in the middle will instantly solve our and his own limitations going forward.

167~~~
I don't see it ever happening consistently under LvG.  Mata can't truly excel in this setup until we consistently play our controlled game at a much higher tempo, which only happens in very specific circumstances with our continuing squad limitations.

168~~~
We could at least give it a try. I mean it's not like he's actually been given an extended run at #10 here within a functioning, settled side.

Play Depay LW, Mata AM and Pedro RW. Maybe it will work, maybe it won't. It can't be that much worse than the alternatives though and at least we'll have given our best attacking players a chance in their best positions.

169~~~
And how long would we have to give him in that position that the squad isn't 'settled' to justify if he doesn't perform? I do agree we should be playing Memphis on the left with a potential Pedro signing on the right, but I'd much rather see Ander play as a third midfielder through the middle to add some mobility and somebody to instigate the tempo of a game a little quicker.

170~~~
Don't know really, we'd have to see how he's doing. Five or so games would be enough for us to know if he's progressing or at least if the team in general is functioning better, I'd have thought. If he is as badly suited to that role as some here think then it would likely be apparent by then.

Yeah, maybe Herrera would work better as a #10 than Mata. Mata has previously reached a higher level in that position than Herrera ever has though, so I'd have thought letting him prove himself one way or another first would be a wiser move. Especially as Herrera is really more of a box to box CM imo.

Put it this way: If both of them are playing to their absolute best then Mata is the better player. Maybe Herrera has more chance of reaching his highest level here but for the sake of a month or so of our time it'd be worth trying it out.

171~~~
Saw someone ask how many of Rooney's assists were from set plays over the years. and it got me wondering how many of Mata's were from set plays back when he was at Chelsea and was apparently really creative (which I think is untrue, but that's another debate entirely).

First season: 6 out of 13 league assists were from set plays.
Looking for the 12/13 season now.

172~~~
Ahhh here it is

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/mata-skill-2.gif" src="https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/mata-skill-2.gif"/> 

Lovely stuff, if only there was an alternate angle.

173~~~
He had 52 assists for Chelsea in 135 games. 33 from open play, 19 from set pieces. Overall, I make it 89 assists from 360 games.

A fair rate of assists but it's obvious he's not what you'd call a creative player regardless of stats. Still, he's one of our better players and imo easily better than Pedro so he should still start games for us.

174~~~
Yeah, as I imagined, a fair number of set pieces in there.
Agreed he's not an overly creative player. Not sure I'd say he's better than Pedro, myself - especially in this system, but I can see why others may think he is.

I still think Mata's valuable, as he takes gret set-pieces and is a great finisher, but I don't think he's ideal for any role in a 433/4231 - especially a possession-based one.

175~~~
My view on him remains unchanged from last season - Mata is very aesthetically pleasing both on and off the pitch, but he doesn't actually offer a huge amount in terms of penetration and creativity. He is for me, a luxury player whose strongest attributes are his technique and finishing. As a playmaker, he simply does not do a great deal outside of the opponents penalty box. He doesn't dribble and take players on, he doesn't play defence splitting passes, his work rate is nothing special nor is his defensive contribution.

It's the same as last season where we looked completely devoid of creativity, and whilst the caf was only too happy to heap the blame on Young and Fellaini, we offered nothing from the right flank. We went 3 games without scoring and yet Mata was always absolved of any sort of blame. For his role in the team he should have been and should still be one of our primary playmakers, and I just don't see him doing that, compared to others like Silva, Coutinho, Cazorla, Fabregas etc...

Having said all that, I can see a place for him along with Rooney and Memphis in a fluid front three, provided we sort our midfield shape out rather than having two defensive midfielders and a #10 who basically operates as a second striker.

If it had been me however, I would have loved to see Nani and Memphis as our wide men in a proper 4-3-3.

176~~~
I wouldn't mind seeing a young player (Januzaj/Pereira/Lingard/Wilson) for Young or Mata at some point.

177~~~
He needs to play behind the striker. He's wasted as RW as he simply do not have the pace to cover that role

178~~~
But he doesnt have the balance and dribbling to play center in a possession based side.

179~~~
He's certainly better than Depay on that regard

We've got 6 players whose natural in that role (Mata, Fellaini, Herrera, Januzaj, Rooney and Perriera). Depay should be play on the flanks, were his pace and technique will cause havoc in the opponents defense

180~~~
Depay has twice as much balance as Mata got, both not great dribbles but Depay can carry the ball better than Mata can. Mata is more creative though, wouldnt want Depay playing there either.

181~~~
For every one of those, there is about 10 of these.

182~~~
He was shite on Saturday. Dallied more or less every time he was given the ball. A higher tempo will help him, though, in his defence. 

Whether he plays centrally or out wide is a bit of a red herring, to be honest. He's probably played more professional football games in a wider role than he has done centrally and he's more than capable of excelling in either role. It's up to him to make more of an influence, which he's certainly capable of doing.

183~~~
Keeping the ball under pressure? Yeah, hate it when that happens...

184~~~
I got this from the Louis van Gaal Tactics thread so as to not derail that.
Mata at Chelsea was quite similar to Silva at Man. City with the only difference being that Silva operated deeper and took more control of the match whilst Mata operated more in the channels and in the final third. I remember the matches where Chelsea badly missed Mata's creativity and guile, and that was when they even had Hazard and Oscar playing for them.

It's only since he's moved to us that Mata's become much less of a playmaker and more of a goalscoring, supporting player, almost like a wide forward/second (third?) striker.

185~~~
They were never similar. Silva dictated play in a possession team, whereas Mata scored and assisted in a counter-attacking team.

Silva is the guy who assists the assist as well as assists the goal-scorer. Mata is just the guy who assists the goalscorer.

Silva's ability to sit on the ball, turn and dribble his man, create, dictate... is all significantly better than Mata's.
Hence Silva has always been ahead in the pecking order for Spain.

Mata isn't even as creative as Herrera, and has always been a second striker.

Put Mata in possession team and reduce his space.. and he gets bullied out of the game, and only offers goals and safe passing. Give him space to play into and a stretched defence to exploit, and he's effective.
Silva thrives in teams who suffocate the opposition.

Not alike, and never were.

186~~~
Exactly, hence why I said that Silva dropped deeper and took more control of the match. The similarities between them are in the fact that both are small, not fast, and not quick on the ball. As well as the physical traits, both have quite a good control of the ball and can maintain it under pressure (Silva more than Mata, of course). Also, both are quite good at spotting key passes (Silva is more than a playmaker than Mata, of course).

The only big difference between them is in their playing style. Mata isn't one to dictate play and be the side's main playmaker, whilst Silva is. However, Mata is more direct and more of a goalscorer than Silva is. Mata cannot thrive in playing a possession-based game as he's quite direct and a final-third-based player. Silva is more all-rounded.

187~~~
Okay... so if you're saying all this, why did you say they were quite similar? You've just listed loads of differences (and there are even more we could list).
You've said they're quite similar and then said 'the only big difference... is in their playing style' So surely they aren't similar.

He's genuinely more similar to Rooney (when his technique isn't atrocious) than Silva.

It's amazing how people still bundle Silva and Mata together, when Mata has never shown the capability to do what Silva does.

His game is all about finishing, assisting once the defence is stretched, and set pieces. Silva's game is completely different.

188~~~
For me, quite similar doesn't mean 100% similar i.e. exactly the same. I was thinking back at his Chelsea days and wondering how essential he was for them before Mourinho came in. When Mata was absent, Chelsea had a tough time breaking down opposition defences, particularly those that sat back with numbers. This is quite similar to how Man. City miss Silva. Both were very good at breaking down opposition defences albeit with different approaches. That's where the majority of their similarities lie.

189~~~
Just read in the MEN that they think Pedro would replace Mata and not Young... They're having a laugh, right??

190~~~
Don't want the thought to even cross my mind.

191~~~
It's highly probable. van Gaal rates the diligence and mobility of Young bizarrely highly. I don't think Mata should be starting, but he's definitely a better option than Young.

192~~~
I could not have put it better.

193~~~
Wouldn't be <i>that</i> surprising.
I think it's clear that van Gaal really likes Young, and probably doesn't regard Mata and Herrera as crucial players, like most on here do.

194~~~
nah I can't say both do the same with different approaches. Silva with his creativity forces space to appear, and that is breaking down defences. while Mata, for the reasons stated above, has to wait for space in defences to appear before he can act himself. not quite similar at all

195~~~
Your posts are right on the money 

In my own opinion I wish we hadn't bought Mata...gave Chelsea a huge amount of money for a problem we both didn't/don't want

196~~~
That's how I have always imagined it would go. Wouldn't surprise me at all.

197~~~
Fair enough, I can see what you mean with that. I was thinking of something different when I mentioned "breaking down defences" but I guess I was thinking of that incorrectly anyways.

Ultimately, though, Mata and Silva are completely different players, and with Silva having more in his locker, I see him as being better than Mata. However, at Chelsea, he was still key as he was the one putting players through on goal with his more direct approach. Still, though, I do find his transfer here unnecessary at that time, but now, he's useful for us given the transfers that we have conducted.

198~~~
Quite possible. Hopefully it means Memphis-Mata-Pedro though.

199~~~
Actually no, i am also under the same suspicion. The thing is that in this 4-4-2 (or 4-4-1-1) with the two holding midfielders we rely heavily on the wings to build up our attacking plays and get the ball forward. Which means that our wingers must spend a lot of time in the middle third of the pitch, effectively hold onto the ball under pressure, provide defensive contribution and of course carry the ball forward.

This is what made Young "irreplaceable" in the first place despite his lack of qualilty, his overall contribution. Last Saturday i almost felt sorry for Mata when i was watching him running up and down the right flank and trying to make himself useful. Against a more creative FB we would probably have more problems.

On the other hand, both Mata and Pedro flourish when they're given the opportunity to stay in the final third. Tracking back full backs and contributing on both ends of the pitch isn't really their cup of tea. You can't have four players who can only contribute in the attacking third (Rooney, Memphis, Pedro and Mata), it's too risky. Even Barca has three.

Pedro is stronger than Mata and he can offer much more in our pressing game. But the main difference is that Pedro will pass the ball and then look for a run in the box, behind the defense and he will try to beat his marker when Mata will pass and look for the next open space in the midfield to occupy. Pedro's better at making things happen in tight spaces than Mata.

In the best case scenario we'll hopefully see a return to last season's 4-3-3 with Carrick-Schweinsteiger sharing the holding role, Morgan and Herrera as the two b2b midfielders (a more fit Bastian could also play there) and Pedro-Rooney-Memphis up front and Mata being the first to come on whenever we want to try something different.

200~~~
I tend to agree with that. The reasons for Young being nearly irreplaceable at the moment are his defensive work and his pace in 1:1 situations. It does not make him a fantastic footballer but our attacking players don`t offer this.
I thought that Memphis might have similar strengths to Young and will replace him on the left wing. However, LvG does not see it this way.
You get the feeling that the pecking order of the 3 behind Rooney is Young-Memphis-Mata atm and as soon as a right winger comes in Mata will be benched.

201~~~
Watching Silva on Monday night made me realise once again what we're missing from Mata. I still think that he's the better finisher, but other than that there's no contest.

202~~~
Wouldnt mind if it's Mata or Young, they're in the same category for me as in how much of a key player they are. Mata's more productive but Young is more likely to break the match open by passing a defender or his excellent link up play with Shaw. Pedro is better than both on the wing.

203~~~
He did nothing wrong there. Carrick was the one who should have done better. There was a clever little one-two available, but it was ignored.

204~~~
great pass to januzaj for his goal just now

205~~~
It was a perfect pass to play him into a very dangerous position.

206~~~
Very good so far. Hope to see him try more of these decisive passes.

207~~~
Great pass for the goal. We need to see more of that, as he's often reluctant to play the pass and we haven't really seen a creative Mata since his arrival.

208~~~
Very good assist. Still want more from him though.

209~~~
Was he instructed to come inside or was it of his own accord.

He needs to play in the middle with somewhat of a free role. He's played the last 10/15 mins in the role that David Silva plays for City.

The more of the ball he sees in the middle of the park, the better United can potentially be in possession. 

His best attributes are basically wasted when pushed out wide. He's too predictable. Cutting inside every time. It's a waste of a position on the field the way I see it. If we had another pacey winger out wide, willing to take on his man, we would be so much more dangerous

210~~~
He's given some freedom. I think LVG once called him a 'false' winger

211~~~
He doesn't come inside enough. He's so much more use to the team there- constantly moving, making himself available. 

Maybe he is afraid of leaving the right flank too vulnerable.

212~~~
Has anyone worked out what was wrong with this yet? I've watched it a good 15 times now and I'm still baffled. He didn't take on three defenders to burst into the area with his natural dribbling skill? He didn't swing a Beckham like cross into a completely empty area? He didn't contort himself into a jellyfish or turn his marker invisible to slip it into the overlapping runner?... Answers on a postcard.

213~~~
Assisted from the left hand side. Would be much better as a face up left winger, not an inverted right forward who plays extremely deep.

Nice little ball in for Memphis then as well.

214~~~
Should've been a second assist...

215~~~
Weird game for him. He's lost the ball way too many times, but he really should've had 2 assists

216~~~
You're reading to much into it, maybe football isn't for you? Perhaps, marine biology? For every take under pressure and turn inside there is a take under pressure with his back to space and dribble back 20 yards. Quite literal really.

217~~~
I don't get why people kept calling for Mata to be taken off, he was our best player and everything positive and all of our creativity was through him.

218~~~
Created two chances. And the only one to do so.

219~~~
I thought so too. Just once i would like him to play that number 10 role. With our wingers he would really come to life. His best stuff came when he drifted into the middle

220~~~
He created two great openings but he was losing the ball for fun. He's far too easy to dispossess.

221~~~
Good pass for the assist and a good pass for the Depay chance.

222~~~
Class! Memphis should be arrested for theft for denying a second one.

223~~~
Yeah was a weird one... he conceded possession far more then usual, and yet was our most threatening person in possession by some distance.

224~~~
He can have a poor game and still come up with a goal/assist while at least doing the basics decently.

Rooney's equally productive except for one big difference. He barely resembles a top flight footballer when he's having a stinker.

225~~~
Maybe thats why, hes trying difficult passes to get the team moving

226~~~
Perhaps indeed. Maybe you can enlighten me as to what Mata<i> should've</i> done? It's the only way I'll learn.

227~~~
Yeah, maybe logic would point straight to that, but in reality, he lost the ball in a lot of daft/silly ways that weren't through trying difficult passes.

228~~~
He was sloppier than usual tonight. Set up our goal and our only other chance so can't complain too much.

229~~~
Mixed performance. Brilliant through balls. For both sides though.

230~~~
Should have come away with two assists, with an AWOL centre forward that's a good peformance.

231~~~
was actually my MOM. hes quite good that lad. Should have had two beatiful assists instead of 1

232~~~
Very good game imo. Has done things we expect him to do. Lost the ball on few occasions but never gave up, been all over the pitch and got a nice assist. If Memphis had buried that chance he'd have 2.

233~~~
Nah, his shit moments mostly came in our half. Would've been MOTM if not for those.

234~~~
Should have had 2 assists, wonderful passes from him. But elsewhere he looks pretty slow, and gets bullied off the ball quite a fair bit. Though, like the rest of the team, he improved when Schweinsteiger and Herrera came on. Soon as Herrera came on, he and Mata were already linking it up on the right.

235~~~
Gets pushed over way too easily. Has obvious quality though.

236~~~
Probably his most creative game since he joined the club. Hopefully it continues. You can tell what a difference having memphis actually running in behind makes though, always felt he had it in him to show that creative side if we just had players making the runs. Was good today for the most part though.

237~~~
Created our two best chances (and goal) with completely left-field passes (figuratively, not literally. One was from the right) and if Memphis had slotted home his chance we could quite comfortably say we won that game because of Mata's vision. Yet that's cause for concern for some. Play so-so and create our best openings = not good enough. Play well and don't create enough = ditto. Some of you will never be happy. God knows what the Caf would've thought of Eric. The little munchkin did his job. Green tick on the scorecard for me.

238~~~
Looks not fully fit to me. Some brilliant moments (great passes into the path of the runner, finally) coupled with some easy ball losses and weak defending. Still, deserves his place

239~~~
I thought he was pretty rubbish except for those two brilliant passes, but those alone turned it into a decent performance. I'd like to see him given a couple of games in the number 10 role.

240~~~
He should play at 10 with passing like that.

241~~~
Mata made a couple of passes tonight that served as a reminder of why he's managed to fight his way back into Van Gaal's starting XI. Not certain if we have many players at United who could pull those kind of through balls off. When we face compact teams who sit deep and don't try to play out Mata's true value will be clear.

242~~~
That wasn't the point, the point was for every dribble out under pressure there is a whole myriad of dribbling back, not going at his man, holding it up. It wasn't about what he should have done, it is what he did in relation to the other video. It doesn't help when he has an obvious lack of pace and physical ability. It seems his legs have gone and he no longer values at least having a go at beating his man in most situations (unrelated to my earlier comments).

No surprise his assist came from the left side as he was a much better left sided wing forward for Chelsea than a right sided inside forward for United.

243~~~
Eh? The defender is right on him, if he turns there - unless he pulls of some crazy loop-de-loop flick, he's getting tackled. So he - sensibly - holds up the ball, waiting for the overlap from Darmian, but see's how the defender has pulled round anticipating said pass, so retains possession by going back.

Basically, you've picked the wrong GIF to make your point.

244~~~
Two moments of pure quality to fashion our two best chances. Having said that, I'm looking forward to having a natural wide-man out there in Pedro (hopefully), Mata cutting inside constantly really slows down the pace of our attacks.

245~~~
Basically, you've picked the wrong point and thought that it is the one I was making. You're just picking at the crux of the matter when that is not what I am trying to say.

For every one piece of night tight work under pressure to move inside and open up play there are 10 times where he gets it and has to shuffle back and start the attack again.

If it is happening for a a whole match and there are 4/40 good pieces of play, there is probably a pretty glaring reason to either move the player away from there or give him a prod of confidence and allow him to actually take on his man. He looks completely shot of confidence in that regard. Tonight against Villa he was doing the same thing, slowing himself down to face up or back in the defender when under any kind of pressure and not taking his man on, even in the less risky situations that didn't call for hold up play.

246~~~
Only seen the Depay chance so far, that's what I want to see from him more often, It should actually be the standard of an attacking midfielder at United.

247~~~
Should have gotten 2 assists today, even in his first season with us he made some great through balls, when he has runners in front of him, I think theres only 2-3 other players in the Pl who can play such inch perfect through passes

He needs better movement in front of him, like today with our young pacey players, ie januzaj and depay

248~~~
You said, and I quote "there is a whole myriad of dribbling back, not going at his man, holding it up." - I have pointed out why, in the example you showed, he couldn't really do much else but go back - thus it was a decent bit of play from him that helped us retain possession. The point your making is that he does this often and it's poor/not good enough - and have used this GIF to prove your point - the problem is, this all this GIF proves is that Mata makes good decisions relative to whats going on around him.

You have failed to illustrate what Mata has done wrong in the clip you posted, and have continued to mask this by being vague and condescending.

249~~~
Again. That is not the point I am trying to make. Read above - regarding the last point. If your right forward is doing that every time he gets the then I really fail to see how he could be creating chances at all. I mean, there is literally no point in a player who plays in the front line to always get the ball, run backwards and pass it to the CM/Defense. It kind of defeats the point of having a right sided forward.

I know you're not arguing that, but perhaps it will give you some perspective on what I am trying to get across.

250~~~
Well then you have to pick a better scenario to demonstrate your point. If your right forward retains possession in that scenario everytime he gets it in that exact situation, then that's a good thing. Mata however receives the ball on the right in a variety of different ways, sometimes he could do something adventurous - but goes backwards instead in an attempt to regain possession (A clip you wanted to show) - sometimes he really has no other choice but to go backwards and keeps the ball - which is fine (the clip you showed) - and sometimes he gets the ball and plays an incisive / dangerous pass (like today) which is great and he should do more often.

251~~~
Look, forget the clip. You're getting wrapped up in what is happening in the clip and you can't see what I inferred. (about it happening regularly, almost constantly halting attacks up) I'll slice some clips out of the game against Villa today to better demonstrate what I mean.

252~~~
Should have had two assists today from two perfectly weighted through balls, but there were several occasions where he stopped our momentum dead as he can't go past a man, and he still gets hassled off the ball too easily.

253~~~
He received the ball on the left and was 1 on 1 with the full back several times tonight but there's never any danger he's going to threaten their goal from this position. For the sake of the team we need a winger on both sides of the pitch so the opposition don't have the option of doubling up on only one of our wide players.

He needs another run as our #10. Created our only 2 chances tonight with his through balls.

254~~~
Don't want to take anything away from the good things he did today (great passes, should have had 3 assists), but why does he get himself into situations where he'll be muscled off the ball? He's obviously an intelligent player that understands space and movement, so why keep turning into danger where he knows he'll get tackled and knocked off the ball? Make a quick decision, turn if there's space and pass the ball. You don't see Schweinsteiger going shoulder to shoulder all the time when he has the ball for example.

255~~~
Should've ended the match with two assists, still, got dispossessed two or three times today in dangerous situations but we're solid as hell at the back lately so maybe it's worth it.

256~~~
He is going to lose possession during the course of the match that's what you get with a player like him and by now people should come to terms with it. He is our only creative spark in our team. If during any part of the match if look pleasing to the eye Mata is always involved. 
He is the best player in our squad at this point IMO.

257~~~
With solid midfield behind him he should be allowed more freedom in the final third and he has it in him to be what Silva is for city, just need to break those shackles. As our team gels further I feel we are going to see the best of Mata this season.

258~~~
This

259~~~

260~~~
I want us to give him a run of games playing as a 10 because I believe that in our team he is the only one capable of striking the right balance between the need to create and the need to support the striker. Better yet if we manage to bring in Pedro as having Pedro and Depay coming through the wings at pace will stretch teams giving more space to Mata to pick the apart.

261~~~
Really want to see this happen. With Morgan and Bastian/Carrick behind him we don't need a hard working #10. Games like today are tailor-made for him to start as #10.

262~~~
He is best as a 10, simple as that. Van Gaal wont play him there though, at least not now.

263~~~
Honestly, I find this to be a worry.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/6bQUoj6.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/6bQUoj6.jpg"/>

264~~~
As usual, Rooney and Mata quite far back. I think it's Mata's style though, he won't go to the wings but just cut in and pass. I still want him to play centrally if Pedro comes.

265~~~
Shows his quality when he gets those few opportunities to drift inwards, would really love for him to have a spell behind the striker.

266~~~
Would have been my MOTM if he was more careful with possession. Mixed performance but great ball for the goal.

267~~~
Memphis' runs will help him here, whether he's a 10 or a RW.

268~~~
You're thinking about this too simplistically. Mata doesn't take on a man because he would most likely waste possession. Most players would do that. Even Young, Januzaj and Memphis. Mata makes the same runs as they do when the opportunity arrives, cutting inside with the ball. Why would you expect a winger to beat his man down the flank only to show himself on his weaker foot. That's not how the team is set up.

Rooney has been the biggest weak link in our attack these two games. He's offered very little. He's not keeping the CBs busy by being in their face or making runs. He's not being dangerous on the ball. He's playing a bit like Falcao without the balance problems.

I agree that he needs a run at #10 but I don't think he will simply because he's better than our other players in the wing back position. The left backs don't know what to do with him when they aren't already marking him when he gets the ball.

269~~~
You're basically saying our right forward doesn't try to create chances and use his ability because he might give away the ball? If this is the case then there is absolutely no point in playing him on the right hand side.
He had a run at #10 last season and he showed that he was woefully off the pace and lacked the incisiveness to link up play with midfield. Basically, to be blunt it is pretty obvious his legs are gone and he's adopted a<i> cant win, don't try </i>mentality and for what it is worth Van Gaal is happy to let one of his wing players be nothing more than a deep ball recycler and offer next to nothing up front.

I don't know, but that doesn't really sit well for me. All the shit Rooney is getting and he in my eyes is basically playing the 9 and the right wing forward role all on his own. But that is just my opinion of course.

270~~~
You are really saying that Rooney playing the right wing role and #9 all by himself. For the last 2 games Rooney has not been able to play his primary role to any good affect.

Forget about 2 roles.

271~~~
No I wasn't saying that at all. Not trying to dribble past a player doesn't mean he doesn't create chances. He created more chances than anyone in that game.

Mata got a run in a 3-5-2 system with two forwards that didn't play well together or well overall. The whole team was a mess.

Rooney's getting flack because he's been our poorest attacking player. Your opinion is that he's playing forward and right wing? How do you figure? He's not close to playing like a winger. He's been fairly static and lackluster.

272~~~
Yeah that is a fair point. I should have mentioned it.
Basically, he's getting no support on the right hand side at all. In both games Mata's main position was nearer to the half way line than the box. Right now, Rooney is operating as a player who plays between the CB's and creates space for his wide players. One wide player on the right is not getting the ball and moving into the space created, the other is running into the corner and then turning out to try and play a ball across goal.

When Mata is not forward, Rooney's go to move is to move out to the right hand side to get free and get on the ball. If you look at Rooney's map he has a lot of touches on the right hand side. That is pretty much how he's been playing in the last two games. Forgetting the worlds glowing prejudice against Rooney, he's being deployed in this role. Mata is being deployed in the right forward role and his job is to get the ball, face up and either come inside or link up his fullback down the right hand side.

He pretty clearly isn't doing any of those at all. His little piece of excellent play came from being broken on the left hand side and spotting a run from Adnan (that he is never in a position to spot when playing on the left inside out with his back to goal and space) and played the ball in.

Personally, he's always been a left sided forward or wing forward playing face up in my view and this right forward role isn't working. He's lost a lot of confidence in his ability to put pressure on his fullback and that is almost the entire premise of how the front three operate. (well, Juan's part anyway) It is really causing a mess that he is being stuck playing so deep.

Just looking at the stats;
Mata to Rooney, 6 passes.
Depay to Rooney, 7 passes.

4 of those Mata passes were out to the right wing where Rooney received.
1 of the passes from Depay to Rooney was only out to the wing where he received.

There is something in this Juan Mata role that isn't right. I didn't mean to bring Rooney into it specifically considering the current hate train going on but it is more about how the front three synergize and there is absolutely no chemistry between any of them at all. Mata in my opinion the worst of them.

273~~~
That's the thing. He isn't operating between the CB's. He's not causing them problems. He's supposed to do that but he isn't. Mata is doing his job. He's covering at the back, he's creating chances. He distributes the ball well and he actually tries through balls. I'm not sure you understand at all what his job his. You can't look at how Young plays on the left and think that's what Mata is supposed to do. Thank feck he isn't like Young. Mata is different. He's covering a position that isn't normally his and he's doing a better job of it than those who actually make a living of playing there.

274~~~
I've criticised him a fair bit lately but will always give credit where credit is due and he was by far our best attacker today. Was nice to finally see some neat through balls by the little fella, something which the lack of recently was one of the main reasons I gave him flack. This is what he should be doing on a consistent basis and I don't care if that comes at the cost of losing the ball a bit more which he was also guilty of today. Actually love to see players prove me wrong(in a good way). As for Rooney..

275~~~
I really don't understand why Mata is played out wide. Just doesn't have the pace to be a wide player. Different story as a No10 though.

276~~~
Some of his passing yesterday was exquisite. I love watching him play.

277~~~
Provide the only two moments of quality but he was also guilty of giving the ball away too often and in bad areas and defensively he was poor and left darmian exposed.

278~~~
How come he isn't getting any praise for his defending?

It's just two games though, but he has won lot of balls for a "luxury" player people like to call him. I've noticed he has won lot of balls during these two games, and checked the stats, he is fifth in the team by tackles made(both Smalling and Blind ahead of him are on 2.5 per game, same as Mata, so you could say he is actually third). Also third in the team by interceptions made, 3 per game, only Schneiderlin and Smalling are ahead of him there.

Again, I know it's just two games, but he was actually very good defensively in pretty much entire second half of last season too, ever since van Gaal moved him wide. Considering how much slack he got for that since he arrived at United he definitely deserves praise for improving in that department.

279~~~
Even Messi would struggle assisting Rooney as a number 10. He is hopeless. Until we get a proper striker in I think our attackers are going to struggle creating chances.

280~~~
Eventually I hope he plays a run of games in the middle as he is less of a threat out wide. Talented player that he is.

281~~~
Missing the point in my opinion - losing possession because you're trying an ambitious through ball or dribble near the opponent's box is acceptable, even desirable in our cautious setup. Losing possession quite deep because you're turning into trouble and getting muscled off the ball is dangerous, and Mata's guilty of that far too often for someone of his intelligence and technique.

282~~~
Poor game in general yesterday, but with those two passes he showed what he can offer as a creative 10 in this system.He has so much more to offer in the middle, particularily with rapid wingers like Depay ( and hopefully Pedro) finally in the team.

283~~~
Love Mata - why don't we give him a slightly free-er role behind the striker (fighting it out with Rooney) ala Silva at City....?

284~~~
I don't get why people have such an issue with it given he's spent over half his club career out wide and most of his international career there. It's not just some role this nutjob van Gaal has inexplicably forced him into.

285~~~
We will be so lethal if we play Hernandez instead of Rooney, Mata behind him, Pedro on the right if we get him and Memphis on the left.

286~~~
I think you have to put it in context with the fact as United we have always played with blistering pace on the flanks, players that could drive at a fullback and go past them. Mata basically goes backwards or square from his starting position and leaves the shape of the team lopsided when he drifts to the center where he needs to be to do most of his best work anyway, so that is why many want him to simply start centrally to begin with and give him pacey runners on both wings to hit with his passing.

287~~~
He'd do a lot of this if he was played centrally too.
A good chunk of playing as a 10 is picking up the ball at a 90 degree angle, or even with your back to goal.
You then need strength and dribbling to turn your man or shield the ball and hold it. He lacks that.

I still don't see how he's better suited to play centrally. If anything, playing wide actually allows him more space and reduces the tightness of the marking and general congestion.

He's not really perfectly suited to either role, in my opinion. But he's definitely not suited to a central role any more than a wide role.

288~~~
Like that David Beckham?

Mata is fine where he is playing, he has license to drift in whenever he feels like it and usually does.

289~~~
In truth you sum up why he wouldn't be a first choice player for me at all.

290~~~
For me, the essential thing when Mata plays on the right is that Darmian bombs forward more than he has done so far. I like Darmian but he needs to be a bit more adventurous. With Mata constantly cutting inside, we need an overlapping right-back to offer an outlet and keep the left-back occupied like Valencia did well last year.

291~~~
Beckham was certainly much quicker and stronger than Mata and I think the fact he was one of the best crossers in the game shows he had no problem getting around his fullback and delivering. 

Where he is playing means our shape constantly ends up lopsided and we have 3 players all occupying the same space centrally.

292~~~
Just because we've traditionally often played with pacy wingers doesn't mean we necessarily have to do so with Mata, though. I do think there's plenty of merit in potentially playing him centrally, but if we give him a wide role with plenty of freedom to drift in then he's equally as capable of performing there.

293~~~
I don't think he has to play as a 10 because then he would be easily outmuscled and man marked. When he starts on the right and has the freedom to drift, he is at his best. He can find more space and time to make dangerous pace. Since he hasn't got great strength to say the least nor dribbling skills, playing him in the middle would render him almost useless. Let him start on the right but give him license to roam free, a bit like Messi currently does for Barca.

294~~~
To be fair, even though he'd be marked heavily and potentially outmuscled, opposition teams doing so to the extent where he's nullified would probably free up space for the likes of Depay and Januzaj to pose a threat of their own. It's handy for a central player to have plenty of strength, but I don't think it's completely essential if they have enough ability.

I agree though that Mata can have plenty to offer when he's drifting in from out wide.

295~~~
Or Silva and Modric, for most of their PL careers.

296~~~
One of our biggest issues has been a lack of pace in attack, basically filling a position usually used for speedy players to play another AM who will end up occupying the same space as our #10 and #9 most of time isn't a good way to balance a team's attack.

297~~~
Modric? He played as a CM for most of his career, he only started out at Spurs on the wing until he got used to the league.

298~~~
Yeah, there are many examples like that. Mata needs to be more courageous with his passing and he'll be fine.

299~~~
I guess we saw a bit of evidence of this last night. His excellent pass for Januzaj coming from the left hand side.

300~~~
You can have a pacy player on one wing though, while having a more skill based one who drifts inside on the other wing.

301~~~
Beckham never needed to get around his fullback, which is kind of what made him so good. He could deliver a deadly cross from anywhere.

At times I think It really does help teams like Chelsea/City not having to think about their traditional ways.

302~~~
To me that just makes the team lopsided, ideally you have pace on both wings, especially since we have none centrally, this is where I expect LvG hoped Di Maria would advance us and how I imagine he is envisioning Pedro will spruce up our attack. If you have two runners in the wide forward roles then you give targets other than Rooney for the midfield and #10 to try and thread in, one of Mata's best assets.

303~~~
More than anything else our biggest issue has been dwelling on the ball and hesitancy to play a forward/dangerous pass. Pace does help a lot no doubt and I'm not saying you're wrong but with quicker passing it can be less of an issue.

304~~~
Becks was very accurate from anywhere inside the opposition half that is true, and he was very clever at getting a yard of space to make his delivery.

Maybe, but even at a club like Chelsea they currently employ the logical system of pace on the flanks and the slower, passing hub centrally.

305~~~
I said PL careers. The majority of which he played out wide.

306~~~
The biggest difference with him and those players is that they're excellent ball retainers, with their agility and deft feet. Mata doesn't really have that. He's fine there for now but I'm not sure he'll keep a place should we sign Pedro.

307~~~
That ball retention will be even more needed if he were to play more centrally, he'd face CBs and DMs. He would need to be even better.

308~~~
We do dither on the ball without a doubt, and I mentioned in another thread that it may be down to LvG's obsession with ball retention that is causing this ultra cautious approach of moves stopping dead to avoid playing a risky ball. However I just think if we had some genuine pace on those wide areas then Mata would have two great targets to aim for if he was picking the ball up centrally, where too often we have so little movement ahead of whoever has the ball. Last night people thought Memphis was poor and he certainly wasn't great, but 3 times he made good runs that gave Mata and Januzaj a target to hit. With Rooney having no pace and constantly dropping deep I think we need to look to the flanks to provide the runs in behind. 

I think the issue with Mata is he is so easily hustled off the ball that LvG doesn't want to risk him centrally and I can understand that as well, it's a catch 22.

309~~~
I don't think he did mate, I'll drag <a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a> in here to see, but to my recollection Modric only played wide for about a season or so.

310~~~
Bit in bold: a lot of people say this, and I understand where they're coming from, but I dont think that adding pace would have the effect that people assume. No amount of pace makes up for the fact that - as he's shown - Mata has to release the ball quickly, when under pressure... or he loses it.

At least if he drops deep he has time and space. But if he sits in the pocket where a 10 can usually pick out runs consistently, then he'd struggle without that time and space.

Basically, no amount of pace in wide areas (in a suffocating possession system) can make up for the fact that your no.10 can't hold the ball long enough to pick out the passes.

Look at the best no.10s (in possession teams) none of them are just picking passes for fun without sitting on the ball.
It just doesn't work like that. He'd get bullied, and still struggle to hold the ball for long enough to pick out the runs. Pace or no pace.

It's not like there's acres of space to pass into and to really use the pace. If there was, then, yes, you could get away with literally playing first time passes all game, and knocking it round the corner etc. without sitting on the ball first.

311~~~
I think Mata should keep his place for now but he it seems he wants a central role and can be much more effective there imo. If Pedro or a more natural winger is signed he may well be dropped, the formation is more a 4-2-3-1 with the two holding midfielders than a 4-3-3 but that could be LvG not having many options for a right winger, if the boss does switch to a 4-3-3 then Mata's position/selection could come under threat as he doesn't seem very keen in carrying out his defensive duties as witnessed yesterday when Villa attacked down their left yesterday and Darmian got caught out of position. I like Mata, he's one of the more creative players United have but it's hard to find the perfect position for him although I'm sure he'd like to play second striker/in the hole whichever you prefer!

312~~~
Can't argue with any of this, I'm just trying to look at the positive side of the possibilities in the risk/reward dynamic of starting him centrally and how we might help him be more effective there. Basically as I said in my other response he would not be a starter for me, he loses our shape and stalls our play when playing on the right, and despite his eye for a pass all the points you make about his physical limitations centrally are on point and why I suspect LvG seems to want to start anyone but him there.

313~~~
I do get the reservations people have over Mata playing as a #10.

However, do we actually have any better #10's at the club? He doesn't need to be perfect to be better than the rest.

I know a lot of people would like to see Herrera there (even though it isn't really his best position either) but he doesn't really provide enough end product given we'll probably be relying on our #10 to support Rooney in a big way.

After that it's just the likes of Depay, Januzaj, Fellaini, Young or Rooney. Not awe inspiring options.

We know Mata provides a lot of end product and we know he has previously been brilliant as a #10 (albeit at a different club with a different style). Surely that makes him a better choice than those other players? It's not like we want the team to be built around him, just give him a run of games in what is supposed to be his best position and see how he does.

314~~~
I could be wrong. He was at Spurs 4 years and I thought he only played CM in his final season. Interestingly, wiki says he "did a Dave" and didn't play in Spurs opening games of that season because he was intent on joining Madrid.

315~~~
I wanted to write something similar but your post is perfect. Aston Villa, yesterday, were full of very quick players and yet they didn't cause that much trouble. Pace is a good tool but you need to have a good and quick passer to exploit it.

316~~~
Context is important though. He was brilliant in a free role, in a Chelsea side that was under transition. He didn't need to track back and was always ready for the counter. The Chelsea side he starred in was awful. As a #10 or second striker, whatever you want to call it, he needs to occupy congested areas and unfortunately that's not in his skill-set. He's incredibly easy to mark out a game. All you have to do is pressure him from behind and he'll run back towards his own half, giving the opposition lots of time to organise their defensive shape. We have already given him a run as a #10 and that didn't go too well. He's played well on the right and I don't see any reason why his position should be changed.

317~~~
Very good performance from him yesterday. He was nonexistent in the first game but he definitely made his presence felt against Villa. He affects the game in a good way when he is all over and swap positions with the other attacking mids. His assist to Januzaj was just a gorgeous pass as well. If we can score at least 2 goals a month that would go a long way in helping our team and his own confidence.

318~~~
Are you saying that he is not a good and quick passer? Because I am not sure I agree with that. I think personally he's just being scared out of doing anything dangerous until the opportunity really presents itself as wide open. Much like the two fantastic passes last night. Because he doesn't want to be dropped, whenever there is movement around him he almost always opts for a safe option (see below two players made the run for him to ignore).

Personally I believe he knows his own legs are gone. I think if we geared his confidence toward sitting in the pocket and playing the 10 role without having to deal with defending to much, basically playing off the ball retrieval players with an idea to get the ball forward. I think this may work well for Mata personally. We need him just in advance of the opposition midfield every time we win the ball to get a pass, touch on it, turn and play someone in. I noticed that Januzaj or Depay never really got back far enough to link up play and were always getting the ball so close to Rooney as to not be very creative.

Here is another example of his tendancy to not try a pass and slow down the attack. He even has to apologize to Morgan who has made a great run after some fortuitous control and dart to make the outlet. Basically this is one of the biggest things that is really clogging our system. (It isn't just Mata though to be fair)

319~~~
He played in Dinamo wide, as a LM in 4-4-2 formation.

320~~~
Mata has done great on the right side. I'm not getting many of the complaints, since he has played in that role he has been one of our better and most consistent performers.

321~~~
Sorry to disappoint your effort but that's what I meant at all <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

322~~~
Where's the blog <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

323~~~
Nah, I wasn't sure if you did mean that. That is why I asked - I was going to say my piece anyway so no harm done!

324~~~
Yeah, it was a good post anyway and I agree with you. Having pace in attack is always a welcome bonus but quick and dangerous passing is more important, just like Mata showed for his assist and his great pass to Adnan. I feel there is much more to exploit from the current set of players before looking for improvements.

325~~~
I know it's early in the season, but where are all the people who were claiming he's uncreative last season? We're only 3 games in and he's created god knows how many chances.

326~~~
Should be playing as a ten and not out on the wing.

327~~~
To be fair every person on the planet bar one knows this. The one happens to be the manager.

328~~~
Yes I know, it's blatantly obvious.

329~~~
Even out wide he'll be an assist machine this season if we keep playing him.

Wouldn't be at all surprised if he gets dropped for Pedro though, which is annoying.

330~~~
Let's just hope we get to see him behind Rooney then with Depay and Pedro on the wings.

331~~~
Should push him central for a open game.

332~~~
I just don't understand why he's refusing to play Mata in the middle. He's finally put Memphis on the left and he's been absolutely brilliant, but now Januzaj is in the middle. Mata is a great passer and a very nifty player, but doesn't have the pace to be as effective on the right.

It'd just feel a lot more natural having Memphis on the left, Mata in the middle and Young/Januzaj/Pedro? on the right.

333~~~
He had a terrible second half, just disappeared.

334~~~
He was missing 2nd half. Went too safe.

335~~~
He is getting quite sloppy, but he does have some very good passes in his locker. We need it at the moment.

336~~~
Seems to escape a fair bit of criticism on here, compared to a few others.

337~~~
Very sloppy, again.

338~~~
Completely muscled out the game.. if we sign Pedro, he could face being on the bench.

339~~~
Eh? He was feckin grand in that second half. Tried plenty of incisive passes, some of which were exquisite.

340~~~
I thought he was good <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Lots of good incisive passing from him.

341~~~
I really really hope we go Memphis-Mata-Pedro. Will be superb.

342~~~
We badly need a right winger Mata is not suited to play on the wing in this system.

343~~~
He needs to go past 65 players a game and have 100% passing rate. 
I really don't understand some people, he was good tonight.

344~~~
Aye, we were all waxing lyrical about him in our section. There were two passes he hit in a row, one to Darmian and one to Bastian that were glorious balls.

345~~~
Sloppy and also slow. Not just his running, but also until he finally plays around

346~~~
Fan favourite. Look at the hyperbole created above to deflect that.

347~~~
Stopped our attacks going forward by cutting back and slowing the game down. He really isn't a winger. Should we get Pedro he could play in the hole with Rooney up front. Got to say disappointed in his performance but he's not a winger at all.

348~~~
Many will disagree but I think he was good.

349~~~
Number of good passes to Darmian, had that superb through ball to januzaj in the 1st half, that ball to BFS. Always kept play moving along and was much more aggressive in his passing today. 

I think he'll excel if moved to the middle with Memphis and pedro on either side.

350~~~
Can't believe bloody Januzaj gets games over Mata in the middle. Just staggering management

351~~~
Even that's not good enough if each and every pass doesn't rip the opposition apart and lead to a goal.

352~~~
Enjoy the win lads. He was ok

353~~~
Boggles the mind.

354~~~
He would be unreal if he had pace.

355~~~
Yeah I rate Mata fwiw, but not so much on the wing. He offered very little, the odd pass or 2 aside and defensively he was also quite weak. 

i personally thought it was a 'meh' performance. Surprised with Januzaj and depay on the field, he didn't interchange more centrally on occasion. Seemed stuck out wide.

356~~~
Anonymous again.
Escapes a lot of criticism on here because most of the Cafs get erections over his selfies and blogs.

357~~~
People expect a winger's performance from him, that's not gonna happen. His job is to get involved in the middle, keep the ball moving  (which at times means a safe pass) and try to pick players in good positions when possible,  he's had some glorious through balls already this season and his touch is superior to anyone else on the team. LvG must love him and rightly so.

358~~~
meh out wide whatsa mata with him in the 10. ouch!

359~~~
I don’t like him as a winger, he was much better last year when he was cutting inside and playing as second striker, that’s his natural game. Back then, he had Young on the other side keeping the width. It seems now Memphis will be the one cutting in, so Pedro on the right makes sense.

Also, when he drifts inside, Darmian is completely isolated on the right, and his role is very restricted- he only attacks when Mata is also on the right wing.

We will be much better side with Pedro instead of him on the right. Not sure what’s going to happen with him as clearly van Gaal doesn’t want him centrally.

360~~~
Don't think he was bad just didn't have that great a game. Would like to see him given a chance playing #10 if Pedro joins.

361~~~
Thought he was pretty anonymous. Not a bad game, just not anything overly good. I can see him being benched for Pedro though.

362~~~
Thought he was fine today. Contributed well but I guess he faded as the game went on.

Wonder why people expect him to play as our #10 if/when Pedro comes in. If he's not playing there now, why would that change with the addition of another attacker?

363~~~
Just saw some stats that say he attempted more passes then any of our attackers on the pitch, also completed more then any of them. Off the top of my head - in the second half (I thought he was average in the first, bar an excellent through-ball to Januzaj, which he should have done better from) - I can remember several occasions where he released Darmian down the right to put in a free cross, once where he put in Shaw (for the Memphis chance), twice doing good work for Bastian to have a shot, and also whipping in a great corner that he should have scored from, on top of some good quick corners with Memphis, as well as generally having some very good interplay around the box with Rooney/Depay/Schweinsteiger... but yeah, apart from all that he was annoymous, or missing, or sloppy, or not adventurous... or something.

364~~~
Class today as he was vs Villa. He's looking so much more creative with Memphis and januzaj making runs in behind as I always suspected he would, because before there was nobody really running in behind. Darmian and him are building a nice understanding as well.

365~~~
As others have been saying, get him in that 10 position, and let him rotate with Herrera and Fellaini. Depay and Pedro on the wings.

366~~~
Typical game of Mata.  He has moments where you can see why you want him in your side.  Then he goes for ages without doing anything.  Doesn't work hard enough defensively.  Slows our attack down.  I can understand why Mourinho had no problems selling him to us.

367~~~
I thought he played well. I've said in the post match thread he can drift in and out, he's not one to control a game's rhythm, but with our centre midfield now that's not necessarily a real issue for me. Given our struggles with creativity in the league he's the sort of player I'm fine with seeing.

Still would love to see him at 10 though, or on the field with Ander for a while.

368~~~
Very good again, doing his job perfectly.

369~~~
Last season he was very very efficient with his possession however he was not very creative and was criticized for not attempting riskier passes. This season so far he's not quite as efficient in possession, lost the ball a bit more than we're used to seeing him (still easily one of our best ball retainers) but he's attempting the riskier passes now  and has created more chances than anyone so far. He's put both Januzaj and Depay on a one-on-one with the keeper with Silva-like passes  and Rooney too that he strayed just offside on the right. He was criticized for not attempting these kind of passes last season.

370~~~
He was ok, similar to how he often is, some nice touches and passes, but out muscled easily and often stops our attacks due to not being able to turn a defender and accelerate.

371~~~
Rooney

Depay ------Mata -----Pedro

I think this will work for us, with Januzaj and Young being an alternative to Depay and Pedro and Big man Fellaini an option for Mata. Then again we can play Januzaj if required as a no.10 too. 

Hope LVG tries this along with 

Herrera -------- Schneiderlin
        Schweinsteiger

behind that top 4

372~~~
People will be getting such a shock if/when he eventually plays centrally and barely looks any better.
Definitely better suited to the wing, even if he has his limitations there.

373~~~
TBH not a fan of the either formations. I like Mata on the right as it allows him a free role and keeps him away from a congested middle. And the fact that he has Darmian behind him helps. 

For the second I don't think the forwards and wingers will receive good service with that lineup. Although I can see LvG playing variations of that in big games.

374~~~
I agree with him only being OK for this game. If you look at the price tag he came with he should have done better. His performance is from a player costing like 15m rather than 46m. Have to shape up to be honest.

375~~~
What game did you watch? He slowed us down constantly! Looks hamstrung playing that position without Herrera to link up. A waste of a talent unless played as a 10. If he doesn't play right wing again then that is fine by me!

376~~~
Yeah, spot on.

I like this version of Mata a lot more. It's been very noticeable in the last 2 games that he's been actively trying to create more chances rather than just going with the flow like he did for a lot of the last season. As for him going backwards a lot, I'm not too bothered by that. He hasn't got the strength to hold up the play and so he prefers to keep the ball. As long as he can keep playing these through balls...The lack of strength will be even more of an issue if he was playing as a #10 so I'd say he's fine as it is. He ends up drifting inside in any case.

Just hope we don't sign Pedro. Mata is quite easily the better player.

377~~~
I agree. I dont think he had a great game and slowed us down too often. I can see him being benched if we buy Pedro

378~~~
The second half yesterday was the quickest football we've played all season, across the entire pitch, by a country mile, how on earth do people think he slowed us down?!

Also, yesterday was clearly the most attacking Darmian has been for us and he was a threat down that right hand-side... again particularly in that second half. Do people think this was some sort of magic coincedence? Mata was constantly feeding him on the overlap.

379~~~
Still don't think he was a good investment (considering the then-record price). Buy Pedro, return Mata for a refund.

380~~~
Not sure what he adds being stuck out wide, Would much rather see him at #10 where he can pick up more of the ball. If we do eventually sign Pedro you would think that his wing position will be the one that is the one up for grabs, so that could see Mata out of the team.

381~~~
26 goals and assists in 45 starts - mostly whilst being played out of positions, when we've been a bit rubbish.

God this place is weird sometimes.

382~~~
Van gaal has already said he prefers 2 strikers in that position so that aint happeniny

383~~~
100%

384~~~
He has a glaring lack of pace despite being a wizard with the ball....he's a big asset but might find himself on the bench if van gaal signs more forwards with pace but mata will play a big role this season and is currently our only true playmaker

385~~~
“lies, damned lies and statistics”: Stats can be used to prove anything.

386~~~
In the halls of statistics, it doesn't get more important then... you know... goals.

387~~~
He'll never play that #10 role, he just doesn't suit the criteria for that role LVG requires.

388~~~
Our #10 spot is up for grabs. Mata there flanked by pedro and Memphis is much better than Mata out wide with januzaj or Fellaini as the #10.

389~~~
The goals stat only tells you the number of times a person had the last touch. Do you not find YouTube compilations that focus on goals by midfielders (and defenders) rather pointless? I'd rather see their other abilities - passing range/strength/tackling/defensive contributions/aerial prowess/pace/strength of character/leadership/dribbling ability/positional awareness/dead-ball ability.

390~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That is brilliant.

391~~~
That's deep man.

392~~~
I think if we do get Pedro he'll certainly be given the chance in the #10 role. It'd be daft not to to be honest. When you look, we don't really have a player at the moment that can play wide right which is why Mata finds himself there I feel. And it's not his best position but he's consistently shown his quality there, I can only imagine he'd be more dangerous more centrally with runners around him.

393~~~
Possibly. Just my opinion I know, but I don't rate him so highly and predict he'll be on the periphery soon, and gone within a couple of years.

394~~~
What? He didn't slow us down at all, we played probably our quickest football in a long time and he created loads of chances for us. Played plenty of through balls and picked out great passes all game long, and held on to the ball well when needed. Without a doubt was one of our best players. 

In fact, over the first 3 games he has been one of our best players. He has played great forward passes and looked very creative actually with forward runners to pick out. Some people can't see that though because they have a predetermined notion that they don't want to see him out wide so he cant possibly do well, when in reality he has been doing really well there.

395~~~
The amount of posts including the word 'Pedro' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

396~~~
Yeah, hilarious.

397~~~
I had this one down as a cert for ages <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

398~~~
Unreal online meltdown today <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

399~~~
I obviously disagree with you (just seen your tag line pmsl in this case) but I really don't think he's great at this position and I've seen all 3 games. Just my opinion id prefer Valencia or Young in this position.

400~~~
Fair enough... And yeah, I got the tagline because I was one of the "scouts" on here for like half a year but only handed out I think 1 like and didn't promote anyone <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Deserved it tbf

401~~~
When Mata is in the game, he oozes of class and he is great at creating chances for our team;however, he also has the ability to go missing from games and not have an impact on what is going on.

402~~~
Thought he was our best attacking player by far today, really think if he had herrera with him, they could have nicked us a win, their understanding is one of the best between players in the PL

403~~~
Easily our best player today.

404~~~
He was great, everytime he was on the ball, he made the right decision and created chances. This is what the Chelsea Mata looked like.

Dont want him taking our free kicks, he has good accuracy but no power. Only close range ones, should be his.

405~~~
Yup, he was excellent. Very good game from him.

406~~~
Was very very good today. Should've hit the target off Rooney's cross, but was very incisive.

407~~~
I am often critical of Mata but I thought he was by far our best attacker today, looked sharper and stronger than usual and had all the ideas just no one to finish them off.

408~~~
Smart player but he's too limited to be a top player

409~~~
Really? I wasn't impressed. He cut inside at every single opportunity and often did nothing with it - most of the time it was from really deep positions. No wonder Darmian looked so knackered. 

He was the best of the front four but wasn't hard.

410~~~
He was good today, our best player.

411~~~
He is taking more and more responsibility and I like that. He really should work out a little to protect the ball better, he gets dispossessed too easily at times.

412~~~
He's attempting riskier passes now and I don't think Silva or Ozil could have done any better.

413~~~
Seriously needs to give more through balls, he has the ability to do it but why is he holding back? There were several moments in which Depay could have exploited the space between Mbemba and the right CB.

414~~~
Magnificent today. More of this with better finishing please.

415~~~
Mata was really good today. He created 5 chances today. However, I thought he could have done a better job in terms of finishing.

416~~~
Impressed me today. Got on the ball a lot and was more adventurous with his passing. Comfortably our best attacking player.

Also did anyone think he was a lot more central than usual today?

417~~~
When he was playing more centrally in the first half he was fecking brilliant. I really wish Van Gaal would just try him out there for once.

418~~~
Class again today. Started the season in very good form and is looking more and more creative. A shame we are so toothless up front if Memphis isn't on his game. But Mata was brilliant again

419~~~
Glad to see people appreciated his effort today. Work his socks off, always looked to play forward, most of our chances today he had an involvement again. Cant believe some of the muppets claiming he was bad in the match day thread.

420~~~
You say he cut inside all the time like you'd expect him to do anything else. What else is a false winger going to do?

421~~~
Very good today. I don't know why some people are complaining about his performance.

422~~~
You're forgetting he played brilliantly the last 30 minutes because he on the tip of a midfield triangle.

            Mata
Schneiderlin Carrick

That was how it was. In the first half, he was out on the wings and contributed nothing offensively.

It's obvious he's best either playing as a number 10 or on the tip of the triangle in midfield.

Mata in the number 10, Young on the right and Memphis on the left is the best formation.

423~~~
We need more movement in front of him and to get him off that wing.

424~~~
Had 5 key passes apparently, and has generally been creating a lot more. Hes perfectly fine on the right IMO. People will complain all the time though just because they want him to be in the middle so will make shit up to suit the argument

425~~~
I agree with this.  By no means bad against Newcastle, but does not offer enough of an all around game.  I can certainly see why he plays as he has the ability to pick a killer pass, but when a team wants to park the bus and close the spaces I find Mata not very useful.  Compare his work rate defensively to someone like Ayoze who sprinted from one side of the pitch to the other to defend heroically.  If we expect to win anything we need more players who play all facets of the game.

426~~~
He had a good game going forward but he looked half asleep at times. He needs to be brought in off that right wing permanently because he neuters Darmian and leaves the flank open. Play him in the middle where he causes the most damage.

427~~~
He is totally wasted as a winger everyone saying he was brilliant today but for the first 60 minutes when he played out wide he did nothing of note it was only after he took a more central position he started to have any influence on the game he needs to play centrally and we desperately need a new right winger.

428~~~
He has flashes of quality that I'd love to see him do more by staying central, but our game is simply hindered by not having pace on the right.

429~~~
ran the show, his best game of the season

430~~~
If we aren't going to play him centrally where he can best utilize his great skills we should just get sell him. He's wasting his potential on the wing. I'm tired of seeing him being played out of week in, week out. To be brutally honest I don't know how the idea of playing him out wide and having Januzaj, even Depay in the first two games, in the middle makes zero sense from van Gaal when both Januzaj and Depay are more suited to playing on the wing.

Hoping for a change.. when he's working more centrally he's brilliant.

431~~~
The problem is that we don't have a quality right winger so Mata is seen as the best choice of the current players.

432~~~
What else do you expect him to do? 

Really incredible that someone can watch that game and say he did nothing. 

He links beautifully with Darmian and the partnership will get better as the play more. Releases him so many times.

433~~~
Ran the show? Well, it was a flop show. Needs to do orchestrate better shows.

Did anyone else think: Man, we could have done with Pedro instead of Mata here. Darmian and another wide player with pace could cause havoc.

434~~~
I thought he was good today but wouldn't go OTT he saw a lot of the ball and for for ran down quite a few blind alleys as well. One thing that I don't understand and can only assume comes from Van Gaal is how often Mata will have the ball on the right and Darmian will make the run on the outside yet he never(rarely at least)uses him or plays him in.

435~~~
Maybe keep <i>some </i>width and double up against Haidara? Ayoze tracked backed well and Darmian was constantly ganged up on with no support from Mata. Just because he's a second striker playing on the right doesn't mean he gets to shirk all winger responsibilities.

436~~~
We must have been watching different games then. Darmian was constantly checking his runs in case Mata left him exposed, and frequently ran at down that side.

437~~~
Newcastle barely threatened us and Mata was constantly working defensively. If there is any game where he should shirk some defensive responsibility to attack more, it was today. 

Btw, he wasn't playing as a second striker at all. It's a bizarre thing to say about the guy running the game for us. Being a winger doesn't mean hugging the touchline and banging crosses in.

438~~~
You are talking about the defensive aspect of the partnership while I am talking about the attacking aspect of it. Darmian did check his runs at times but every full back that plays with a winger that cuts in has to do that. Nothing unique about Mata in that.

439~~~
He has to be on the team. He's the only player who might have a clue of what to do in attack.

440~~~
He wasn't good today Mata but was still better than Rooney, Januzaj and Memphes

441~~~
Did some great things today, did some awful things. So meh.

442~~~

443~~~
He was very good today, easily our best attacking player.

444~~~
My man of the match today.

445~~~

446~~~
Love that, I'm sure those numbers will be sent to Ogddn and he'll still find some way to blame everyone but Rooney.

447~~~
Agree.

448~~~
Problem of course is, we haven't got one striker nevermind two.

449~~~
Not only is Ogden clueless at transfer news, he is also clueless at football analysis.

450~~~
Our only player who actually wanted to make things happen in the second half.

451~~~
Genuinely have to wonder what people watch when they say Mata is man of the match?  

Yet again he failed to move the ball quick enough, moved way too far apart from Both Darmien & Rooney... Leaving hardly any space for either to operate. For someone of his apparent quality you want a LOT more than his current performances. 

Agree with Ogden, whilst I like him he's a luxury player that isn't someone who does well when a teams needs something extra.

452~~~
That doesn't make sense - Mata's movement inside gave Darmian a shit load of room on several occasions today... moving away from your full back will generally give them loads more space to operate in.

He was also the only person moving with the ball with any real purpose in the second half - he was actually trying incisive passing, going for worthwhile 1-2's, and was doing a good job of creating space with clever movement.

453~~~
Thought he did well from what I saw today. Mata is not the problem imho. 

RE: Ogden and his silly quote - why is it that everyone must be sacrificed for Rooney? It's always what he needs. I know he's British but this is just crazy the way these so called journalists are so biased. If he was doing something worthwhile then yes we would set up to make things happen for him. But he's not doing that, so why should the rest of the team be sacrificed just to give him what he wants? Pisses me off.

454~~~
He leave Darmian exposed defensively too often too. Cracking player but a luxury one nonetheless.

455~~~
Have to agree. Baffled at the widespread praise. All of Depay, Januzaj and Rooney looked more dangerous and all of them are are getting hell of a lot more stick on their threads. I can only assume it's his style of of play which is easy on the eye that masks how ineffective he can be.

456~~~
Easily. 

Was amazed to see Shaw win it once I voted.

457~~~
Show how fecking clueless and biased odgen is.

458~~~
You assume wrong. It's so typical to downplay a player like Mata by saying it's his style being easy on the eye that makes posters rate a performance.

459~~~
So we should build a team around Rooney? He isn't good enough anymore to warrant that.

460~~~
Was good today but I feel he has much more to offer, which is limiting his game by (mainly) staying that wide. He drifted in a few times to the middle, causing them problems.

If we moved him into the middle, with a Reus/Griezzman type pacey goalscorer to the wing, I believe we'd get the best out of him.

461~~~
He doesn't really stay out wide at all, he has a lot of freedom to move. Was on the left at times in the game. I do agree with the premise of your post though. If we are going with 2 solid CMs, Mata should be the #10 with Memphis and a top attacker on the right. We don't have unfortunately but januzaj can work there.

462~~~
I'm surprised to see people thought he was one of our best players against Newcastle, I think he's probably been the main reason we've been so poor offensively this season actually (and I love Mata as a player). He's incredibly slow, and I'm not talking about pace, I'm talking about ball retention and passing it. People complain about our slow tempo, but he's the main reason why. He doesn't misplace many passes, definitely, but I feel he's killing any kind of pace that could go into our attacks. It's no tragedy, either this is what VG wants and fair enough, and if it isn't, I'm sure Juan can be instructed to play with a bit more directness and speed.

463~~~
It's becoming annoying how woeful he is on his weaker side

464~~~
I thought he was pretty ordinary today, I don't think him and darmian are a great partnership, although he is brilliant defensively darmian is not as good going forward. It works defensively because mata isn't much help and leaves him exposed but mata has to have players running past him otherwise he isn't very effective and even when he does play darmian into good areas it doesn't lead to anything.

He doesn't offer enough out wide we either need to give him a chance in the centre or bench him for young. We now have good enough holding players to have the luxury of playing him as the number ten so I have no idea why he isn't being given the opportunity.

465~~~
Sorry man, let me qualify that - I agree with you, I meant, being out wide whenever he receives the ball hinders our attack a bit because he doesn't have the pace to cause defences trouble in behind. So 99% of the time he'll check back and stop a bit of momentum. It's not a criticism of mata. I just think if we add an additional threat on the right, we'd open much more spaces for our other players.

466~~~
Yup. That's why I wanted pedro even though I don't rate him as the Caf <i>seemed</i> to do.

467~~~
Yeah, I'm a bit tired of all Rooney's problems constantly being deferred to other players, or those around him.

468~~~
I'm not sure which game he saw today.

469~~~
Agree with both. Adding a right winger with pace would give Mata an even better platform with pacey options left (Depay) and right (NEWGUY), and the whole team would have a far better balance for it. Then you'd have Januzaj as second choice number 10 or sometime right winger, and Herrera who can in the midfield two or as the most advanced of the three should we play that way.

Plus he's actually one of the best finishers at the club, so in addition to bringing him in field and someone with pace out wide, he'd find himself in goalscoring positions more often.

470~~~
Anyone who is criticising him today is basically talking out of their arse and should rewatch the match or stop having an predetermined thought on him just because he is on the right. His role isn't to stay wide, but to come inside and add creativity and yes done that superbly this season and especially today. Took complete control of the game and anything positive we did came through him or Memphis. We just couldn't score and it didn't help that schneiderlin behind him offered nothing on the ball and our fullbacks had no final ball. He was class though, without a doubt.

471~~~
Aye, complaining that he comes inside a lot is a bit stupid given that's presumably exactly what a false winger is supposed to do. If LVG wanted the RW to stay out wide then he wouldn't be playing Mata there in the first place.

He played well today and was our best attacking player. In fact he has pretty much been our best attacking player since he arrived at the club, though you wouldn't think it from some of the criticism he gets.

472~~~
Yep. Complain about the tactics all you want, but Mata has been performing his role perfectly this season, has created chances constantly, has kept the ball really well,  played some lovely passes and ran games for us. His role isn't to stay on the wing and go past players. So people criticising him for not doing that is basically just lacking any type of knowledge of how we ever play.

473~~~
I wasn't that impressed with Mata today. I thought he was overpowering his through balls and passes. I think he's wasted on the wing, would rather he played the AM role behind Rooney or another striker.

474~~~
Had a very good second half IMO but he is not a winger

475~~~
Sorry but that's bullshit, sure he misplaced a few passes and missed the volley but when he moved to the centre he was our best attacking player in the last quarter of the game. We are limiting him by playing him on the right because it's quite clear that we do not have a top attacking right back who can play the dual role that playing a false winger demands, if we had a Dani Alves or Cafu on that wing we would be ripping teams to shreds. Now that we have a double pivot that is capable of controlling games and blocking counters there is absolutely no reason we shouldn't be playing Mata in the hole. Playing him on the right, with Rooney in such woeful form is putting a lot of pressure on Memphis cause if we had a top class attacker on the right opponents wouldn't be able to double up on our left winger.

476~~~
One of our best players and the least of our problems... with the exception that we need someone playing to his right if he is going to drift as much as he did today.

477~~~
My feeling is that in this system he is deeper than I would like and there is not enough balance on the right. But Mata himself is excellent. Herrera in the team would probably fix it anyway.

478~~~
He is simply not a winger and not really a threat when he cuts inside since he rarely shoots. We need a more direct player from the right/middle , someone who will actually take on a player and shoot rather than always look for a pass.

It will sound stupid, but what we need is Reus or somone with similar playstyle and qualities.

479~~~
Obsession with Mata on the wing or the problem with that is strange. First of all he played there last season and looked good.
Second, despite the fact he starts as a RW he runs all around the pitch and isn't glued to that right wing. Last year he was more just on one side, this year he's roaming everywhere.

480~~~
And what exactly did we create in the last quarter of the game? Our best chances in the 2nd half were Hernandez getting lucky with a deflected effort, a corner and the chance Rooney set up for Mata. He moves central and creates barely and he's supposed to be the Mom and best attacking player? Give over. I didn't say he was bad nor did I ever mention his passing. He had a 90% pass success ratio so clearly passing wasn't an issue. I said he was ineffective and he was throughout. 

The bit in bold is hilarious. First, it was that he needs Herrera next to him to play well. Then, he needed an 2 DM's behind and play centrally to be able to perform well even though his best form for United has come out wide and he's spent almost all of his career out wide. And now he needs Daniel Alves or Cafu to be able to rip teams to shreds. If we had Dani Alves we wouldn't need Mata. What next? Does he need Messi and Ronaldo up top to play through balls?

481~~~
People go on about him being uncomfortable on the win as if he's actually really comfortable (and really effective) centrally.
Most of the time when he goes inside, he passes sideways (rarely forward), and doesn't look particularly comfortable in the actual central areas where he should be getting on the ball.

Basically he's not getting into (m)any of the areas that we actually need him to. Perhaps partly down to tactics, but also because he isn't capable. He gets it, drifts into a spacious central area and plays a simple (often 'safe') pass that barely impacts the game.

If any thing, van Gaal is doing him a favour by moving him out wide. Not only does it suit him more because he gets more room, but he also gets the benefit of the doubt from fans, because apparently he'd be miles better in the middle.

482~~~
I don't get the fuss about Mata. He is so slow, gets dispossess so easily. Is LVG using him that badly? Why did Jose sell this guy? When Jose sells you, you are usually shat.

483~~~
Oh dear.

484~~~
That last bit is a tad harsh. Mou sold him because of his work rate, and at that point he preferred Oscar. (Jose prefers a more physical/hardworking player over someone like Mata IMO).

Before Jose came in, Mata was twice their POTY, wasn't it?

485~~~
I don't know about the Mourinho bit. He's not god, after all.

He's liked because he's good at putting the final touches on moves (scoring and final passes), has very nice (and 'pretty') technique, and did the business for Chelsea under a certain set of circumstances. Oh yeah... and because he's supposedly going to be miles better when everything is perfectly aligned in his favour.

But like you say, the fact that he's slow (both in terms of raw pace and with his use of the ball), can't hold the ball unless he distances himself from the opposition, can't beat a man, and basically lacks in quite a few key ways... is all overlooked. Things that have nothing to do with other people, or a 'lack of runners'.

As if Silva 'runs the show' (proper shows, that is, not rather iffy 0-0 shows) because of 'runners'. I'd say it has more to do with the fact that Silva can actually keep hold of the ball when the opposition nibble at him. And the fact he can turn a man consistently, and isn't forced to dribble sideways in order to avoid being tackled. That allows him to find the runners.
Mata lacks in those areas, so it's very convenient to blame it on runners and everything other that Mata himself.

If we're going to ask why Mata isn't imposing himself on games consistently, then let's look at the people who do, and what they do when they have the ball. Very few are as limited with the ball at the foot (and their back to goal, or at a 90 degree angle) as Mata is.

486~~~
Quite the opposite of being a weakness, he's the only one who creates anything. So frustrating that we've dropped Herrera, as their partnership was one of the few promising signs from last season.

487~~~
Talk about taking one harmless statement and writing a fecking book when you have misunderstood what I really meant. Ok let me explain again, by playing Mata on the wing with so many attackers out of form we are asking way too much of Darmian in attack - we need a quick winger on that side to get more out of our right side offensively. I was not saying we need Cafu/Alves to make Mata look good but that if we aim to continue in this vein we need our RB to be more of an attacking threat than Darmian!

488~~~
People will claim Mata is as good as Silva under the right circumstances. Some will even say he was the best player in the league a few years ago. Yet Silva played over him for Spain over the years. Silva even played as a 'false nine' when Mata is a better finisher. That surely tells us something?

Unless Spain were also lacking the runners/quality Mata needed?

489~~~
We need to move him back to his favoured number 10 position. He's too slow out on the wing.

490~~~
What a lazy analysis.
BTW Kevin De Bruyne says hello.

491~~~
You're right in so far as Mata will never run the show in the way Silva does (they're quite different players really), his weaknesses will exist wherever he plays and moving him to #10 won't suddenly make him a much better player.

It might make us a better team though. He might not be a perfect #10 but it isn't like there are any better than him in the squad. Even if he only maintained his current form, moving him into a central position would allow us to play with more width on the right, arguably making us a more effective team. It would also likely see him get into goalscoring positions more frequently, which is where he really is brilliant.

It's also worth pointing out that for all people complain about some lack of creativity and/or control on Mata's part, we still don't have many players better than him at it.

492~~~
He is a small, cuddly teddy bear who writes a blog (generic and bland, tbh).

Exactly. There are numerous times when he slows down the attack. Could run with the ball, instead takes a turn and passes it backwards. Very frustrating to watch.

The bad part is, I don't think there will be much difference if he is moved to number 10. The same issues will come to fore in that position too.

37m luxury buy.

493~~~
Running at pace and beating a man is not the only form of attack. Today, he was the only player who looked to do something in the final third. For that matter when everyone was complaining about our dull play in the first 2 games, Mata was the only player who provided any little spark or any play that was pleasing to our eyes.

Yes, we do have lot of problems in our attack but Juan Mata is not one of them, atleast at this point

494~~~
It may not be the only form, but it is a damn effective form of attack. 

Newcastle gave us ample space to work with; they were happy to sit back and let us pass it around in front of their defense. Mata can't dribble, he is slow and ponderous on the ball and completely useless on the counter. The problem is that he doesn't do anything to effect the game. Did he dribble past anyone? Did he make one defense splitting pass? Januzaj, who is getting some flak for his performance, did it thrice.

Mata is not a player who is going to elevate a team, but someone who can be part an effective part of a good unit. As evidenced from the excuses that are made for him, seems like we need to create the perfect conditions for him to be good, until then, it's everybody else' fault. 

He is one of problems in the attack, a big one. At this point, I wouldn't mind seeing Jesse Lingard play ahead of him on the right.

495~~~
Mata had 3 dribbles and created 5 opportunities, only Memphis had more dribbles at 7, and nobody got close to him for chances created (next highest at 2). Januzaj with 0 chances created and 1 dribble. So you're basically 100% wrong. He played a good amount of defence splitting through passes, like that clip to Rooney late on when Rooney's volley got blocked. And he's been creating plenty of chances every game and playing good through balls. You could make this criticism for mata last season, but this season he has looked far more creative and has been a lot more positive in his play. He's playing exactly like he should be in his role, and doing it well. It's not your fault if you just don't like wide playmakers and prefer old fashioned wingers.

497~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Stat attack.

Which were these chances Mata created? Can you elaborate? When did he dribble past an opponent and started an attack or trouble the Newcastle defense? 

Januzaj played two excellent defense splitting passes through to Rooney and Depay. Also, played a brilliant little pass to free Darmian on the right.

498~~~
He was the one who was trying to do something in the final third. I agree to a extent that he plays a little safe and that is more due to LVGs tactics rather than Mata himself. I remember 2 occasions when he tried a through ball only for Rooney turn back due to his lack of his pace.

The big problem in our attack today is Rooney our main striker who cannot score for shit, a young #10 in Januzaj who has not yet proved in any way that he can be the regular starter at this stage and a young winger in a new league who is trying too hard and who was played as # 10 for all of pre season and first game of the season for whatever reasons.

499~~~
The obvious thing here is that once he moves inside centrally, there's no one on the right wing (apart from Darmian) so he's already lost 1 option there for a 1-2, link up play or through ball. Playing through Darmian there is risky because he'll have to come up against potentially 2 players covering him (left winger and left back), not to mention if he loses it there, we're fecked.

He passes square because that's the safer option to do when your other attacking players are so deep in the opposition's half; they're inviting the pass to intercept and counter attack.

There's two factors against Mata here, 1) he's not in any natural position to make the best passes he's capable of 2) we play far too slow as a result of his position and our players.

That's not defending when the times he does make mistakes though (including when he definitely should pass faster etc).

I'd agree Silva imo is a better player but the difference in their comparison is highly magnified by their current/past team set ups though. I'm not even sure Silva would be 'appreciated' in a Mourinho team; look at Ozil at Madrid being substituted consistently in the final third of the game, in a less physically demanding league and more dominant team.

Silva has played with Milner, Navas, Aguero, Dzeko, Toure, Fernandinho, Nasri etc etc which is almost a perfect blend of hard working, physically imposing, fast and technically profficient players. Mata in his time here? Young, Valencia, Carrick, Cleverley, Fletcher, Rooney, Rafael, RVP, Nani etc and of course the current lot. None there have had the right mix of any consistent form/quality, not to mention the managerial changes, his team mates' and his own changes of roles over that time.

Sure Silva has played from wide too and continues to do so but he's consistently been in the better situation to succeed than Mata.

If we're talking about players, who deserved more 'just' criticism imo then it should be Januzaj's display today. The 'problems' and excuses that can shield criticism from Mata still exist here but Januzaj needs to perform better to be justifying his place in the team atm (and I'm a massive fan). But again we can put that in context because that's only his 3rd game in his preferred role and he's only 20!

500~~~
I don't think Rooney was that bad actually. Agree with the rest of your second paragraph and that the tactics are also to blame for the bluntness of our attack.

All of them were trying to do something. We didn't draw because of a lack of trying, we drew because of lack of ideas in the final third. Mata was as much a part of that as anyone else.

501~~~
Agreed, no idea why people keep praising him. He's playing way to deep, slowing nearly every counter by standing behind the advance and waiting then holding up the ball and passing it backwards. Darmian keeps running up and then running back because Mata never gets in a decent position to overlap properly. If he does, Darmian's run is tracked completely and he can't get a decent ball off.

I just want Mata to stay on the left fullback on the line with Rooney. Mata plays to deep and it drags Rooney over to compensate and Depay/Young play to pushed up and on the outside to be effective. Our forward line basically looks like this;

/

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/6KkqLtd.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/6KkqLtd.jpg"/>

One of those, the cutback was a <i>real </i>chance created, the one to the center was the shot for Rooney that basically had two defenders in front of him. No idea what the others were? His crossin was also 1/6 - two way over hit, one in behind that nobody was ever going to get to and one blocked.

Stats don't tell the full story here I am afraid.

502~~~
Played better towards the end but his first 70 mins he was the worst player on the pitch bar that Mbumble guy. Time to give Chich, Lingard, Pereira or Herrera a chance from the start next game instead? Or even Fellaini I suppose, certainly help our aerial threat and get Januzaj out right.

503~~~
Mata hit more forward passes then any of our attackers (51), he also has the highest percentage of forward passes on the team (about 60%), Depay is second with around 55%

I know its just stats, but clearly Mata does more then just pass it backwards. In fact, what I really liked about Mata's performance yesterday was that he was constantly demanding the ball. He'd slip it off to Carrick/Schweinsteiger and immediately be on the run to pick up the ball round the corner and then go on a run into a more central area - where he either fed in Depay/Shaw down the left or Darmian down the right. A few times he'd also go for the 1-2's off Rooney/Hernandez, but they didn't quite come off... still, at least he was trying to make things happen.

504~~~
Incredible.

505~~~
Agreed. Mbemba isn't even that hard a name to spell.

506~~~
I think I've said this before, but the chances created stat is very misleading. It's basically a shot assist. If player x passes to player y who takes a shot from 50 yards, the pass leading to that shot is registered as a key pass/chance for player x. It's flawed and ridiculous. Januzaj created the best chance of the game, but that didn't register as a chance because Depay didn't take a shot.

507~~~
Forward passes are all well and good but you have to try to play them before the defenders have a chance to get behind the ball. And if you stop running on a counter attack just so you can play a forward pass it's not much use because whoever you play it to will be on their own in all likelihood.

508~~~
Our entire team is guilty of taking far too many touches/spending way too long on the ball, this is not exclusive to Mata at all.

509~~~
I wonder how the opinions differ so much, Im a huge Mata critic but thought he was brilliant yesterday. Almost every dangerous attack we had, was through him.

510~~~
Don't you know Mou never makes a mistake. He has never sold a player that was actually any good or bought a player that didn't work out. Better stop your blasphemy before the cafquisition puts you on their shitlist.

511~~~
True, but he is the worst culprit. And I don't think the quality of his passes/shots is making up for it at the moment. Time to put a player in who can actually make the right runs and provide a threat on the counter IMO.

512~~~
Strange how people slag him of when he is clearly playing very well at the moment. I've always loved the guy and he's been doing well out wide for me. He was working well with Darmian toob and tried a few balls on the overlap which Matteo didn't quote read as the understanding isn't there 100 percent yet but that will improve.

513~~~
1st half all touches. Will try and do the 2nd half tonight.

514~~~
Watching that, he definitely looked a lot more dangerous when allowed to drift inside, which is to be expected. He's a useful player to have in the side: his plays quite intelligent and he's often making plenty of decent movement off the ball. He was sometimes guilty of perhaps slowing down the play, but he'd mostly make up for it with some nice little moves and passes. Usually reliable when he's on the ball.

516~~~
I think he played much better in the other games this season. Did not do much in this game in terms of incisive passing - Januzaj was much better with two beautiful through balls. When he is on the wings and a third player like Herrera does not join him to create a triangle (like last season), it really limits his game.

517~~~
Cheesy virtually everytime he gets the ball he comes backwards onto his left side. He kills all momentum on the right side of attack. Play the fella at the tip of our midfield or not at all imo. He is a class little player but due to his limitations he needs to have players around him to bring out his qualities (movement and pace is whats needed around him) right now he's stuck out right wing and is a massive part in our lack of creations of chances. It speaks volumes when our most creative player is killing our creativity.

518~~~
I thought he looked dangerous against Newcastle. Especially when he was drifting inside. The only problem with that is that there's no one on the right to stretch the play which in turn congests the middle. If we can get another wide right player with pace and play Mata centrally I think we'll get the best out of him. I think it might also help Rooney too and lets be honest he needs all the help he can get!

519~~~
It's funny that pretty much people who are criticizeing him(with few exceptions) are hardcore Rooney fans who still can't see anything wrong with their hero but yet Mata is at fault for everything.

520~~~
Never understood this. Surely people are hardcore Manchester United fans and not individual player fans. Seems weird. I think the thing with Mata is unless he's scored or created a goal his play style is more subtle and a little bit difficult to see. He also relies on movement around him, something which he's not getting a lot of at the moment. Rooney being a main culprit.

521~~~
I don't understand it either but it's quite obvious. The usual suspects are easy to recognize.

522~~~
Yikes. That first half video was bloody hard to watch. His first 9 touches he gets the ball and runs backwards, or goes sideways and passes backwards. A couple of times he has acres of space in front of him to take his marker into as well and he stops and then turns and passes backwards. As it goes on though the run from deep in the corner was great (though why is literally 2m from being the furthest he can possibly be from his position), shot was nice, there was also a couple of really nice passes when he was up the field as well.

I just really want him to stay forward and stop getting stuck behind the play supporting Darmian. Darmian is a grown man who can defend his wing. When he is stuck back trying to defend he rarely gets back up the field into the opposition third.
Yeah it is bloody hard to watch sometimes. A few times he actually engineers his touch to make sure he's taking it even further away from his marker, bacl toward his own goal when he has time and space to take the ball down and go forward and attack his man. I honestly can only come to the conclusion that he thinks his own legs are gone and is down on confidence. (Or the must play safe attitude mentioned earlier).
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/Y8NjnRq.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/Y8NjnRq.jpg"/>
Yeah, of course there is. He's barely ever up front creating on the opposition back line. He's always inside or way behind the play. There are only about 7 of those passes on the wing where he needs to be operating consistently.

He did have nearly as many passes forward as backward though to be fair.

523~~~
As a person mata is clearly a gentleman, however his footballing style and how he fits in our system is causing us problems.

He is not a right winger, he has little pace, power or acceleration and more importantly he fails in the decisive moments. For all of the slick passing and his technique on the ball, there are too many moments where if he had the clinical approach of a world class forward he would be cementing his place by making these game changing moments.

Unfortunately as it stands he is replaceable and makes our right side look slow and easy to defend against. 

The only way I can see it working long term is if he is moved centrally and a world class right sided forwarded is brought in and Rooney is replaced as they are both too slow.

524~~~
It would take a pretty good player to displace him. I'd rather have Mata than some past paced winger with no end product (See Valencia or Navas). Especially in the way we play now.

I think some of the criticism is unfair. How many players are there in the world who are both world class passers and finishers? If Mata played for City, he would have loads of assists when paired with players such as Aguero and Toure.

525~~~
He isn't on the same level as silva though so wouldn't really get into their team.

This isn't matas fault entirely as he is really playing out of his natural position. But that doesnt get away from the fact that as a right winger he doesnt offer us what we need. He needs to play central with fast paced and decisive players supporting him.

526~~~
I really like him but that's my main gripe with him, he's good enough to pick out dangerous passes but too many he resorts to safe back and sideways passes. I honestly think it's because he's playing under the philosophy bullshit that makes the player keep possession before taking a risky action. How I would love for LVG to stop with this nonsense and just asks the players to play positively.

527~~~
I didn't say he was. I said he would do a lot better in a team with more movement and better attacking play, like City. There aren't many players in the world on Silva's level in that particular position, so saying he's not on the same level doesn't really say much. And he's played large parts of his career on the right wing, LvG isn't the first manager to think that it's his best position. I agree we could do better on the wing though, but there are positions I would strengthen before that.

528~~~
I'm not really sure how they compare as they are completely different players in terms of style and the way they are deployed.

Navas is lightning and uses his directness as a weapon, he rarely contributes defensively and a lot of his work is done deep in the opposition third.
Mata on the other hand is a much better play maker and uses his superior passing.

Look at Navas' map compared to Mata's. Plus he is a right footer playing a natural right footed wing forward role compared to Mata's right sided inverted forward role.

529~~~
Wait, I am not comparing them, other than saying that I don't think we would do much better if a player like Navas replaced Mata in our team. Or did I misunderstand you?

530~~~
I'm not sure. I remember him being like that quite a bit at Chelsea. Even when they broke forward, he'd check and pass sideways if there were men to take on. If there weren't men to take on, then he'd be able to surge forward. A great example would be the third goal against Liverpool last season (the assist for van Persie) - That's basically Mata at his best. Space to run and pass into, nobody to dribble past.

The sideways passes and safe play wont suddenly stop just because of van Gaal's tactics. He plays safe because he's not capable of holding the ball or advancing the play effectively when he's pressured in midfield. I don't believe it's just down to tactics.

531~~~
I compared them and their role in both teams? I think Navas role suits City because they have a good stable RB and the pace they play at allows him to stay up and direct, I am not really sure they can be compared as individuals. I kind of agree with you I think Navas would struggle in this system.

Just adding food for thought, not trying to pick apart your point albeit a good one!

532~~~
Oh right, I get it <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Yes, I think you're right that they do need some with and directness in their team, which Navas prodived I suppose.

533~~~
I'm not talking about those moments when he is under pressure but he has time and space but doesn't go for the creative pass.

534~~~
Play him behind striker or don't play him at all.

He can play well on the right wing, but it's so obvious that's not his preferred role and sometimes he goes missing during matches since he can't impact play the way he would if played in the role of SS or AM.

LVG is doing his best in playing players out of position and Mata is prime example of his philosphy, playing player that's not strong enough, not pacey and isn't best at backtracking as a winger.

535~~~
He did that in the first goal against Villa, to be fair to him.

But the reality is, in a possession system, you will be under pressure most of the time. You have to create your own space within there. 
The few times Mata finds space is when he drops deep and basically allows the two banks of four to develop. Essentially he's finding space in areas where it doesn't hurt teams - which is not praiseworthy at all. 

What is ideal is a player who can create space without having to drop into that deep, nonthreatening area all the time. There are only so many times a pass like against Villa will work out. Someone like Isco, for example, creates space in advanced/congested areas. That's what it's about. 

I guess, essentially, my issue with Mata is that his version of creating space is often not the kind of creating space that is required. It's not space in the areas that it needs to be.

536~~~
I keep seeing people saying this and sometimes wonder if we are talking about the same player...He does those passes often. The assists to Januzaj against Villa, and the brilliant through pass to Memphis in the same same game are just some examples of it.

537~~~
I didn't say he doesn't do it, just said he doesn't do it enough, specially when he has space.

Yes he did and it was great and hopefully more will come.

538~~~
It's not that easy to consistently do when your striker mostly needs the ball under no pressure. He can improve at it I suppose but for me Mata has been one of the bright sparks of our attack so far. He's still not the kind of player I want at right wing, but he adds a lot.

539~~~
Can you explain this please?

540~~~
I will sort out the footage block tomorrow.

541~~~
I wish he could influence games like Silva does.

542~~~
The odd thing is, the more I watch I would say the closest thing we have to Silva is Januzaj

543~~~
The thing is, he actually does influence the game far more than any other United player. 109 touches and 93 passes against Newcastle. Only Schneiderlin came close to those numbers but he was much further back on the pitch. FWIW, Silva had 91 touches and 80 passes against Everton, but obviously made them count for so much more.

I know the videos above have been taken down, but I actually thought he did well in the first 15-20 minutes. He moved the ball on quickly and had Newcastle scrambling. But then, as Mata started to slow down the tempo, United's entire attack began to lose its bite.

For better or worse, Mata has consistently been given more freedom than any other player in the United side. First in the hole in the 3-5-2, then on the right in the 4-3-3 and now the 4-2-3-1. Everyone else has to stick to their positions whereas Mata can wander pretty much wherever he likes. If only he'd shoulder that responsibility with a bit more verve, I think we'd be favourites, or thereabouts, for the title. 

On paper, Depay, Rooney and Mata are three of the most talented players in England. Mata's form is critical to making it all tick, though. So far, he's only given us about 20 minutes in the league. Solve the problem of Juan Mata and you solve the problem of Manchester United, imo.

544~~~
Yeah, I'd agree with that. We could start by putting him in the middle.

I know, I know, crazy thought.

545~~~
Barely been involved today.

546~~~
I reckon 95% of his play and passes was forward oriented in this first half, something that people constantly moan about him.

547~~~
They were, but he wasn't involved enough. Most - if not all - our best spells came from the left side of Memphis.

548~~~
Please get him central. Pretty pretty please.

549~~~
Just play him in the middle for gods sake. He puts himself there most of the game anyway.

550~~~
Nice pass for Rooney hattrick

551~~~
Nice little assist for the third goal, timed his pass to Rooney well even if it was fairly simple.

552~~~
Didn't even notice he was on the pitch until I saw him start the 2nd half and hearing that Bastian was the only sub. Lovely pass for Rooney's third - his through balls this season have been excellent.

553~~~
Still easily our most prolific creator, however involved. I still expect some gifs of a hesistant pass from the 23rd minute to illustrate some bizarre, opaque point, mind..

554~~~
Aye, he can perhaps be frustrating in some of his play sometimes, but he's easily one of our most skilled and productive outfield players when he's on form.

555~~~
Which is what a player like him is for. Not to compare him to Eric, but that's exactly what he'd do. He could be rubbish for 85 minutes then produce something mercurial. He didn't score from open play until December after coming back from suspension if I remember correctly. Oh, the gifs we'd have had. Sack Fergie, Sell Giggs.

556~~~
I'd really like to see him given a run in the 10 role but LvG doesn't seem interested.

557~~~
I'd really like the whole second striker plan to be binned

558~~~
I think we'll see more of Herrera in that role now. Mata suits a number 10 role, but he's equally capable of playing out wide when he's allowed to drift inside, whereas Herrera wouldn't really suit being played as a winger. I'd be more than happy with a front three of Memphis, Herrera and Mata, though.

559~~~
I'm still not convinced I have to say. He just seems so slow and that's just not his pace but also until he releases the ball or knows what to do next. He slowed us down too often lately

560~~~
great creative player, I really wanted him to get on a scoresheet, let's hope mad manager plays Herrera in the hole so they can combine together once again, tehy were joy to watch last season and I think it can work this season too in slightly different lineup, Schneiderlin, Depay this time included

561~~~
What would you prefer instead? 
I think you're probably right about Herrera. I think Januzaj is a winger and not a 10 so I'd swap him and Mata over in today's starting 11. Personally I'd drop Herrera but happy to be proven wrong.

562~~~
three-man midfield

563~~~
Indeed. They bring the best out of each other, and can drift around each other if need be. As much as I think Juan is our best #10 individually, I think both of them on the pitch, in that early 2nd half formation, would give us more all round.

564~~~
Didn't play Kagawa as the #10, not playing Mata as the #10.

What is wrong with us?

565~~~
Herrera should play as a nr. 10. And then Mata will shine too. 
Also Mata has spend most of his career on the wing. 
And played there last season too.

566~~~
He spends so much time in the middle, don't really understand the complaints about him playing on the wing.

567~~~
I thought he was very good today.

568~~~
My main point would be if you start him in the middle (as an a/m not as a second striker where his back is to goal) then all of a sudden he's got 3 potential passes on being rooney through the middle, Depay running from the left and then the right winger i.e. Januzaj who would be running in on his stronger foot. Not to mention if he's already central he can make the pass quicker. We've got wide players in Depay/Januzaj who would naturally be wanting to make a run inside and we've got Mata who's by far our best player at spotting those runs. Multiple runners would open up the pitch as teams wouldn't be able to just flood the middle.

When Herrera plays and Mata is wide it's not such an issue as they've clearly got a good understanding and Herrera uses the ball a lot quicker than Depay/Januzaj do centrally which helps Mata, but as a natural fit Mata as the third midfielder with two wingers making inside runs seems like a good idea to me. There will be some games where maybe the other team presses too quick and Mata can't find space where he might be better of wide but I can't see the hard in trying that set up, although right now I'd be happy going with a front 4 of rooney, mata, depay and herrera.

569~~~
We all would.

570~~~
As ever, baffled with any criticism he gets. He's a sublime footballer and is just brilliant to watch. I also think he operates very well from the right and would be quite happy for him to continue there.

571~~~
He's an excellent footballer, just a shame he comes across as an abonimable human being.

572~~~
... I just wanted to say something bad about him, since people are harsh on everyone here. He's quite clearly the definition of a class act.

Sorry Juan. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

573~~~
I think he has been good all season so far...

574~~~
Well, he may have created one or more clear scoring chances in every game we've played so far, but you have to remember that he did once do this..

And this...

So...think on.

575~~~
While I prefer him centrally, I think it is best for the team that he plays on the right. Fellaini and Herrera can be in the #10 role. Whereas if Mata goes central, Adnan, Young or Valencia come in on the right.

576~~~
I sort of think Kagawa would be the perfect number 10 for us now with the current system. Ironically.

577~~~
I have not watched the match from this morning, fair enough that you acknowledge he had had problems with his ability to keep play ticking over when he's dropped back for whatever reason. I cant comment on this game however, the overall point is that as an attacking player he needs to spend more time attacking rather than defending. Sounds like he had a good game and the more confidence can only help to solve the mata.

578~~~
But thats an irrelevant criticism because of his natural tendency to drift inside anyway. 

Against Newcastle I thought it was notable the amount of time Januzaj spent on the right and Mata centrally. I think thats the fundamental reason Januzaj has been preferred over Herrara so far so that they do have that natural ability to swap roles.

Anyway, I agree with those who like his position and think it will be an even more useful ploy now we have a real right back rather than a headless chicken to give us more width down that side.

579~~~
He's been good in every game this season and our best attacking player over the 5 games by far, and has created plenty of chances. I said it before, but this season he's looking way more creative then he has since his 12/13 season at Chelsea and it's great to see. Finally looking like the player we thought we were buying. Not saying he was poor since he came, but he has been decent overall you could say. The odd glimpses of class and some great games mixed with some ineffective games. This season, we finally have a settled team so hopefully he'll keep it going but the way he's started this season has been really encouraging. Been weird that anybody has criticized him at all these last few weeks really.

580~~~
Yeah he plays from the right, but like one of the poster said, he probably ends up in the middle more than sticking to the wing. I think it suits him just fine, plus more often than note the fullback is less physical type of player than a typical DM nowadays, where he would be tightly mark and barged the ball off him. With a full back tracking him and follows him towards the middle, it would theoretically opens up more space for Darmian, I think <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>.

581~~~
Quiet in the first half but came to life when his bro was moved into the #10 role.

582~~~
I thought he was pretty good.

583~~~
Look, I am not saying he's a crap player or he should be dropped. But that bit in bold is a huge stretch, it simply isn't true. Even if he were the best out of the lot (so far for me it is clearly been Depay but they have all had patches of inconsistency) it wouldn't be by much. One thing that is obvious to see is that his potency is greatly increased when he is staying up field and not getting bogged down helping out Darmian. When he's able to get support if and when he comes inside to playmake. When he isn't up field he leaves a huge hole that Rooney often drifts into. When he gets involved from deep on the break (the exception being that full half dribble out of the corner) he has slowed it down and virtually stopped it on a number of occasions.

(I am not talking about the Brugge second leg though. Haven't seen it yet.)

584~~~
I don't think it's irrelevant when him coming inside means that often we can lack anyone but Darmain wide, where as if we lined up with someone on the right who can go down the line but also make an inside run like Depay does on the left it would open up more options in the attack.

Januzaj did move wide at times but he seemed to hold his width and wasn't really making runs inside. He can do it just not sure whether it was instructions or him but I don't think he was being as effective as he can be there. I agree that Januzaj/Mata/Depay can be fluid and I'm happy to keep going with it, I just think Mata should be the one primarily central and Januzaj should be on the right making inside runs on to his left foot. That seems a much more natural fit for everyone.

I agree that Mata on the right can be effective with Herrera as I mentioned in my post however I think when it's Januzaj/Depay off Rooney both hold on to the ball too long and make it harder for Mata to influence.

585~~~
Played some lovely through balls yesterday something we don't see often enough, would like to see him play in middle a few times but that would probably force Herrera out of the team again!

586~~~
Without setting the world alight, Mata has barely put a foot wrong so far this season

But for some reason I do fear he will be dropped at some stage

Anyways does anyone have his passing stats?

587~~~
We need to buy a RW and play Mata in the 10 position. I just love his decision making when he has options to slip it through. Pedro on the right would have been perfect. I hope we can buy someone and give him a run there.

588~~~
Thats the way I saw it too, but im over it now. I think Mata will be fine where he is with Herrera at No 10

589~~~
You can find all of his stats <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Players/25363/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. For a more detailed version, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/players/juan-mata/stats#performance-score#manchester-united-(current)#english-barclays-premier-league#8#season-2015/2016#165#all-matches#1-3#by-match" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a> is probably better.

590~~~
Made the Spain squad alongsidw Dave. Not sure who he's in ahead of or if someone's injured

591~~~
No Thiago or Morata. Great to see Juan back though. Just a shame there was no room for Ander with Spain's ridiculous strength in depth.

592~~~
Mata has been our best attacking player yet this season. I don't get the critiscism here

593~~~
Indeed. Most of the criticism should be directed towards the players that haven't made the most of his service.

594~~~
He has replaced Jesus Navas in the squad. Thiago has been dropped.

595~~~
His refusal to offer width as a winger is so annoying. He needs to offer the overlap to Darmian when he's got the ball, not hang back five yards so he can cut inside and play an easy pass.

He spends 95% of the time running away from goal and 5% running towards it.

596~~~
I love the guy but Anybody else get incredible frustrated watching him 

Darmian is making great runs down their side but mata stops all momentum. 

Honestly wouldn't say no to Mane as our RW at the moment

597~~~
Always think he has a goal in him but when he doesn't get it, he really does look detrimental to our attack. Keeps cutting in too often and isn't linking up with Herrera enough.

598~~~
His worst half this season, Swansea are doing a good job picking him up when he cuts inside. The lack of movement ahead of him doesn't help either.

599~~~
Hey, what do you expect from a false winger #10? He's our most gifted player, he needn't do anything that he doesn't want to.

600~~~
Currently the spanner in the works!

601~~~
Because everything else around him is so fluid?

I think Mata's had a poor half (his worst of the season so far) but come on, Depay and Rooney have been poor too.

602~~~
I'm not disagreeing but every time Mata gets the ball he checks back killing our attack on the right hand side. He has quality and he can produce from close quarters in around the box but 30-50 yards from goal its horrible to watch him out wide!

603~~~
There is also always the chance he gets knocked off the ball even with his back to goal. Right wing is not suiting him very well in these tight away matches.

604~~~
Get it up you!! Ya Beauty

605~~~
Now thats a finish! He needed that.

606~~~
He's just so great.

607~~~
Ended his worst spell with a goal.

608~~~
Poor first half, but there when he was needed to finish that. Obviously warming up for his favourite oppononents, Liverpool.

609~~~
Did well to get the goal but he still feels like he slows our attacks down way too often.

610~~~
He does because hes playing in the wrong position. Watch what he actually does every attack, ball comes into his feet and Darmian goes beyond him but the defender knows that Mata cant take him on as he has no pace. So he turns in and then gets his head up instantly and looks for runners....there are none for him to hit.

My favorite player by a mile for United but he has to be in the hole, he makes good runs beyond the striker and scores goals he also passes it into spaces to put players in behind. Playing him on the right is very hit and miss as he has immense quality but hes not suited to play there.

611~~~
Should play in the hole really but was meh today. Swansea's fullbacks did well to press him whenever he got the ball and it stifled his impact. Still scored though so you can't complain about him too much today. Was probably his worst match of the season, but scored.

612~~~
He should have scored 2. He had such a brilliant chance that he smashed wide.

613~~~
Although he scored I can totally see why Mourinho sold him. There is just no position for him. He just isn't a winger. He drifts inside way too often and finds no one to pass to. Gets disposessed too easily and lacks pace. He is a beautiful footballer but I just don't see it with him on the wing.

614~~~
Wasn't great, but then scored and had another chance and then gets subbed. Well done LVG.

615~~~
He was poor today yes he scored a goal but besides that he was no better then Rooney or Memphis. I think with the current formation Mata is the big problem in our attack when he is playing on the right we are basically playing with 2 tens and the centre of the pitch gets to crowded and Darmian gets to isolated on the wing. Mata should either play centrally or he should not play at all we need someone on the right similar to Memphis who stays out wide to strech the pitch.

616~~~
He really is a bit of a square peg at the moment, isn't he. He just isn't going to shine (properly shine, not just scoring goals here and there) in our current formation. Maybe if he was the one in the middle, but that doesn't look likely. 

I can't believe we let Pedro slip through our fingers.

617~~~
Push him behind the striker. We will play everybody but him there. Start him there and then see what happens. I think he should be part of a floating three behind the striker which rotate and cause problems. If hes stuck in one position its easy to defend, if you have him, Memphis and say Herrera switching around, it could cause problems.

Not his best games, took his goal well, but I dont think he should have been subbed because it basically meant long ball which defenders like Williams will be happy to deal with.

618~~~
Maybe in Pellegrini's 4-4-2 boxy type thing? He's not entirely dissimilar to Nasri in that both are sort of conservative on the ball and play both AM and W.

619~~~
Not ideal to play him there but still a much better option than Young imo. When he came on, he stayed wide, tried to beat his man and cross the ball. Problem is that he's not that good at those things. Darmian overlapped, but he doesn't seem to know how to cross either.  Not a huge Pedro fan, but he would have been ideal.

620~~~
Shouldn't have been subbed off for Ashley Young today. It should have been Memphis coming off for Young, as Memphis was arguably our worst player today (along with Rooney) and Young is better on the left wing anyway. It was stupid to sub off the guy who scored our goal today.

621~~~
Good goal Juan. Enjoy Spain. Hugs.

622~~~
I agree. After he scored and got his confidence up it was strange to sub him. Should have looked to move him centrally and see if he could get another chance when we were chasing the game.

623~~~
He's an impact sub/rotation player. That's all he can hope to be in a top team. Whether he pays centrally or on the wing.

It's almost always: 'he was good but...' or 'he scored/assisted but...'
The same things people claim hinder him out wide will hinder him centrally too. Maybe to a slightly lesser extent, but still too much.

624~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/08ft" width="560"></iframe>

I don't get why he's coming so deep and staying central then he's just completely bypassed and has no pace to get in any position to support. If he just pushed back onto his fullback the second Smalling ignored his pass he'd have been on the end of a possible square tap-in. In his role I find myself sometimes looking at the right wing and saying out loud "for christ's sake Mata get up the fecking field and stop dawdling around in the middle contributing nothing.."

There is literally not a single player on the right side of the pitch. Our shape is all over the place because Mata comes so deep and so far out of his own zone to get in the way of the play.

625~~~
It's clear Van Gaal is telling him to come inwards. Mata couldn't play as a winger anyway.

Stupid he isn't played as a #10.

626~~~
He is basically playing as a 10 while we have no right sided forward. It is bizarre.

627~~~

628~~~
When you want him out wide right during the counters or transitions he's often dropping straight in to the line of the midfield and when you do want him making a run centrally during the organized play then he usually sticks pretty far out right. It doesn't seem like he provides any threat at all to the full back during the transitions with runs behind the defense and as he's more or less always dropping deep it becomes predictable for the full back too.

Even when he succeeds and drops deep and offers an alternative he usually does so in an area that isn't threatening at all and it rarely leads to a lot. If he wants to leave his position during the build up he'd be a lot more dangerous if he stayed high up the field and tried to find space centrally instead as if he receives the ball there it is instantly a good chance to create something.

629~~~
He is one of the reasons why we struggle upfront. He's just so slow with his movement and play. Too often he stops and plays it back again, it becomes frustrating. Really wonder where his top form is but like this, he shouldn't start games

630~~~
Make or break season for him now I think, it's been two years since he was one of the leagues best players and if he doesn't get back to that kind of level I think he will be on his way next summer. Failure to sign another winger will give him a run in the team but it's noticeable how we have virtually no threat down our right hand side.

631~~~
Our right wing could be a problem all season. Just a shame he's never reached his previous highs

632~~~
He's also the only one that gets onto the end of crosses in the box, which is his job as a wide forward. He's slow, that was always known and he cannot beat his man from a stand still position but his off-ball movement is excellent and that will add goals.

Edit: Also think he's had a hand in all of our goals from open play in the league so far this season.

633~~~
One of the main reasons for our poor attacking play, yet also our best attacking player so far this season. Busy guy.

634~~~
I was really hoping we'd get some pace in to play on the right and least offer an alternative to him, he frustrates the hell out of me most weeks and the only cover we have is Ashley Young.

635~~~
I just think LVG feels he isn't strong enough to hold the ball in the number 10 position. At Chelsea he had Drogba upfront who could hold the ball up and so he could bounce off him but here we have Wayne Rooney. A striker who has no pace, strength and a lack of movement to trouble defenders. On the right wing he has more space but apart from the reverse pass into the box, he doesn't have many other ideas to trouble the defense .

636~~~
That's the problem though, don't play him as a 10 play him a bit deeper as an a/m. Let him float and find space. Cutting in from the right he can get some space but then we lose an attacker from that side, where as if he's central and allowed to drift he can be in a position to link up with either Depay or the other winger. It would let us overload some areas like other teams do, forcing the opposition to break their rigid formation as they'll have to move to keep tracking, so either they do that and space opens up for someone else, or they're too slow in which case we might be able to play someone in.

With the window gone and Januzaj on loan it can't really happen now and so he'll have to stay wide but I'd definitely say it's a wasted opportunity.

637~~~
We should be building the team around him rather than Rooney; he's more talented and has a better mentality.

638~~~
We did the same thing under Sir Alex with Giggs for a considerable period of time before he was converted into a central player full-time. Lopsided formations really aren't that strange. You can go all the way back to Brazil in 1970 who played with Rivelino - a classic #10 - on the left and Jairzinho - a wide forward - on the right. We've just done the same on the opposite wings with Mata and Depay. The system isn't the issue it's the execution of it.

639~~~
A 4-3-3 has 3 passing midfielders and 3 attacking forwards. Usually the midfielders are all central, but LvG is kind of tasking Mata as one of the passing midfielders, albeit one who starts from out wide. The #10s we've used (Depay, Fellaini, Herrera and Januzaj) have all played much higher up the pitch, almost as strikers.

It kind of looks like this:

------------------Rooney
Depay------------Januzaj

-------------------------------Mata
-------------Scheiderlin---Bastian


Yes, we look lopsided but I don't think it matters. LvG wants to keep Mata's 90% passing in the side but doesn't believe he can do it as a #10. He still contributes a lot, but for some reason the Caf seems to want to judge him as a traditional winger. That's clearly not his role right now.

I think it's fair to criticise the tempo of his passing, but I don't have a problem with his position in the team.

640~~~
Sorry I missed this, but I meant it's easier for creative players when your striker is not playing the way Rooney has been. In his current form, you can't really play the ball to him in tight spaces or when he's under pressure from defenders as easily as you'd like. I'm not sure from Rooney's POV blame can be apportioned on the service from the likes of Mata too, of course.

641~~~
I am starting to agree with this. I was one who didn't really like him in the #10 role for us, but that could be more due to the fact that the players around him just aren't suited. I would rather we build around Mata than Rooney.

642~~~
Mata isn't suited either.

643~~~
A team like ours doesn't need to build the side around anybody, not even you don't have a messi/Ronaldo in the squad. 

We should definitely have him as the #10 though to get the best out of him and our wide players. Him or Herrera. 

I just hope we don't put Rooney there now that we have martial.

644~~~
Brwned, you're talking about Ryan Giggs here. His entire persona and legacy on the football field was based on taking people on, being like lightning and putting whoever comes near him under pressure with the ball at his feet. Are we really going to compare his role on the field from a good 5-10 years ago under Ferguson (which was basically a down hill beat'em up brawler type football system) to the way Juan Mata and Depay are playing at the moment? There is a reason that we are one of the lowest ranked teams for amount of dribbles. I get what you are trying to say, I personally don't think it really has anything to do with the system also, more that Mata just doesn't have the positional instinct or the mobility to play as a right forward properly. Tactical and intelligence is there and ability to finish but without the other two, he's rarely in the right place at the right time.

Look, I am not mindlessly bashing him or having a go at him a la the post a couple below yours mindlessly blaming Rooney for Mata's lack of pace and positional sense. But there are so many instances where he is out of position and either getting in the way of fast moving attacks or he is stuck sitting back way to much slowing the play down by passing back or dribbling slowly into a nothing area and then dribbling backwards and passing it back. There simply has to be some sort of directive from Van Gaal allowing him to be completely nerfed on the right flank. We are rarely attempting to put pressure on the opposition fullback. I am hesitant to definitively say that Depay also doesn't take on his man enough because he actually has pace with the ball at his feet, so by design, his game takes him into more situations where he isn't holding up the ball and then passing it back. But I do feel that these two players in this system need to be forward facing and basically getting the ball and running at the defence and causing problems. Otherwise there is absolutely no point having a player like Rooney up front, with everybody who is up playing with their back to goal and moving backwards it keeps pulling him off the line and out of the centre to have to contribute in the spaces left behind.

It makes no sense and I don't understand it if it is what Van Gaal is trying to get us to do. Since he hasn't really changed it at all? Or dropped Mata for somebody else and moved him? I don't get it, it must be what we are trying to do and it makes no sense to me. That is all I am trying to understand here.

Take this chance for example, this is actually a really really good chance to score and part of exactly why he needs to always be up and in the right position:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/kngm" width="560"></iframe>

But he is just so far wide and then when there is a neat ball in he doesn't tuck in at all. He just kinda stops on the spot and even instinctively I don't know how from there you are going to get a ball to fashion something on target. Herrera would have to be an absolute magician to manufacture a pass that connected well enough for a player out that wide. If he tucks in and tucks in early he either draws the fullback away from Herrera allowing him a better chance on goal (but probably far to late in that instance as he starts out to wide, which is fair enough) or he is in perfect position to take that ball first time from a few yards away from Herrera and not have both defenders come across completely closing down any opportunity at all.

I really just want us to be creating as many of those opportunities we can a game and to me, he's rarely in the right spot at the right time to be able to. (Oh I remember that is kinda similar to the Liverpool goal he scored.)

I know that is a bit neolithic and moyesish having to simmer the game down in such a way.

645~~~
Is there a legitimate reason LVG doesn't fancy Mata as a #10?

646~~~
Because he's not a particularly great #10?

647~~~
Based on?

648~~~
How?

He is clearly more effective as a #10.
Not to mention his best ever season came in that role/position.

649~~~
Just a few things.

He struggles to impose himself, to keep hold of the ball, to create when the space is restricted.
His best stuff came in a poor Chelsea side that basically counter-attacked and gave him complete freedom.

He's completely ill-suited to play number 10 in a top side who play possession football deep in the oppositions half.
He's suited to counter-attacking football, and even then - he's useless defensively and lacks the dribbling ability to really relieve pressure. So he wouldn't get into a top counter-attacking team, either.

He's got beautiful technique and is great at scoring and directly assisting. But everything thing in between is lacking. And as weird as it may sound, that prevents him from being good enough for a top team. Hence him apparently being better than Silva for two years, yet still being behind him for Spain, even when Silva (a weaker finisher) played as a false nine.

650~~~
How is that clear?
If anything, being on the wing allows him the space he needs. He's not great there but at least he isn't in the congested central area, where he struggles to keep hold of the ball and impose himself.

If his best ever season was at Chelsea, then that's not particularly relevant. Chelsea were crap, they lacked balance and gave him complete freedom. Not the makings of a top team. They also didn't play a possession game, which requires a different set of skills.

He basically showed that he's a great finisher and could directly assist goals (a good chunk being set pieces - Chelsea have been great in the air for years).
The bits you need other than that (that are arguably more important for a '10') - he doesn't have.

651~~~
I disagree with these two points in particular - Just 'cos the Chelsea side were poor (though how poor were they? worse then we are now?!) doesn't mean he wasn't great (he was) in that number 10, and I've seen him impose himself in loads of games, sometimes for us (Spurs Away, Liverpool Away are two that immediately spring to mind) but particularly for Chelsea (there was a game at Old Trafford I think in the FA Cup, where he absolutely ran the show in the second half).

652~~~
Is he back in the Spain squad then?

653~~~
His best games are almost always when he's scored. Mata completely running the show without scoring is/was a rarity.
He's great at what he does, which is scoring and directly assisting goals and he's pretty to watch, but he's not a good enough '10' for a top side. When you look at what a top side needs in a '10' (whether counter or possession football) - he's missing key parts.

He'd weaken City significantly if he replaced Silva, for example. Meanwhile, Isco, for example, would make us a better team, if he replaced Mata.

As for the games you mention:
Liverpool away - on the wing (where he's better) and it was his goals that made it special. Otherwise he was mostly part of a well oiled machine.

The FA Cup game against Chelsea - The 2-2? I remember Chelsea tearing us to shreds on the break mostly. Our ball retention was awful and the midfielders kept on gifting the ball to Chelsea with acres of space to sprint into.
Can't remember the exact Tottenham game you mention.

Of course there will be one or two examples, but not enough, in my opinion.

654~~~
I don't think he struggles to impose himself in the middle, as he showed last season and previously with Chelsea. I'd say he struggles more as a winger due to his lack of pace and strength which makes it almost impossible to make an impact in that right wing, leaving us dormant for most of the game.

You can't completely disregard his performances for Chelsea because they were crap, Januzaj also had complete freedom for us in that role, so it's not like we restrict our #10s, Mata was also given complete freedom in that our brilliant spell last season when AdM was on the bench.

Chelsea's average possession in that season was <b>55%</b>, which isn't significantly worse than our 2014/15 average of <b>58% </b>or our current average of <b>57%</b>, so it's not like they were misplacing passes or losing the ball every time they had it.

655~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker</a>

Both accurately define Mata i must admit, but he doesn't command that role as well as his Spanish counterpart does for City, he is more effective as an attacking midfielder with 2 pacey fingers wingers on each side.

656~~~
More about the manager's preference than anything else.

657~~~
That same lack of pace and strength hinders him in the middle too. In fact, being wide is of benefit, because it means he isn't surrounded. 

The fact that Chelsea were crap isn't even the main point. It's that they lacked balance and played a completely different style of play. 
Regardless of those possession stats. it's very clear that we position ourselves higher on the pitch, suffocate the opposition more, counter-attack less. The style we play isn't what Chelsea were playing during Mata's two good years. 

If you put men up close to Mata and give him the ball , Mata plays safe and sideways (regardless of whether he's central or wide). 
Whereas if you counter-attack and create space to play into, Mata doesn't have to hold the ball under pressure as much, and/or beat men with dribbling or strength as much. 

Most top teams face parked buses every week, so the '10' or the guy to build around (as people suggest) needs to be strong enough to keep hold of the ball, turn his man, dribble...
If the top team is playing counter-attacking football, then the 10 is usually require to relieve pressure via dribbling, and being an out ball - Mata isn't capable of this and his defensive game is also useless.

He did well at Chelsea - that's great. But Chelsea weren't particularly good and didn't play this system that van Gaal's team are playing. 
It wasn't just pace surrounding him on both sides (after all Oscar was the central player for one season) it was more a case of having space to play into. We don't have that.

658~~~
The weird thing is most see Mata as more of a second striker then a traditional #10 anyway. 

Tbh, from everything I understand about LVG's requirements for his #10, Mata seems perfect.

659~~~
yes he is

660~~~
Great news! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

661~~~
and he is ambitious

662~~~
Never mind that Mata, get on with the job of sweet talking De Gea into that new contract.

663~~~
Juan reactivated his YouTube channel <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> He's such a lovable guy.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZ8j79iWMuM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

664~~~
My guess is that while he sees players like Herrera and formerly Januzaj as being a <i>lot </i>better centrally than out wide, it's arguably quite even with Mata, who's fairly capable of doing well in a wide position. I'd struggle to see Herrera performing particularly well for us on the wing, for example.

665~~~
After our 1-2 at Anfield, Van Gaal hinted that it was down to a lack of balance which is a pretty good argument for not playing Mata as a #10. He's more effective as a #10 in a chaotic system (see Chelsea in 12/13), but if we're talking about the level of organisation that top level managers like Mourinho, Van Gaal, and Del Bosque want, then he's a very poor player to have in that position. And I'm not specifically talking about defensive work when I refer to organisation, which I think is overplayed in Mata's case. You don't drop players like him for that reason. Obviously it goes way deeper than that. I wouldn't say he's gone downhill since 12/13, but he's certainly not in the comfortable position he once was in and that's because the role he's had to play has exposed his limitations.

666~~~
I think it's more to due with the fact that he doesn't fancy anyone else on the right and I don't blame him. Mata is our best option there. He's pretty much our only option unless Martial can play there or if you want to use *shivers* Young or Valencia.

I like this photo.

675~~~
They look like brothers.

676~~~
Mata needs a big performance at the weekend. He's floating through the season so far and he's a much better player than that.

He needs to take a few more efforts on goal when he cuts inside instead of circulating the ball at every opportunity. He's more than capable.

677~~~
I'd be happy with an identical one from the last time we played Liverpool.

678~~~
3 goals in the last 2 games against the Scousers... reckon he'll be in amongst it again on Saturday.

679~~~
If that was Herrera, that would be my new wallpaper for the rest of my life.

680~~~
Disappointing today. Interesting to see that Ander went on the right, I wonder if we'll play that against PSV, with Fellaini/Rooney and Martial through the middle.

681~~~
Thought he was pretty good and felt it should have been Herrera to go off instead 
But it didn't matter in the end

682~~~
Was very poor aside from the freekick routine. Herrera wasn't much better but was more forceful

683~~~
Had a quiet first half but I thought he was getting better in the second half before getting replaced.

684~~~
he was meh.

685~~~
Hasn't really picked up has he. Still a bit "pointless" with the ball and it was right that he went off. Just doesn't show enough when he has the ball

686~~~
The freekick and subsequent celebration that it had come off were great. The rest was a bit...meh.

687~~~
He really struggles to impose himself. Sth like what we saw from Martial today would be unthinkable from our right hand side with Mata there.

688~~~
Doesn't do much these days, but passes and keeps the ball safely so Lvg won't drop him.

689~~~
Meh sums up today's performance pretty well alright.

690~~~
The only reason I gave him a point more than Memphis was his part in the freekick, as other than that he offered very little at all today.

691~~~
Very disappointing today. We can't have one side of our formation offer nothing.

692~~~
Was poor today I thought. Was a good decision to sub him off. Just didn't impose himself enough.

693~~~
Nothing performance. And I'm one of those that think he's had a decent season so far.

694~~~
I like him better when he drifts to the middle and has options around him instead of only either cross or dribble.

695~~~
Yep, I think he's been our best attacking player this season but today was definitely a bit of a no show.

696~~~
Was pointless today, nothing was coming from our right side. Even when he was drifting inside he just made some short passes to the nearest player.

697~~~
It would be helpful if attempted something purposeful with the ball when he drifts into central areas. Atm I think it's better if we try Lingard or Perreira on that RW because as it stands our right side of attack is dead.

698~~~
Yup. It would be refreshing to see us have a threat from both sides. But despite his lack of pace and ability to go on the outside, Mata has to be more pro-active. Complete passenger today. Tried nothing, did nothing.

699~~~
Had trouble, as he often does, getting on the ball against a team parking the bus. Normally a player like him just drops deeper and more central and links up but Van Gaal wants us more rigid than that. I could see Memphis and Young both starting when Van Gaal is sure the other team is going to sit 10 behind.

700~~~
Even I have to admit, not great yesterday but did a job. 6/10.

The pass to Blind though, while 'easy' still needs the perfect weight on the pass to make Blind's job easier. That's me taking the best positive I can.

701~~~
I rate mata, who doesn't. But I think him playing on the right is one of the reasons why we can't break down the teams who bring the bus. It's not his fault of course, he dies his job.

702~~~
Both Mata and Herrera were poor today.

703~~~
Thought he was poor today, almost invisible. Good stuff with the free kick though.

704~~~
From football365's 16 conclusions

<b>* </b>That first goal meant that Juan Mata had scored or assisted every one of Manchester United’s Premier League goals excluding the own goal against Tottenham. At a time when Wayne Rooney falters and many others flatter to deceive, Mata continues to be the jewel in an often unflattering crown. On form, he is United’s best outfield player.

I also regularly forget that Mata only turned 27 in April. Many more years of wonder to come.

705~~~
I imagine that was written before we scored the other 2? Herrera won the penalty for the 2nd and Young passed it to Martial for the 3rd

706~~~
I found it interesting that he has such a different view to the rest of us.

707~~~
The rest of us probably watch every United game...not sure about the football 365 guy

708~~~
In fairness that was only 3 goals

Assist for adnan, mata scored against Swansea and then today.

709~~~
Three goals. It is hardly some magnificent achievement, it is even worded in favour of him in saying 'excluding the Tottenham OG' when really you could just say, so not every game then. Haven't seen the second half but he did the usual in the first half that I saw. He is a massive problem at right forward and it is bordering on almost pointless playing him there. I've seen people saying he's our best attacker this season or something similar and that quite frankly is incredibly delusional.


The only thing that is of wonder is that at 27 it is scary to think that some of these performances give an obvious air that his legs are gone. But that could easily be attributed to the way LVG has the unit playing.

710~~~
He was ineffective, unfortunately. I really wanted him to play well.

711~~~
He needs to be in the team because he's one of our best players on the ball, but he's just not a very good winger.

He's a conundrum right now. I think its time to play him centrally and get some pace on both flanks.

712~~~
Clearly LVG doesn't rate Mata as a number 10, he's played Fellaini, Di Maria, Depay, Januzaj and now Herrera there ahead of him. Of course LVG's judgement isn't always sound but that really suggests something here, same with Mourinho. 

He's absolutely useless on the wing though. I don't care about his assists and goal stats, when I watch the game I see us struggling to break down teams and see Mata drifting ineffectively central and leaving Darmian isolated. I'd drop him for Young, and play Rooney behind Martial and then we'll start threatening teams.

713~~~
Great pass for the first goal. 1 goal and 3 assists in 7 games, no one else has been that productive.

714~~~
That's a shame, because they've been really bloody good since he's joined us.

715~~~
Ignore facts because your opinion is contrasting. Ok then.

716~~~
I genuinely think his best position is on the right drifting in.

717~~~
Its not like goals win games or anything.

718~~~
He's clearly not being asked to be a winger, and he's clearly not playing as one.

Do you genuinely think that Van Gaal says to him before every game 'get chalk on your boots and get crosses in' and yet still continues to pick him week in, week out when he spends the majority of his game in an inside right channel?

719~~~
Stats don't tell the whole story. He got an assist yesterday and had no influence on the game otherwise. Stats don't tell you the counterfactual either, ie how many more chances and goals would we score if Mata could actually get away from his man & looked to link up with Darmian better. And another fact we can all agree on is how slow, safe and turgid our attack is, and to my mind Mata is one of the biggest culprits. He's a much better footballer than Ashley Young for example but look at what having a bit of pace & ambition does in terms of effectiveness.

720~~~
But thats the problem right there, the lack of a proper winger on the right makes the team very lopsided, and pretty much makes the right hand side a non factor when it comes to attacking. All our play is coming down the left because thats the only position we have a player that can beat a man. 

I like Mata central, and I'd play him there. But with a winger on either side. It doesn't have to be a traditional, line hugging winger, just someone with pace and skill who can offer a threat down the right.

Personally I'd quite like to see Young and Memphis on either wing, problem is, they both prefer the left.

721~~~
I like him and he is quality. But he offers nothing much on our right hand side which makes us look unbalance.

722~~~
I knew van Gaal wouldn't sell Mata, but I thought that he would play at 10 this season. I guess his physicality is more of a hindrance there or something? 

I'm starting to like him as RW though, no he hasn't got alot of pace but he brings pinpoint passing in the final 3rd- something the rest of the team are absolutely dreadfull at right now. With his freedom to roam all over the pitch he can be of influence and very important to the team, with Darmian being an excellent defender we're not even that weak defensively down the right which is a plus. He has his limitations but what he brings to the team is much more important for van Gaal right now, he's basically involved in every attack.

723~~~
I don't think he's supposed to be offering the threat down that side, it's supposed to come from the over-lapping full back and the AM (Herrera yesterday) occupying that space when Mata does come inside. 

I don't think it's Mata's problem, really, and more an issue of unfamiliarity with Darmian. Last season Valencia, for all his faults, did do a decent job of giving us width from that area, the problem is that Valencia's delivery and lack of talent in the final third meant he might as well not have bothered. 

The more Mata and Darmian play together the more productive an area that right hand side will become.

724~~~
I'm surprised people seem to be generally pleased with his league performances. For me he stifles any directness or urgency about our attack the moment he gets the ball and rarely if ever plays these final passes that people talk about. Not a fan, wish he was great for us though. I genuinely think we'd have more joy with Young on the right wing.

725~~~
We're struggling for goals yet some people want us to drop our most productive player? Glad you guys aren't in charge.

As for our attack being lopsided, that's kinda what happens when you play with a false winger isn't it? Not like asymmetrical formations are that unusual...

726~~~
I just think its over complicating things for no reason. Rather then relying on Darmian or Herrera providing the width when Mata goes wondering, why not just play an actual winger there who can provide that? And play Mata play centrally in the space where he's roaming into anyway?

727~~~
I'm just amazed you seem to find it so weird. 

David Silva's played that role for City for absolutely years and he's worshiped on here.

728~~~
David Silva is a much better player then Mata, who has the ability to dribble and continually beat a player. Something Mata can't do, and something that massively hinders our attack when he has the ball on the right, and always has to look for a pass. Its easy to defend against, and results in our slow build up play.

The difference Young made yesterday when he came on and starting running at the defence (Martial too) was night and day. Thats what we need on the wing.

729~~~
So the issue is that you don't think Mata is good enough, not where he's lining up then? Because the 'issues' you seem to have with him playing from the right aren't going to be miraculously solved by him playing at 10. I don't see how anything I've written in bold relates at all to where he is playing.

730~~~
You don't have to be a great dribbler to be a great #10.

731~~~
So why is that any different when he's nominally lining up on the right but doing the vast majority of his work in the exact same areas as he would be if he was playing as a 10?

This is his heat map from the first game of last season vs Swansea where he was definitely a number 10.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/3Uveb2f.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/3Uveb2f.jpg"/>

I can't find one for yesterday, but I would be surprised if it wasn't almost identical. So how is his lack of dribbling an issue in one position but not an issue in another?

It's just an invented criticism, as is pretty much everything thrown against Mata from the right. The fact some people seem to genuinely want Valencia playing over him there is staggering.

732~~~
Jesus, this is getting tedious.

The issue <span style="text-decoration: underline"><i>isn't</i></span> what he's doing once he's central, its that to get central he leaves the right wing with no one attacking there. THAT is the issue. The right wing is unoccupied. There is no threat from there.

And second, when he is on the right, isolated with the fullback, he's very limited. He's not going to beat the defender, so he's either going to pass it backwards/inside, or wait for an overlap, which is easy to defend against. Thats far less of an issue in the centre of the pitch where he's not going to be isolated one on one with a defender all that often.

exactly, he's great poacher and has an eye for a pass, also can come little bit deeper and control the game, dead ball specialist, great technical player with some flair when he turns it on. I understand people call for a faster more direct palyer on that right hand side but it has more to do with the possession tactics set by Van Gaal, Mata would be actually pretty good if we countered quickly and he had all the space to run at and mainly where to put final ball. 

I dont' think he's ideal but he's the best we have on the right right now and unless we change our pace when setting up counters and in final third we will see this kind of performances from Mata, right now he's just effective player we need but he can be really nice to watch if we turn on as a team.

734~~~
For some reason I think he's one of the first names on the team sheet regardless of the position. LVG wants him on the pitch. I don't mind him on the right and you can always rely on him to provide goals and assists. But he was poor yesterday. Didn't seem to get on the ball as much as he usually does.

735~~~
It would be less tedious if you didn't insist on making this a circular argument and bringing up points that I've already addressed. I don't really know why you bothered to type out two paragraphs of stuff you've already said tbh.

This was said about you earlier but its abundantly clear in this discussion too:

You obviously believe there is only one way to play football, and any attempt to argue with you that there is more than one way to skin the proverbial cat is just a waste of time. No Mata, is not a pacy, powerful wide man. If thats the only person you think should be allowed to play on our right wing then fine, I simply disagree with you and am happy with Mata.

736~~~
Our play often loses momentum when the ball reaches him as if there isn't an immediate pass on he has to come backwards with the ball as he can't dribble and has no speed to go past a player and drive the attack on. There's no doubt that he can have very effective moments within games, but a lot of the time I find him incredibly frustrating and a passenger.

737~~~
If it makes you feel better, why not just think of Mata as a #10 who occasionally helps out on the right, whilst Darmian is a right-wingback who has the flank all to himself?

That's the way I look at the team. It may be an asymmetrical formation, but that's the least of our problems, imo. Posters here put far too much stock into what a winger or a #10 is 'supposed' to do and how formations are 'supposed' to look.

The only way it'd be a problem is if either Darmian or Mata were uninvolved as a result of where they're played. On the contrary, they're probably two of our most influential players. My only issue would be with the tempo of the latter's passing, but I think that's more down to LvG's philosophy than anything else. I'm quite happy with our lop-sided formation.

738~~~
Because that still leaves us an attacker short on the right hand side, which is a massive issue.

We need someone on the right, doing what Young did on the left yesterday (preferably to a higher level mind). Playing at pace, taking defenders on, and putting the opposition defence on the back foot. To much of our attack is played in front of the oppositions defence because we don't have anyone that can penetrate them or run beyond them. Its easy to defend against, and for the defence to keep their shape, and plays a major part in why we're not opening teams up. All our threatening attacks also only come down the left too, and I'm not really sure how you, or anyone else, can be happy with that. I can't help but feel its because everyone likes Mata, wants him in the team, so is willing to accept/ignore the obvious problems his lack of pace and penetration causes. Fwiw, I want Mata in the team too, just not on the wing.

The difference Young and Marcial made yesterday was night and day with the first half. We'd look a far, far, more threatening team with genuine pace and penetration on both wings, not just one.

739~~~
van Gaal seems to like him and prefer him on the right. He wasn't the problem yesterday as our two forwards from the low countries were both far worse.

740~~~
These two points are contradictory. Either he is on the wing or he isn't.

To me, it looks as though we're set up like a 3-5-2 on the right hand side (with a single wingback and a narrow AM) and a 4-4-2 on the left hand side (with a fullback overlapping his winger). What we lose in width, we make up for with an extra presence in the middle. Both formations have their strengths and LvG is mixing and matching his approach for the personnel at his disposal.

I can understand wanting a traditional, United style pair of wingers, but I'd rather have our best 11 players on the pitch. When judging Mata's role, I only question how much he contributes. The answer is 'a lot'. That's something we should want to keep in the side.

Our problems are more down to tempo and a lack of movement. When Young came on, our system stayed the same. When Martial came on, again, our system stayed the same (only this time with Herrera as the 'winger'). It just goes to show that our lack of urgency is the real issue. A lop-side midfield isn't.

741~~~
I thought Mata did pretty well yesterday, set up a couple players earlier on..

742~~~
Is it impossible to consider that Liverpool shut up shop on the right considering what happened in the two previous meetings? Rodgers neutralised Mata and thats why we went to attack on the left and when Anders shifted there (a different type of player) we manage to push their defence and got a penalty.

743~~~
He's being deployed as a Right Inside Forward. The problem that <a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a> is referring to is that he spends to much time inside and not enough time forward. If he were to be playing as a 10, he'd play in a position that suits where he is currently playing, as well the attributes that make his use of his abilities but we'd also have a right sided player that spends most of his time forward and taking on the left fullback and stretching the defensive line to give more balance.

It isn't a blight on Mata or his ability, he simply is not that positionally disciplined and gets bogged down with his lack of mobility putting out fires from deep and inside instead of being up forward with the attack moving it on when he is supposed to be.
That is not what he is saying, he is saying he doesn't want him to play Right Inside Forward, he wants him to play 10 or not at all.
It is a pretty simple solution, either tell him to stay forward and pressure his man more, give him freedom to start and continue counter attacks or remove him from the Right Forward position and play him elsewhere or leave him on the bench. So far he has been very ineffective at Right Inside Forward and a couple of assists and a goal mask that completely. Against Liverpool he again had a very poor game and was largely anonymous. He's really been going backwards since the start of the season and I would not be surprised if he is starting to get phased out of the team with the couple of substitutions that have come recently. The role he's trying to play and not doing well is quite problematic when you look at how unbalanced the attack is and how little time Mata spends forward linking the attack.

The answer is not 'a lot'. Frankly I have no idea how you could come to that conclusion whilst your above statement says we've had to contort the system in a gnarled and rigid way just so you can make comments on Mata's game being viable. It might as well be that the guy simply isn't a right forward and is struggling to the point where it unbalances our attack. He's getting stuck behind play and having to come inside for a safe option more times than not because of his lack of pace and willingness to pressure the fullback.

744~~~
Good post. I don't really understand what most posters really want to happen. Are they really suggest we either:
<ul>
<li>Drop Mata and play Young from the right; or</li>
<li>Drop Herrera, move Mata inside and play Young from the right</li>
</ul>Either one of these scenarios takes our two most productive attacking players out of the team and replaces them with someone who is one of the least productive attackers in our squad. Basically we'd be swapping goals, chances and assists for a bit more width on the right hand side. It seems like a lot of posters aren't adapting to a new style of play that doesn't include a Beckham on the right and a Giggs on the left (which is strange because even Fergie deviated from this this when allowing Ronaldo to spend most of his time cutting inside).

745~~~
What does Young have to do with Mata? I don't think anybody is saying we should move him to the right, because it's common knowledge he does ten Times better on the left. The problem is that if we don't have any options on the right wing. At all.

746~~~
I think people find it hard to understand how a team plays with a false winger. They keep comparing our style to how a team sets up with two conventional wingers. When a false winger plays, no matter how good he is. The concentration of attacks will always be through the side with the conventional winger. He is the outlet. Sky put up an opta stat for Man city a couple of weeks ago to show how their attack was when Silva plays as a false winger. In the past two seasons, over 50% of Cuity's attackes have come from Jesus Navas side. This is despite everyone acknowledges that David silva being one of the best in the world.
The vast majority of Barcelona's attacks com from the left side despite having the best player in the world on the right. The problem with our attack isn't that it comes majorly from the left but the pace of the attack needs to improve vastly.
As I said earlier in the thread, I don't have an issue with him on the right, he gets more space there and he comes up with goals and assists. However our attackers need to move it around quicker and that includes him.

747~~~
I'm not so convinced about that... I think Mata is plugging a gaping hole in the squad on the right wing. I agree he has not been at his best in that role but realistically who else could play there for us? We have a lack of options and IMO he needs to be in the starting line up.

748~~~
Excellent post. It goes back to people seeing something which is not the 'United way' they are never going to be happy unless we see two wingers fly down the flanks. I agree the speed of the attack is awful, no wonder we struggle to break teams down.

749~~~
People are saying we need width on the right hand side. That implies that either Young would replace him on the right side or Memphis moves over from the left and Young comes in on the left. The net result of this to the team is Young in, Mata or Herrera out.

750~~~
Whatever he is he's ridiculously productive, scored or assisted 3 games in a row now..

751~~~
I'm sorry your post isn't welcome here.

What you meant to write was a paragraph of drivel about the United way, thump your chest a few times and find 37 ways to say 'pace and width'.

But seriously on your last point do you think its Mata's fault that he doesn't move the ball quickly enough or a problem of a lack of movement around him? I think he moves the ball quickly enough when players make themselves available for him but dallies on it too long when there is a lack of obvious pass on which, sadly, happens too often.

752~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I think it's a collective problem and I don't blame Mata for it. I have noticed that the distance between our attackers is quite often too big so there is little hope of some combination play in and around the penalty box.

753~~~
Halle-fecking-lujah!!

How is that so difficult for some people to get their head around?

754~~~
One of the problems with Mata's position is that Darmian isn't a wing back, or at least hasn't really shown that he can play as one yet. I see him more as a traditional full back who overlaps his winger and puts a cross it, but that sort of combination doesn't happen much with Mata's current role. Darmian has the whole wing to himself which means it falls to him to make runs with the ball. I don't know if he has that in him.

755~~~
Would work better if we just played with a guy that could play the right attacker better than Mata.

756~~~
He is seemingly too productive to actually leave out, but then again as a direct comparison, Herrera is very productive too in addition to being an all action midfielder who can press and defend. I just feel at times he's too easily nullified on the right in terms of being a general and consistent thread. Having one side completely shut down isn't ideal.

757~~~
It's tough because on one hand there is no threat from the right hand side and it's to easy for teams to defend against him but he is productive. At some point he surely has to be given a chance in a central role because eventually we are going to need a better option on the right wing and so far no one has really nailed down that role behind Rooney.

758~~~
Of course, I didn't want to give the impression my problem was with Darmian, who I think is a fine player. Just that if we want to play Mata there in that role it requires a different sort of full back to funtion really well. We simply don't have a suitable right wing combination at the moment.

I am not really sure, I think people see words like "winger" and "out wide" and automatically think that your wide players have to play as wide as possible and run down the outside and whip crosses in constantly. But it isn't really the case here, all you have to do is look at Depay and Young and how they play their role and assume that to give balance to the team that Juan Mata has to be doing the exact same thing. Which he clearly isn't, he's out of position a lot I have found and tends to stay back and slow down our counters as well as ball watch from deep while we go forward. It is as though he must hold Darmians hand through everything.

I know it is harsh but logically looking at his game right now it is as though he knows himself that his legs are gone and instead of actually trying to take his fullback on he retains possession the majority of the time. For someone playing a pivotal forward role that simply isn't good enough. He has more passes backwards than he does forwards as well.

I can also logically deduce that his poor positional sense also led him to being dropped from the 10 role last year. Although probably harshly with how much of a mess we were in the 3-5-2 and the wide players not really having a clue how to operate properly, I'd like to see him play 10 in a 4-2-3-1 but at the same time, Herrera has 10x the amount of mobility on and off the ball. It would be rather pointless to swap them in my opinion.

764~~~
I'm sorry Sam, I know you're agreeing with it because its another way to complain about pace and width but surely you can see its pseudo-intellectual nonsense.

What does the quote 'he spends too much time inside and not enough time forward' actually mean? Those things aren't mutually exclusive.

Taking it on face value though, a look at our relative positions vs Liverpool shows that Mata, actually, was our second most advanced player behind Depay during the Liverpool match and actually spent more time 'forward' than Young did (presumably Ashley Young is a player you'd like to see over Mata on the right).

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/ZuwlpLq.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/ZuwlpLq.png"/>

So Mata actually spent most of his time both forward <i>and </i>inside, probably quite unexpectedly for a player being asked to play on the inside right channel. If you want Mata to not be in the team and instead favour a traditional right winger who will isolate his full back and cross the ball then fine. BUT JUST SAY THAT. Don't pretend like it's an enlightened critique of the failures of Mata to perform as a playmaker from the right because its not.

765~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/319e" width="560"></iframe>

766~~~
Well he can be criticized for his performances as a playmaker too. He deserves praise because he's one of our most productive players in terms of end product but he hasn't been a great playmaker for us. We don't have great options, but ideally if he can't provide a genuine threat to the fullback using pace and dribbling ability, then he should be getting on the ball, dictating and running the show.m

At the same time, I'd like to see him playing with Martial and Depay to his left. Maybe more pace around him will help him showcase creativity.

767~~~
Top player and doing a job but he isn't a traditional right winger, he will cut inside and cover similar ground to an AM, that's fine if the AM will interchange and drift wide, like Di Maria was supposed to do, but the AM's we have prefer the center, for me shouldn't be a right winger but the problem as we know is our lack of actual right wingers. 

Wing - 1. Depay 2. Young 
Attacking Mid - 1. Mata 2. Herrera

Assuming we aren't considering Valencia a winger anymore. In terms of wingers, we have so many unknown's who may well outperform in that position, despite not being as accomplished, rounded as Mata. Players such as Pereira, Wilson, Lingard and not that I love the idea, but Shaw if Rojo can cover LB adequately.

I love Mata, but he shouldn't be considered for a wide position with one striker as we need the width.

768~~~
You have to look back at the previous games to see what is being discussed.



Plus if you look at his dashboard from the Liverpool game it is absolutely dreadful. There is barely anything in the attacking third.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/0cC2KUr.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/0cC2KUr.jpg"/>

That isn't what he's saying, that is what you think he (we) wan't. Nobody is pretending to critique some pseudo scientific view of our football. He's not playing forward enough and not influencing our play in a dynamic way. That is the bare fact, people seem to want to use pseudo science to explain that he's a false winger, inside 10 in some sort of magical formation where we don't play a right inside forward for a reason. We don't, Mata has just been poor.

769~~~
Even his end product this season has not been that great at right inside forward. Two assists, one from a set piece and one from so far out of position. His goal was a back post tap in as well. He has been quite productive in the past though. He's also had a couple of really good low shots saved. I'd like to see more of that and less pointless back passing in our circle on our side of half way.

770~~~
I think given the circumstances he is a pretty productive player, at least relative to our team. I'm guessing the percentage of his contribution would be quite high in the games he's played. But yeah, with Mata, the concerns are different. It's what he does the rest of the game that needs to be improved, or alternated with in some games.

771~~~
We don't need <b>width</b>, we need someone to attack from the right wing. If Mata roams around, only Darmian stays on the right side, and for obvious reasons he will be reserved in his actions.

Obviously, Mata is not a winger so nobody expects him to bomb down the wing ala Tony. Last year he was a false/inverted winger and I thought that role suited him perfectly- he played high up the pitch, he could link up with RB, Herrera or striker, could utilize his excellent positioning and finishing (he has striker instincts). This season he's been playing different role, doing simple things most of the time, which he's so good at. He isn't even that influential for our play, but I have a feeling he's one of the first names on the team sheet because of moments of effectiveness. He's the kind of player who can play shit game but still manages to grab a goal, so it's understandable. It happens quite often so I don't blame van Gaal, I just think we could do better if he played like last season.

This is clearly van Gaal instructions so I don't blame Juan, but I don't like him in that role at all. I really don't understand how playing Mata so deep benefits the team in general, especially that we have proper midfield right now and we don't really need him there. I hope Young goes back to the team and we play like we did last season, with Mata staying high up the pitch instead of being everywhere else then on the right wing. Surely if van Gaal wants him in the team, he would be more effective playing higher on the wing?

Who cares if it's a symmetrical formation or not, the point is we have nobody attacking from the right wing and I find it bizarre that so many people don't see a problem with that. We’re having real troubles with scoring goals from open play- so far we’ve scored 3 goals in 4 EPL games. Maybe that has something to do with attacking only from the left.

Amen, I agree 100%.

772~~~
What circumstances? True, relative to our team. Or are those the circumstances? (not having a dig just curious)

773~~~
Yup.

774~~~
He hasn't been playing a different role at all. The heat maps from various games show that he's one of our furthest forward players. I have no idea where people are getting this idea that he's playing ridiculously deep.

775~~~
They probably have in mind his awful mistakes in our own half, because otherwise he plays very high. Personally I have a problem with his passing game, he keeps making those dangerous lateral passes and totally refuses to make the vertical ones.

776~~~
What heat maps?

777~~~
The one against Liverpool that shows him further forward than our centre forward?

The one against Newcastle that shows him practically in line with our centre forward?

The one against Swansea that shows him practically in line with our centre forward?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s4.postimg.org/slb30ro63/Heat_maps.png" src="http://s4.postimg.org/slb30ro63/Heat_maps.png"/>

778~~~
Since the moment he signed, I couldn't wait for him to play for us in Europe, missed out on that season due to being cup tied. Can't wait to see him out there, could really see the best of him.

Well I hope.

779~~~
Right, but none of those position maps show anything other than he's very far forward (typically the second or third most advanced player) and that he's very much playing inside. Neither of those support your statement that 'he's too much inside and not enough forward' and you still haven't begun to explain exactly what you meant by it.

In fact, you've pretty much just shown exactly what anyone who has watched us this season should be able to tell, he is not a winger, he is not playing like a winger, and he is not expected to be one. 

My point, which I feel like you've missed. Isn't that I think Mata's been brilliant, I agree with your point that he didn't have a particularly great game against Liverpool and <a class="username" data-user="4910, @amolbhatia50k" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4910/">@amolbhatia50k</a> that we should be seeing more of his play making abilities because he's <i><span style="text-decoration: underline">clearly</span></i> being picked for that reason (although I would add that I think the lack of pace and movement around him is a far bigger mitigating factor than is being given credit for).

Rather, my point is I find it incredibly frustrating to see Mata criticised for not doing things that he's not being asked to do and that aren't expected of him. It's akin to saying that Chris Smalling has had an appalling season because he's yet to score a goal. I have no problem whatsoever with the idea that we might be better off with a more traditional winger, I don't know if thats true but as an idea its fine, I have no problem whatsoever with people criticising Mata's performances for the role he's being picked for.

What I do have a problem with is people criticising Mata for not giving us width, for not taking on his full-back, for Van Gaal for picking Mata 'on the wing' etc... because none of those things are expected of him and he's clearly not playing there.

And what I find most frustrating is people having pops at Mata for this issue when he has, once again, been our most productive attacking threat and, by a long distance the least worrisome of our issues in the final third. I find it perverse in a season where we're struggling to create chances and score goals that our most likely player to create chances and score goals is the one player the most people seem to have the knives out for.

780~~~
Criticising and nitpicking Juan Mata whilst Wayne Rooney seemingly gets away with murder with some our supporters during his shocking start to the season, is right up there with the worst this forum could produce. 

As has already been said by others, he is the least troublesome part of our attack. He's downright excellent. He needs to start every single game.

781~~~
De Telegraaf say he's going to play No 10 today.

782~~~
Fecking brilliant that reaction from him and Young. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Great video, cheers.

783~~~
Oooh, that would be interesting.

Maybe LVG will be more willing to play him as a #10 in Europe?

784~~~
I think he's mostly played well today, though judging by the match thread this seems to be a very unpopular opinion....

Edit: I did find it hard to focus after the Shaw injury though tbf.

785~~~
He's been utterly useless and pointless.

786~~~
Had enough of him. 
Fair weather player, frustrating, totally inconsistent, careless in possession. He pops up with the odd world class assist/goal & the Caf creams themselves.
He's been totally underwhelming since he's arrived.

787~~~
Play him at number 10 they said....

788~~~
For all the shite Rooney gets on here, Mata is seriously pointless.

Can't play on the wing. Too lightweight for number 10 and midfield. Had it with him.

789~~~
This is the Juan Mata performance thread. If you want to spew agenda driven bile about Rooney go and do it one of the seventy other Rooney threads on the board.

790~~~
Not good enough sorry.

791~~~
Ironically, looked as though he's playing out of position. No clue at AM.

792~~~
So bad today. 

Actually i dont think he has been very good since joining United. He had a lot of bad/invisible games during his time but masked some of them with a goal or assist.

793~~~
Woeful today. Worst game he's ever had for us I reckon.

794~~~
But he's Juan Mata, sexy beard and all, he MUST be good.

Terrible for us. Exactly as you said, has a run of invisible games, masks it with a simple assist here and a goal there, but generally terrible in his play in the team.

795~~~
fecking disgraceful.

Piss off.

796~~~
Don't think he was near as bad as, say, Herrera was in the CL game a few weeks ago. Think some people are overly hard on Mata.

797~~~
Bit of a pointless player, dont hope to see him start anytime soon.

798~~~
What a stinker. Unbelievable he wasnt subbed off

799~~~
I love Mata but he was absolutely terrible. Worst I've ever seen him.

800~~~
Always looking for the extra touch and pass, often unnecessarily.

Time to leave him out.

801~~~
Aside from the Villa game it's been the same old story. Looks good but does absolutely nothing only to be relentlessly praised on the caf for his mythical link up play.

802~~~
omg was he awful today or what!

803~~~
Piss poor today.

804~~~
Absolutely shocking today really. Sloppy passes, and then refusing to shoot when getting the chance and just passing it on. One of his worst games for us I think. In his #10 position too, which everyone on here was calling out for.

805~~~
Worst performance in a United shirt.

806~~~
What an absolute shite game from him.

807~~~
Imagine if we had Pedro on the right instead?

808~~~
He was terrible.

809~~~
Heart of a pea! Looking forward to Rooneys return!

810~~~
The myth that he is best as a 10 lives on. Even despite another 90 mins of evidence against it

811~~~
That was a genuinely abominable performance. Hideous.

812~~~
At least I hope the #10 talk stops now.

813~~~
Today just reaffirms why he plays on the wing. He plays on the fringes of the game, he's an impact player. Always has been which is why he's spent most of his career out wide.

814~~~
Gets the ball, turns inside and plays a pointless pass. Repeat.

815~~~
Spot fecking on.

816~~~
Really a nothing performance from him today and he completely fluffed a chance that BFS served up for him on a plate.  I'd prefer to start Young and Memphis on the wings and play Herrera behind the striker.

817~~~
I been saying it from the start; our RW is a cause of alot of our problems.  It's not mata's fault either but he's pretty useless there unless he plays in his natural position. 

Without a RW like how depay plays on the left our attack is lopsided and very easy to mark out.

818~~~
He rarely does anything. He's hugely overrated on here. Chelsea robbed us of £37.1 million. He's so slow and dithers on the ball like David Moyes in the transfer market. In an ideal world he'd be a bench option at best. Or sell him.

819~~~
An absolute passenger, and has been for a while, and fecked up every time he got near the goal. Absolutely dreadful tonight.

820~~~
Careful, you're kneejerking. He's a great player for Man Utd by that, according to some experts on here.

821~~~
Another unjustified criticism on here, typical Caf. The truth is what he really needs is Messi, Ronaldo and Robben around him. Then he will really flourish…

Seriously though, play him on the right or don't play him at all. People need to accept his limitations, which I believe LvG already knows and that’s why he spent majority of pre-season and EPL so far looking for solution in no10 position.

822~~~
He was playing as a #10.

823~~~
His worst game for us. Nothing was clicking, really had high hopes on him taking the #10 position by storm.

824~~~
Spineless performance. Shove your hugs.

825~~~
Nice guy, looks neat, technically very good but contributes absolutely NOTHING. Weak, slow and wants 8 touches when 1 will do

826~~~
We're a possession team that struggles to scores goals. I'd have thought a player who keeps the ball well while also getting a lot of goals/assists is pretty much the opposite of pointless.

Obvious that this thread ain't going in that direction though.

Definitely don't get the notion that he doesn't get criticised here mind, he has plenty of doubters.

827~~~
People saying we don't have the strikers upfront to score goals, but how much of that 'lack of a cutting edge' comes from Mata fannying about on the ball?
He's fecking useless. Not fit to lace David Silvas boots.

828~~~
What a shocker Mata had tonight our worst player for me can't remember him doing anything right.

829~~~
If you look at our goalscoring rate under Moyes before Mata arrived, then look at our goalscoring rate with him on the pitch and then our goalscoring rate when he's been missing, the obvious conclusion is to wonder why on earth we spent £37m for him.

830~~~
Terrible performance, but some of the overreaction is delightful.

I mean "he rarely does anything for us" really? That's factually incorrect.

831~~~
Should have buried BFS's fantastic pass. What a let down his attempt to control the ball was.

832~~~
Do you have these stats? I'd be interested to see them.

I wanted to see him as a #10 and like many others on here was excited by today's line up. Shows what we know.

833~~~
£40m flop.

834~~~
Wasn't his best game but the reaction on here is crap. He was always trying to create it just wasn't coming off. 

A bad day in the office for him. The Schweinsteiger pass summed it up. He should of came off for Morgan to help kill the threat of PSV on the counter and push Ander further up the field.

835~~~
Just confirms that he can't play as a number 10 in a possession system.

Maybe he can play there in a counter attacking system with more space, but not in a possession system. He's best out wide then.

836~~~
Pops up with a goal now and then but its not that far off the mark, after his first season where he still had some cutting edge

837~~~
Both chances he missed he was coming in from the right.

838~~~
Decent performance in the first half. Abominable in the second. What he does at the end of the Schweinsteiger pass is criminal.

839~~~
It's a bit more often then every now and then when you look at goals and assists. 

But I mean, its fairly obvious that this was an off day... I mean, look at that chance in the second half, are you telling me that Mata normally wouldn't a) control that ball and/or b) bury it?

840~~~
He was asleep today. Taking touches when he needed to pass, too slow to shoot, not shooting when he had to, just a very strange performance. You need to be more alive and aware to the situation when you're chasing a game.

841~~~
Play him at no10... so he finally does and hes was shite <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Kagawa all over again

842~~~
Judging by the posts here and in the matchday thread, one would think Mata turned in one of the worst performances ever in a game. There is always insane overreaction here after a loss. Yes, Mata didn't play well today. Yes, he should've scored off that Schweinsteiger pass or passed it to Memphis at least. But for most of the game (until the last 20-30 minutes), his play was fine, and he definitely looked better set up as a #10 than as a right winger who drifts to the middle. It allowed Young and Memphis to stay wide, and the potential of our wing play looked better (it's another matter that Young didn't play well from the right). I would still like to see him in the #10 role, and hopefully he'll be better next time. People want to kill him for slowing down our play, yet Schweinsteiger and Blind were both far more guilty of that today.

843~~~
Calm down guys. Granted he was really really bad today, he has still been playing well. I mean for christ sakes, he has created most of our chances and assisted a bunch of our goals. It was a bad game, these things happen.

844~~~
Would say give Rooney a shot at 10 when he's back. Although if you let Mata get used to the position again I think he'll be the better option. 

Had a bad game today, nothing more nothing less.

845~~~
Forget the missed chance, that can happen to anyone but once again he created absolutely nothing. It's general theme of his United performances. I thought the only thing stopping him from creating chances was a lack of pace. Doesn't even have that excuse now...

846~~~
He was very poor. But let's be honest, he has not been playing well this season so far. I would have benched him some time ago, this game doesn't make a difference

847~~~
You're doing it wrong. He's obviously not good enough and has been shown up by all our other wonderful attacking players. We should be playing Young or Valencia ahead of him as they're far better unless you overvalue minor details like goals and assists.

848~~~
I don't see a place for him in our starting line up in all honesty.

849~~~
That's not true. He had at least a couple good passes to Memphis in the first half.

850~~~
I thought he dropped deep far too often, especially with Herrera in midfield.

851~~~
It's his lack of directness that's the problem.

852~~~
This. First thing he does is turn back ffs.
Also lets not say LVG coaching because Memphis Young and Martial don't do that

853~~~
Oh god, here come the reactions. 

Juan, stay off the internet until next week, put your feet up and enjoy a hot chocolate.

854~~~
I'm not saying you're wrong, but Herrera's been doing it quite a bit too  - especially against Liverpool... as was Depay actually.

855~~~
Depay wasn't doing it that often and gave the ball away a number of times due to attempting to take on his man or do a trick flick. Herrera was playing CM....

856~~~
But it coincides with him playing his "best position", like last season where he got a bunch of games there and made nothing happen. And I dont believe its an impressive amount if you disregard his first half season at the club, where he was our more creative player.

857~~~
Against Liverpool? Herrera was playing AM

858~~~
I was talking about today.

859~~~
Herrera did the same while playing at #10.

860~~~
Januzaj didn't

861~~~
Well I've never been convinced that #10 is his best position - I did want to see him giving a go there - largely because we seem to be giving everyone else a shot... but I'm happy with him on the right, he gives us a different option, gets goals and assists, and can really come into games to good effect (like the second half against Newcastle)... he just needs to do it more consistently. But then literally all our attackers suffer from consistency...

862~~~
And look where he's gone!

863~~~
"Once again"...I swear to God Redcafe fans are hilarious.
Say how about the time he played a wonderful pass to Junuzaj that won us the game against Aston Villa?
Say how about the time Mata was our ONLY creative and dominant outlet vs Newcastle that should have had at least 4 assists that game if it wasn't for our poor finishing.
Say how about that time he scored against Swansea to give us a fighting chance of getting back into the game?
Say how about the time he assisted Daley Blind's goal against Liverpool that put us ahead by 1?

Come on guys. Enough with the bs.

864~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> true

865~~~
He did none of that playing at 10 just saying, maybe he is just better out on the right with licence to drift in

EDIT: Everytime I have seen him play 10 for us he has been shite

866~~~
For the first hour we looked quite good when it came to chance creation, but is that solely in spite of Mata? Had a poor game but given our options I wouldn't mind seeing him at number 10 again.

867~~~
Hardly the biggest sample size to judge him at #10. A few games at the start of last season in a badly malfunctioning 3-5-2 and one game this season where he was just generally off the pace.

He didn't mess up that Schweinsteiger pass because he was playing at #10, he messed it up because he was off his game at that stage generally.

868~~~
Takes too many touches on the ball which slows us down.

869~~~
He's annoyingly cautious for someone who's primary role is to create. If he has no pace and he turns and passes the ball backwards the majority of the time then I'm not really sure what he offers. Seems to get an easy ride form United fans for some reason. His form has been patchy at best since he joined.

870~~~
He is a player too reliant on others.

Tbf did some good things today as well but then went missing or just crumbled when he needed to be counted. Too Spineless of a player if that makes sense.

871~~~
Strongly agree. Honestly as much as he is a really likeable fella, he doesn't half drive me up the wall sometimes as a footballer. I tend to keep quiet about it as he's so popular but honestly I think a decent amount of our laboured attacking play can be attributed to him and the way he plays the game. Nowhere near direct enough and way too hesitant to pull the trigger.

872~~~
He was utter shit for the last 30 minute or so and should have been subbed, but he was ok before that. Not great, but not terrible either.

873~~~
Juan Mata has been fairly productive as a number 10 for us.
In 1192 minutes(13.4 full games)(14 apps)(excluding this game) He has scored 7 goals and 4 assists as a number ten.
That is a goal or assist every 108 minutes..

874~~~
Mata problem is he always want to create chance rather then thinking of scoring,
The chances he miss is really annoying.

875~~~
Figures for PL matches only.

Under Moyes before Mata arrived 36 goals in 22 games. With Mata on the pitch that season we scored 23 in almost 14 full games (90 mins). Mata missing (didn't start or been substituted) 5 goals in just over 2 full games (against weak opponents)

Under LVG last season. Team scored 62 in 38 games. Mata on the pitch 41 goals in 27(6) appearances which works out as just under 26 full games (90 mins). Mata missing 21 goals in just over 12 full games.

This season Mata on the pitch 4 goals in 4.5 games. Mata missing 2 goals in 0.5 games.

So in each of the seasons he has been at the club, we have been scored at a slightly higher rate when Mata hasn't been in the team. Overall since Moyes arrived, with Mata 68 in 44 full games, without 64 in 37 full games. Mata at the club but not on the pitch, 28 in 15 games.

Stats from transfermarkt. Need to select the season then take a close look at whether he was on the pitch when goals were scored.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/juan-mata/leistungsdaten/spieler/44068/plus/?saison=2014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/juan-mata/leistungsdaten/spieler/44068/plus/?saison=2014</a>

Nice guy. Talented footballer. But to my mind, the sample size is too large to be ignored.

876~~~
Mata is a handy little player, he's just not 37M worth of player. He should probably stay in the first XI because we don't have anyone better right now, but for next season we need to sign a player to replace him with far more weapons. He was embarrassingly terrible tonight, which is probably skewing opinions rather heavily.

877~~~
When Giggs was getting near the end of his career, legend that he was, I'd get annoyed at times at how he'd always go for the 'killer' ball. Mata is the opposite.

A happy medium would be nice like.

878~~~
If I see him fluffing his lines from that BFS pass again I'm going to throw my TV out the window. Memphis was free in the middle as well.

879~~~
I dont think so, I think his problem is intent and attitude. He's far too happy to pass the ball sideways or backwards these days, when at his best in the past he would be looking for killer balls constantly. Thats the player we took from Chelsea. He wasn't as good as some others at keeping the ball, but statistically he created chance after chance. He's lost that edge right now

880~~~
He had a poor game but there was clearly some good aspects imo. It's not all going to click at once. You've got an attack/midfield with 4 new players out of 6, Martial doesn't even speak english. Mata deserves a roasting for some poor play and for not doing better from the schwein pass but others had poor games too. For me I can see the potential in him, Depay and Martial although I don't expect to see it much when Rooney is fit. You can't expect it all to click straight away. 

Up until the Shaw injury and for some spells after that our attack looked as good as it has done in ages and there was some real threat. The injury and subsequent re-shuffling in defence and then poor decisions/lack of clinicalness in front of goal, mostly from the young players made this worse than it was in some ways. If we scored the good openings we made than Mata taking the time to occasionally slow the game down and wait to speed it up when there's lots of players in the final third wouldn't be such an issue.

881~~~
Made nothing happen?
Had 7 games as a number ten
He scored 3 and assisted 2

882~~~
He's the CAF darling, and gets off too lightly. I've not been a fan of Mata, the one at United. Too slow, too cautious, takes too many touches and can't shoot. He's such a nice guy and all, but how does that help the team to win games? I'll rather have young players like Memphis making the kind of stupid decisions he made today, as I can put it down to inexperience. For such a talented and experienced player, he contributes so little, too often to United.

883~~~
But wouldn't you agree that we've not had the team to really let him create as he did at Chelsea? Aside from today I can't think of many situations he's been in where we've set up in a way that would allow him to influence in the way he did for Chelsea. We didn't have the players. Last season/under Moyes you've got no runners from the wide positions inside. The strikers all want to come to the ball and play like 10's not 9's. It's only with Herrera as well that we've really started getting runs from the middle as well. It's not like there's runs he's constantly missing. 

I agree that sometimes he can be slow on the ball in the middle but when he gets to the final third he's plays it fast enough most times. But like I said more often than not there isn't the run.

With Depay and Martial, 2 players who will run in behind then we might see more from him in that capacity. And there were flashes of it today. But they need time to get an understanding. And it's not all him, as young players they will and did make mistakes that impacts the team.

884~~~
A day to forget, I'm interested in what he has to say about this performance in his blog...

885~~~
Very disappointing tonight considering he was playing in his favoured position. His passing was well off and he made the completely wrong choice when Schweinsteiger played that beauty of a pass into him.

886~~~
Now that Rooney is pretty much consistently shit, I think it's fair to say that Mata has taken over as our most inconsistent player. You never know whether you're going to get brilliance or utter dogshit.

887~~~
Thought he deserved another chance at #10 but showed why he doesn't play there. Was a poor performance I thought. The only decent knock-down Fellaini got fell to him and he tried to pass instead of taking the shot (which he messed up anyway). Thought he lacked a bit of leadership in that moment.

Also, I know he scores a bit but I can think of a few chances he has spurned, when he should be burying them, when we really needed him to score.

888~~~
Probably his worst game for Utd.

889~~~
Consigned himself to the right wing forever more after tonight's showing, but it might be for the best as it'd only complicate the number 10 position even more if he'd had a stormer, would also have potentially left us with Valencia as our right winger, and nobody wants that.

So we've basically got:

----------------Martial----------------
Depay---------Rooney---------Mata

And this could be fantastic, but we have virtually no adequate cover, even more so now i've just voted for Young to be our new LB.

890~~~
I agree with that. Its like he was in two minds a lot of the times. That ball from basti had to either be a shot or a pass across the box. Instead he tried to control it.
That set up from Fellaini onto his left foot and he goes and passes it back to Fellaini.

891~~~
Wonder if he was more mentally affected by the injury than others, he's such a nice bloke. I'm going to let him off on that assumption.

892~~~
I don't think that will work as much as I'd like it to. Rooney isn't going to budge from the middle, he doesn't run out wide much now and when he does it's not effective as he always needs to check back. So you've got Rooney, mata and depay all looking to come central. Then on top of that you've got rooney's main play there being a half turn and a wide pass pinning Depay/Mata to positions they don't want to be in. 

Sadly I think if Rooney plays 10 then you'd probably want Young to come in which isn't really something I'd like although he does try hard to be fair to him.

893~~~
Caf curse strikes again. 

Player gets run in the position everyone wants him in, and he looks well below the performances in his 'wrong' position. 

See also Di Maria (central midfield), Herrera (number 10), Rooney (up front) etc.

894~~~
What a way to feck up your chances to play your favourite position.

895~~~
He wasn't that bad. He should have scored when Schweini put him through. But otherwise I thought he did well. Linked play up and had some good movement/touches.

896~~~
He was poor, but I'm hoping it was just a bad day.

897~~~
Why wasn't he trying to score today? So many times he had the ball, in space near or inside the box and he decided to pass. Needlessly might I add.

898~~~
He wasn't that bad first half. released a lot of our players on the run. Hid in the 2nd and that is unacceptable. Back to the RW or bench for you.

899~~~
Aye, he was fine in the first half. Basically what we get from him anyway, except the attack wasn't as lopsided (which doesn't bother me but does bother others). We certainly didn't look any worse with him at #10 during that period.

It was really in the second half (and especially the last half hour) that he was particularly disappointing.

900~~~
He does very little but manages to pick up a goal/assist every other game. Hopefully that ends the Mata at #10 endless cries from fans.

901~~~
No surprise whatsoever.
People will keep on harping on about his runners and his position. But it's Mata's limitations.
The only time he can sit on the ball is when he's in completely useless/nonthreatening areas. Give him the ball under any sort of pressure (in that '10' zone) and he's poor. That's not good enough, hence he never kept a place for Spain, even when he was 'one of the best players in the league'.

He's better wide, and he's not even great there. Said it before - he's not good enough for where United want to be, or for any top side, for that matter.
People will forever point to his Chelsea stuff, which, when analyzed a bit more, actually doesn't prove he's a top player (worthy of building the team around) at all.

Impact sub.

902~~~
Nobody denies that he can finish and put the ball on a plate for other people to finish. Oh yeah, and nice set pieces. The issue is pretty much the rest of the time when he's not doing that. 

He's limited. Can't turn his man, can't dribble his man, can't shield the ball, can't sit on the ball unless it's in a nonthreatening position. He slows play down. Only comes to life when he's directly making a goal happen - basically like a forward/striker.

It's almost not possible to have a 'Mata masterclass' without him scoring or directly assisting (and even then, it's rarely a true masterclass). 
His ability to assist the assist (the harder part, in my opinion) is not good enough. 
We've seen Silva run the show without directly scoring or assisting. That's the difference.

903~~~
Runners are not the issue. I wish people would stop making this excuse.
The issue is that Chelsea played on the break more. He had more space to play into most of the time. Thus he didn't need to shield the ball, dribble his man or generally be strong as much. He's at his best when defences are stretched, because he doesn't need to be strong or overly tricky with the ball at his foot. When defences are settled and on top of him, he's poor.

He's just unsuited to a possession team (or even a top countering team). It's got nothing to do with runners. No amount of good running is going to suddenly give Mata the ability to be strong on the ball.

904~~~
this thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
He is the Carrick from 5 years ago. Cant do anything right it seems, at least for some fans.....

905~~~
Slow, can't turn and run with the ball and tonight when he had two key moments he botched them, the pass to Memphis was too heavy and how he didn't bury that chance Schweini created for him I'll never know.

The problem United have in attack is we have two very talented but very inexperienced young forwards in Martial and Memphis in the front 4, this is where Rooney and Mata are supposed to be our two world class players that take up the slack as they develop next to them, but neither are good enough.

906~~~
Very much this. His audition as a number 10 was a monumental feckup.

907~~~
It is not that Mata doesn't have any dribbling ability of a winger, it is just that using it to beat a man or hug the the line is not part of his game.
Mata either
1) Comes inside to look for a killer pass or a shot.
2) Links up with the full back to create space for the full back to pick out an open player in the box.
3) Is making off the ball movements/runs to put himself into a position to score.

I just think that some people are asking him to do more that is out of his style of play. I don't agree with the fact that Mata slows the play down, albeit he may lack pace but he is quite quick in what he is doing, especially in the final third of the pitch.

It is just a bad game and I don't know why people are blowing this out of porportion as if Mata has not been our most productive player this season.

908~~~
I agree Rooney has not been good enough, but to say Mata has not been good enough so far for United is just a major overreaction.It is a fact that Mata has been one of our most creative and productive player so far this season. He had a bad game and I have faith he will deliver once again against Southampton this Sunday.

909~~~
It's not part of his game because he can't do it. It's not the end of the world. He has his qualities, but dribbling opposition players isn't one of them. If he could do it then he obviously would.

He's not quick in what he's doing, until it's directly involving a goal. Unless he's literally shooting or setting up a goal, he's pretty slow in his approach. It's very aesthetically pleasing but it's not zippy at all.

Yes he's been productive, but we all know Mata can directly contribute to goals. That's not the issue - it's that when he's not directly contributing to goals he's not great or progressive at all. He's limited and can't actually keep hold of the ball for long enough to influence games properly.

910~~~
The fact what he has produced so far is supposed to be the best creativity we have shown highlights the problem with this squad right now, the two senior attacking players simply don't offer enough.

911~~~
Apparently we are watching two different Mata's then... Mata is usually is on the move quickly or is distributing the ball quickly when I watch him. In fact sometimes I would argue he speeds things up! He may be physically slow but in build up plays I think he has been fine. 

I think that in games like these, it may suggest that we need someone who can huge the touch line and play more like a traditional winger when Mata coming inside and playing more off the ball is not working out. Unfortunately, seeing as we loaned out Januzaj, Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia are subpar as right wingers, We may be short of options.

912~~~
What he has produced so far?
You mean how he produced the killer pass that led to Januzaj scoring the winning goal?
You mean how he could have produced 3-4 assists if it was not for our dire finishing against Newcastle?
You mean how he produced a through ball to Rooney against Club Brugge?
You mean how he produced a goal that gave us a chance to still compete in the match against Swansea?
You mean how he produced an assist against Liverpool that put us up by 1?

I think he has been offering us a lot, just not last game for the last 60 minutes.

913~~~
Deliver once again? He's been the main reason we are insipid up front for the last season and a half. I have been truly underwhelmed by him since arriving at United. Yep odd flashes of gold but in the main far to much of a luxury player and can see 100% why Jose got rid, the boy flatters to deceive. The quicker Rooneys back at 10 the better imo.

914~~~
Lets go with things that actually mattered in the games.

When it comes to assists that has been something that has been exposed to a large degree by Brunt's stats last season, a set-piece even more-so. Also the goal he scored against Swansea put us 1-0 up, he didn't do anything once they went 2-1 up which is when you need your senior forwards to step up.

That is really my main point, if this team is going to get to a place where it challenges then it's not about Memphis and Martial, they are learning and their best lies ahead, we need to upgrade Mata and Rooney as neither do enough to take up the slack for the young players in the attack. They'll have moments, Rooney got a hat trick against Brugge and I am sure he'll have some good games eventually this season and as you say Mata has a goal and a couple of assists, but when you look at the forward lines we want to be on the level of Mata and Rooney don't cut it IMO.

915~~~
Juan Mata was very bad this game. No excuses, the chance he missed from that brilliant Schweinsteiger pass was criminal.

His crossing was poor too and he dallied on the ball a bit too much to the liking considering the game was getting end to end in the 2nd half. This gave PSV defenders time to crowd the box.

He needs to pull up his socks. A major share of responsibility for today's loss is on Juan's shoulders.

916~~~
Genuine question:
You've claimed that it's not that Mata can't dribble like a winger, but that it's not his game (I still don't understand this...)
And that he's actually quick at distributing the ball and moving about the pitch.

What isn't he good at at, in your opinion? Is there anything, or is it everyone else's fault? Because I'd think even the biggest Mata fans would admit he's not capable of dribbling like a winger.

917~~~
Weird, the Mata I am watching is either receiving and passing backwards before dithering with the ball for a few moments or falling over and losing the ball under the slightest bit of pressure.

918~~~
Not good enough last night and has shown no signs of justifying his transfer fee since he signed. He has his moments but his best performances were at Chelsea and that is over two years ago now and there is good chance he will never get to that level again.

edit: Yes, I stuffed the Tottenham one up and couldn't go back cause I closed the layers and cbf.

923~~~
I don't disagree that playing on the break would help but as you say that's more to do with him being bullied on the ball and it's hardly uncommon for a player of his ilk to suffer in some circumstances. I've said before that he's not as good as someone like Silva in terms of dribbling but neither of them would want to be in a really tight game. 

Part of that lack of space though is a lack of players who will run in behind. We're getting better at it now but as I said it takes time to click. Runners stretch the game as well as presenting an opportunity to play a cutting pass. Over the past few seasons most teams know they can push up on us because Young/Valencia are very passive/predictible. That makes it harder to find space and harder to create. That's why I don't understand people who say he's not creative or not doing what he did at Cheslea as if the situations are the same.

You say he can't play in a possession team well I don't see that. He did very well for Chelsea who would have dominated most the games they played. He plays for Spain who are all about possession. He can play in a possession team fine. A possession team that moves the ball slowly and has hardly anyone looking to stretch the game- yeah he'll struggle. So would most. 

As I said though in Depay and Martial we've got players who want to run in behind now. That will push teams back more and their pace will offer a greater threat on the counter. These things will suit Mata. It needs time to work and trying to judge it in a situation which had the Shaw injury and a bunch of players who are still getting used to each other, not to mention two very young players who clearly have a lot to learn regardless of how talented they are isn't particularly fair for me.

924~~~
'none of those position maps show anything other than he's very far forward (typically the second or third most advanced player) and that he's very much playing inside.'

You can circle it all you want, but it still doesn't show what you're arguing.

I really, at this point, have no idea what you're on about.

So why don't you try and explain it in plain English?

because drawing circles around position maps showing Mata as <b><i>clearly </i></b>one of the forward line and <i><b>clearly </b></i>one of our most advanced players is doing nothing for your point.

I can only deduce from your circles that you think that the fact that the winger on the other side taking up marginally more forward positions is important for some reason, but its so blatantly not I don't know why you're prattling on about it.

928~~~
No thanks, I think I will be okay with one user brick-walling some pretty clear evidence in front of them. If you don't want to understand it then I am not going to spoon feed you a third time.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ok then, thanks for the two pages of nonsense.

The fact that you managed to reply to me about 4 times without addressing the actual issue that you couldn't explain what you thought your maps were showing in the face of disagreement is really annoying.

930~~~
Rooney isn't playing so i guess someone else has to get slaughtered when we lose.

Not defending his performance yesterday, but he's been very productive for us in the time he's been here. Even if he looks anonymous at times he can carve out an assist or goal and deserves credit for that.

931~~~
Well I disagree. I don't think he's as good as Silva but I think in a true free role like Silva has and with the right players around him, which I think we have although they now need to mature then he can be a standout player for us. As I said we created enough chances yesterday and Mata was a part of that. Poor choices in the final third, including Mata let us down but there was plenty of potential there. I thought it was definitely one of our better attacking displays until later in the game at least. 

I understand what you're saying and I agree he can get bullied of the ball too easily, although his word rate defensively has improved loads. But I also think he can be a very effective player.

932~~~
IMO heat maps when we're attacking would give us full picture, I'm pretty sure there would be difference to last season. Might be wrong but would be interesting to find out, anybody knows where to find such maps?

933~~~
Mata is not in his best of form for us this season. He usually is very accurate finisher but he has consistently missed chances for us this season that have costed us a lot. But I am confident that he would turn around this and start putting them to sword. 

However the other issue with Mata, which others have mentioned in this thread, is his lack of directness. He so often refuses to shoot, he comes deeper to play simple passes which are backwards or sideways. He HAS to play more forward passes, through balls, and shots because he is genuinely the most important source of creativity for the team. I don't think its a philosophy issue because Herrera and Schweingsteiger regularly play more directly than Mata (best example is Schweingsteiger's dinked pass to Mata yesterday).

934~~~
The problem is being anonymous and getting a goal or assist has been the norm. It's good to be productive when you're not playing well but if that's the default mode then it's obviously not good enough. I do agree that pace and width to stretch the play would help him a lot and there's been very little of that when he's been here, but i'm rapidly losing faith in his ability to succeed here. It's remarkable how few great performances he's had in just under 2 years here.

935~~~
Speaking of which, I didn't think that he linked up much with Herrera very much today... Surely they should have been more than capable of opening up PSV a few times?

936~~~
Exactly. He's a great player, but is not suited to a possession-based system playing as the 10. He comes alive in the transition, like Ozil did at Real. They are both very similar in that respect...

937~~~
But that's the thing... he's very unlikely to do that again. I mean, Mata's touch is his best attribute, and he's demonstrated many times that he has one of the best first touches around...So you give him that pass again and 99% of the time he's bringing that down and scoring/laying it off to Depay.

It's why I think today was just a massively off day for him, passes that he normally makes easily weren't coming off, his touch was letting him down, and obviously his shooting desserted him... it happens, people have really shit games sometimes, we move on.

938~~~
Couldn't have said it better myself. Great post.

939~~~
Mata was ineffective vs Newcastle? Please go rewatch the game. Mata was very effective vs Newcastle. He had at least 3 good passes to set people up to score and created ample space for Darmian to put in a final ball on multiple occasions.

Club Brugge-fair enough

Swansea- He was pretty solid throughout. He could have been better, but the bottom line is that he did produce a goal

Liverpool- Mata was pretty good against Liverpool.In the first half he was one of the few bright spots that game(made no sense why they kept playing it through Memphis) and he definitely did better in the second half.

Mata could be playing a little bit better, but to suggest that he has not been producing for us is just stupid.

940~~~
I'm not a big fan. Too slow, too tentative, too lightweight, just what does he bring that we can't replace? Once our next phase of transfers is done, I think he'll be the biggest casualty.

941~~~
I share your opinion although I thought it might happen this summer. However, it turned out we didn’t get a right winger what is bizarre considering our lack of options there.

942~~~
Anyone else notice he has a habit of getting caught in two minds at the back post?

There's been 3 or 4 times in his United career he's been played in at the back post, and got caught in two minds between shooting first time, and controlling the ball. Its really weird as he's so composed in every other area of his game.

943~~~
Our best chances that game was created by Januzaj and Rooney, not Mata. You're the one who needs to rewatch the game I'm afraid. Those are the kind of games Mata is usually praised for but when you look back he's done practically nothing.

As for Swansea, yeah he scored a goal but so can't say much but the lack of creativity from him was fairly obvious. Again.

He was utterly ineffective versus Liverpool in what was probably the worst first half of our season. He and Herrera were seemingly trying to outdo each other in the "passing back and sideways" competition.

He's in the team to create chances and he's struggled with that part of the game. Worse, a lot of time he's not even positive in his play and is content to go with the flow and keep on passing it sideways and backwards. The signs were good with the Villa and Brugge game but he's lapsed back into his usual self.

He needs to add good performances to his productivity if we're to go anywhere in a hurry.

944~~~
Yeah bit surprised with that, looking back at his volley against Liverpool don't see why he should be lacking confidence hitting it first time.

945~~~
That feck up from Bastian's pass was horrible. Those are the type of moments that define games, we would have probably won after scoring that and making it 2-2. Hopefully that's a 1 in a million kind of thing for him

946~~~
a few minutes before he wasted a shot over the bar from about 18 yards out. that might have been on his mind aswell

947~~~
How are you defining productivity ? Memphis has 3 goals + 2 assists compared to Mata's 1 goal + 3 assists in fairly similar playing time. Most of the attacking or creative players have had far less playing time so hardly a fair comparison.

948~~~
Aye, I'm not sure why people are pointing to this display as proof he can't play #10 for us when many of the things that were off about him yesterday have nothing to do with the position he was playing in.

Some people already have this notion that he can't plays as a #10 in this system (which may or may not be true) and are jumping on this performance as proof that they were right. However, basic logic would suggest that one performance in that role isn't enough for us to base any conclusions off.

949~~~
I've noticed it myself and I don't get it. He did score against Swansea from a similar position though

950~~~
I've never seen a player so determined to make themselves so pointless. He doesn't want to do anything. He deliberately looks to weasle out of using his ability. It's bizarre.

He's a very good player when he actually does what he's good at, but he doesn't do what he's good at very often, and I wouldn't mind if this latest bout was just a spell of poor form or something, but the problem is I remember saying the same thing about him when Moyes was in charge...and then for a large part of last season, and now again this season...and it was the same story in his last season at Chelsea. He's consistently poor with the odd good game or run of form thrown in, rather than the other way around.

There's always an excuse for Mata though...first it was Moyes, then it was his team mate's fault for not making the right runs, then he's out of position. He has been given more leeway than most players would for playing poorly so regularly. I guess people just really wanted him to do well, which is fair enough, but the reality is whatever the manager or other players are up to, he just doesn't do nearly enough himself. He puts the effort in but he seems to lack the mental strength to play in a team where the pressure is always there.

Compare him to someone like Schweinsteiger, who's probably no more talented, but thrives under pressure and struts through games, so can come into a club like United and impose himself as if it's no issue at all.

951~~~
He has the quality, but it's starting to feel like we need more production & authority from a player in his role.

How do you guys see him fitting into the team over the next two years? What is his future at the club?

952~~~
I think he's been our best attacking player since he came to the club but, even with that said, I still find it hard to imagine he'll be a permanent fixture in the first team in two years time. If he continues as is then you'd expect him to be relegated to a squad role by then.

He looks a square peg in a round hole atm. I still think he contributes more than enough to be a certain starter for us right now (which he indeed seems to be) but you'd hope we'd improve beyond that point in the coming years.

For Mata to actually become an essential player for us in the long term he'd have to hope that either a) he gets moved into a central position and thrives there or b) he becomes more effective in the RW role as the team around him improves. Not sure how likely either of those possibilities are.

Of course that assumes LVG is still the manager for the next few years. A new manager with a new playing style could certainly change the way he fits into the team.

953~~~
He'll be lucky if he is still at the club in 2 years' time. It would be harsh to say that he is the problem but it is also clear that he isn't the solution as our scoring rate has been consistently dire while he has been on the pitch and improves marginally when he is missing. We have several players who can pass the ball so are far more in need of passing options rather than Mata. 

The obvious thing to do, which doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, is to focus on the younger attacking talents. Mata, Rooney, Fellaini and Young should all be gone in 2 years' time.

954~~~
for everyone talking about Mata as if he's a problem, are you overlooking that he's pretty much been involved in the majority of our goals?

955~~~
I think he has the dribbling abilities of a winger;however, I didin't say he can beat a man consistently like a world class winger should because of his lack of pace. Sure it may be a hindrance in his game and it may prove him to be ineffective against certain teams, but it definitely should not suggest that because of that limit he can't be a dominant force in a game.
Where has Memphis been in the Premier League when it mattered? I don't want to discredit his performance against a sub par Club Brugge side but there is no doubt that Mata has been our most productive player so far.

956~~~
Fair enough, I guess I've just been watching a completely Juan Mata to the majority of the Caf since he arrived at United. 

His shooting usually desserts him, & that's when he's actually decisive enough to take a shot; which is rare.
Has a good touch, but I find he's the main culprit in slowing down our attacks many a time. 
He's a fair weather player, has no guile or determination to take a game by the collar. 
I guess to summarise it's his inconsistency that really bugs me. Can't say I've seen him have a decent run of games at a 6-7/10. He pulls the odd top drawer goal/assist/performance e.g. Anfield last season & lives on that rep with the Caf for a prolonged period.

957~~~
Januzaj and Rooney were our most creative outlets that game? That definitely explains how the both of them were our two worst rated attacking players that game and he was our highest.

Fair enough with Swansea game. He was spectacular, nor was he rubbish, but he definitely could have done better.


Mata has struggled to  create chances? He has created 11 total in the Premier League for Manchester United and has assisted 2. That is way more than anyone in our squad. I'm not saying he is perfect, but Mata is among the least of our problems.

958~~~
Scoring rate has been dire when he is on the pitch? Yep that is our problem. Never mind the fact that we hardly have any forwards at the moment who are in form to finish of the chances that are created. Never mind the fact that he has been our most creative and one of our most productive players ever since he has joined United. 

Focus on younger talents? Give me a break! Have you not been watching Depay in the EPL and for the second half of this game? We need proper alternatives when Mata or our other starters are ineffective or not playing well.  We are in need of a traditional right winger who can hug the touch the line and spread the back 4. We don't have any of those players right now because thanks to Van Gaal he either sold or loaned out those types of players and refused to purchase one. When Rooney is not playing well, we need a solid back up alternative who can come in for him. What did Van Gaal do? Sold RVP, Falcao, Hernandez and brought in a project.

959~~~
I'm dealing with facts. Januzaj played two lovely through balls in the first half, which was more than anything Mata did in the whole game. Rooney also created a better chance (for Mata) than anything Mata did. 

Chances created is a shit stat and very misleading at that. Januzaj for example had no chances created in the Newcastle game which was blatantly not true. Of his 2 assists one was a peach and the other one was a set piece.

Mata is part of the problem is all I'm saying. He's the creative linchpin of a team that barely creates anything. And unlike the likes of Depay, Herrera and Young he's also a very passive player which is infuriating.

960~~~
I think his point is that he's playing 5-10 yards deeper than the other winger, which isn't really a point at all as he's still far forward. Against Liverpool he was further forward on average than Fellaini who was playing as a striker. Against Swansea he was as far forward as Rooney who was playing as a striker and against Newcastle he was maybe 5 yards behind the striker. All in all it's a very strange argument.

961~~~
Yeah, I said as much earlier on in the the thread and also that I thought it was a nothing argument, but he just got upset and started hurling insults around.

962~~~
Despite Tuesday's game, I would love to see him get a consistent run as our #10.

963~~~
Is that an app or website you use for those player positions on a map graphics?

964~~~
The ones I've posted in this thread are from fourfourtwo statzone, I think Squawka also has heat maps but the match zone thing isn't working for me.

965~~~
Thanks

966~~~
Where did I hurl insults around, honestly, you're on a wind up aren't you?... There are some cameras here and some guys are gonna rush in and tell me how hilarious it is that I got rused, that it is all part of some caf initiation humiliation ritual?

The argument is pretty simple, when Van Gaal talks about balance he wants his left and right forward to be mirrored (ie as the diagrams explained pretty much in the same spot on opposite flank, Mata is well back in most of them bar the Liverpool and Newcastle one). Back in NL max's post about LVG's tactics he talked about how the two wide players are to be direct and attack the goals in both the channel and inside. There is evidence there that Mata has not been doing that effectively at all. Also he has more passes backwards this season than forwards and I honestly can recall maybe twice where he drove directly at his fullback (or past) and cutting to the area for a shot, Swansea to force a low save from Krul and against Tottenham where he had a couple of quick shots into a defender and wide of the goal.

This was all explained many pages back. If you look at the below, even the fact that his influence says how far forward he is, look how many touches he has in the grey area basically where his position as a right forward is.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/wt24zeO.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/wt24zeO.jpg"/>

Yeah they aren't working for me either, I thought my browser had a problem or something and their ios app is absolute garbage.

967~~~
I think this is your problem; you expect him to mirror the positions of an out an out winger in Depay/Young. There is no way in hell that Van Gaal expects Mata to mirror the player on the opposite flank. Mata is never going to "attack the goals both the channel and inside", he is only ever going to come inside to influence play and of course he's never "drove directly at his fullback"... He isn't a winger. 

Mata is always going to be 10 yards further inside than his opposite number, he's usually going to be 5-10 yards deeper as he'll drop into midfield to influence play. He's never going to beat a fullback and he's never going to attack the channel. Unless Van Gaal is a blithering idiot, which his record suggests he isn't, then he won't be expecting Mata to do any of the things you say he should be doing. I'd love to see a City fan criticising Silva (when he's on the left) for not doing the things you're lambasting Mata for...

You could criticise Mata for being a bit slow/loose in possession; you could criticise him for not being incisive enough; you could criticise him for not imposing himself enough, however the things you are criticising him for are bizarre. It's like criticising Schweinsteiger for not dribbling past players several times a game.

968~~~
But, as I have replied to you a few times now thats a rather silly criteria to judge him on. In LVG's ideal world he may not like a player like Mata, but expecting Mata to get wide take on a full back and isolate them is just ridiculous its not his game and he's clearly not being asked to play there. You can tell that from the various graphs and maps average positions that you've posted in here yourself.

As I've said before, I have no problem whatsoever with people thinking that we'd be better off playing with a more direct, traditional winger over Mata, if thats your opinion then fine, I have no problem whatsoever with people thinking that Mata's not plying particularly well this season, if you think that then fine.

What I do I have a problem with is fundamentally misunderstanding the role Mata is being asked to play in this team and then criticising him for not fulfilling criteria that he's not being expected to fulfil.

969~~~
Lads, jesus lets forget this. I can't keep going through it over and over again. I say right inside forward and you instantly explain back to me what a winger does and why he doesn't do it, that has happened a couple of times now. I'm not trying to say he must be a winger. I'm saying he should keep his shape and attack with the ball while in the final third and not turn back and inside and pass it off and hang about. Have some dynamism in the role he is playing at inside forward. (Not winger) He needs to mirror what Depay's doing because Van Gaal has said in the past his wide players are to be direct and put pressure on their marker to stretch the play for the 9 and for the 10 to run in advance of the 9. That dire experiment with Depay and Januzaj.

He's at 10 now anyway so I hope he stays there so we don't have to revisit this again, forget about it.

970~~~
It's because you're making the fallacious argument that he is expected to be a winger because he is playing on the right. 

I suspect from your last few sentence you actually fall in the camp 'I don't like seeing Mata playing from the right, I think we'd be better suited with a more traditional winger' which is fine, but just say that. Expecting Mata to change his game and do what you're asking just isn't going to happen, partly because Mata isn't that sort of player and partly because he's not being asked to.

971~~~
Lol, "winger" now you are on the wum. Well played.

972~~~
Yes I know you're calling it an inside right, it doesn't change the fact that you're fundamentally criticising Mata for not performing the traditional roles of a winger.

973~~~
So, now that we’ve established that he isn’t a winger of any sort, I have a question.

He doesn’t take on fullback, he doesn’t stay on the right, he doesn’t influence the play. What he does is drift all over the pitch, and makes a lot of sideway and back passes. Could somebody explain to me what his role in the team is?

People saying he’s our most productive player. He is also greatly responsible for the number of goals from open play we have scored (4 in 5 games), as he is the player with most freedom.

That’s not directed at him, I just don’t think that the way we’re using him right now is beneficial for the team. I’m pretty sure he was deployed much more of a forward last year and it suited him well.

974~~~
Aye, he seems to have a lot of license to drift about this year, certainly more than he had at any point last year, I think.

Which really raises the question of how unhappy LVG actually is with some of the things Mata has been criticised for. I mean people criticise Mata for sideways passing and being very cautious in possession, comparing him unfavourably to players like Herrera and even Januzaj while he was in the #10 role. Yet Herrera struggles to get into the team, Januzaj has been shipped off to another country and Mata is a nailed on starter given extra freedom.

I suspect that LVG's vision of what Mata should be doing is quite different from a lot of the caf's.

975~~~
Agree with this a fair bit. People were muppety mad when Mata signed for us but he's just been so.. bland, for me. He's good, you can't say he isn't, but he lacks bravery, balls, the mentality to grip games and make something happen. The comparison with Schweinsteiger is apt, and probably why their standing in the game is so far apart. When we signed Mata I expected that player who used to run us ragged. Mata used to be a pain, twisting and turning and making our players look silly. We've see seen a different Mata at United. One that you can't deny is fairly good but can rarely ever say is great. I find myself preferring Herrera to him. They offer very similar things but Herrera has more dive and heart than Mata IMO.

We signed Mata to be one of the big different makers in the premier league. He has been far from that.

976~~~
Never rated him particularly highly, didn't want him when we got him, and preferred Kagawa! Having said this, I don't see what other options we have in the squad that would be an improvement. He does add creativity and is decent with recycling possession. If we can get an exciting right winger, I'm sure he'll be demoted but until then I suspect he'll continue in the position, scoring the odd goal, forging the occasional final pass, but never really looking like the right fit.

977~~~
It's more than one game though and that can't be ignored. He was given a chance under Mourinho as a #10 in an organised system and he failed to adapt. Mourinho then put him on the right where he was less detrimental to the team, but he wanted out. Van Gaal gave him a chance at the start of last season, and once again in an organised system he failed to make a positive impact. His season started when he scored the winning goal against Crystal Palace, having come on as a sub, and was played on the right for the rest of the season after that.

The more you watch Mata, the more you realise that he's not a top class #10 for any top side because his skill-set limits his overall impact. So many ridiculous reasons are used to support the claim that he should be playing there, such as Chelsea winning the Champions League in 11/12, yet that Chelsea side was absolutely horrendous defensively and Mata went missing on so many occasions. He's probably the easiest player to shut down in our team because all you have to do is pressure him from behind and that results in him running towards his own half. Which is exactly what Mourinho did at Stamford Bridge last season. People expect him to effect a game as a #10 but he's not going to do that because the conditions aren't available for him to do so, and for us to give him those conditions would be disastrous.

Let's just take him for what he is now. A good option to have on the right, but we can definitely make an upgrade if one becomes available, and I maintain my position from the start of last season that he's a squad player at best.

978~~~
Yes! Yes! Let the philosophy flow through you.

979~~~
This is my problem, as everyone seems to be saying its LVG who is stifling him, but I noticed it under Moyes too.
Anyway he is still one of our most productive players tbh, and I like him a lot, but I really do want him to kick on

980~~~

983~~~
That is a mental line up. He'd be a terrible manager, but really good at FIFA.

984~~~
Great post. Exactly the way I view Mata.

985~~~
There are a few misconceptions about Mata, in my opinion:

1) Mourinho only sold him because he couldn't defend.
Not true. Not only was he not very useful defensively, but he was/is also not brilliant at relieving pressure via dribbling up the field. In the toughest games (when Chelsea counter-attack) you need a real ball carrier, who can gain yards for the team. Mata can't do this that effectively. Willian is superior in this regard, as is Hazard, obviously. They are great out-balls for a counter-attacking side.
You can bet that if Mata's only issue was defending, Mourinho would compensate for that, because he scores so much. But the reality was/is that his goals and assists don't compensate enough. Not for a serious team.

2) '10' is his best position. Playing him there makes him much better.
Not true. If anything, playing centrally (in a possession team, more so) means that he is more tightly marked. And as he lacks the turning, dribbling, strength and shielding to deal with the tight marking - he would not loo better centrally. About the only benefit is that he'd get into more scoring positions. But his overall play would probably be worse.

3) He'd be better if only he had runners.
It doesn't matter how good the runners are if Mata is unable to keep the ball in his possession in pressured areas for any good length of time. He's not going to be spraying inch perfect first-time passes into the runners' path constantly. At some point he'll be required to evade the tight marking and create the space to slide people in. There's this weird idea that great movement takes away the need for players to actually dribble, turn, shield, hold the ball... But it doesn't work like that. Movement isn't what makes Silva do his thing. It's his ability to dribble/turn/wriggle into those pockets where he can encourage runs and release players.

Surely you have to ask yourself why Mata was apparently one of the best three or four players in England (and as good as - if not better than - Silva) yet didn't get a proper spot for Spain (who have the runners he apparently lacks). He didn't even play at false 9 - Silva did, and Mata's a better finisher!

4) He was great at Chelsea because they had (a) a solid midfield and/or runners
No. He was great there because they played counter-attacking football to a greater extent (or at least it wasn't possession play), and they didn't ask him to defend or really do anything he found difficult. Most top teams would ask him to do these things; he wouldn't be able to, so he'd get benched. 

Mata is good at certain things. Certain important things. But unfortunately some of the things he's not good at are that significant that they stop him being truly great. He just doesn't get into the first team at a proper top European side. Not a top countering team for the reasons in point 1. And not a top possession team for the reasons in point 2 & 3.

986~~~
This is a very strong argument that may very well be correct.

However, I would prefer to give him a decent run of games in what is nominally his best position before deciding that you are right. 

As is your argument is based on a) your own personal assessment of the player's capabilities, b) a few games at the start of last season in a malfunctioning team and malfunctioning system, c) half a season before that in malfunctioning team under a manager who was totally out of his depth and d) one season under a different team, club and manager whose entire approach to the game has been regularly criticised on this forum.

So while you may well be right to say he can't perform as the #10 for us, I would prefer to see him given a run of games for us in this system so we can establish for once and for all if this is really the case. I certainly don't see the harm in giving it a go given that we don't have any other obviously outstanding alternatives in the #10 role and Mata hasn't exactly been wowing people in his current position. Even if we didn't improve it's hard to imagine we could be significantly worse either, so why not try?

As for Mata only being a squad player, that might well be the case if we actually had genuine alternatives to compete with him for his position. As is his competition is Young and Valencia, which means he will be first choice for the foreseeable future.

987~~~
<a class="username" data-user="82556, @Speak" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82556/">@Speak</a> Is it really a good idea to use selection for the international team as a way to assess a player's ability? We've seen plenty of our players receive less than the recognition they deserve at international level without us assuming they couldn't perform for us, Carrick being the obvious example in recent years.

Anyway, it's hardly unbelievable that the manager just rated Silva more despite Mata's quality performances. Silva is a brilliant player after all. That doesn't necessarily reflect Mata's ability to play as a #10 for us.

It would have been much easier to just write "I think Mata is pretty average". Your whole post seems to dress your opinion up as a series of facts, but these are all opinions made on the basis of you thinking he's average (you say "not true" several times as if you've proven something, when in actual fact you go on to give your negative opinion as to why he's average or why his qualities should be underplayed). In a few examples you have used the facts of his career and worked backwards to reach a "factual" conclusion, which is actually just you opinion. Examples include: Mourinho sold him (fact) because he isn't brilliant at dribbling/carrying the ball and that's Mourinho's preference (your opinion). Mourinho sold him (fact) not only because he is poor at defending as Mourinho would compensate for that (your opinion). He was great at Chelsea (fact) because they played counter attacking football to a greater extent and he had no defensive responsibilities (your opinion).

Anyone could do this with any player. "David Silva - he's a great player. Not true. How many goals has he scored throughout his career as an attacker". Most fans tend to look at all the excellent things their best players do contribute to the team, rather than the things they don't contribute or things they aren't expected to contribute. In Mata's case it's quite easy: a quick look at his direct contributions to our goal tally will show you why he's one of our best players.

989~~~

990~~~
That's fair enough, you're right. It's not the best way to prove anything.

991~~~
I do disagree with your opinion and if you just put forward your opinion then that'd be fair enough. I've debated others on here about his qualities and weaknesses and would have probably done the same again.

However I took issue with the way you posted, stating that other people have "misconceptions" and that certain opinions of what he brings to the team were "not true". 

It was the arrogant nature and condescending tone of the post that I took issue with, not the content (albeit that I disagree with the content).

992~~~
I actually put 'in my opinion' on the very first line. Literally stating that everything after (even the fact that there were misconceptions) was just my opinion. 
But anyway, fair enough if it came across like that. I can sometimes come across that way, which I need to work on.

993~~~
Don't worry I'm sure they'll be a future post where you criticise Mata and I'll probably come across badly in reply!

994~~~
Think it's unfair to judge him on one game as a 10, but it's not like people weren't saying the same last season. I mean, for a game we dominated, he didn't really seem to control the game for us.

995~~~
I'm very positive LVG will make this 46m euro man start producing for us. The money we brought him in for was a bit inflated by todays market and also that we were in a shit situation on the last day. He's been up and down lately but I'm sure Mata's time will come. He's got too much quality to fail. Simple as that.

Mata, you should be able to do this. Silva also had a tough period and managed to pull through. I think you should try to find some inspiration in that guy. I really like him as a player and for the money we paid he will have a lot to live up to. Other teams paid a lot for their players and eventually it worked out well. Bale and Ronaldo are two recent examples. I'm just concerned we have to dig too deep into our wallett whenever we want to do big business.

996~~~
He is more productive than most of our players.

997~~~
Can you edit your post so that you'll insult a bunch of posters while you're at it? That way your post would truly be worthy of a ban.

998~~~

Classic!

1001~~~
Spot on

1002~~~
I felt Mata linked up well on Tuesday and was reasonably good - i do think we needed two of Carrick, Schweinsteiger or Schneiderlein behind him though 

The balance was better in one sense with Young and Memphis wide and Martial floating 

At the same time we were missing that solidity that our midfield has provided 

My biggest issue with Mata is that he seemed reluctant to shoot and he needs to be able to try and take more responsibility - do want to see him at 10 again tho

1003~~~
Don't even think iur solidity was a problem, they created nothing apart from a fluke corner kick in injury time and one random counter attack, that will always happen. We just got punished both times. The end of the game chances only happened once we started hoofing. Our problem on Tuesday was us not taking our chances, and PSV basically finishing every chance they had bar the de Jong chance at the end. Just a fluke result imo, given the play.

1004~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> damn it, they've made their pod for this week!

1008~~~
The amount of shit Valencia (rightly) gets for being incredibly one footed should equally be directed at Mata. The way Mata plays makes it a bit less obvious than Valencia but he's still equally appalling on his weaker side. Inexcusable and had cost us goals on more than one occasion. While I get that not every footballer can be Cazorla, there's absolutely no excusing a professional not being able to so simple things with both feet.

1009~~~
Am I being followed around the forum now <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> I didn't mean all that I said. I just happened to sit in front of the computer and got angry.

1010~~~
One out of the ordinary performance and you guys are questioning how good Mata actually was at Chelsea and whether or not he was actually good when he first got here. The obsession certain fans have with pace and useless skills and not the slightest attention to detail about end product is bewildering . Lets go ahead and sign another young pacey inexperienced prospect and sell Mata then. So that we can start blaming BS  and starting claiming how overrated he was at Bayern.

1011~~~
I love Mata (somewhat unhealthily, I might add,) but it really is time for a game-changing performance. He's too talented to be turning in pedestrian performances like this. I'd love to see a return to the form he displayed in March, when he and Herrera were translating their off-the-field love into on-the-field magic.

1012~~~
What facts? Januzaj was SHIT that game. You know what is actually funny? You and only you on your own thinks that Mata wasn't the best attacking player on the pitch that game. Januzaj had a really good pass but he was nonexsistent that entire game. I will not further argue this with you if you are still going to stick to that pathetic notion that Mata was not effective at all during that game.

Mata is not any problem. It is Van Gaal that is the problem and the way he structured the squad. We don't have a single credible alternative right winger to back him up when he is not playing well and he dosen't have the slightest clue when or when not to play him.

1013~~~
Januzaj plays two perfect through balls= Januzaj shit. Mata does feck all=Very effective all game. You're double standards are glaringly obvious unless you're wumming but I doubt you're that clever.

Mata is lucky we don't have a credible right winger then. He's be on the bench if we did given LVG's reluctance to play him as a #10.

1014~~~
'Useless skills', such as the ability to turn his man, shield the ball effectively, dribble past players, keep hold of the ball under proper pressure. 
You know, skills that actually aren't useless.

1015~~~
Not those skills, you know damn well what I meant. Those stupid tricks that Depay and Januzaj would try and fail. Any way that is not my point. If you want to blame Mata for everything then go right ahead.

1016~~~
I'm wumming? Your stupidity is what is glaringly obvious. Januzaj played a marginally offside pass and played a decent ball to Memphis. Since the notion of your argument is that Mata dosen't impose himself in games, Januzaj did the polar opposite aswell. He was getting muscled off the balls, slowing down counter attacks to take poor shots. If you are arguing that Mata goes missing during games( which he dosen't bar Swansea and 2nd half of PSV) then why would you suggest that Januzaj was our most creative outlet when he didn't do a damn thing for 90% of the game?

Throughout that Newcastle game Mata made his presense felt. He kept on stretching the defenses up with his passing and creating ample space for either Darmian, Shaw Depay to run into to produce the final ball or to have a go. Not to mention, he produced a great ball to Rooney that he squandered He also had one fantastic shot and a decent freekick and could have been a goals if it was not for Tim Krul great hands.

There is a reason why everyone who saw that game praised Mata as our best attacking player that day and criticized Januzaj for being our worst and suggested he go out on loan(that dosen't mean I agreed with it).

1017~~~
I thought you were done arguing...yet here you are still spouting shite.

My argument was plain and simple. Januzaj did what he was supposed to do as a creative player in the team. He wasn't fantastic, no, and more prone to simple errors but his highs in the game were quite comfortably higher than Mata who did almost nothing and missed a great chance to go along with it. And I'm not sure how it's possible for anyone with a set of functioning eyes to suggest Mata does not go missing in games. That's the one thing he's absolutely excellent at or has been since his move to United.

Absolutely hilarious how you big up a shit freekick from Mata and then downplay Januzaj's passes as "marginally offside" and "decent" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Had it been the other way around you'd be wanking yourself silly.


Mata is the only player in the squad who gets over the top praise for doing very little. Simple pointless sideways and backward passes are labelled as great attacking and link up play (ala Newcastle). It's been a continuing theme from last season. Maybe because he's a handsome bastard or because he writes nice blogs...Not even saying he's bad. He's not. In fact, he very rarely has bad games but he's just meh in the overwhelming majority of games.

1018~~~
Spouting shit? Ha. 
Januzaj had two nice passes, but the fact is that one was offside(not saying it is his fault) and the second was was indeed nice, but you cannot possibly say that Januzaj was our most creative outlet because he definitely wasn't. He made too many bad decisions and was completely shut down or invisible. Mata was the one pulling the strings. It not me that saw it everyone but YOU seems to stick by the ludicrous idea that he was ineffective against Newcastle.

"Mata is the only player in the squad who gets over the top praise for doing very little"
Doing little? You mean being our 2nd most productive and probably creative player(maybe Herrera?) ever since joining Manchester United? Wow, I had no idea it was that easy...

I understand ya'll frustration whenever Mata has games like this. Damn, I was pretty frustrated too in the 1st half of Liverpool and when he played really bad Mata is the LEAST of our attacking problems. Sure Mata does have these games when he doesn't do what he is supposed to be doing or is ineffective but so does EVERY player. 

Even though you are going to slam highlight videos, here is a reminder. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1019~~~
Agree with all of your post, but the first point you make is a very good one and stands out the most. Mata wasn't classed as a Mourinho-type player because he couldn't defend, but would you call Sneijder and Ozil Mourinho-type players? Defensively he was awful, but Sneijder and Ozil weren't that much better yet Mourinho almost had no problem having them in his best XI.

That's fair enough but I can't imagine the outcome being any different to what we have seen already. My assessment is largely based on his time at Chelsea. His performances under Mourinho and Van Gaal have all but confirmed his status as a #10 in a top team, and I don't mean to sound arrogant/disrespectful. There are certain elements of his game - such as struggling under pressure, not being able to shield the ball well, and not positioning himself in congested areas - that are often overlooked and a run of games is not going to alter that. It's the way he is and it's what makes him almost anonymous as a #10.

While Mata's 12/13 season was class, it's often romanticised and is lacking objectivity. The amount of space he received was bound to make a quality player like him look great. Mata's best position isn't even as a #10 in a top side IMO, it's as a RW where he can drift in and receive the space he needs. He needs complete freedom (no defensive responsibilities) to be effective, and no top manager is going to give him that, so there's absolutely no way he's going to be a viable #10 for us. I think Van Gaal won't play him as a #10 unless we face weak opposition or we have an injury "crisis". With all that said, I'm happy to be proven wrong.

1020~~~
Completely anonymous so far.

1021~~~
Weird singling out a player like that when he had done more than Depay, Rooney and Martial before the goal. He created the only chance before being the instigator for the goal. Don't understand why people can't see how involved Mata really is but they want Young instead who's got frankly an awful record at creating chances and goals or keep Depay on who's not been up to par in the league.

1022~~~
Not even playing that well and he's still more likely to create a goal than any of our other players. Says a lot about both him and the team generally, I think.

1023~~~
Been much better in the last 10.

1024~~~
For people wondering what he brings to the team watch the 2 minutes of play before we scored.

1025~~~
Young creates more than Mata tho.

1026~~~
He makes things happen.. He is someone we should always play... we can/should be able afford to have an attacking player like him in the XI

1027~~~
No he doesn't.

1028~~~
At time of writing I don't think Mata had even been mentioned once.

Obviously he was involved with the goal and has done better since then, although it's worth mentioning that he was offside.

Memphis always looks more likely to create something to me, even if he is inconsistent and his decision making is sometimes off. He is a young player who will improve. Mata has a tendency to just play it safe and recycle possession, which is OK, but for someone who is meant to be a world class playmaker, in a team lacking creativity, it's not really what we need.

1029~~~
Directly involved with our only 3 chances of the game. He's not been good (better then Rooney and Depay for me mind) but he does at least make things happen.

1030~~~
Total Imposter of a winger would rather have any other winger at the club than this guy playing in this position! Yeah he does great bits here and there but the rest of the time we carry him. Get him off never to be seen in this position again please!

1031~~~
He does, and it isnt even close. He passes defenders so much more, and that creates loads of space. In stead od the obligatory sideways passes. Young showed it vs Liverpool and vs PSV.

1032~~~
Tbh I'm not sure we can afford to leave him out of the team given the lack of productivity from other players.

1033~~~
Really?

1034~~~
Indeed. People itching to bump certain player threads after 20 minutes of unanimous poor play. Absoutely everything we've done thats been even remotely dangerous has directly involved him..Mindboggling to have a pop, let alone single him out. I imagine half of them would've have hated Cantona. <i>"Yeah he does the occasional good thing, but doesn't do enough over 90 minutes for me."</i>

1035~~~
Who else has been involved in all 3 of our chances in this half of football?

1036~~~
Mata isn't a world class playmaker. Your post sums up a lot of poster to me. You just don't get it. Mata doesn't waste possession. Depay and Young both do. Why should Mata cross the ball when there's so little chance of scoring? You just lose the ball. Look at our goal. It was a goal that came after "playing it safe and recycling possession". Southampton are playing with two strong DMC's and two big CB's and we've got Rooney and Martial in there. High balls are not going to do us any good unless their aimed specifically like when Mata made that pass to Depay that was headed over. Southampton are an extremely cautious and defensive side that are very quick on the counter. You can't be wasteful against them.

1037~~~
The final delivery is miles apart between the two, that is key in comparing them.

1038~~~
So we have a new scapegoat at least.

1039~~~
It is, only that we barely get to the stage for the final delivery. You need players who can break open defences for that with either dribbles or passing, it goes unnoticed but Young beats defenders with such ease.

1040~~~
Absolutely spot on, he's vital to the way we play. Memphis, Martial and Rooney need to up their movement around him. We're far too static at times and Mata is not the guy to solve the problem, his job is to keep us ticking.

1041~~~
He is anoynoymous because our two cdms have been too damn slow to get him the ball. When he makes himself available we take too many touches to get it out.

1042~~~
I honestly don't know what the point of Mata as a winger is,very poor winger,no pace and can't go past a player,he always comes back.not impressed at all when we've got Young and Anders on the bench.

1043~~~
Get the ball wide get to the byeline and whip balls in or our forwards will stop getting into positions. The only time Mata gets to the byeline is at corner kicks. He's not a winger but it's where he's playing and he is donkey shit at playing here. He needs to fight for the ten jersey or get benched. I'd rather have Young or Valencia play this position.

1044~~~
We need to have some players who aren't afraid to take risks to create something. Cleverley could recycle possession and play it safe - it wasn't enough. Our goal came from an incorrect offside call against Mata, and a great bit of play by Martial. For a lot of the half we looked dour.

I never mentioned crossing the ball either, but Mata should have the tools and capability to create chances for us in the final third.

Anyway I don't want to come across like I am blaming Mata for the first half - I think the far bigger problem was our CM combination. Having two specialist holding midfielders doesn't really work for us I feel, we need to have one of Schweinsteiger, Herrera or Fellaini in there to offer something going forwards.

1045~~~
HE'S NOT PLAYING AS A WINGER FFS HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS IN THIS THREAD.

1046~~~
What a lot of rubbish he's had many an opportunity not just this game and he cuts back and plays safe square or backward passes. He passes the ball square and sprints away pretending to look for a return! He is going through the motions get him into ten or get him off.

1047~~~
I feel like we should be playing through Mata more than we play through Memphis...better things are happening when he gets the ball.

1048~~~
They're only happening when he drifts all the way to the completely opposite side as nobody is meant to be marking him there.

1049~~~
"Pretends to look for a return"
how the hell is that even possible?

1050~~~
You're just so wrong.


Don't think I need to tell you about the actual goals and assists.

Against PSV Mata had 71 passes with a 94% accuracy to Young's 25 passes and 88% accuracy.

1051~~~
His positioning is his biggest asset. It's amazing how he found himself in those 2 situations- Martial goal and when the ball fell to him and he crossed to Memphis. 

He’s very handy when he stays high up the pitch, useless when playing deeper. I still don’t like that we don’t use our right side at all.

1052~~~
There are some who think Mata's is infallible and will blame everyone but his for his shortcomings.

For me he's a clear luxury player and completely unbalances our team playing on the right. There's no need for him to be wondering into Rooney's space, not doing anything much, and leave a huge gap on the right.

1053~~~
He creates more chances than any other player in our team. If you don't believe me or all these other posters or the manager who frequently starts him over Young then believe the black and white numbers.

1054~~~
What is he playing as then,if he is not a winger,not a midfielder and he is definitely not playing as a number 10???

1055~~~
Surely if you actually watch the game you can see what he's doing and where he's playing? 

It's really not a novel position at all.

1056~~~
Thought he did well end of the half started to show for the ball and make runs, one of the main reasons we are back in this game imo.

1057~~~
Oh look, the pointless player scored again.

1058~~~
What's his shots to goals ratio???  The guy doesn't ever miss.

1059~~~
For all the things I criticise Mata for, I really rate his finishing and work in the opposition penalty area. For me he can and perhaps should play basically as a false nine, with Martial.

1060~~~
Can't understand the stick he's getting today.

1061~~~
People talk about playing Young or Valencia instead of Mata and it's just ridiculous. He is our most productive player.

Played a big part in the first goal as well as scoring the third.

1062~~~
Don't read the match day threads on here. You'll get one sensible post for every five idiotic ones (being generous).

1063~~~
1 goal and assist for a nothing player  <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1064~~~
He's been properly good this second half for my money.

1065~~~
What the feck was Rooney doing there? Threw himself down. Would have been more in the way had he stood still.

1066~~~
Inside forward then we are still fecking carrying him

1067~~~
An inside forward?

1068~~~
Much much better 2nd half, he upped the urgency a lot.

1069~~~
1 goal, 1 assist <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1070~~~
Our best attacking player bar Martial, problem is not getting the ball to him enough

1071~~~
Apart from the first 25 when he didn't touch the ball basically, I thought he was great today. Fully deserved the goal.

1072~~~
He got an assist for the first one? Couldn't see it on my stream.

1073~~~
He drifts out of games far too much but his statistical output is too good to not have in the team. Reminds me a bit of Rooney a few seasons back, actually.

1074~~~
Very good today. On the ball calm and composed like usual (PSV was a one-off in that regard) but he showed more potency expected of him. Off the ball his movement was great though much of that was due to the fact Southampton came to play so space was there to be exploited.

1075~~~
Should be, he was offside though

1076~~~
just play him instead of rooney, then bring young out wide. It's odd because he can contribute nothing for 60 minutes then grab a goal, which is why he's so valuable to us when we arent playing particularly well.

1077~~~
He did great when he went central. I'd like him to get another chance there, even though I know he won't.

1078~~~
Didn't see a huge amount of ball, but whenever he has it he usually does the right thing

Think he is hugely important

1079~~~
Agreed.

1080~~~
Thought he was poor in the 1st half, but did better in the 2nd half.

His technique is superb. That was a very good finish.

1081~~~

1083~~~
1) Played a pretty damn good pass to Depay in the first half who should have scored if he timed his jump better
2)Scored a very simple yet crucial goal off of a rebound
3)Put Martial through to lead a counter attack
4) Looked pretty solid in the build up of plays

I do definitely agree with those who are concerned about the lack of balance...there is a huge hole on the right wing and for this to fully function we would need someone like Valencia playing at his best offensively.

1084~~~
Quite happy to carry a player who scores 1 and assists 1

1085~~~
He and the whole team looked better once he came inside a bit. Needs someone running outside him when he does that though, which Valencia offers far more of than Darmian.

1086~~~
More like he is helping to carry us?

1087~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1088~~~
Was Martial's goal counted as an assist for Mata?

1089~~~
It's not enough Stack his overall showing is not enough

1090~~~
I must be watching a different game from you buddy

1091~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/htG8TFD.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/htG8TFD.jpg"/>

1092~~~
To be honest I ddnt think he was our problem today. I dont think he is the right man to be out wide, would prefer to drop Rooney and play Mata behind the new boy but that wont ever happen. We lack intent on the right when Mata is out there, all his good work happens when he drifts inside.

1093~~~
I'm sorry but he wasn't good today, apart from his goal, his performance was lackluster and non-existent.

1094~~~
Pfff, you can prove anything with facts.

1095~~~
The Game where he played a great cross to Depay that should have been a goal if he had timed his jump correctly?
The game where he played another good cross off a corner for sneiderlin to completely butcher it?
The game where he scored a simply, yet very crucial goal that won us the game?
Th game where he put Martial through on a counter attack?
The game where he looked very solid coming through the middle?

Hop off the hate train and appreciate the god damn player who helped us to to win the game.

1096~~~
He's so much better than Rooney right now it's not even funny. That little Spaniard is a complete package.

1097~~~
He took the chance well but way too often he just doesn't move our play on when he gets the ball wide.

1098~~~
Bless him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1099~~~
I don't think he'll get the credit he deserves for his goal, that was not an easy chance but he made it look so.

1100~~~
Good goal,still a luxury player imo.

1101~~~
Goals and assists are the best kind of luxuries to be fair.

1102~~~
Yeah, I've seen him feck up chances like that before. I was expecting him to sky it!

1103~~~
As long as you are winning

1104~~~
Well, they kind of help you win.

1105~~~
Especially when you're struggling for them otherwise.

Take Mata out of today's team and we lose. Some luxury.

1106~~~
We won because of his goal.

1107~~~
Got better in the 2nd half. He was too quiet and almost pointless in the first half

1108~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1109~~~
That doesn't make sense as his goal was the last one we scored and we won by just 1.

1110~~~
fecking touché <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1111~~~
He's a difference maker and a match winner. I won't say we're lucky to have him here, because a club the size of ours should have top notch players. But he's in that elite bracket who can help win you titles.

1112~~~
Looking at the matchday threads (today and previous ones), and this thread, it seems to me like Mata is becoming the CAF's new scapegoat. He actually didn't see much of the ball today, especially in the first half, but did well when he got on the ball. 1 goal and 1 assist, and you still have people moaning. Unbelievable.

1113~~~
I have mixed feeling about him. Obviously he is quality and classy, and a charming good man too. Always manage to provide us some vital goals and assist in the game, but at the same time he is slow and weak and leave us a big hole on the right hand side. He is still my first choice though, but we need to work something out there, maybe Valencia on the right back?

1114~~~
The guy could sit down all game and I'd still love him.

1115~~~
Even if he's not constantly involved in the game, he remains productive. He's usually capable of delivering when it matters. I'd rather see someone like him not being overly involved in the game but popping up with something when it matters, as opposed to a faster winger who's on the ball a lot, but has no end product and is ultimately more wasteful.

1116~~~
There is a reason he starts every game. I think LVG considers him one of the first names on the team sheet.

1117~~~
I was a little disappointed when he didn't end his post match interview by saying 'hugs'

1118~~~
He almost always makes a difference, either by keeping it simple and keeping possession, or by creating chances, or by scoring/assisting even when not playing well! Love him!

1119~~~
I'm giving him an '8' for today. 

Scored his goal, basically assisted the first, good pass to Schneiderlin for his shot from the corner and kept us ticking over nicely.

Little magician. Fantastic player.

1120~~~
Yep. The opening 25ish minutes he hardly touched the ball, but was brilliant after that. A shame he had an off day against PSV... Like he was involved and the movement was good, it was his touch that let him down which is usually flawless. So clearly just a bad day for us. But I have my doubts that Van Gaal will pick him in the hole any time soon, even though when he plays on the right, he always comes inside to act as a #10 basically.

1121~~~
I think LVG likes him coming in from the right. He clearly trusts him, Mata/Smalling/Blind/Darmian have started every game and played the most minutes. Maya's the only attacking player out of those 4 and that speaks volumes for how much he trusts Mata.

1122~~~
Bring back Tony? Love the way opinion whip-saws on the Caf.

1123~~~
Still want him central. He's a much better player then Rooney, and with a two pacey players on either side, and upfront, Mata would thrive (even more).

1124~~~
Kind of why the off day against PSV is frustrating. His movement was good and got in great positions, but his touch and passing let him down which is so uncharacteristic from him. Rooney will play there when fit most of the time, which means Mata will be on the right, so he has to take the chances he gets in hole in order to stay there.

1125~~~
I think he's easily marked out of games in the middle. Especially if the opposing team sits deep.

1126~~~
He has an invaluable ability to pop up with a goal or an assist even if he's struggling. I thought he played well in the 2nd half today, was much more involved.

As always a fantastic finish for his goal, made it look easier than it was.

1127~~~
Been easily better than Rooney this season. When he imposes himself on games, he is fantastic.

He just has a habit of disappearing at times which is annoying. His technique is probably the best in the team.

1128~~~
Trying to be sensible in this thread is folly. It's amazing to me that posters can brandish words in here like "non-existent", "luxury player", "liability" when he's our most productive player. How can a non existent player literally win us the game?

1129~~~
Another game, yet another direct impact on the result. Average performance but in the right place at the right time again and just keeps on producing. Great to see.

1130~~~
I've literally seen posts from people that say "didn't do anything but score" or "only time I noticed him was when he scored" ... which Is mind boggling really.

1131~~~
That's all well and good Mockney, but as someone in this thread has told me before "The goals stat only tells you the number of times a person has had the last touch"...

1132~~~
Yeah but you wouldn't sign Gerrard which renders that table useless.

1133~~~
*booooom* (inception sound).

maybe he disappears on purpose....so he can reappear for the goal/assist?!

*boooooooooommmmm*

1134~~~
Zing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1135~~~
There's one thing I noticed about Mata, he really has quite the tendency to fool linesmen that he's not offside. Goal against Liverpool last season, goal against City last season and now this assist, all offside but still got away with it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1136~~~
It's true and long may it continue.

1137~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> not bad

1138~~~
I agree. It's Juan Bloody Mata. He always delivers when needed the most.

1139~~~
All a player needs to do to be rated again on the Caf is lose his place in the team. Valencia did have a good game yesterday but Darmian deserves his spot.

1140~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Shoes on the other foot now, isn't it!

1141~~~
I think some posters just want a direct winger who is going to try beating his man every time they get the ball and then whip the ball in, even if that fails 9 times out of 10. You simply can't afford that kind of wastefulness in modern football. I'm glad that Mata plays more patiently and waits for the right opportunities instead.

1142~~~
I fully agree with that. One player that I really can't stand is Jesus Navas. He's a traditional wide winger - as traditional as you can get: and I can't stand him. It's always the same thing. Try to beat your man with speed, try to curl the ball into the box. Can't shot.

Mata is a phenomenal player with a skill set that is only matched by Barcelona. I think people need to cool down and see the bigger picture.

1143~~~
Guarantees double figures every season.

1144~~~
That is what <a class="username" data-user="46569, @NinjaFletch" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/46569/">@NinjaFletch</a> wants. <span style="color: #ffffff">c-c-c-c-c- COUNTER WUM.</span>

He's playing at inside forward when he is up on the right though. Since he is a left footer he should be playing on the opposition fullback and driving at goal and inside for a shot or to link up with the 10/9. There is a lot of dribbling out toward his own goal and passing back and sideways. That is the main argument.

1145~~~
I don't think he is that kind of inside forward at all actually. He's more like a wide playmaker who drifts inside and makes disguised runs behind the defence. So you can say he's a kind of forward in that he gets into scoring positions, but he does that by making a run and receiving a pass into space, not by dribbling into them. The rest of the time he helps keep possession and circulate the ball, while making the odd incisive pass. 

The wide threat on the right needs to come from the right back instead, and Darmian isn't good enough at that atm. Rafael probably would have been, but had other issues.

1146~~~

1147~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> What do you mean?

1148~~~
Yeah that is the main argument, he's leaving the right side almost unmanned and lacking any directness at all. A lot of the time because he drifts inside and out of position with how he plays the role. But like you (and finneh and Ninje) said, goals, keeping possession and high retention and none of that really means anything, in the end if he score then it is job done. I still think personally he has to strike more of a balance in his attacking play and add into his game that directness that Depay offers. Because he almost becomes pretty predictable and it allows the defence to be tighter because they know he's not going to offer anything.

1149~~~
I meant that he has amazing technique. Only the players in Barcelona (maybe not only) have got that standard of one touch football and magic flicks. We should be happy he's with us.

1150~~~
He was better in the 2nd half. He just needs to find a way to be more involved and avoid these phases where he's just out there like a stranger.

Oddly enough, him and Darmian hardly combine over the right flank

1151~~~
He's wasted on the right. Much prefer him when he's in the middle.

1152~~~
It's never going to happen, but Mata behind Martial would be great to see. Flanked maybe by Young and Depay. its criminal that Rooney will start ahead of Mata as a number 10 these days.

1153~~~
He was superb yesterday. He changed the game. He was the one player brave enough to try and create something (while everyone else just focused on keeping possession). I cant tell if its his own nature to be brave or LVG has given him more freedom than the others. Either way it worked a treat. A great performance AND an assist and goal. Well played. To play that well after having a mare v PSV showed character

1154~~~
It happened 6 days ago.

1155~~~
That's true - looks like he instantly put that bad performance behind him, which is great to see.

1156~~~
I battered him the other night but he was much, much better yesterday. Good on him.

1157~~~
That happened against PSV didn't it?

1158~~~
Yes it did

1159~~~
Actually he doesn't pass the ball to Martial as I thought, it's the defender who kicks it. Has any stats center gave him the assist?

1160~~~
Don't think many have. It's not an assist, but obviously the goal wouldn't have happened without him, so it's as good as one.

1161~~~
I like him on the right actually. He is a key player for our current possession setup. The fact that he is so productive is just a massive bonus.

That being said, to get the best out of him in this role you need a beast of a RB behind him, like a prime Alves

1162~~~
The way I see it he is producing the goals and assists but not quite the performances. I don't know what we can do about that other than getting in somebody like alves behind him. (Or perhaps wait for Darmian to improve)

Unless of course we replaced him with a marquee signing like Reus or Bale ( not so likely, is it). Although my personal preference is somebody either like Greizmann or potential like Draxler

1163~~~
He just needs to come hunt for the ball sooner. Probably not limited to United but, often we tend to focus trying to break down teams mostly on one side and these days that is often through the left side. So when Mata does stay out right, he sees very little of the ball. Part of the reason we got better yesterday was Mata came and looked for the ball, he was ending up all the way on the left sideline. When he does get on the ball he usually ups the pace for us a little. Been thinking for a while that he really should be our #10 but, that in this system is a very specific role in that LVG wants that player more central and closer to goal. Maybe part of the problem is at the start of the games, he holds his position a bit more to figure out what the opposition are going to do down our right side - dunno but, it's typical of him not to really enter the game till a good 20-30 min have gone by

From the right if Mata just is given autonomy from the start to roam and our CM is given instruction to cover the right when he does roam while we are in possession then he can start doing it earlier in games.

1164~~~
Of course, totally forgot about that. And it didn't work at all... Perhaps I'll leave the tactics to LVG!

1165~~~
That was a real workman like performance yesterday which I've not seen from him before. There was a couple of times he tried to get on the end of a couple of chances inside the box. I know he says he's not a winger but he did do a very good job for us out there (albeit he does drift inside an awful lot).

1166~~~
Im probably one of the few members here that see him as a very good wide right forward. Played well yesterday and did well for both goals he had a hand in

1167~~~
Prefer him on the right that at no.10. It means Herrera should be able to get in the team, blocking Young. While I have been satisfied with Young's performance he's inefficient. Like another poster mentioned, he'll look to take on his man consistently but then often failing with the crosses. Sometimes a good delivery but even if the deliveries are often good, you need to be finding a man, which I feel he doesn't do enough.

1168~~~
It is kind of weird that when he was at Valencia, he played wide and he actually had some pace/acceleration. He's only 27 and yet it seems he's completely lost all of that lol. I've said it before but I still think he looks as though he's 'carrying' weight; he could be more leaner and possibly be that extra half yard sharper, which imo would help him and our game massively. Maybe it's dribbling technique but Silva's style of carrying the ball is majestic and with that fleet footed step he can actually go past people. Mata had this before and I still think he has it but where has it gone?! Maybe being the only creative link between the midfield and attack hinders his game i.e Aguero, Navas, Sterling, Toure are equally capable of dropping and dictating play in their familar formation, whereas Mata is usually the last one to give that final pass/chance.

Either way, his qualities now should be that he plays centrally and has freedom to pop around the pitch/into the flanks. This right sided position is surely not a long term solution because he will struggle to impact games where teams attack down that side or are able to keep the ball better than us. Hopefully someone like Martial can drift that side of the pitch and link up with him because we need some serious width. It's not about needing to beat the full back and being able to cross but width stretches teams when they press/anticipate the ball. Earlier above someone criticised Navas and rightly so but it shouldn't be because of his orthodox style, which imo is glorious, it should be for his lack of consistent end product. For the amount chances he creates/gets into very good positions he should be a regular double tally goal scorer and assister.

I've said it before in other threads but players like Young and Valencia should be getting game time the way they are (not for the long term but as soporadic starters and 'game-changers' as subs) now because their orthodox style compliment our intuitive, intelligent players like Mata, Herrera, Schweinsteiger, Depay, Martial etc. Not to mention their fearless professionalism and experience.

1169~~~
He instantly creates something once he moves in or rotates to that #10 role. He is so much more dangerous than anyone we have who could play behind the striker.

1170~~~
Has anyone gone back to the second half of the Moyes season and last season and seen how many times he's blazed the ball over from inside the area? Against Palace he had three in one game before getting the lone goal, Soton at home he had two. One thing I noticed that I thought was a bit strange.

1171~~~
See that's the issue with Mata. If he starts on the right in current 4-2-3-1 and drifts inside there is nobody attacking from the right wing. That makes it easy for opposition defenders to double mark Depay, who is struggling to create in the EPL.

I liked him more in the right attacker last season. His dribbling isn’t anything special but he’s good at creating for himself that little bit of space to pass, cross or shoot. That’s how he played last year when we used 4-3-3 (I mean, the real 4-3-3, not the one LvG is talking about). He also could get in dangerous positions more as he stayed high up the pitch.

I see a lot of people are happy that he’s influencing game and so, but it makes us easy to defend because we’re attacking only from the left. It’s easy to see how we struggle to score goals from open play, and it will be even more difficult now with Shaw out.

1172~~~
We did just tonk away three against Soton though. Granted two were pretty gifty.

Another example of Mata not staying forward on a counter.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/2elo" width="560"></iframe>

1173~~~
That's not really a counter... this is a counter!



look at those little legs go!

1174~~~
Jesus, Rooney actually showed pace there, touch was ordinary but.

1175~~~
Rooney still has good straight line, off the ball pace. He's just fecked doing anything else quickly

1176~~~
We were very lucky to score first and second goal, so it proves my point that we struggle to score from open play.

So are you suggesting Mata is playing too deep?

1177~~~
As in, he's being deployed deep? Or he's not playing his position properly?..

1178~~~
Lucky in that the first was offisde? To be fair, it was a hard one to spot, with Mata coming back into an onside position and the linesman not being sure whether Rooney touched the ball on the way through. It still required decent movement from Mata and great work from Martial to score.

The second goal, yeah its a bad back pass, but it needs Martial to be alive to the situation... we made our own luck in both scenarios. 

They were no more lucky then Southampton's first, and to an extent their second (if we're saying our 2nd is poor defending, then so is their 2nd)

1179~~~
Yeah, I agree he's playing too deep.

I guess you missed that it was Southampton defender who kicked the ball and it landed under Martial feet. Double luck.

You sound like the only scenario you would consider as “luck” is when the opposition score an own goal. Yeah it required Martial to be aware but we didn’t manage to create such an easy goalscoring situation on our own, so yeah, it was very fortunate.

First Southampton goal was scored after DDG made a safe from Mane shot, so it’s close to our third (I don’t consider it as lucky goals).

Calling our second goal as “bad defending” is bizarre, it was a pass to the striker feet.

I don’t understand why so many people won’t admit we were very lucky to score those goals and it was Southampton who had better chances.

1180~~~
So anything that isn't a direct pass to feet count as luck?

And it's not really luck, he had to make the tackle, and there's only one place the ball could have gone once he made the tackle, to the side, which is where Martial was.

I meant their second goal. The ball is crossed to Pelle who is free of anyone even remotely bothering to mark him for some bizarre reason. He has a free jump to head the ball into the net... completely ridiculous on our part, obviously not as bad as Yoshida's backpass, but certainly in the same realm of terrible defending.

Basically, we were only as lucky in front of goal as Southampton were - but you make your own luck in football. This was a game that, after the first 30 minutes, we completely dominated until their 2nd goal went in. I imagine if we had defended that goal with any shred of decency we'd have seen the game out with little fuss.

And what were these great Southampton chances? The header from the corner that De Gea made a superb save from? Everything else was half chances/shots from outside the box.

1181~~~
If I said we got lucky because we won after an own goal, you would probably say the same. Come on, it sounds ridiculous.

No- because Pelle and Mane were in control of the situation, the latter made a perfect cross and the former scored a nice goal. Our defence made a mistake- but I don’t consider it as lucky goal. If it worked like that you could always said “if X was closer to Y, you wouldn’t score”. But they did, and we never touched the ball- unlike our first two goals. We were not in control, we got lucky.

We dominated, fair enough. My point is we needed the fortune on our side to score 2 of those goals. We can’t count on that.  

I remember Blind saving us twice, plus Pelle hitting the post. I would like to remind you David De Gea was 2nd highest rated player with 8.5 (Martial was on 8.8). They definitely had the better chances.

I saw a lot of people who don’t want to admit we were lucky, but would they say the same if it was Southampton who scored those goals? Yeah, I don’t see it.

1182~~~
I know he has his fans here but the way he plays the position drives me nuts, so often he gets the ball in a position to attack the fullback and he either passes it back or sideways, and yes I know he does that because he realizes he can't go past anyone and needs to wait for the overlap, but it's so frustrating to watch.

1183~~~
Had a good game.

1184~~~
Looked like he had an excellent match judging by the comments I've read and what I did get to see of the game. He was unlucky not to get a goal.

1185~~~
Another pretty ordinary 70mins for him, his little dart for the second was important though. Makes you think again that being a little more direct and forward thinking he could do this a lot more often and cause more problems. I think he really benefited from Valencia being an absolute balls out madman and running up the right hand side almost every time. I have to admit that his linkup with Darmian seems to have dried up because Darmian has realized the guy is a loose cannon positionally and doesn't want to go charging up field to be caught miles out of position which is almost a certainty when Mata drifts inside.

1186~~~
He rubbishes the idea that LVG is too rigid. There's no position he doesn't find himself in the front 6.

1187~~~
Right inside forward.
<span style="color: #ffffff">KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM BABY.</span>

1188~~~
he drifts all over the place. Arts what I'm saying. LVG gives him a lot of freedom.

1189~~~

That touch. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1191~~~

1192~~~
for years and years Fergie had complained we didn't have enough goals coming from midfield. #Johnnykills.

1193~~~
Don't care about arguments about him as a player when you see stats like that. Yes, they don't tell the whole story but the part of the story they do tell is that he directly impacts the game more than most.

1194~~~
Opinions on him start shifting as he's hitting form. It's obvious he's taken a step up the last couple of games.

1195~~~
That goal stat is very impressive.

1196~~~
Also impressive al Toure and Hazard have 6 penalties between them.

1197~~~
Were all of this guys posts before he was banned in this thread?

1198~~~
He really is a wonderful player when on song.

1199~~~
I think he plays much better with Valencia over lapping him. At the minute Darmian is too safe and doesn't want to risk overlapping, which really limits Mata's space. I prefer Darmain defensively but in the games we are needing to break down teams, I think Valencia should be starting IMO. Against Sunderland it should be the same, Darmian needs a little rest IMO.

1200~~~
I think he has the most from open play

1201~~~
Great skill set but wasted at right side of a 3 imo kills our momentum going forward up the right side but when he picks the ball up centrally he is a danger to any team. But he needs employed in the right manner!

1202~~~
Another assist. His output with goals/assists is top class.

1203~~~
Did he mean it?

He was obviously watching Depay while the ball was travelling but I am not sure if he meant to pass it to him or if it was poor shot.

Good run behind the defence though, he is again involved in our goal.

1204~~~
Another assist. His output with goals/assists is top class.

1205~~~
He clearly meant it. Its pretty obvious on replay.

1206~~~
There's calls to bench him, which make no sense. He consistently contributes in the final third.

1207~~~
Thought that one was a bit lucky really and he didn't have a good half (compared to how he's been this season in general)... But you can't deny that he's being productive. His weight on a few of those lobbed passes has been poor though for a player like him, same with that free kick. Hopefully he'll improve in the second, as when his final ball is on it's game, that's when we'll be scoring loads because he plays such a big part of our attack.

Edit: On the replay was clearly an assist. Good spot. Though I don't know why he wouldn't shoot from there but it worked out!

1208~~~
Had a poor first half, but that was a good assist

1209~~~
Great composure to pass that across the face of goal.

1210~~~

1211~~~
I love him so much <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1212~~~
People genuinely thought he should be dropped for Young or Valencia. People are very stupid sometimes.

1213~~~
Exactly.

1214~~~
He's good at making that back post run. We've seen him miss control that ball there recently, but he's scored and assisted many times from there.

1215~~~
Typical Mata performance. Gets an assist but "masks" (might be a disservice to overlook his contribution in terms of stats to be fair) ineffectiveness otherwise and general anonymity. I mean he's spent a lot of time drifting centrally into an area where Rooney is already playing and left a big hole on the right which means that whenever the ball comes into that area it just ends up being recycled backwards because there's no one ahead of the ball. His lack of willingness to keep the width there is really helping Sunderland to keep tight and compact and is one of the reasons we continue to be easy to defend against on the whole.

1216~~~
If we wanted our RW to stay wide then we wouldn't be playing Mata there. Bit weird to hold that up as evidence against him when absolutely nobody thinks he's supposed to be keeping width in this set up.

1217~~~
Such a productive player. Needed a piece of skill like that to open things up.

1218~~~
So productive yet gets so little respect on here.

1219~~~
I love the little fella, but I honestly reckon I'd be faster than him in a sprint.

1220~~~
He obvious has licence to come inside. However doesn't mean he should leave his FB isolated when the ball is down there. He should make an attempt to come towards the ball and try to create an option or 2 vs 1 situation. It's gotten to the point where Martial and Rooney have spent more time wide than Mata.

1221~~~
Luxury player assisted two goals today when we weren't playing well.

1222~~~
It was a good run and good touch, but the player who really took the risk and produced the goods was Blind.

1223~~~
Fantastic performance today. MOM by far. Don't get why so many United fans don't appreciate him. Our best outfield player.

1224~~~
It was a combination. Without Mata there would be no goal.

1225~~~
He's a bit underrated this season in my opinion, he's an excellent player really.

1226~~~
It's really unreal how productive he is. Great for the lad, great game.

1227~~~
Tough call for man of the match for me between Mata and Martial.

1228~~~
Still the best attacker we have at the club.

1229~~~
It would be much better if he stayed wide on the line for the first and last goal, we would have much more space in the middle for Martial and Rooney.

1230~~~
That's why this man has to play, somehow somewhere.

1231~~~
Journal Writing Munchkin is our most productive player this season. 

Love him.

1232~~~
Productive as usual. Goal and an assist. Excellent. 

Good overall game too. Some of his touches are absolutely wank worthy.

1233~~~
Everyone criticises him but his stats are superb. Goals, assists, everything.

1234~~~
Really really good at football.
Not the biggest, not the quickest. Nothing he can do about either and those are his only weaknesses. 

He really should be playing every game. He is almost always involved.

1235~~~
Yeah but the risk and execution was all from Blind's side. That was much harder and took a lot more skill.

You can't argue with a goal and assist from him today but he sort of reminds me of Berbatov in 2010/11. Yes scoring goals but is he the right fit for the team and really the best fit in our attacking play? Sort of the same way 07/08 Ronaldo scored double the goals of 06/07 Ronaldo but didn't have the same fluency in his game. 

If you take out his goal and assist, which is a  nonsense to be fair, I can't remember a single thing he did of note. In contrast, take away Martial's assist, I still remember his hold up play, his touches, him stretching the defence, running at players, creating a chance for Memphis on a plate. I hope the point is clear here. Clinical player but not not yet convinced he's the right fit for us.

1236~~~
Nice work today..

1237~~~
Steady on! He's been dire at times this season.

1238~~~
Actually thought he was poor in the first half, but he has so much quality that a goal or assist (or both) always seems to be just around the corner. That's why he plays every week.

1239~~~
Hes a weird case. Does not look very impressive, but his output is just unreal.

1240~~~
On top of my head excellent hold up play and over the top pass for Valencia when he was surrounded by three players in second minute of the game. Also great control and shot from 16m after Pantilimon made excellent save.

You are talking bollocks.

1241~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/39hr" width="560"></iframe>

He stopped the ball dead before shooting. Fantastic footballer.

1242~~~
A very concise post.

1243~~~
''He's only a luxury player''. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1244~~~
Another game, and more "luxuries" from Mata....

1245~~~
Mata's output makes all talk about his performances seem silly. He consistently delivers the basics, movement, passing, and positioning. You can also guarantee he will either score or assist two out of every three matches. Nobody can argue with those stats.

1246~~~
He's our most productive player and most consistent non-defender/goalkeeper.

1247~~~
He had a very good game today, even though his passes weren't always perfect in the first half, he was in the right place at the right time almost all the time.

1248~~~
He just needs to stay close to goal and everything will be fine. His positioning and first touch are getting him in an awful lot of fantastic opportunities to score.

1249~~~
Had a very good game indeed. Classy all around.

1250~~~
Useless. Keeps scoring useless goals and providing useless assists. Like we need those to win games.

1251~~~
That's harsh mate you're being very unfair on him. He did very well to square the ball for Memphis. He also had a good shot denied by a fantastic save.

1252~~~
Valencia makes all the difference in he world for Mata.

1253~~~
He's responded brilliantly to a poor game against PSV. His first touch for his goal was magnificent.

1254~~~
tell you what, in the the match day thread, people were complaining about him. But he's so bloody good 85% of the time. If LVG sold him tomorrow....goodness knows what would happen on here.

1255~~~
Marvellous today he was everywhere, easily my MOTM. 

I love him... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1256~~~
Keeps us ticking, scores and assists. Out best outfield player.

1257~~~
I'd argue you're extremely biased against him in that case. He completely bossed the game and controlled our play after the break. Hardly put a foot wrong.

1258~~~
The best thing is that despite getting the job done with simple good assists (and some amazing first touches) he has the potential to have an absolute world class day as well. He is a brilliant player. I said it last years (even when we had ADM) that he's our most skilled player.

1259~~~
Fair play. I doubted Mata a little bit but his performances have improved. Excellent touch for the goal.

1260~~~

1261~~~
Everyone around me in the ground was fawning over him in the second half

1262~~~
Yeah I think I agree
Probably been our best this season

1263~~~
Yes he is a little frustrating because of his lack pace and power but damn he is on productive player and at the end of the day it's goals and assists that define games. Wonderful little player.

1264~~~
I can understand that. He's such a skilful player for us. No, not aggressive and not intimidating, just understands the weight of a ball at a crucial time. It's a real talent.

1265~~~
Sloppy in the first half but made some good runs in the second half, definitely enjoys having Valencia out there.

1266~~~
Not sure if this has been mentioned before, and I havent been able to check its validity just yet, but I have seen a comment stating that he has scored the most goals in the league of any midfielder, since he signed for us.

1267~~~
I think its goals and assists, maybe it is goals now aswell

1268~~~
I think a lot of people simply don't understand mata's role in the team. He has played more minutes than most for a reason, I have no doubt he's doing pretty much everything that LVG is asking of him. He adds numbers to attack in all areas of attack, keeps possession sublimely, and is creating and assisting. Just because you don't notice him until he scores or assists doesn't mean he is being poor, I'd say the fact that he's constantly on the stat sheet says he is performing.

1269~~~
He was very good again. It's hard for some to appreciate his qualities, so I'm glad that the manager isn't asleep to those qualities

1270~~~
Very good game. Much better in the 2nd like the entire team.

His technique is just superb.

1271~~~
"If you take away he's goal and assist he was poor"

Hahahaha that is an unbelievable statement

1272~~~
Aren't a few little luxuries actually good for you?

1273~~~
3 goals and 5 assists in 11 games. 

Those are some POTY stats right there <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1274~~~
Not a dig at you mate, I agree with your opinion that Mata's a wonderful player. What annoys me is the "pace and power" talk. No one used that description until Gary Neville on MNF and now it's a go-to phrase.

1275~~~
I was surprised to see a speed stat posted during the game of  United's 3 fastest players

1) Martial 33.summat
2) Valencia 32.summat
3) Mata 32.summat

No way can Mata run as fast as Valencia. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1276~~~
He is fine as he is but his limitations make him far too reliable on others to be considered a top top player. His touch, intelligence and goal threat would make him difficult to handle if he had more strength. Like Rooney he benefits a lot from having Valencia in the side.

1277~~~
Valencia's defensive vulnerabilities could be negated by beast mode Smalling and if he can improve his crossing enough to create half chances (and I'm sure the coaching staff will work with him on that) then he can offer us something down the right making Mata an effective weapon.

With Mata in the team I didn't like how little we offered offensively down the right when Darmian was playing, Mata needed to be in the team because we had nobody else at that level, but we also had to create more down the right flank.

1278~~~
Just a goal and an assist. Stealing a living here.

1279~~~
God, these sarcastic 'haha he scored useless' posts are really cringey. Very strong performance today. His statistical output is fantastic.

1280~~~
Our number 10 on the flank. Vision, skill and a nose for the goal. What more can and will you ask i wonder.

1281~~~
He was great today wasn't he? Anyone who says otherwise need their eyes testing.

1282~~~
Nah, the ones that are poking fun of those who have said he's useless, a luxury player etc... It's just a bit too primary school like as a rebuttal for me.

1283~~~
Those posts are still not as bad as the routine posts after every game criticizing him for his "lack of pace, doesn't stay wide, slows the game down, doesn't do anything/stays anonymous, etc."

1284~~~
It's actually amazing when you consider that he was our 3rd fastest player today, behind Martial and Valencia!

1285~~~
this lack of pace argument...
..

1286~~~
Don't really get that. People have called him a useless/luxury player - so why can't people use sarcasm to refute it? I mean, those comments are pretty silly to begin with, so whats the harm with responding with a bit of silliness? Not everything has to be deadly serious all the time.

1287~~~
Saw that myself and was surprised that Depay isn't in that list.

1288~~~
Glad I'm not the only one who saw it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1289~~~
MotM for me today. His passing is very useful to us as well, keeps us ticking over in the opponent's half which is something Rooney can't do consistently at the moment and Carrick - Schneiderlin are usually too deep for. But apparently he would be a better player to some if he just stayed wide and tried to beat his man and cross all day <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>. Moyes might be gone but his vision lives on, clearly.

1290~~~
I like him on the wing. He has a great habit of ghosting into space at the back like he did today, something we wouldn't get from a traditional wide player. Deserves credit for his composure, never snatches at or hurries his shots and he's scored a number of goals by taking a touch first. 

Also, having Martial up front is making a big difference, there's much more space for him to operate in

1291~~~
Mata: the beautiful and fast devil

1292~~~
Well I mean if the initial posts are just silly throwaway comments, then the sarcasm response is fine. But from most of the posts I've seen highlighting criticisms in Mata's play tend to have some rationale and level of analysis to them.

1293~~~
That finish today made me laugh, it was like he gave himself a free kick in the area <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1294~~~
Yep, but it's a day for the Mata fanboys so I guess that'll be the tone.

1295~~~
Was he shooting or passing for that first goal?

1296~~~
Yeah, tbf most of the criticism of Mata is fairly reasonable and directed towards faults in his game that are fairly obvious.

I don't think the sarcastic responses are really directed towards those sort of comments though. It's more aimed at those who thought we should drop him for Young/Valencia, or who implied that goals/assists are a luxury, or who blamed Mata for problems that aren't his fault in the first place, or who described him as pointless, or who rubbished the idea that he is actually one of our best players.

People with those sort of opinions deserve every bit of sarcasm that comes their way as those are, objectively, very stupid opinions.

1297~~~
It's definitely a pass.... I doubt he'd cushion a shot in such a manner.

1298~~~
Yeah he hit a pass against Lens and then lost the foot race to win that ball back, it was kind of funny, like a pug chasing dobermans at a dog park. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1299~~~
MOTM easily.  Most effective player on the pitch, but need Valencia.

1300~~~
Worked very hard today. Normally he'd complete one or two of the dinks over the top he mishit. Will start setting up Memphis more an more, I think, with Memphis making good runs between RB and RCB and Martial attracting more attention. Would be helped by someone more mobile than Rooney as a 10.

1301~~~
If Herrera played as the #10 that's our strongest line up imo. Would rather Mata as a 10 but lack a right winger.

Great performance today. Having a mobile forward in front of him helps things a lot.

1302~~~
Yet again, goals and assists. I will say it again, he directly impacts games more than anyone and for that reason should be one of the first names on the team sheet.

I don't want to get carried away by one of the easiest goals he will ever score but when you watch that first touch in slow motion, the way it just spins back and sits, it's a thing of beauty.

More of the same midweek Juan. Hugs.

1303~~~
Alongside Martial he's our best attacking player this season. It's cringeworthy how people try to shoot him down time and time again with the same bollocks and it's always him who's on the scoresheet either with a goal or an assist. He should've had probably atleast one assist more today but other attacking players weren't sharp enough in the first 15 minutes or so when he's created very good chance(s).

And it's not really just stats with him, he's working very, very hard all over the pitch, role model player for me.

1304~~~
Getting back to his best pretty much.

1305~~~
In football acceleration and pace over a short distance is most important. Mata is especially poor in this area. He might hit a high top speed on a chase back up the pitch 60 yards, however.

1306~~~
It was brilliant, didn't realise how good until the slow-mo replay on MOTD. It just nestled to a halt straight away to rest like a set piece on the 6 yard line.

1307~~~
Some fans still can't understand his role in the team. To them he needs to be a winger, dribbling at speed and taking players on and getting crosses in. Thankfully, LVG sees otherwise and the way he plays reflects that.

1308~~~
He has been one of our best players so far this season without a doubt. To think some people on here thought he was holding us back and was nothing more than a luxury player, his performances this season in a less favoured role have been very good.

1309~~~
This is the issue. They can't undertand the role of a false winger. We look more composed in the opposition half when he plays.

1310~~~
He's been one of our best players ever since the 2nd half of last season. He actually tracks back and works hard on the defensive side of the game which is brilliant to see.

1311~~~
I think he has a tendency to flit in and out of games. Whenever I watch him I always remember at least a couple of moments of magic but he doesn't seem like the kind of player who imposes himself on a match. He kind of adorns the match instead. Would be fantastic in a complete side though, so hopefully he'll have a more consistent impact as the side around him improves.

1312~~~
Even David Silva drifts in and out of games. What's important is that they make impact when they are in and around the box.

1313~~~
Great player - my only concern is that he loses the ball too often at times.. probably because of the way he carries the ball, it's easier for the opponents to get a toe in usually..

1314~~~
But out of all our attackers, he's usually at the bottom of stats showing who's given the ball away.

1315~~~
Also does quite a bit of recovery work whenever he loses the ball, usually helping us win it back again in short order. Mourinho might have felt his work-rate was lacking at Chelsea but I haven't seen any problems with it at United so far.

1316~~~
Unfortunately a lot of people base their opinions on players by how good they are in FIFA. Has no pace and strength? Must be shit.

There was a thread here a couple weeks ago where some guys argued that Tony fecking Valencia should start over him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1317~~~
I don't think given the way he has played and how poor we were up top till Martial came in that deserves a smiley! He has been largely average this season (he's a talented player) and his stats look great but it's torture to watch him at right of a front three he is severely hampered and United attacks up the right side suffer. Long term he should be 10 or sub imo. Happy he's at United though the more class players the better. But let's not be blinkered about it we need better in that position he's occupying although this doesn't necessarily mean Mata dropping out the team.

1318~~~
He is also number 2 in the team for most interceptions. Just behinfpd Schneiderlin.

1319~~~
I agree, we need someone more dynamic on the right, Mata should play in the middle.

1320~~~
Wow, now that's a surprising stat to me. Is it maybe also because he has the most minutes of our outfield players? Would like to see an interception / minutes breakdown.

1321~~~
He does have a bad game where he goes missing in about 4-5 games, but we can easily afford that.  His quality in the games where's good in is just too much to leave him out.  His end product is usually excellent too.  Brilliant signing.

1322~~~
Still think that he's our best player after De Gea. He keeps the posession well, doesn't lose the ball often, keeps making very good chances for his teammates (like he did yesterday the header for Depay and that ball for Valencia) and have very good goal and assist output. While not exactly spectacular, he is a player who gives constantly a 7 or 8 every match.

1323~~~
I would love to see:

1324~~~
I think it was a pass. He kind of changes his body shape just before he touches it, very slightly. Looks to me like he tried to trick the keeper and defender into thinking he was going to shoot. And it worked!

1325~~~
I remember that day we signed Mata, I was over the moon ! Still very happy we have him, I was perhaps expecting even more from him but I am nonetheless delighted he is a Manchester United player.

1326~~~
Maybe it's just me, or I expect too much, but he's not hitting the herights, a good player though.

1327~~~
Mourinho sold him to give Oscar room. Imo he's much better than Oscar.

1328~~~
He's not excellent in anything, he's a good decent player.

1329~~~
Super performance by Mata yesterday, and it's clear that he's much better on the wing than the centre. 

I also think Valencia brings the best out of him, as he works the line much more than Darmian, which means Mata can drift in and get involved in the game more.

1330~~~
Wouldn't agree with that.

He's an excellent finisher inside the box. His touch is also excellent. And his passing approaches excellence at times (e.g. the one he laid on for Depay yesterday).

1331~~~
As I said in the matchday thread, when he's running around and getting involved in the midfield battles he genuinely looks like a 12 year old kid that's been brought along to a game between his dad and his mates on the astroturf at a local sports centre.

Running around far too slowly not really getting involved because he can't get to the ball or he'll get outjumped/outmuscled/out-tackled for a 50/50.

But if he has time and space then obviously he's got the talent to create a goal or score one and he'll get far too many plaudits for it.

1332~~~
He's as economical as it gets. He'll obviously never dominate a game with any physical attributes but he consistently contributes to a lot of our best play.

He's got 3 goals and 3 assists in 7 EPL games so far this year too.

I think people assumed he'd be playing an amazing diagonal pass which take out 4 defenders every game but that just isn't what he's about. If you look at some of his highlight reels though you'll realise that he's been a great signing for us. Some fantastic assists and brilliant goals.

I think he's going to end the season with around 15 goals and assists to his name which would be a great return.

1333~~~
I'm sorry, but that's bollocks. He's an excellent and clinical finisher, very good first touch and he is quite predatory with excellent movement in the box. He goes missing too much and doesn't dictate or progress our game as much as he should, but to say he doesn't have the one, solitary, excellent trait is mental.

1334~~~
I worked out that, in the league, when he's been on the pitch we've only scored two goals (OG vs. Spurs / Martial 2nd vs. Soton) where Mata either didn't score, lay on the assist, or be the last player to touch the ball before the assist.

Whenever we do anything remotely good attacking, more often not, he's involved around it somewhere.

1335~~~
He had 10 goals and 5 assists last season despite the team not being as good and being out of the side for a considerable period. I think he'll get more than that.

1336~~~
Was far more involved yesterday. Thought he had a great game, and I agree that he benefits from Valencia being at RB.

1337~~~
He got 4 assists last season actually so he's already beaten that this season, he's also equalled the assists he got when under Moyes. That's what happens when you have players who can actually finish a chance!

1338~~~
Just for clarity I mean he's going to score around 15 and assist around 15. Something like 12 goals and 17 assists.

1339~~~
I actually think he does that, to some extent. Not literally 4 defenders, but I think his diagonal passes to left wing when he changes the side completely and leaves our left winger with opposition fullback in one on one situation are really underrated, probably because Depay struggles to dribble past that player more often than not.

1340~~~
I really don't see any of this. For the type of player he is he works very hard in getting the ball back and makes plenty of interceptions. Oh, and I guess fans should be more muted when praising one of our players who creates and scores so many of our goals.

1341~~~
Took me a while to figure out what your first paragraph meant.  Is that right? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1342~~~
Had a check, he was wrong about the Herrera penalty v Liverpool and Martial v Liverpool. Carrick passed it to Herrera who won the penalty and Schweinsteiger passed it to Young who assisted Martial

OG v Spurs - not involved
Januzaj v Villa - Mata assist
Mata v Swansea - Mata goal
Blind v Liverpool - Mata assist
Herrera v Liverpool - not involved
Martial v Liverpool - not involved
Martial (1) v Southampton - Mata assist
Martial (2) v Southampton - not involved
Mata v Southampton - Mata goal
Depay v Sunderland - Mata assist
Rooney v Sunderland - Mata pass to Martial who assisted
Mata v Sunderland - Mata goal

So that's 4 goals he wasn't involved in, still pretty good.

1343~~~
He wasn't on the pitch for those goals. He'd already gone off. (If he'd been on vs. Liverpool, he'd probably have taken the pen!)

1344~~~
He is the type of player that you can't depend on to make your team better when in a bad rut. But, if the team is playing decent he can help elevate the team to a higher level. He should definitely be starting. He doesn't harm the team as long as the RB is willing to keep the width for him.

1345~~~
Oh shit, you're right. Fair enough!

1346~~~
Looks like it is! Step aside OptaJoe...

1347~~~
As I said before, will easily end up with 30 goals (goals and assists) combined this season, which would be great.

I also expect the same from Memphis.

1348~~~
Martial should help with that by drawing defenders and opening up spaces around the goal.

1349~~~
Exactly, that is why Herrera took the penalty.

1350~~~
Disagree. Silva seems to be at the centre of everything whenever City are at their best and he links up brilliantly with Aguero. Mata doesn't have anything like the same kind of involvement in our play. He has great moments but not great games. Silva has great games.

1351~~~
WTF do you mean he doesn't have great games. Most of the time Mata is also at the centre of anything positive we do drifting all over the place. Look at the stats. He's  s always one of the players with the most touches and passes in our team.

1352~~~
I don't need to look at the stats, I watch him week in week out. I feel like the figures mask his overall influence, which can often be marginal. He is a very talented player who has great moments but goes missing at times. I've explained my reasoning here, so do I have to go over it again for you? I will of you like. I'll even put bigger spaces between the words so your eyes don't get tired.

1353~~~
Well you are wrong.

1354~~~
Is this true?

1355~~~
Actually, when you put it like that... yes, you're right. I am wrong. How did I not see that? Thanks pal!

1356~~~
silva has been moved to the middle, not wide anymore hence everything going through him. While given the choice id take Silva but considering Mata is playing as a winger he is doing a fantastic job

1357~~~
Silva has been great wherever he's played but even more so playing centrally.
I'd like to see Mata play in the middle tbh, I think it's his best position, especially if we're going to play 2 dms. We need a creative spark ahead of them.

1358~~~
Please can we get a video of Mata's contributions because some people here expect an all action midfielder not a composed player.

1359~~~
Which we do have because Mata playing on the right takes up the same positions as he does when he plays centrally. 

I'm a fan of him from the right, I think he does a lot better as the spare man than he does as a classic number 10 lining up against the opposition DM.

1360~~~
Elaborate.

1361~~~
It is true. Though in terms of assists he has had 11 in 55 games for us and 27 in 82 for Chelsea. 

If you exclude the the 13/14 season (since he did not have full season with either team)

Goals:
United: 15 goals in 40 games (0.375)
Chelsea: 18 goals in 69 games (0.261)

Assists:
United: 8 assists in 40 games (0.2)
Chelsea: 25 assists in 69 games (0.362)

1362~~~
How will a smattering of good moments prove that he's more than just a smattering of good moments? And where did anyone state that he's supposed to be an all action midfielder?

1363~~~
The love for Mata way out weighs his performances imo. At times he's a passenger and one of our weakest links. Yet if he scores a goal or an assist he's suddenly the best player in our team. Truth be told he's not best suited to the role he plays for us but his left foot is a wand. I'd rather see him in his best position and a player more suited playing where he is playing right now.

1364~~~
Thing is you can't look at the stats because they just don't match up with what you're saying. Take yesterday for example, Mata had as many touches of the ball as Wayne Rooney (the bloke playing centrally), and made 10 more passes then him - I mean, how much more involved can he be? And that's just not a one off, he's quite often our attacking player who has had the most touches and made the most passes (the problem arises when <b><i>too </i></b>many of those passes become safe and he's just not really doing anything with the ball) - so he's obviously always involved in the game, and you can tell this from watching the game. Mata will never shy away from the ball and will always look to get on it.

1365~~~
its funny you mention this, as when I watch him at old Trafford as soon as he moves central and receives the ball he is pounced on immediately by defenders, he never has time on the ball and is juust nicking the pass away in time. that might be to do with his small frame and lack of pace but on the right he does tend to have more space drifting in as the forgotten man.

1366~~~
What does the man have to do to be properly appreciated on here? People are downright blind if they think the goal and assist was all he did in an otherwise anonymous performance. If Martial or Depay had played like that, there would be universal raving. 

It's crazy how high standards people measure Mata up to. He's been consistently one of our best players since he came and still people are debating whether he should start or not. Madness.

1367~~~
He's sometimes a passenger in that he'll have some very quiet games where he's not particularly effective (like most players), but he's not one of our weakest links. I really don't see that at all. You're saying he's "suddenly the best player in our team" when he scores as assists as if it's a thing he only does occasionally...when in actual fact he's regularly one of our most productive players. I'm struggling to name many players in our team who are better performers than him. Mata's been the most consistent and effective player along our attacking trios behind the striker: his end product far outweighs Depay's, while the rest of them have been in and out of the team.

1368~~~
You're quoting stats to someone who has already said that the stats can mask performances. How is that ever going to work? And the fact that he drifts infield to get on the ball isn't proof that he's playing brilliantly, it's proof that his starting position is all wrong. Yes, he would be better centrally, no your stats still didn't convince me that everything I've seen in the 18 months he's been at United is invalid. 
He's a very talented player who has moments of brilliance. I think he's capable of more than we've seen. 

Please don't reply with more stats.

Well I started my entire post with "you can't look at the stats because they just don't match up with what you're saying." so obviously I'm going to quote stats, but I've also qualified my post by saying "he's quite often our attacking player who has had the most touches and made the most passes (the problem arises when <b><i>too </i></b>many of those passes become safe and he's just not really doing anything with the ball) - so he's obviously always involved in the game, and you can tell this from watching the game."

This was in response to him "going missing" - but how can he go missing when he's one of our players who's always getting on the ball? Unless you're saying you don't notice him getting on the ball when watching the game? But then that wouldn't make a great deal of sense. The criticism <i>could </i>be that he doesn't do enough with the ball considering how much of it he gets, but I'm not entirely sure that's what you're saying.

For me, his starting position is only wrong for those people who want something different from that position (a winger who runs at defences namely) but considering we have that on the other wing, I'm more then happy for him to do what he's doing on that side of the pitch and consistently effect games in the manner which he's doing.

1370~~~
So I looked up some numbers and it turns out he has the highest interceptions (1.4) and tackles (1.2) / 90 mins in the league out of our attacking players (so not including Schmidfield and Carrick). Not bad for someone with a little bit of a reputation of being a passenger defensively. And yes, I know stats don't show the whole picture but they do tell you something. I've noticed him tracking back and helping out a lot in games directly as well.

1371~~~
I still don't get where people get this idea from.
As I see it the reason he actually gets any space in the central areas is because he drifts in from the right and the full-back can't follow him in to mark him.

From last season:

1374~~~
Ultimately I think that a player of his ability should be running the game - he should be at the centre of everything. And yes, for me this would mean him playing in the middle and not out wide. I'd prefer a quick wide man and Mata central. I'd even consider playing Wilson on the right and, yes, I'd be happy to bench Rooney to give Mata the chance to influence the match from what I think would be his best position.
I just feel like, in the right set up he could be more influential.

1375~~~
He's by fat our best option on the right, maybe he could be our best option at #10, but that does not make him better than Silva. I'm saying this as someone who wants Mata in the team every week.

1376~~~
I don't understand people who compare Mata and Silva, they play completely different roles, one is a creator, other is finisher. Mata is much more a forward than an midfielder, he is at his best in and around the box, Silva on the other hand is more midfielder than a forward.

And as much as I had doubts over him he is starting to convince me he is really good at what he does. His stats are very good and just a fact that he plays so much could tell you that LVG rate him highly too. There are not many wide forwards who score and assist as much as Mata does.

1377~~~
Yet this says not much as Depay has been stone average since he joined and Rooney not much better this season. The 10 has chopped and changed but I'm never going to say he's the best player in the team as he clearly isn't but he does possess massive qualities like touch and passing but where he plays its better to be good on one v ones and or have pace and Mata is lacking in these qualities. You'll see the difference when he's replaced in this position. He must be played as a ten to get the best out of him, playing where he is now kills virtually every attacking momentum up the right side.

1378~~~
No chance was Mata the third fastest player on the pitch. He was easily outpaced by van Aannholt coming into the box on 61 minutes. Luckily, De Gea was able to make the save.

1379~~~
Always thought he was an assist-machine at Chelsea but since joining us he seems to have become more of a goalscorer.

Not surprising then that he got 18 in 93 appearances for Chelsea and he's hit that for us already in 62.

1380~~~
Just because you "say" that doesn't mean you get to reposition the argument entirely to suit your skewed subjective view..it's like saying "<i>yeah you can prove we landed on the moon with facts and data and stuff, but you're talking to someone who doesn't believe there is a moon, so everything you say is void"</i>

It's not really our problem if you're determined to ignore things that don't back your opinions up. It's yours.

And that goes for a shit load of daft posts in here....like this absolute nonsense, backed up by absolutely nothing

1381~~~
I hope Mata never stumbles onto the Caf, some of the criticism he gets on here is mental.

I am beginning to judge some posters ability to analyse football performances on their opinion of Mata.

1382~~~
Football isn't an exact science though is it? Skewed subjective views (is there any other type of personal opinion? Isn't the entire point of an opinion that it is utterly dependent on the individual? How can that not be Skewed?) are part of football and part of the reason why you and I can discuss someone like Juan Mata. You have cold, hard reason - aka assists and goals on whoscored - and I have my uninformed and blinkered gut-reaction to his part in the full 90 minutes. 

And I'm not determined to ignore facts and figures, clearly Mata is an effective player and one who, over the course of a game, has a high chance of playing a part in or scoring a goal. Iirc this was the case even during Moyes reign but I was still slightly disappointed by him. Furthermore, even facts can be presented in a way that emphasises a subjective opinion - which is still skewed. Newspapers do this on a daily basis to promote their own specific agenda.

I mean, you could tell me that Mata has more touches in the opposition half than other United player but then again, if we're playing 2 dms, 2 kids and Wayne Rooney then I would expect that. Doesn't mean he's had a great game. 

Or you could tell me that he has the most assists. But who would be next in line, Daley Blind? A centre back? You could tell me that his pass completion is the best in the side (because of the bulk of his passes being short ones to Darmian or the nearest DM)  but maybe you'd omit successful through balls? So why would it be a problem for me to prefer what I see with my own eyes rather than a post-match figure presented by someone who already has their own opinion and may well be just as inflexible?

1383~~~
Those stats are amazing really. There's been an underlying theme throughout his United career has been that he's a shadow of his former, Chelsea self. Turns out that this shadow is considerably more prolific than the original!

Obviously, there's been a drop off in assists but he took every set-piece for Chelsea and only rarely takes corners or free-kicks from wide areas at United. Which will account for most of that discrepancy. 

This looks like another example of that typical bias you get in football when you watch your own team's players in every minute of every game all season but watch rival players in highlight reels only.

1384~~~
True.  I guess it's partly down to that one excprtionally productive season he had at Chelsea (12-13) - he's not matched that in terms of goals, but by his own standards that was a particular purple patch.

1385~~~
Never quite matched it but came bloody close last season, despite not taking the set-pieces referred to above. It's just funny that us United fans can watch him come within  3 goals and 1 assist of that uber-hyped season with Chelsea and still spend almost all of it slagging him off (and I'm including myself in this criticism!).

1386~~~
He's benefiting hugely from Martial so he gets more of a free role, brilliant little player.

1387~~~
Exactly.

1388~~~
His performances here and KdB's performances in Germany have sort of put down another Mourinho myth i.e he always knows when to sell players. Mata/KdB would currently walk in Chelsea's first XI.

1389~~~
Meanwhile our right hand side of the attack is non existent

1390~~~
No, it's not. If it was non-existent then we wouldn't be getting regular assists and goals from the player who's playing on the right hand side of the pitch. I get that Mata can sometimes have fairly quiet patches in a game, but to argue he's non-existent in his role is ridiculous.

1391~~~
And now, Mou would rather have them than his existing lot.

1392~~~
True enough, I hate the lazy argument that because a certain manager didn't see where a player fits into their team or a young players potential that this can then be used as a stick to beat the player with. It's an annoying brand of reductio ad absurdum that seems to pollute the forums.

1393~~~
I didn't even know that was a thing. For me he only knows how to buy players for immediate impact. Arsene Wenger is the one who should have a reputation for knowing when to sell.

1394~~~

1395~~~
I think Mata is re-writing job description for a winger. 
He has been superb so far.

1396~~~
I think mata's position is fine, he is not stuck on the wing he comes inside and gets involved in the play, interchanging, and with the ability and speed of matial and memphis, not to mention young is a pretty good impact sub he is enjoying his football. Most important part having mata, can assist and score goals, and we need mata especially now he has got the players around him to work his magic, this is probably the perfect team for mata at the minute

1397~~~
i also came across this which shows how vital Juan Mata is for us:

Since Juan Mata signed for Manchester United in January 2014, no other midfielder has scored more goals from open play. Yaya Toure and Eden Hazard are the only midfielders to score more goals in total, although almost a third of their goals have come from the penalty spot.

<b>Yaya Toure</b>
Goals: 20
Goals without pens: 14

<b>Eden Hazard</b>
Goals: 20
Goals without pens: 14

<b>Juan Mata</b>
Goals: 17
Goals <b>without</b> pens: 16

1398~~~
As proven by Valencia, it can be used very well if the full back is effective going forward. Valencia is much more willing than Darmian but unfortunately doesn't have the crossing ability. There is loads of space to be exploited on the right, it isn't always upto the winger to do so and Mata is clearly allowed to what he's good at, move infield and not waste time trying to do a Robben.

1399~~~
Disregarding their starting positions, wouldn't Matrial drifting out wide, with Mata cutting inside and Rooney pushing up keep our right side dangerous?

Anyways, about Mata, his stats are just astonishing. More than merits his place at the moment, imo.

1400~~~
Why isn't this thing showing number of assists? Surely that's the third most important stat on such a list?

1401~~~
Glad ppl are starting to see how effective he can be in the position van gaal has deployed him in. Sick of the "hes not a winger" "needs to play in the middle" "not effective outwide" brigade . Feck sake doesnt need to do step overs and run like usain bolt. he has his own style and is doing well where he's playing.

1402~~~
Our attacks from the right side are virtually non existent. Mata cuts inside and passes the ball back or square. His quality around the box is not in doubt but there is no way he is being utilised in his best position.

1403~~~
Apart from the fact that he's clearly done better for us from the right than in the centre?

1404~~~
Apart from when he, you know, assists or scores. Which he does quite regularly. I don't see what's wrong with him cutting inside/passing it to someone else as well if it's effective. I'd rather have that than Valencia constantly bombing down the wing but just booting it at the defender and ultimately creating nothing.

1405~~~
First off all its not effective we are so lop sided all our attacks come from the left. Secondly not suggesting we have Valencia doing that. Mata is effective in an around the box certainly not right wing, buy Mane for me and let Mata compete with Rooney for the 10.

1406~~~
Must have been all those goals and assists that tricked us all into believing it was effective. Silly us.

1407~~~
I'm beginning to think that in general is a problem. Once upon a time only ST holders got to see every minute of every game, and until very recently most analytical armchair fans only got to see a good dozen or so games on telly, and a weekly highlights package. Now everyone is watching everything, and analysing the shit out of it, to the point where build up play that doesn't result in something amazing (which is probably 70% of even most good matches) is picked apart and treated like a warning sign of the apocalypse. Mata's sideways passes in particular get treated like this regularly, as if all players of any merit should be hitting gymnastic defense splitting through balls with every other touch...


None of which is to say we've actually been great or anything, we are still a bit pedestrian but a lot of the moaning this season does seem to be about amazingly trivial shit, which I can't imagine would bother many 5-10 years ago.

1408~~~
18 league goals in 55 appearances since joining from Chelsea is pretty impressive, I can't find his assist numbers but I'd imagine they're not too shabby either.

1409~~~
You are aware we're top of the league? If we are lop sided and top of the league after 38 games .... happy days

1410~~~
Stats don't show how often counters and attacking moves come to a halt when the ball reaches him on the right. It's obliviously an improvement when Valencia is on but if we are to persist with Mata out there than we really could do with getting a more productive RB in to utilize the space he opens up.

1411~~~
sky sports news put up the stat he is the leading midfielder for goals/assists over last few years, above silva

1412~~~
Yes, it is. He's scoring and getting assists for us on a regular basis. I understand that he can occasionally have quiet spells, but he more than makes up for it with his contributions in most games.

1413~~~
I'm still not convinced despite his numbers. It's clear to see that at times the flank he's on is worthless to us in our build up play. He effectively is a deep lying striker playing on the wing, using his good movement to get on the end of things or be the penultimate touch.

That's the thing though. When he isn't the final or penultimate touch he tends to be nowhere at all.

1414~~~
We get just as much productivity out of the right wing as we do the left wing. The only difference is that Mata puts in less pointless crosses and doesn't dribble aimlessly to the touch line or hit the first defender. Instead he's more economical and recycles the ball quickly by passing it back to a CM or RB because he tends to read quicker than most whether anything useful might develop and he's less speculative. 

Doesn't make him any less productive, that's for sure.

1415~~~
Highlighting the shortcomings of a 21 year old new to the PL doesn't negate Mata's flaws though, Memphis needs to add consistency there's no question about that, however his stats are no worse than Mata's whose whole "defense" on here is built on his stats. I think we need to get more out of both flanks, Memphis maturing and Mata being paired with a fullback that can craft a chance would be the immediate route IMO.

1416~~~
Memphis' stats were largely boosted by the games against Club Brugge if I remember correctly, though, who were very poor opposition and a team we'd effectively already beaten after the first leg. Mata's not only been delivering this season in regards to goals and assists, but has mostly been doing so when he arrived. Not to mention that Memphis' stats <i>are </i>actually quite good, even if his overall performances have been mixed.

Mata does have quiet spells and could arguably be involved in more of the game at times, but I feel like some of the complaints are overly harsh: he's ultimately productive in front of goal for us, and has been one of our most useful assets in attack.

1417~~~
That's right, things were very different in 2010. United fans only ever complained about the Glazers, the Ronaldo money being spunked on nobodies, the failure to buy a central midfielder, Berbatov slowing the side down, Michael Owen wearing the no. 7 shirt, us failing to beat a side like Leeds at home in the cup, finishing 2nd in the league,  relying on Rooney to score all the goals... Hardly any moaning back then. Great days.

1418~~~
I wasn't even thinking of Memphis actually. I was thinking of Valencia and Young. 

As for Mata's stats:

Goals and assists are kinda important in football. 4 goals and 3 assists in 8 games is a great return. 

His 90% passing accuracy shows how little he gives the ball away. 

1.4 tackles per game is twice as many as the combative Rooney (0.7), much more than the "defensively aware" Young (0.4) and much more than Memphis (0.6). Also more than Carrick (1) and Herrera (0.8) (amongst others)

He makes more interceptions per game (1.3) than: Young, Shaw, Herrera, Valencia, Rooney, Fellaini and Memphis (amongst others) 

He plays more key passes than anyone else in our squad (2 per game). In second is Herrera with 1.3 followed by Rooney with 1.2 and Young with 0.8. 




So while he might not be a physical beast charging down the line, he's doing his fair share of everything while scoring and assisting more than anyone else.

1419~~~
This I can agree with. Now I can see how good Dani Alves would have been in this setup it really is a shame we couldn't land someone like him. I also admit to pining a bit for Rafael; maybe he would have done much better for LVG in this season's team than the shambling mess we were the first half of last season?

1420~~~
I know goals and assists are important, and him being better than the two average wingers we've been using for nearly half a decade is not in question, what I am saying is that his shortcomings also hurt the team and we could look to remedy that, some are acting like he's immune to criticism and a team never progresses like that. The problem too often on the Caf is you get "fanboys" vs "haters" which is pointless.

1421~~~
It's hard to weigh up exatly what the deal is with Rafael, other than Fergie he doesn't seem to have won over many managers, he's even been dropped already at Lyon I believe. Dani Alves certainly would have worked for us as Mata really needs a converted winger more so than a pure fullback like Darmian, I don't think it's any coincidence that the latter had his best attacking game paired with Memphis.

1422~~~
I've been guilty of convincing myself that Mata needs to play as a #10 but, his current role as the RW (which he really isn't) is perfect for him. Some people have called it a forgotten man role. Basically he is just free to go where ever he wants. This suits him very well versus the pure #10. In the #10 role he I think he has a more defined job and it does seem like he is easier to get defenders on him when he plays that position for us, reducing his effectiveness.

The one problem I see with him though is when he sticks to that RW and we are so focused on trying to create down the left, he goes "missing". He isn't out hugging the side to open up the the space but, he is not close enough to the play on the left to contribute. I think he needs to come looking for the game a bit more when this happens.

As for the argument that we don't create from the right. I think it's a valid point of view. Those statements are not that the person that plays on the RW is not contributing but, he himself is not directly creating a lot of opportunities or threatening situations from the right side. Not making killer passes or putting opposing fullbacks under pressure or getting into the box with the ball on that right side. That is completely true and it is also true that opposing teams know that when he gets the ball out wide right, he is going to look to come in or try and feed the fullback - making it easier to defend. Simply put, the types of plays that happen from the left side with Depay/Young is something we just don't get from Mata as a RW.

For what he is doing though, he is very effective, so we need to figure out how do we create from out wide right when Mata is on the pitch. For that to start happening perhaps once in a while Rooney / Mata need to switch even though Rooney is not a winger he can still do the job of one at times or even let players like Depay/Young come overload the right much like we've tended to do with Mata helping do the same on the left. That would help change things up and provide a different angle of attack for defenses to worry about.

1423~~~
Of course it's pointless to have fanbois and haters. Its worth noting though that I did a search for Mata through your posts and read back through them and you've been moaning about him for a long time....

Here's a few....

This made me laugh considering Mata timed a great run from wide to score a great counter attacking goal.

This seems to be a theme in your complaints about him. You do realise that he's not being asked to play as an actual winger and it's proving quite effective.




I'd say it's fair to say that you've been set in your opinion of him for a long while now and you're basing your complaints on these preconceptions rather than objectively based on his actual contributions this season.


He's not a conventional winger, maybe forget about your fast, tricky crossers and start appreciating him for what he does bring? It's purely an aesthetic thing imo, he's absolutely producing the goods this season.

1424~~~
He is very good there in the wing. For example, in the very first minute or so against Sunderland, he made a delicious dinked ball to Valencia which completely bamboozled van Aanholt. Valencia messed it up yes but his vision was spectacular. The pass to Memphis vs villa or Spurs I forget which was equally brilliant. He is our best creator and has played really well this season.

1425~~~
In isolation I like Mata on the right, but when I look at how to improve the team the #10 is the the priority and there is two options, bring a player that play on the right or bring a player that play in the middle, I like Pereira and Januzaj and think that they are both suited to that right inside forward role with Mata playing in the middle in a fluid front 4. I also think that if we wanted to had numbers and quality we should do it with the purchase of a wide player.

1426~~~
I have had a negative opinion of him for a while as I think he's a hindrance a lot of the time, I don't consider that a hater, simply sick of seeing moves stop dead when the ball reaches him and he has a one on one opportunity. 

I think you'll find I praised him after that game, but I realize you weren't looking for those posts. In fairness though it was hardly a stretch to say that overall Di Maria is a player more suited to the counter attack than Mata.

Yes I realize how he is playing the role, but how much more effective would be with a Robben or Reus out there? It's as if the flaws he brings to our attack are to be totally ignored.

He's done nothing to change my opinion, I have said more than once he has moments of contribution to the team, but I think that side is a definite area we can approve, I don't see what is outlandish about that.

I never said I wanted crosser, I want someone out there that can take on a fullback and drive at the goal, not a player that goes horizontal most of the time, I like to see wide players that can force the opposition back and make something happen on their own. Again I have acknowledged when he has had a decent game, but I don't see why we can't improve that position to one that is effective when things aren't precisely as that players limitations require.

1427~~~
Well, we would also be better if we had Ronaldo playing on the other side, but you can't just pick whoever. It would be more constructive choosing someone in his place from our current group of players.
Running at the defence is not the only way to force them back. Good passers (like Mata) can often force the opposition back merely by being in possession of the ball. Defences are coached to drop deeper when there's no pressure on the opposition player in possession.

1428~~~
You mention players like Reus and Robben but are they really attainable? How many traditional wingers are there in world football that contribute with goaos and assits like he has? We had di Maria and he did keep Mata out of the side for some time but Mata earned his way back in on merit. Think you're underappreciating his commitment and contribution. LVG has come up with a creative albeit imperfect solution but it's paying off.

1429~~~
shocking how some people will never be happy. Mata is an effective player, scores, assists, intercepts, passes well and doesn't give the ball away much. maybe they should support real or barca.

1430~~~
Behave yourself we have to support a different team as our opinion doesn't match yours?

1431~~~
He's not quite appreciated enough when you watch him on the telly.

When you go to the ground and watch him, you're left drooling over him at times, looks the best player on the pitch.

1432~~~
That you Fergie?

1433~~~
Can you imagine how pissed off people would be with Beckham?! "Oh sure he crosses the ball perfectly now and then and gets the assist, but he drifts inside far too much to have these 25 yard shots (and yeah they go in, but so what?) and because he's so often inside, he's killing our attacks!! And even when he's on the wing he never runs at his man or tries to beat them in a one on one... he's far too reliant on Gary Neville making these overlapping runs, because he never bloody dribbles for himself either... it's stifling our right wing!"

1434~~~
Very true, I blame the FIFA Generation. Requirements of a winger seem to be pace, pace and pace these days.

Mata really does offer us something great, he retains possession very well, has the ability to play a killer pass, pretty clinical finisher and he's unpredictable in the sense that he drifts everywhere and playmakes.

1435~~~
It's got nothing to do with fifa.  

Before the season started; i said mata would eventually struggle when some of our squad gets finalised.  Luckily for him; that still seems a while away. 

My biggest problem with him comes from something alot of people dont think about which is -  symmetry. 

You just dont have a winger like memphis on the left and a midfielder like mata on the right.  It allows the opposition defence to lean towards memphis side as the only player who can utilise width.  Even if valencia or darmian do enter the width's of the right side; the defence is already in the best position due to them having to be more central in the marking of mata. 

It not only makes memphis's job harder but also the fullbacks and the central attacking midfielder as the opposition defence leans towards the centre. 

You look at bayern & barcelona who still utilise some of van gaals basic tactics.  You have robben/ ribery & neymar/messi.  The similarities between each two of those wingers causes the opposition back 4 to be flat and more spaces start to appear as the left back in this case is kept wide as possible - leading to spaces inbetween CB's and fullbacks. 

All because you have a winger who utilises width.

1436~~~
Well fair play, at least you acknowledged that a player who scored both goals and a scissor kick wonder winner away at Anfield had a decent game. If that's not objective, I don't know what is.

1437~~~
This is just wrong. Regardless of how wide you're right winger is, if the ball is on the attacking sides left wing, your left back will <b>ALWAYS </b>be tucked in... regardless of who is out there. Defenders should really be no more then around 10 yards apart, at all times... this is just basic defending, it's got nothing to do with Mata, or Memphis. 

It doesn't make Memphis' job any harder, at all, he still has one full back to deal with. It's not like he has an extra defender coming across to him or something. Teams when they play against United will always keep their defence and midfield compact, regardless of how wide your wingers are. It literally wouldn't make any difference. The only thing you <b><i>could </i></b>say is that Mata drifting inside brings his full back with him, thus creating less space for Rooney/Martial - but a) this has no effect on Memphis and b) it just leaves <b>more </b>room for your full back to penetrate, which should - in theory - be a good thing. Also, if Mata is drifting inside to create and score goals, then that is literally the best way to break down teams who are trying to be compact and tight.

1438~~~
We've had this conversation before,  haven't we?   The lack of symmetry in my eyes makes it painfully obvious what mata is going to do.  It is however less obvious what memphis can do as he had the same ability to cross as he does to shoot. 

Mata though can only pass and though he scores goals; this is nornally down to finishing moves off rathen than really getting in to space by dribbling  himself.

1439~~~
Not that I'm aware, and even if we have, it still doesn't make sense. If defenders know what Mata's going to do, why don't they stop the passes he makes to create chances/goals? Or track his runs? And how does he constantly find space in the box if he's so predictable?

Also, as per the bold... what a weird, weird criticism. You basically want him to score the goal by doing all the work himself? Or not score goals but make chances for other people, who might not be as good as finishing as him so might not score?

1440~~~
When we were talking about potential RB signings in the summer I did wonder if a less defensively sound but more attack minded RB like Coleman might suit the side better with Mata playing as a false RW.

Obviously I'm delighted that Darmian has settled in well and he was certainly a bargain compared to all the other RBs we were linked with but even still I can't help but wonder how much better we'd look with a serious attacking threat from RB.

Of course if we had gone down that route we may well be complaining about a lack of defensive solidity on our right flank instead....

1441~~~
I have been critical of him, but he has been in good form these last couple of games. He can be found missing in some games, but suddently he pops up with a goal or assist.
The truth is that not many top class right wingers is around, looking, in premier league Mahrez is the only one who has been better so far.

3 goals and 3 assists from 7 games is very impressive, he looks to have gained some confidence from our last two games also, long may this form continue!

1442~~~
"Yeah he scores and assists more consistently than virtually any other player since he's joined..but he doesn't do it in the way I find most aesthetically pleasing. What we really need is a player who'll create the same amount of goals or less for other people in a way I prefer."

Repeat for 20 pages

1443~~~
Darmian is perfectly capable of being a serious attacking threat. You saw how he can turn it on at will when he waltzed straight past two defenders to cross against Sunderland with appearing to break a sweat. He's very two-footed, unusually for a fullback, and it makes the attacking that much easier. For Italy, it's really his attacking football that has won him the plaudits.

In our initial run of games, it looked pretty undeniable to me that both he and Shaw had been instructed to play conservatively. They noticeably chose not to go forward a number of times, both with the ball or looking for it. Shaw's game got more attacking more recently, perhaps as a result of it becoming clear that this season he's an unstoppable beast, and Van Gaal responding to that. But anyone who watched Darmian much before he came to us will be able to see that he's consciously focussing on his defending.

Which isn't a strategy you can really criticise - if he gets caught forward on the right, he's got one of the most defensively negligible 'wingers' in the league as his insurance. Basically, the opposition would be left with an unguarded flank to attack. Compare with, say, Shaw-Young on the left; Shaw could be reasonably confident that if he lost the ball in an advanced position, Young would bust a gut to get back and cover, and have the defensive ability to fill the gap.

This is why I'm always split on Mata. Even after good performances like against Sunderland, you can't deny that however good he is at the things he's good at, he will always be really bad at the things he's bad at, and other players have to take the slack. If you play someone else there, Darmian probably has a lot more licence to attack, and he's capable of being a team's most effective outlet (he often is for Italy these days, especially when he plays with Candreva). So you have to balance whether the loss of Mata is worth that gain.

For the record, I'm not saying we should drop him. You should never drop someone who's hitting hot form, even if in the long run you don't think they're the answer. But I'd want us to be willing to drop him quickly if he stops making such a big statistical contribution in attack.

1444~~~
There is no one, notice my line-up suggestions, I hardly ever don't select Mata as we did nothing in the summer to even provide competition for him on that flank, all our wide options like to play from the left.

I mentioned them as in the type of player we need out there IMO as opposed to thinking we could actually buy them, for instance someone like Costa that Bayern picked up would have been able to provide closer to what I was talking about, not a traditional winger.

I know you are being sarcastic but you took two separate sentences and applied them to one game.

I praised Mata for the Liverpool game;

Then I said I acknowledge when he has a decent game, which was pertaining to games like the performance on Saturday or the one against Newcastle.

It's a Catch 22, like Brightonian said you can see Darmian feeling free to attack on the left this weekend, but with Mata in front of him I think he felt he needed to hang back more, plus Mata often passed in field so I think as the games went on Darmian made less overlaps and just held his defensive position, where Memphis almost always looks for the LB link-up.

1445~~~
I think in those situations Mata is hanging out centre-right because he's waiting to make a run into the box if a pass comes in from the left. That's how he scores/assists a lot after all, by 'disappearing' and becoming forgotten and then making runs in that inside-right channel. If someone is going to push wide out right and stretch the defence in that scenario, it's going to have to be our right-back.

1446~~~
We could play like we did last year, with Herrera on the right midfield, Schweinsteiger on the left with Schneiderlin as pure DM. But in that case we can only play one of Rooney/Martial up top. I would like to see the latter on the left though, see if it works. Memphis so far hasn't won me over and the Cafe seems very reluctant to give Young some playing time there so it might be worth a try. 

Mata best position is definitely on the right, but far away from midfield.

1447~~~
Playing Mata the way we are clearly is a valid strategy for a top team even if it doesn't suit everybody's tastes. The problem I think is our lack of attacking threat from the overlapping RB. Valencia gets into good positions but is atrocious with creating anything and Darmian is not even getting into good positions at the moment (though could be because he is adjusting to the new league). Nice debate above on Mata though - love caf for this.

1448~~~
And again.

1449~~~
He's had his weetabix this morning. Playing very well.

1450~~~
Mata is playing really well.

1451~~~
So much better than Wayne Rooney it's not even funny. He's creating, moving, dancing, scoring and baby sitting Valencia. He's probably going to visit a museum in Manchester at half time too. 

God bless Juan.

1452~~~
Such a great player when he's on his game.

1453~~~
Superb 1st half. He is playing better and better lately.

1454~~~
Barely noticed him tbf. Does nothing when he's not scoring or assisting.

1455~~~
He's bordering his Chelsea level imo, absolute brilliant once again.

1456~~~
Man of the match so far

1457~~~
...Are you kidding?

1458~~~
Absolutely outstanding half. He's running the show tonight.

1459~~~
Yes.

1460~~~
Playing like a player of his talent should.

1461~~~
He's really stepped up these past few weeks. Showing his true talent, as he has it all.

1462~~~
Brilliant little baller, if we can get a RM and play him at 10, that would be awesome

1463~~~
Been sensational today so far

1464~~~
Been fantastic so far tonight

1465~~~
All his best stuff has either come from the right or coming in from the right, too. So.....just saying

1466~~~
Phew!!! Probably his best game in United shirt. He has been central to everything we have done tonight. Our best player (that's some feat considering Martial but still).

1467~~~
Thank christ. 

The state of this thread at times it can be hard to tell.

1468~~~
Blistering form.

1469~~~
Sweet christ

1470~~~
My God.

1471~~~
Who the feck does he think he is with that kind of Hollywood flick?

<span style="color: #ffffff">Lovable bastard.</span>

1472~~~
He's taken the piss there. Audacious.

1473~~~
yeah, but seriously, what does he do other than score or assist? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1474~~~
Where are all the folks I was arguing with last season who were saying that Mata isn't a creative player?

1475~~~
And people ask silly questions about his ability. Feck me! Best buy we've made in years.

1476~~~
Been fantastic so far, taking charge.

1477~~~
wow

1478~~~
Luxury player. Bench him.

1479~~~
I don't think I've ever seen him put in a better performance then he has today. Not even for Chelsea/Spain/Valencia. Unplayable on this form.

1480~~~
Absolutely filthy!

1481~~~
He's slow though.

1482~~~
I hope someone ruffles the shit out of his hair tonight.

1483~~~
defo his best game this season

1484~~~
He's phenominal at his best.

1485~~~
Too slow. What we need is moAr pace.

1486~~~
Fantastic yet again.

Ever since he stepped off that helicopter, I was waiting for the day he played for us at Old Trafford in the Champions League. Didn't disappoint. 

Best player on the pitch and that pass, just pure class, a pleasure to watch.

Hugs.

1487~~~
MOTM today he was class.

Even beat a Wolfsburg player for pace at one point.

1488~~~
Think he'll be a contender for player of the season come May.

1489~~~
Can we put the idea that he can't play on the wing to rest now? It's clearly not his best position granted but that's a long way removed from being "wasted on the wing", always has been.

1490~~~
Really is the little magician! 

Should be the first name on the team sheet out of our attackers along with Martial.

1491~~~
He's just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> if it wasn't for Mike he'd have been my MOTM.

1492~~~
Luxury player, no pace, no strength bla bla bla wonderful player! Fantastic tonight.

1493~~~
Majestic tonight.

1494~~~
Has someone made a gif of Mata's back heel assist yet? This guy does things other players dream of trying.

1495~~~
So impressed with him tonight. One of his best games in a Utd shirt.

1496~~~
Gave him MOTM tonight. Felt his overall performance was just ahead of Smalling's due to the latter's part in the goal conceded. Delightful showing again from the little Spanish magician.

1497~~~
A beautiful man

1498~~~
Luxury player.<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1499~~~
Played very well tonight would love him in at 10 instead of Rooney though

1500~~~
Was very good today created and scored and was dangerous

1501~~~
His best game for us. He was completely unplayable tonight. If he retains this sort of form, we could seriously be title contenders.

1502~~~
Pundits and interviewers asking about taking the penalty ahead of Rooney. If the idiots did their research, they'd know he's on penalties now.

1503~~~
As soon as he wasn't central to our play, we became shit. Which is presumably part of the reason why he's singled out by idiots when we're shit as a whole. He's crucial if we wanna play attractively. If we're pedestrian or hanging on, he's not going to dribble it out of defense ala Ronaldo, is he? But that's what we have Memphis for...potentially

1504~~~
If I hear anyone giving him any shit or banging on about how he can't play on the right, I may just lose it.

1505~~~
He was the only one to come out of the second half with any credit, besides Mike. Overall a very good performance.

1506~~~
Incredible throughout. He is getting better and better. I can't get over how good he is technique-wise. His 1st touch is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Probably our best outfield player at the moment.

1507~~~
hes on fecking fire

1508~~~
That pass... Great game.

1509~~~
Best player tonight. Superb.

1510~~~
I'm starting to think it is his best position. More time on the ball and more space to operate in. He's shown how much he can influence games from out there. 

Proved again today that he is probably our best outfield player.

1511~~~
In Juan we trust.

1512~~~
His best performance as an United player.

1513~~~
Forcing Van Gaal to take him seriously. Making himself indispensible.

1514~~~
First name on the (fantasy) team sheet, for me.

1515~~~
I really think Mata with a free role/am with Depay/Martial ahead and probably Young to give balance (ideally next season Januzaj) could bring so much. One below par game with extenuating circumstances against PSV shouldn't rule him out there. When there's movement ahead of him he finds it and he always manages to pop up at the right moments. Yeah he's proving he can impact from the right but how much more effective could he be with more freedom and an extra person providing runs, not to mention us with someone else providing width.

I think any doubt over his workrate as well surely is gone. He's not a Park or anything but he does more than his share, any weakness he has defensively is purely down to his speed/strength imp.

1516~~~
Beautiful footballer

1517~~~
I think Van Gaal has seen him as a key player and automatic starter since around February. It's just people on here who love hating on him

1518~~~
Can't believe some people on here question this guys ability, he is class.

1519~~~
He hasn't had much of a chance to play as a 10 for us, I still think his qualities are of better use there. Then again his crossing is also really good so you might be right.

1520~~~
He is a clear cut match winner Juan.

1521~~~
Forcing the caf more like. Van Gaal has seen him as a key player for quite a while now.

1522~~~
Ermm he's been virtually undroppable since the last seven months or so.

1523~~~
Wow the obnoxious levels have been turned up a notch tonight in here. Cracking game from Mata though, the assist for Smalling's goal had an air of Cantona about it.

1524~~~
Undroppable and not dropped. Van Gaal clearly has him down as one of our most important players. Excellent tonight. Classy player.

1525~~~
No one's being particularly obnoxious. Just mocking some of the increasingly ridiculous criticisms of Mata, who's continually showing himself to be one of our most valuable and most important players at the moment.

1526~~~
Went for smalling as my motm but could easily have been Mata

Although I'm not sure that's overly important

1527~~~
I had my doubts about him but he's really impressing me now. Such a wonderful footballer.

1528~~~
so why again did Jose sell Mata?

1529~~~
Bet Mourinho wouldn't mind De Bruyne and Mata right now

1530~~~
Him and Smalling won us the game. Think he was involved in every chance we got.

1531~~~
Obviously. But these are mere facts.

1532~~~
I wonder if any of our rivals are as dependent on one player for their goals/assists? Mata must have been involved in a huge percentage of all our goals this season, no?

Anyway, seriously classy little footballer.

1533~~~
His close control is absolutely brilliant, that flick to Smalling was orgasmic.

1534~~~
I don't think Mourinho particularly saw a place for Mata in his team: was only using him sparingly, and they had a number of attacking talents. I'd have kept him personally if I was in Mourinho's position, although I assume that the money we spent was probably enough to tempt Mourinho considering he didn't particularly see Mata as part of his plans.

1535~~~
Eh? He's started every game since about March. It's the Caf that doesn't rate him.

1536~~~
A central midfield pairing of Mata and Schweinsteger is almost as good as it gets. They complement each other as well as Scholes and Keane.

1537~~~
Martial and Memphis' pace shouldn't be underestimated either. Last year we only had an inconsistent Di Maria to provide that, Mata thrives on quick forwards creating space and making runs.

1538~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you do realise Mata has never played a single game in a central midfield pairing?

1539~~~
I'm not convinced that beautiful flicked assist to Smalling was intentional, but I don't care <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1540~~~
How are we dependent? Martial has 4 goals, Rooney has 5, memphis has 4 goals and 4 assists... If anything our goals are nicely spread around the front 4.

1541~~~
think this is right. But Mata is a much stronger player now. van Gaal has obviously worked on him.

His close control, speed and holding on to the ball when tackled is all much better.

Also his shooting at every opportunity.

1542~~~
My MOTM<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Deserves it imo even though Big Mike came close.

1543~~~
Beautiful Spanish bastard! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1544~~~
Nah they don't have a patch on the De Gea-Fellaini midfield duo of last season.

1545~~~
I don't know if he's any better than he was at Chelsea, as such. His 2012/2013 season was superb and he was one of the best players in the league at that time. I think he's just managing to find that level on a consistent basis again, and is having a very productive season so far. I was actually quite critical of him during the first half of last season, despite being a fan of him as a player, but I think he's been very good this season. Lovely player to watch when on form.

1546~~~
He spends most of his time in the middle.

1547~~~
Technically such a brilliant player, he's really grown as a player here and has changed my mind about him too, long may it continue.

1548~~~
See he played right inverted winger again, it works. In ideal (normal?) world we would bring Herrera for Rooney and play Mata high, almost like a second striker.

1549~~~
Love that he makes those beautiful crosses/passes in recent games. Today to that header to Memphis <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> The flick was beautiful too. He has cemented a starting spot for the rest of the season if he can keep it up. Fantastic performances the last few games.

1550~~~
He's slow and sometimes looks weak, but his work rate is pretty good. He does more than Memphis defensively.

1551~~~
I'm certainly one of Matas biggest critics on here but he was very good tonight.

His talent & natural ability has never been doubted, but he needs to show it more consistently IMO.

1552~~~
You can't be serious

1553~~~
Look at where Mata's creating most of his chances. It's in the traditional attacking midfielder positions.

1554~~~
Excellent tonight. His touch, spacial awareness and vision was superb. Having more attacking fullbacks has helped give him loads of room inside.

Jose knew nothing. He tackles more than most attacking players in this side and tracks back just fine.

He'd be even better with a number ten in form.

1555~~~
So does Martial.

1556~~~
Mata is our most active player in the areas Scholes used to excel in and Schweinsteiger is our most active player where Keane used to dominate. When they are both performing it's like we have found a way to fit Keane-Scholes into a modern midfield.

1557~~~
great player

1558~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> A new one. Boss approves of this post.

1559~~~
Maybe dependent was the wrong word (though maybe not). It just strikes me that Mata has been involved in an usually high amount of our goals this season. Off the top of my head I can't think of any of our rivals' players who have been involved in such a high proportion of their goals? Which makes me wonder how well we'd fair if Mata was to get injured for a spell. I have a nasty suspicion we'd look very short of creativity as we seem to be relying on his productivity quite a bit, particularly in the PL....

1560~~~
He needs space. Most PL teams that come to OT sit in and that is when he looks poor. WF came to play and we should have crushed them in the first half.

1561~~~
Yes, he does his best work when he drifts into the attacking midfielder position, but you can't call him a part of a centre midfield pairing because of that. Not if you want to be discussing football using the agreed upon meaning of words.

1562~~~
Schweinsteiger doesn't have Keane's mobility and Mata doesn't have Scholes range of passing. They work fine as they are right now. They both need another CM in the team to do the water-carrying. Schneiderlin didn't have a good game tonight but take him out and we'd have been completely overrun for 90 minutes.

1563~~~
I'm having real difficulty deciding between him and Smalling for man of the match. He was class tonight, very unlucky with the shot that was blocked, it was a nailed on goal until then. He has become more of a team player for us which has previously been missing.

1564~~~
That cantonaesque flick was simple amazing. Needs a biiiiiiiiiiiig hug for that <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1565~~~

1566~~~
98% accuracy is pretty insane given you'd hardly call that a cautious performance from him.

1567~~~

1568~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/akff" width="560"></iframe>

1569~~~
They're some ridiculous numbers...

And I bet one of those incompleted passes was the cross for the penalty!

1570~~~
The intelligence for the first goal. Didn't have a clear sight in goal, so draws in a defender, plays it against his arm to get a free shot from the penalty spot. Can't buy that. Should get an assist for that goal too.

1571~~~
I was just thinking that watching the highlight show.

1572~~~
His best performance for us to date? Dare I say, that was Silva-esque.

He was running the show.

1573~~~
Not according to the boss.

1574~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Van Gaal makes my head hurt.

1575~~~
I think he's played his best football in the last 2 games.....

delighted to see him dictating games.....hard not to think he'd be even better in a free role behind Martial with more movement around him

1576~~~
He doesn't really though. Almost all of his best work tonight came from either an inside right position, or drifting into the box from the right hand side. The pen, and his great goalbound effort cleared by Dante early on being good examples.

He basically ran the show against a good European side for a good hour, largely from a right sided starting position. The fact he drifted in a lot isn't the same thing as "playing in the middle' and I'm pretty sure his heat map would back this up (though I"m happy to be disproved)... He swapped with Martial a few times to good effect, but if anything it took our only CF out of the box, and thus reduced our threat. Especially since Rooney was doing his usual shift as a LB-come-DM-come-Roaming Warrior.

1577~~~
He's brilliant. Thats all.

1578~~~
forbidden fruit we are not allowed to think of

1579~~~
What? LvG sees the game very different from us fans <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1580~~~
It's a joy to see him back to his Chelsea days.  Yes I said it. Let's face it he hasn't been as good for us as he was for Chelsea but he is starting to show in a consistent manner that he is very clever with the ball.

1581~~~
Hilarious. When Mata was having an occasional off day, it was too funny the way people were crucifying him and actually questioning his ability. 
Let nobody try that bs again.

1582~~~
He's consistently refused to praise or blame individuals. What he meant is probably he's seen Mata play even better (Liverpool) yet didn't praise him in those occasions either.

1583~~~
Yeah i know, but he should have stopped at the "i don't talk about individuals". Not anything to make drama about though.

1584~~~
I think he's been one of our best players so far this season, long may it continue. Going forward I hope he's a player that Van Gaal considers key for us

1585~~~
That was arguably as good as I've ever seen him, even for Chelsea. Was unplayable until the last 20 when he couldn't get on the ball and we lost all control. Brilliant from him.

1586~~~
Definitely found his Chelsea form.

1587~~~
That fecking flick.  Happy to be proven wrong about Juan.

1588~~~
It does worry me that a player that has produced regularly since joining us, a player with great ability and end product, might not actually be that safe in the lineup under LVG.

1589~~~
What makes you think he isn't safe in the lineup? He's started every game so far, I can't really think of a period in his United career where he's been benched apart from just before his home goal against Palace last season.

1590~~~
Just a general feeling of mistrust when it comes to LVG. He might not like him cause he's not tall enough, quick enough, not positionally disciplined enough, etc.

1591~~~
If Rooney would make any runs forward I think Mata would be even more effective.  Either way he's been tremendous this season and has demonstrated a knack for pitching in with an assist or a goal in what seems like every game.

1592~~~
I hold Mata in such high regard that nothing he pulls off surprises me. Our little magician <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1593~~~
Disappointed I missed the match considering it sounds like Mata played so well. I was a critic of his last season but I think that was unfair. He's probably been our best player this season. Or equal with Smalling anyway. That assist was just magical!

1594~~~
LVG's reaction was a little weird in the post match presser...

1595~~~
I agree, it was mindfeck, but then again Mata seems to be the first name on the teamsheet for LvG and that speaks volumes.

1596~~~
I'm pretty sure he's one of the first names he puts on the team sheet.

1597~~~
Magical performance that was, though. He'll still be hated by a section of our rather simple fans. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1598~~~
Terrible when fans like their own players, isn't it?

1599~~~
No, but that has nothing to do with what I said.

1600~~~
Sort of does though, doesn't it?

1601~~~
No, praising a player and being obnoxiously dismissive of previously deserved criticism made by others is not the same thing.

1602~~~
What you think was previously deserved criticism might be seen as ridiculous & "obnoxious" criticism by others. So it really works both ways.

1603~~~
That would imply that he's never had a run of bad games for us, which would be as incorrect as suggesting he'd never had a run o good games. The thing I see is too many have players that they have such a thing for they can't just say if they had a bad game and vice versa for players they don't like. Plus you can criticize or praise without being obnoxious.

1604~~~
Not fast enough. Sell him and buy Zaha back.

1605~~~
Ouch.

1606~~~
Eh, right.

1607~~~
Thanks you idiot Moyes for bringing us the gifts that Mattah. Sublime footballer and did the business tonight, as he has been doing for a long time now. I am sure LVG is grateful to his predecessor, even if he sometimes seems grudging in his praise of the Inherited Juan.

1608~~~
He is soooo stagnant. Memphis form is suffering because of Mata.
<span style="color: #ffffff">And all such arguments have been back flicked by Mata yesterday</span>

1609~~~
I can hear them on George Best after the Benfica game. Took his chances well but ... (moan moan moan)
So you noticed too?

1610~~~
He has the touch of an angel! 

Quite possibly the only good thing Moyes ever did in his life.... Ever.

1611~~~
A lot of funny guys in this thread, but the reality is he has his flaws. However, if he plays like today- on the right, combining with fullback, pushing the defender inside with a little bit of dribbling- he’s just very very good.

I’m not a fan of him roaming around and leaving the right side “empty”, but today I thought he was excellent. I hope we switch back to 4-3-3 and play Herrera on the right behind him, it’ll be even better.

1612~~~
As I said earlier in the thread, Beckham used to do this all the time (not quite to the same extent as Mata, but still) - and people regard him as one of the best wingers the club has ever had.

Mata always begins on the right (granted, he seemed to actually stay out on the right a lot more yesterday - though he still drifted) and then drifts in as play develops, it's what makes him so dangerous and what gets him goals and assists... I'm not sure why anyone would want him to stop doing it, bar personal preference of how they like a winger to play.... but ultimately, him doing it is clearly not harming the team (despite what some people say).

1613~~~
And Silva himself was awful yesterday. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/> He deserves some slack cut due to the fact he's just come back from an injury, but still.

1614~~~
Modern footballers. They tend to roam to find space for themselves or create space for others. If we had a right full back who could make use of that space then we'd be golden. Noticed that Martial drifted right a lot last night in the space vacated by Mata. Led to some good moment for him too.

Anyone noticed that Darmian as played a lot more freely down the left, getting to the byline more and being less conservative with his passing/crossing. Didn't really do that on the right in the games he's played there.

1615~~~
He's always going to roam about as he's more of a playmaker operating from the right than a winger. That's how Van Gaal wants him to play too otherwise he'd be on the bench.

1616~~~
Anyway, can we talk about that back flick a bit more? 'cos that was properly outrageous. To do that with a bouncing, spinning ball, and weight it perfectly so that it a) goes over everyone and b) plays into a really dangerous area of the box... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1617~~~
Nothing he does ever surprises me anymore. His spatial awareness and judgment of the ball are perfect. Just as the way he killed the ball dead against Sunderland, but even more outrageous.

1618~~~
Great to see him (attempt to)shut the doubters up week after week.

His first touch is just sublime, kills it stone dead.

1619~~~
I'm excited by him, if the team don't play well then he suffers because he will receive the ball deeper and doesn't have the qualities needed to beat his man with pace. But when the team play well (and he helps us do this by recycling possession) it means he can receive the ball in the box where he is deadly.

So far he has a goal or assist per game.

I expect United to only improve as the season goes on, in 2012 / 13 at Chelsea he had in the league, champions league and europa cup 41 starts and 8 sub appearances getting a combined 36 goals and assists.

In the league for Chelsea that season he got 12 goals in 31 starts and 4 sub appearances, I can see him getting 15 league goals this season if he stays fit.

Martial has shown what he can do, and we know Depay has goals in him, he just needs to find his form.

1620~~~
Glad that someone brought up the Sunderland goal because you need great skill to kill the ball , if you see the Rooney chance last night he had a lot of time to take a touch but with his first touch he would have lost the chance anyway

1621~~~
Pierre van Hooijdonk said on Dutch tv that the praise for that backflick was too much, it wasn't anything special, that any footballer would do that and it was mostly luck <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> A lot of things that happen on the football pitch require a bit of luck but he must have a tough life if he can't even appreciate that back flick. I certainly enjoyed it as did most people who saw it, I'm sure! Things like these are what you watch football for in my opinion. Just these little moments of magic.

1622~~~
The Legend....has arrived <a class="username" data-user="33902, @)_(" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/33902/">@)_(</a>

Incredibly influential.

1624~~~
And some posters were questioning his role in the team. Ridiculous, really.

1625~~~
He was pretty ineffective in the first few games to be fair (so were a lot of other attacking players actually). I think that since the Liverpool game he really started to shine, coincidentally that was when Martial made his debut.

1626~~~
If we bring in one or two better quality players, we'll see Juan continue to be influential and I would trust him far more then say a Di Maria. Pleased for him.

1627~~~
Mata has said himself that Martial has been a big help to our attacking game, not only when he gets on the ball, but off the ball too. He's exactly the type of striker that compliments him and it's great to see.

1628~~~
Was it me or did he look much quicker last night? I don't know why but he was actually dribbling passed players, I couldn't believe it!. He's been in great form recently, just coming into the tough fixtures is perfect timing.

1629~~~
He's been insanely productive so far this season.

Someone posted some stats a while back showing that since he's joined United his goals/game is already better than it was at Chelsea but his assists/game wasn't quite as good. At this rate he''ll score more goals and get more assists than he did even at his very best in a Chelsea shirt.

EDIT: Feck it, I'll do the math (PL & CL games combined)...

2011/12 Chelsea: 40 games @ 0.4 assists/game and 0.2 goals/game
2012/13 Chelsea: 36 games @ 0.42 assists/game and 0.36 goals/game
2013/14 Let's ignore this one, as he spent half a season at each club
2014/15 United: 27 games @ 0.15 assists/game and 0.33 goals/game
2015/16 United: 9 games @ 0.44 assists/game and 0.44 goals/game

1630~~~
Just have to hope he continues the way he's started this season as those numbers are insane so far. It's probably helped Rooney as well, that Mata has picked up much of the creative burden.

He's scored or assisted 45% of all of our goals so far this season according to that Andy Mitten tweet.

He's previously been criticised quite a bit on here for doing little to influence the game then popping up with a goal but I think his performances are much more aligned with his stats now.

1631~~~
Martial up top brings the best out of him, imo. Mata's passing tempo becomes less of an issue when there's a pacey targetman occupying defenders and offering a secure out-ball at all times.

1632~~~
give over already. Mata is one of our most effective players, and coming in from wide seems to suit our system, unless you know better. He is doing the business yet you'd like him to play somewhere else?<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1633~~~
Having Martial up front helps him, but he was our best attacking player in first 3 or 4 games too so it's not really fair on him to say that he is good just since Martial arrived because he is excellent since start of the season.

1634~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYKxORWN01A?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1635~~~
Always said that once we get more pace in the side around him, we'll see the best of him. How could he pick out passes and show his creativity if nobody is making runs like the last couple of seasons? Now we finally have pace and players like Memphis and Martial making runs and it's made a world of difference to Mata. Looking every bit the world class player he was at Chelsea. Has been class this season, apart from that one game against PSV where he just had an off day with his touch. He's showing his creativity and quality in every game though which is the main thing and it's no surprise that he's pretty much running our games these days.

1636~~~
Just watched LvG's post match presser, I don't get his comments about Mata, I guess the players understand his nature but I can't see why he is so reluctant to offer praise.

1637~~~
All the armchair pundits who were critical of the little genius have gone eerily quiet, luxury player but in the right system, with the right manager and when on form he is sublime.

Easily my fav player at United at the the mo, that backheel last night was fecking outrageous, born to grace the theatre of dreams.

1638~~~
Mata is probably the only good thing we took from the Moyes reign.

1639~~~
Well I've been slightly critical of him on here, largely because I don't think that he's playing in his best position and I'd like to see a quicker, more direct forward at RW. 

That said, he was excellent last night and is enjoying the best form of his United career right now. He is a very effective player. I still don't think that this is his best position but he's adapted brilliantly and is intelligent enough to have made it work for him.

1640~~~
I still believe there are occasions when our lack of width on the right may end up costing us games but Mata needs to be starting and if that is the only place we can fit him in then so be it.

Thought he actually offered more from wide, in the final third, last night than he usually does and he was definitely the main driving force to get us back in to the game. Martial playing has also seemingly helped Mata become more threatening. When Memphis fully hits his stride we will have a really impressive forward line, even with the albatross at #10.

1641~~~
I think the front three work well together to be honest. If Mata comes inside we see martial peel right and Rooney steps up to the CBs. If we need a different approach there is always Ashley Young that can come on.

1642~~~
He'll probably drop him for 10 games after this.

1643~~~
Yeah you can see the progress that they are making in the carousel forward line and it is nice to see such free form movement, it will only improve further as each players understanding of one-another does. Just imagine its effectiveness with four in-form players lining up there, its barely operating at 50% at the moment IMO.

1644~~~
why is it that people here still say that they expect Mata to do the job of a winger, when clearly he is not a winger, and I don't think LVG is expecting him to play as a winger. Just because he starts out wide, doesn't mean he is a winger. Could he just not be a wide forward or something or do people still prefer a winger to run on the byline and whip in crosses all day long?

1645~~~
I didn't refer to Mata as a winger, nor that he should be doing that job. I simply referred to the teams ("our") lack of width on the right. I think it would be hard to argue that point given the performances this season which have seen minimal activity on the right whilst in the final third. I believe this does limit our options somewhat and that certain teams may be able to turn this to their advantage and the selection of Mata on the right does indeed contribute to this.

Width doesn't necessarily equate to the "byline" and "crosses" either. Memphis provides pretty good width but isn't the stereotypical winger you outline, in-fact he could be considered a wide forward. Imagine that, a <b>wide</b> forward providing <b>width</b>.

I'd personally have Rooney drifting towards that space, if we assume the same set-up, because my issue is with the general lack of width on the right and not a fixation on who should or shouldn't be providing it.

1646~~~
Yeah, sure he will. Actions speak louder than words and Van Gaal evidently rates Mata very highly indeed. Hence he's played him for almost every minute of every game this season. Including the game against PSV when 90% of the caf wanted him subbed off instead of Hererra.

On a side note, I've just realised how incredibly uncomfortable Mata's form this season must be making life for Jose in Chelsea. Which adds a delicious subtext to those amazing goals/assists statistics. Lovely stuff.

1647~~~
You do realise there's loads of examples of very successful teams with wide forwards that don't provide any width at all?

1648~~~
Yeah I was kidding. Van Gaal likes him a lot.

1649~~~
I was being somewhat flippant and in that spirit surely a wide forward providing no "width at all" would merely be a centre forward or an uber-hipster "false wide forward". 
I do agree that some may only provide limited width which I assume is what you were getting at.

1650~~~
He's reminding me of how Iniesta played the same role around 2010 but Juan has a bit more end product to his game. 
I couldn't give him a higher compliment, he just needs to make these performances routine

1651~~~
Yeah, pretty much. Wide forward really just describes someone whose starting position is anything other than central. They don't have to provide width, though. A decent attacking full-back will do that. I'd like to see us start the next game the way we finished the last, with Young at RB. He made a difference when he came on and played a big part in our second goal.

1652~~~
De Bruyne and Lukaku (although I don't rate him too highly) are performing too. Mourinho knows best. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1653~~~
Can only imagine Jamie Redknapp's face watching him at work last night. No bigger 'Wan Mata' fan in the world probably.

The little man really was special. It really does infuriate me that if we had a performing #10, our attack really could be frightenigly good. The front 4 is playing with a -1 handicap, and still outgunning teams. Yesterday was the first game in four that we didn't get 3 goals, and we easily should have. The front line is clicking.

1654~~~
So we do have something to thank David Moyes for.  <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1655~~~
I agree, and i hope that LVG has the balls to drop Rooney if he continues with this form. Januzaij could have done a better job in that role compared to Rooney as he offers absolutely nothing.

1656~~~
Sorry lads. Juan Mata is out for the City match. Me and Juan are having a romantic dinner that evening.

1657~~~
What a man, share a special dinner? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1658~~~
I am going to be so jealous of the winner. A date with Mata!

1659~~~
I'd divorce my husband after that dinner.

1660~~~
Seriously, is he doing media work/promo for the whole fecking club? Might as well change the name to <b>Juanchester United <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/></b>

1662~~~
That's pretty impressive repetition.

1663~~~
A date with Juan <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1664~~~
You'll also have to fight Herrera off!

1665~~~
He's very quick off the first few yards, these bursts of speed are what avail him to get in great positions to score his goals, but he struggles when it becomes a race.

1666~~~
Why hasn't guy's thread been bumped? He's been crap.

1667~~~
Because there's about 8 other players that have been worse.

1668~~~
Is that why every other player playing has had his thread bumped? He's hardly been better than the rest of the useless lot.

1669~~~
Because (unlike some our other players) he's otherwise been very good this season.

1670~~~
He's the caf favorite and is our Silva.

Tbf he's not the type of player that can make a difference in these matches with high pace and intensity.

1671~~~
He's been completely invisible.

1672~~~
As opposed to the others.

1673~~~
Totally agree. He always gets an easy ride from many. He's done well the last couple of games. Excellent assist midweek, but he was crap today and doesn't get his thread bumped.

1674~~~
Didn't play well today, but neither did the entire team (minus Martial I guess).

1675~~~
He's still provided more than Rooney throughout the season.  And LVG's line-up today was bizarre imo, especially putting Ashley Young at left-back

1676~~~
Wasn't the type of game that suits him, with no threat on the overlap he didn't have the space to work in and can't go past players so it was mostly sideways safely.

1677~~~
He wasn't crap.

He did nothing of note, but at least he didn't make any mistakes like pretty much any of our other player on the pitch did. He was decent with the ball, and actually in few minutes before he was subbed he was one of our best players. It would make more sense to haul him off at HT than at that point.

1678~~~
Didn't do much because there wasn't much he could do.

1679~~~
He doesn't seem to be a player who steps up if we're shit. He's doing well if everything is in full flow

1680~~~
He had absolutely no one who made any sensible runs into the box. Our off the ball movement is atrocious.

1681~~~
Couldn't do anything. He is not Messi, nobody was moving and nobody was making runs or making themselves available for the pass.

1682~~~
Wasn't good today, but it's difficult with such poor players around.

1683~~~
Always someone else's fault. First we needed a pacey striker who runs in behind. We have Martial now, who actually played well. Mata was poor. Shame because he's been good recently.

1684~~~
Yeah I thought he was a bit crap along with everyone else. No speed to his play and his passing was way sloppier then it usually is.

1685~~~
Martial was tightly marked for a reason. Nobody offered any movement whatsoever.

1686~~~
Striker in being marked shocker. Mata was poor, stop blaming others for him being poor.

1687~~~
It's funny to say that after Mata led our comeback against Wolfsburg just during this week...

1688~~~
Explain to me what he was supposed to do when nobody would make runs or nobody would give him the ball back when he made runs?

1689~~~
Exactly.  And he's not a winger - he should be played where he's most effective.

I'd drop Rooney tbh, and play Mata behind Martial.

1690~~~
And then who out wide? Depay hasn't been up to much as it is. Leaves us with Young and Valencia, who I think are average. Unless we bring out one of the younger lads in.

1691~~~
Well if Mata is so awful, he obviously shouldn't be wide...

Ashley Young on the left and try Depay on the right?  I wouldn't say Young is average - he was very good last season, and hasn't had much chance to shine this year, but he hasn't done badly. Apart from today which is hardly his fault.

1692~~~
I've been happy with Mata wide. If we are to drop Rooney, I'd prefer us to move to a 433 have Mata on the right and plus Depay/Young on the left. 

On Young, I thought he was very good for his standards, but still average from the perspective of where we should be aiming.

1693~~~
i think Mata can do a job wide, but would be more effective behind the striker.

1694~~~
even though thats not been the case ever in his United career?

1695~~~
Yes.  I think he'd shine.

1696~~~
He isn't going to win a game for you on his own, he's a multiplyer much like Fabregas who is getting similar flack at the moment, when the team is playing well and they'll enhance everything going forward, if the team isn't proving good movement and moving the ball quickly they'll be ineffective.  We hit a purple patch and he'll bag goals and assists.

1697~~~
It's a team game. He can't do it alone.  

In my humble, we wouldn't be as high as we are if it wasn't for Mata.  Or at least, he's one of the few who have produced so far this season.

1698~~~
We didn't play bad against Wolfsburg, the team was on top. Different scenario to yesterday

1699~~~
Once again Mata getting a free ride on here. He did nothing just like the rest, yet others are to blame for it? You could say that about every player then. However, he's not helped by being put on the wing.

1700~~~
I recently saw a packet of cigarettes which said "Fumer Mata" on the side. Which I'm going to hazard a guess stands for "Smoking Kills"

With that in mind, do with have a midfield maestro playing for us who's name translates roughly to John Kills

If so, that's a damn cool name.

1701~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1702~~~
At least you've got your priotities straight. Being a football fan is all about equal opportunity player bashing.

1703~~~
I've no idea what you're on about? It's quite clear he gets a free ride here. What other players get the excuses of it's the other players to blame as to why he was poor? I'm not a Mata fan really, I'll admit, but I'm not biased. When Mata plays well then I'll praise him. His assist against Wolfsburg for example was majestic. As I've also said before he isn't helped by being put out on the wing.

Edit: I should add that I wouldn't of posted a third message regarding his performance on Sunday if there hadn't of been the excuse of blaming others. My intention wasn't to freely bash him.

1704~~~

Isnt he just lovely.

1705~~~
Isnt he Juan derful

1706~~~
Tell Dave that, mate. Hugs.

1707~~~
Feels like he only just arrived. I just melted.

1708~~~
He got the armband for Spain tonight when he replaced Fabregas, what was interesting though was that instead of replacing Fabregas as the AM, Isco moved into that role and Mata went out to the RWF position where he plays for us. 
I think despite the many calls for him to play centrally his managers think he benefits from having more time on the ball with the floating wide role as he's not storage enough to protect the ball under pressure centrally.

1709~~~
I love him.

1710~~~
mata himself said he doesn't mind where he is played as long as he is given the freedomto run channels.

That's why I think mata won't play no.10, LVG's no.10 has a fair amount of positional responsibility and mata loves to rome, that is when he is at his bets.

1711~~~
^Although I don't know where Mata plays when he does for Spain, I'm not sure about that argument of Del Bosque playing him there because that's where he prefers. I believe it's a simple thing of just having seen him play there for Utd and think 'that's fine, I'll play him there too'. I know it sounds silly but we've seen many cases of it before. Gerrard and Carragher being played all over midfield and in defence by Liverpool and subsequent England managers doing the same. Rooney being played in midfield by Fergie (despite being largely average) and then other managers think he can do the same job. Welbeck on the left wing for us, same for England etc etc. Some player hits form for a couple of weeks and suddenly they're in the national squad.

1712~~~
Decent half for him but far from perfect. He was good in possession and attack and pretty bad in defense. Nothing new. Good that he's getting a bit of a break. Been the first name on the team sheet for a while now.

1713~~~
Injured? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1714~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1715~~~
Wasnt really playing well, not surprised he took him off.

1716~~~
Hope LVG wanted to give him a rest and he's not injured.

1717~~~
He wasn't that bad for him to be taken off at HT! Hope it's a tactical decision and not an injury.

1718~~~
Thought he was good while he was on the pitch. His passing, movement and awareness are top class. Seems to be a marmite player, but I love him.

1719~~~
I thought he had a good half too personally. Hopefully not injured.

1720~~~
I was surprised to see him come off at half time, he hadn't been great but not bad either.

1721~~~
Apparently van gaal said it was just tactical. Thought he was playing well, could just be to keep him fit for the next 2 and give us added pace as we played on the break in that second half which makes sense.

1722~~~
I think he wasn't doing a good job on Galloway. And with a 2 goal lead, he wasn't worth the risk.

1723~~~
I think it was proven to be the right call, taking him off, because we needed what Lingard offered - better protection for Darmian and the ability to stretch the pitch bringing counter attacks into play. I love Mata but, like Blind, there are games and circumstances that do not suit him.

1724~~~
Louis confirms it was a tactical change btw lads. No injury.

1725~~~
Not surprising he came off. Was playing well, but we were 2-0 up and looked comfortable.

1726~~~
Didn't see the game but glad he wasn't taken off because he was having a stinker. Lingard a good direct player to have on the counter. Mata is good, but he doesn't have certain qualities

1727~~~
Chased back after Galloway and got brushed off like a little kid against his big brother and I think that sealed him coming off.

He's just not built properly.

1728~~~
Not really. He's just been fan voted as United's player of the month, ahead of everyone's new darling Martial - who even won the PL's award. He's hugely popular. His detractors just post and argue more. Tis the way of the Internet. Wayne Rooney sold more shirts than Neymar this year, yet if you glanced in his Caf thread, you'd think he was widely reviled by his own fans.

I agree there are games he's less suited to though. This is why we have a squad.

1729~~~
An off game. Considering his performances lately, he is allowed to have one bad game. Will be back at his best soon

1730~~~
Van Gaal seems to be ruthless when he notices a defensive lapse.. especially out wide. He's taken off Darmian and Valencia for making mistakes

1731~~~
Struggled a bit in defense but overall, did a fine job. Not a great game but that happens. Hopefully not injured, many big games coming up so hopefully just a rest with the comfortable lead.

1732~~~
Don't think there was anything wrong with his game, just a sub that you can make because you're 2-0 up and play in Europe midweek. Expect him to start against CSKA.

1733~~~
Pretty much this. And even if LVG was not happy with his performance, I have no problem if he then substitutes those players. I just wish he would do it consistently with all players

1734~~~
Juan has always been up and down for us really, but I get the feeling we are at a point where people aren't over reacting to his down moments.

1735~~~
I think LVG realised we would be counter attacking mainly, so wanted more pace on the wing. Nothing wrong with that at all. Let's be honest Matas strengths are running or defending.

1736~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11937882/Man-Utd-news-Juan-Mata-hits-back-at-Jose-Mourinho-over-his-Chelsea-axe.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ck-at-Jose-Mourinho-over-his-Chelsea-axe.html</a>

Mata having a bit of a dig at José... Which is pretty endearing...

1737~~~
Good. Mourinho selling him really damaged Mata's reputation as so many people suddenly became convinced that something *had* to be wrong with him. No harm in Mata now pointing out that those exotic luxuries "goals" and "assists" are actually pretty useful when you need to win football matches.

1738~~~
Hazard - De Bruyne - Mata. Chelsea could've dominated for years.

1739~~~
clearly not enough of a cnut to play for Mourinho. Great comeback though, he can stick up for himself to that toxic bully

1740~~~
"In terms of scoring and assisting and I'm quite happy with the states, and stats don't lie. <b>They are facts</b>."

Couldn't help but read this in Benitez's voice in my head.

1741~~~
Sure I've missed it somewhere, but was he injured at Everton on Saturday? and that's why he was subbed then,  and today a sub?

1742~~~
Nope. Apparently it was for tactical reasons vs Everton and because he needed a rest tonight.

We missed him.

1743~~~
Seems very surprising that call, shame he seems to absolve Rooney of treatment like this.

Just hope Mata's in the starting 11 on Sunday, Very undeserved if not.

1744~~~
We missed him big time. There was almost nothing serious coming from the right tonight.

He better be in the starting lineup on Sunday.

1745~~~
If it's all part of squad rotation that's fine. We've rotated far less than we did under Fergie and fatigue/injuries were going to happen if we kept starting the same XI. Maybe Van Gaal just likes to rest one or two players at a time?

1746~~~
When we lost to Arsenal Neville was asked if the players could be tired and he said only Mata and Memphis could perhaps use that excuse being wingers and playing every game. It's no surprise Van Gaal has tried to rest those two.

1747~~~
Rooney has missed 3-4 games this season and didn't play at all in the international break, unlike Mata who pretty much played in every game for club and country since the start of the season. Darmian was in the same situation as Mata, that's why they were rested, I think.

1748~~~
Gone missing, needs to step it up.

1749~~~
Quiet first half. Hopefully he can pull something out of the bag, though.

1750~~~
Been poor so far. I'm generally against the moaning of him playing on the right, where he's often been great, but it probably isn't the right game for it today. Hasn't been in it at all.

1751~~~
Yeah poor half. Even in what has been a tight game, he's been sloppy on a few occasions.

1752~~~
Really poor today. He's given it away in dodgy areas a few times as well.

1753~~~
Put Memphis on for him. Has wanted too much time on the ball today, game is too fast for him.

1754~~~
Bring on Janu.... Oh. Lingard. Bring on Lingard.

1755~~~
I'd leave Mata on for the moment. He's been very quiet, but it wouldn't be the first time where that's been the case and he's then popped up with an invaluable contribution. He's certainly one of the most likely players to offer something creative, which is what we're generally lacking right now.

1756~~~
Not a very good idea if there's no time and space on the pitch...

1757~~~
Thought he was unlucky to get booked, definitely won the ball, but probably deserved the yellow just for giving the ball away in such a shit place.

1758~~~
We're getting free kicks around the box, he needs to stay on the pitch.

1759~~~
Midfield hatchet man! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/> I thought he worked hard tracking back but the game was zipping past him and he goes sideways way too much for me.

1760~~~
He didn't really do anything, I'm surprised he wasn't taken off sooner than he was.

1761~~~
Pretty anonymous alright.

1762~~~
I thought it made sense to keep him on since he has plenty of games where he's anonymous for large periods, but pops up with a moment of magic to win a game for us or contribute to an important goal. But yeah, very quiet game overall.

1763~~~
We were searching for a goal. No one in the team more reliable at picking a pass or popping up somewhere.

1764~~~
He wasn't good today but I think he should have stayed on as we were controlling the second half, and he can make a contribution despite not playing well in a game. He always has that killer pass or goal in him.

1765~~~
strange vibe from him today, sulking at decisions and many times stayed central when Valencia needed to play a forward ball on the right. not surprised he came off

1766~~~
He's usually a reliable player in terms of retaining the ball in our own half, but this season he's been very sloppy in that regard. In almost every game, he's lost the ball in dangerous positions. Which is mainly down to him playing really poor passes backwards. Really weird.

1767~~~
He looked quite pissed off at being subbed. I thought he was quite poor to be honest. But if playing poorly means getting subbed off, I know someone who would be subbed off every game.

1768~~~
No disrespect to Lingard but give Mata a full game.

1769~~~
The treatment of him is a joke, one of the best players in the league at unlocking a defence and there's not even an attempt to get him central, subbing him for youth players with little top flight experience outside the championship every single game. We basically just repeated the City match against a far inferior side. 

He should be on the platform that Rooney is on in terms of being one of the last players pulled off when you're looking a goal, for some reason he's one of the first.

1770~~~
Worst thing is, once we actually get some pacey players in good areas, Martial up top and Lingard out wide, we take off our best option to make the most of them. Looks like it's getting to him somewhat with that slow run or and against City he seemed surprised and you can understand too when he's consistently shown he's a goal threat and when Rooney is continually allowed to start and finish games regardless of how he players.

1771~~~
So annoying too when Rooney takes free kicks over him, surely Mata is more prolific?

1772~~~
His control is better than Rooney's but he didn't offer any more than him as far as creativity or penetration went, not keen on his slow sulk off either.

1773~~~
Only caught the first half hour but I thought Mata was superlative whenever he was on the ball

1774~~~
We bring on Lingaard and put Martial up top, but by that time, the one who can take advantage of that is off the pitch.

I don't get it.

1775~~~
He was better than Herrera, not great, but I would've preferred to have him in the number 10 role and Herrera to be taken off.

1776~~~
Yes he did. Two through balls and opened up the play for Martial who crossed for Herrera (Mata was also open for that cross). Our best chance of the match. Mata and Martial are the only players that can get the ball in a tight situation and get out of it with a touch or two. Rooney takes a massive touch away from defenders, usually towards his own goal, every time he gets the ball.

I think it's a no brainer to put Mata as the #10 with two wingers on each side. He's better there than Herrera and doesn't have to waste his energy helping out Darmian. Put Lindgard or Young out wide instead. Currently the #10 role is being used to fill in the 11th player, be it Rooney, Herrera or Fellaini. No one that has played it this season is actually very good there.

1777~~~
Our best chance of the match was when Martial played Rooney in one on one with the keeper. He can take the ball in a tight space but rarely gets away with it as he's so slow and easily knocked over, it's why LvG has no intention of playing him centrally, he keeps him wide right with freedom to drift in the hope he'll find pockets to pick a pass. What were his 2 through balls? I recall one really over hit one for Martial.

1778~~~
Over hit? No, Kelly headed it for a corner. The other was towards Schweinsteiger who had made a run but it went like Rooney's through ball, through him and out of reach.

1779~~~
Is there a gif of the first one you are talking about? As I don't recall us getting any corner for the one he tried to put Martial in with.

1780~~~
Feel so sorry for him when the answer is so simple.

1781~~~
No idea but the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34623912" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">text commentary</a> said it happened at 42:25.

1782~~~
Think I'm watching a different game as Mata in that front 3 doesn't do it for me. I think he is a bit of a passenger. We need better!

1783~~~
Weird, I watched the game and I don't remember anything but an over hit attempt to play Martial in over the top.

1784~~~
Tbf, that was the theme of the game today. Through balls that were far from connecting. Think everyone in attack besides Schneiderlin managed one. Thought the passing was pretty poor overall.

1785~~~
True, we were awful on the ball today, not as brutally tedious as the first half against Boro but no change of gear and only 2 decent chances created in 90 minutes.

1786~~~
Agreed. He's not a front three player. He should be in the No.10 position or on the bench.

1787~~~
With 3 pacey players ahead of him stretching the game and making runs he would be magestic, but unfortunately we don't have that at present. I would like to see Young, Memphis and Martial as a 3 ahead of Mata, but it'll never happen.

1788~~~
Me too. I just hate when coaches in any discipline just take advantage of a player's good attitude to drop him in favor of someone who deserves far less playing time; that's just downright abuse in my eyes.

1789~~~
I'm off the same mind set

1790~~~
I get that plenty of people feel Mata's not being utilised to his full potential, and that's understandable, but I really don't see the argument for putting Memphis or Young in front of him. Mata's comfortably better than both.

1791~~~
I meant having Mata as the CAM, with the other 3 as the forwards. I just don't like Mata on the wing, he cant attack a defender out wide or run passed people so it completely limits our attack on 1 side. Darmian isn't overlapping like Rafael or Valencia does, so that again makes it even worse.

1792~~~
He's fine as a winger. Quiet sometimes, but he still grabs us goals and assists, and is capable of some exquisite passes. He's not a traditional, pacy winger, but that's fine; he offers a lot more than someone like Memphis, who might have a lot more pace but is lacking the end product right now. For all this talk of Mata limiting our attack, he's probably been our best attacking player this season so far alongside Martial.

1793~~~
He has picked up most of those with his great intelligence and movement, just think what he could have if played in the correct position?.

I don't think he is completely useless but if you compare him to a proper winger/wide playmaker IMO he could add a lot more. I would have Douglas Costa /Robben/Muller all day long over Mata on the wing for example. Anyway with our wide options right now we don't have much choice let's be honest.

1794~~~
Let him take a free-kick!

1795~~~
Mata's certainly no worse than anyone else, and better than most.
Exactly!

I sometimes think that LVG's greatest talent is to actually demoralise players - except Rooney of course.

Look how much of a spring in his step Chico has now - playing well and scoring goals. Five in three games.

1796~~~
This unfortunately.

1797~~~
We don't have better, and as he's probably our most creative player, or at least one of them, I think you should pick on someone your own size.  <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1798~~~
There was this moment when Mata lost McArthur with a body feint in the middle of the pitch and then ran with the ball and played a through ball to Schweinsteiger but he was too slow for it, sadly.

1799~~~
Mata's good but we need to press higher so he can find these pockets like he did against Liverpool.. When the build up is so slow it doesn't suit almost anyone in our team and never these little great poaching players like him and Herrera. I'd try Lingard for Juan as he needs a bit of breathing to come back stronger. We will need to rotate anyway..

1800~~~
he is our most creative player, he might drift in/out of games but he does productive stuff when he is involved. if he is a passenger then Rooney is the flat tyre

1801~~~
The games I'm watching he isn't he kills everything up the right hand side by slowing down coming backwards or sideways. He sure has quality in and around the box but out wide he's hopeless. He should be our 10 our nothing!!

1802~~~
Mata on the right is one of the key reasons we look slow and turgid but there's a willingness to blame everyone but him. Completely negates any attacking combination on the right.

1803~~~
I said this at the start of the season too.  Mata is currently our best player on the right but effects all of our attack. 

You look at barcelona's front three.  Once the ball gets up tk one of neymar suarez or messi; the opposition are pinned back and the attack is based upon a unit.  However; whether we play martial or memphis on the left; our attack is really lopsided and is easily countered with the defenders defending deeper arguably marking out memphis or martial sinse mata is hardly ever kn the deepers positions.

1804~~~
I think the right hand side is less than ideal. I'm a fan of Mata and I like Darmian but they don't complement each other at all. If Mata plays wide drifting in as he does then you need a right back who is attacking minded which Darmian isn't really. Hopefully he can grow in to it but it will take time. 

Really though that does back to one of my main issues with us at the moment, I just don't get who our system actually suits. For Mata for example starting on the right isn't ideal even with license to drift because when he does drift there's a lack of movement to actually really exploit and less. If he's central there's one less winger for him to play in and on the left Martial tends to hug the line and dribble at people rather than make a darting run inside of the ball, although I'm sure that will come with time.

I get some games it's better to have 3 midfielders in the middle but others it's got to be worth having 2 players who are happy on the wings as well as being able to come inside which martial, depay, lingard and young can do and someone central like Mata who can find these players. 

I wonder if in some games Herrera would be a better option as the right hand side player with Mata more central. Either way I think LVG needs to reconsider the balance in the system, sadly though I think he'll do that by dropping Mata rather than Rooney who should be the one dropped.

1805~~~
He swapped Rooney and Martial, why not swap the other two as well. It would be worth trying.

1806~~~
Most of our attacking players, bar Martial, require others to play well to bring the best out of them.

Last year, in that in famous 6 games period, we had Fellaini, Blind, Young, Mata, Herrera, and Valencia playing really, really well. Now, that 4 or 5 aren't playing or are out of form, the others are also suffering. 

If, and it's a big if, we sort out our formation, style and mentality, we'll see the best of our players.

1807~~~
What was it about him taking his time strolling off during his substitution? He's probably the last person in the team in my mind who would do that given his selfless character

1808~~~
likely not happy he is the go to sub, regardless how others are playing

1809~~~
If we are going to play with two holding midfielders and only one forward with any pace there is no point playing mata, for all his talent without the right players around him and players running beyond him or ahead of him he is just too easily stopped.

1810~~~
Not sure but that really annoyed me! We were needing a goal and he saunters off acting like that. Wouldn't care who it was none of them are playing well enough to act like Billy big balls and Mata son have a real good look at yourself and see if you didn't deserve to come off. Feck me big deal of difference between the days of Becks Ronaldo Giggs and the likes to nowadays.

1811~~~
Yeah, not as if Ronaldo ever went into a strop when he was taken off.

1812~~~
When you keep getting sub'd and left out for Lingard past couple weeks, he can't be very happy about it

1813~~~
I don't understand the ratings. He was under pressure all game and did well to keep the ball most of the time, won quite a few dangerous freekicks with quick feet, and his passing was safe at least, and he even made a few tackles.

1814~~~
Also did a brilliant nutmeg when he came centrally, turned and drove at their defence. He wasn't great, but he wasn't bad either

1815~~~
Seeing Rooney last whole matches despite playing crap, on top of always being the first of the front four to get subbed out, must also annoy the feck out of him.

1816~~~
Think given the level of quality he was producing we could over look it. Mata has for a record signing disappointed imo so a strop from him about getting subbed when he's not playing well is a bit harder to take.

1817~~~
Since he joined the club, there has been a consistent pattern of us scoring at a slightly higher rate in the PL when Mata is missing from the team. This season we have 3 goals in about 136 mins without him, compared to 12 goals in 860 mins when Mata has been on the pitch. Last season we scored 41 in the PL during the 2,297 mins Mata was on the pitch (according to the way Transfermarkt calculate playing time), compared to 21 in 1,123 mins without.

It is about time we left Mata on the bench for a run of games to see if we do better with someone else in his position. Of course he is not the only big name star who should be benched for a spell so that we can explore if alternative options improve our attack.

If after 8-10 games without Mata, our scoring rate remains unimpressive, then I'd put him back in the team.

1818~~~
Mata's blogg. Talks a good fight

1819~~~
I dont care if Mata, Schneiderlin, Young and Herrera talk a lot about back to winning ways, scoring goals and such stuff.
It is what they do on the pitch that matters.

1820~~~
Mata drifts in without the ball.  Thats a big difference to a player who drifts inwards while dribbling.  Our RB fullbacks have no space to get in to because mata doesnt have the ball to play it to him.

1821~~~
Juan has always been an up and down performer for us. He'll produce a match winning performance soon enough.

1822~~~
Stage is set. If anyone is going to produce tonight, it's him.

1823~~~
The stage was also set in the derby. A much more important and high profile game. I guess we have to hope that the stage-fright doesn't recur.

1824~~~
Yeah, he doesn't always perform in the big games. I'm not sure City game was bigger though, tonight is make or break of our CL campaign. Lose and we're gone.

1825~~~
Mata's been much better than Herrera, although that isn't saying much.

1826~~~
Apart from that movement for the chance he didn't get to, that's all he's done. I'm seeing others that are at least doing something getting the flack but at least they're doing something. Far too quiet.

1827~~~
All the play is on the left. 

He also made the pass to Young, who put in a dangerous ball which Lingard missed.

1828~~~
Decent movement at times. Done some okay things, but want to see more of him.

1829~~~
Very anonymous half from him needs to get more involved.

1830~~~
Mata frustrates me. He is obviously very talented, and we saw what he was capable if at Chelsea. At the moment though I just find myself asking what exactly he brings to the team. Even when he was playing well he felt like a luxury player who would go missing too much.

This probably seems harsher than it is meant to be - but I just want to see more from Mata in the final third. He doesn't seem to have any license to take risks or actually be creative. It may well be LVGs system that is hindering him, but it still frustrates me.

1831~~~
He is a passenger he pops up with good stats for a few games but on the whole is not worth much in the wide right position.

1832~~~
He's had about 4 or 5 poor performances in a row. He's awfully lucky we have such little competition on the wings that he'll probably start again next match.

1833~~~
I thought he was abysmal today. Against a team that comes to defend having him on the right doesn't work at all. Lingard or Young merit to start ahead of him at the moment.

1834~~~
Needs to buck up his ideas.

1835~~~
Not playing well. Which is a big problem given he's one of our few quality players.

1836~~~
I'm a big fan of his, but he's been awful recently and its no coincidence its coincided with us not scoring goals.

1837~~~
LvG must have had a word with him about the slow walk off at the weekend as the fastest he moved tonight was when he got subbed. He had a couple of moments in the game but didn't do a lot overall.

1838~~~
I think in his case fatigue could be a factor as well. The problem is, who to bring on? Herrera is the only other option we really have unless we wanna shift Rooney into his role. Since Martial also needs a break, it'll be tough to figure that out.

1839~~~
Maybe play Darmian at RB and get Young on the wings.

1840~~~
Not doing much at all is he atm?

1841~~~
Suspended next game.  Hopefully Valencia is fit.

1842~~~
Could Herrera play his position?

1843~~~
Indeed. I did wonder earlier in the season what would happen if he got injured as we seemed so dependent on him for goals and assists. Seemed like we would struggle quite badly in terms of creativity.

Think it's safe to say that's been the case through this poor run of form. Really need him to pick things up. If we're going to start scoring more then he's going to be heavily involved. As is he's pretty anonymous.

1844~~~
Has been a passenger one of the main reasons we are struggling to create. People will point to his stats but they don't tell the whole story. The sooner he's moved out his role the better.

1845~~~
Wee need him to rediscover his form quick. Our quality in attack is shit.

1846~~~
play him as 10 or bench him and give him some reason to fight for his palce again, he looks too comfortable on the pitch. That little run from the wing was so good but apart that he just played balls backwards and couldn't play his game but he was perhaps suffering from Carrick and Basti playing too deep, being cut off from all the players but Young..

1847~~~
Needs herrera and some pace on the overlap to make any use out of his tidy play it seems

1848~~~
I missed most of the game, and only watched from the 60th minute mark onwards. But from what I saw, he should have had an assist for that Rooney chance, and he was subbed soon after.

1849~~~
Tbf he's not really playing any different to how he was earlier in the season or in his Utd career. He's a passenger in our team who can pop up with moments of top quality. The difference now is that he's not in a purple patch of being clinical. As I said he's Berbatov 10/11 -  looks good on stats but the team is more fluid without him.

1850~~~
Yep.

1851~~~
Am disappointed with his contributions so far this season.    Been very average for quite a few games.  

Has escaped major criticism because of the obsession with Rooney.  

Needs to sort his form out as much more is required from an established experienced pro like him.  He should be setting an example, not riding on the coat tails of others.

1852~~~
Didn't play great tonight, but he's a clever player and probably our most creative this season. I just wish he'd find that knack of scoring some goals again.

1853~~~
Fastest player in the world (from Reddit).

1854~~~
Yep. He's nothing special at all. He'd make a decent squad option in the long run. My preference is to sell him though.

1855~~~
Yep total passenger in this position regardless his stats.

1856~~~
Makes our right wing redundant at times, we desperately need a right winger who can go past people and that clearly isn't mata.

1857~~~
Seeing Bayern tonight, playing under Guardiola, it made me realise how much difference it can make to have wide players who will run at the opponent and take on defenders. Whether LVG would allow this or not I dont know, and I am not trying to make out that the difference between us and Bayern is having Mata out wide. However I have very rarely felt that we carry a true attacking threat down the right hand side when Mata plays there, for me he doesnt create enough. We needed him to be our Silva, and that is the level I think he <i>needs</i> to be at in order to justify being played out wide.

I was disappointed when we sent Adnan on loan and sold Nani, because it left us with a shortage of "proper" wide players. I think that with those two and/or Memphis as our wing options, it would have added a lot to our attacking play.

1858~~~
It's a no brainer for me.

When he is in form he is very effective and can often be the difference between victory and defeat.

When he is not, he is pretty useless and should be dropped.

I wouldn't mind seeing Lingard starting next game.

1859~~~
Ugh, Lingaard starting over Mata.

I get that Mata can be frustrating but the thought of making our starting eleven even less talented than it currently is makes me wince. As is Martial and Mata are the only players we have who look like they can provide any real quality. Reducing that to just Martial by dropping one of (if not the) best outfield players we have certainly isn't a recipe for scoring more.

We have such a uninspiring, workman-like team atm. Please don't remove one of our few remaining hopes for any sort of magic.

1860~~~
I do wonder if this would be the case if he was our 10 instead of Rooney, though. I don't think Rooney currently does much physical work that Mata couldn't, and Mata's link play might make him a better partner for Martial.

1861~~~
He's been poor lately, but this is ridiculous. His talent is unquestionable. He was the heart of Chelsea's attack prior to Mourinho's return. He had 33 goals and 55 assists in 135 games for them, you don't just fluke your way into stats like that. It just seems like he's not suited to our current system, at least not as a winger.

1862~~~
His time at Chelsea is pretty irrelevant. Chelsea weren't a great side, so he'll never have so much freedom again, unless he joins a lesser team. They played a certain way for much of his time there. And his assists record includes taking set pieces for a team with Drogba, Terry, Cahill, amongst others. He didn't prove at Chelsea that he can be a key player for a top side. He's yet to prove it.

He's not suited to this system, I agree. And it has nothing to do with him being on the wing. He's just not capable of making his mark on 90 minutes of football consistently in a possession team, wherever he plays.

And that's why he's not good enough for where this team is looking to go. Many want the team built around him going forward, but the very best players could/can all play in possession teams. Players who can play in a high-possession team, where space is limited, and dribbling turning and shielding are required - they're the best players. Mata can't do these things well enough.

Thus I'd trade Mata's famous statistics for someone like Isco any day.
Someone like Isco, who may not score as much, but will help his team create much better angles and threatening positions on the pitch; who can't be forced sideways with a bit of pressing; who can actually go past a man.

Mata pretty much has to be right in front of goal, or given the ball against a stretched defence, or played in behind the defence in order to do something progressive. How is that the makings of a top #10?

1863~~~
Here we go with the Mata fan opinion roller-coaster. One day, he's amazing, the next a passenger. I missed the first half, but read that he set up Lingard for a glorious chance; in the second, he put it on a plate for Rooney. Seems like pretty decisive contributions to me.

1864~~~
Well he surely isn't suited for the number 10 position either. What is his long term role then? I can see him being a very good second choice player, but once we finally get a proper right winger, he should make way in starting 11.

1865~~~

1866~~~
Hands down has the best style in the club.

1867~~~
It's weird how people change their opinions over Mata so easily. He can play 10 good games in a row and no one will complain, but as soon as he plays two or three bad games people will say he's been like that all the time, and few will come up with usual bullshit that we should sell him.

He was one of our better players this season until last few games, but for some reason some people ignore that.

Saying he is the only one depending of the team is stupid considering we weren't anymore creative at start of the season yet he was scoring and assisting quite often, and most of time out of nothing. Reading some of the comments you would think everything was put on the plate for him and we were scoring for fun. But at the same time our other attacking players had the excuse that we weren't creating many chamces for them.

Even in his last game which was poor he created two or three our best chances of the game.

His form is bad at the moment, no doubt at that, but I think he was still our easily most consistent attacking player since start of the season.

As someone pointed out earlier, it's not a coincidence that we aren't scoring any goals at time when Mata is out of form. We are clearly very dependable of his end product, he has become very important player for us.

1868~~~
The people who don't think Mata's good enough (for where the team should be aiming for) haven't changed their minds due to a few games. 
I certainly haven't. He's useful when he's scoring or assisting and he's pretty good at doing that, but his overall game is lacking. Personally, I think that regardless of whether he's just had two or three good games or not. 

It's probably just different people saying different things. Not people changing their opinions easily.

1869~~~
To be fair I don't actually think he was as well dressed as everyone is making out.

Brown shoes with white chinos and a brown belt, a dark grey/navy jacket with a green sweater, white shirt and a black tie?!

He's just so incredibly good looking he can pull it off and still look classy.

1870~~~
Been our most consistent attacker since he arrived at the club, let alone since the start of the season. Not saying much given the level of competition but still...

1871~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1872~~~
I guess the style of his team mates makes it look even better <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1873~~~
That's true, some horrendous outfits all around

1874~~~
People who want him to be more like Silva would complain that he's lacking end product, same as they do with Silva. City's fans would probably want Silva to be more like Mata in terms of end product.

Basically, people want both of them to turn into Messi, which is not possible because they aren't that good.

His overall game can be more creative, I agree, but he's simply that kind of player and if we had good dribbler on the left who is creative, who doesn't even have to be that special and score too much, plus decent right fullback who could cross the fecking ball and had good engine we would have pretty great and balanced side which could create and score goals for fun. But even like this Mata is the least of our problems. Rooney is shite this season, our fullbacks are far from great attacking wise when Shaw's missing, and we still don't have left winger I mentioned. But yeah, Mata is the problem.

1875~~~
Maybe some would, but I wouldn't. I'd trade him for Silva or Isco's lower end product any day. They'd make the team function better, and probably create more chances, and score more goals.
A few people have mentioned that the stats show that when Mata plays, the team scores fewer goals. Obviously it's just a stat. but it's interesting.
And Silva's stats. aren't miles off Mata, so I'm sure City fans don't want that, to be honest. He's improved his scoring anyway, plus they see what he does for their team - especially the fullbacks.

No they don't. Most people who don't think Mata's a top #10 believe Silva is a top #10.

Nobody said 'Mata is the problem', but this is the Mata thread. And it's just countering all the people who believe he's rarely THAT good because of a host of reasons other than himself. Some people believe Mata is a great number 10, proved it at Chelsea, needs pace on either side to become incredible, and is much worse on the wing.
And some people believe all of that to be false. That doesn't mean Mata's the (only) problem.
Mata's probably the best of a very lacklustre attack, which has players completely unsuited to the system they play. But if the attack improves to the level it should be, he's not good enough. His overall game isn't good enough as a winger or a #10.

1876~~~
If Silva played for United he'd split opinion just the same. Opposition players are viewed more favourably because their qualities are highlighted but deficiencies go unnoticed.

1877~~~
Well, I think Silva is better player than Mata too but I still complain about his end product(more about the goals actually than assists) because that's what's stopping him from becoming top top player, IMO, and I think sooner or later someone would complain about that if he played for us. Same as when people don't complain about Mata's creativity when we are scoring goals, but as soon as we stop scoring people say he is not creative enough.

But I think Mata would be better player for some teams even if Silva is better player. As I said, in team like I described(good left winger who doesn't score too much, attacking right fullback), I would take Mata ahead of Silva and Isco. For example, if Real Madrid didn't have Ronaldo, then Mata would be easily better player for them than Isco, IMO.

As for their stats, roughly - Mata has scored 20 goals in ~5000 minutes for us, and Silva has scored 40 in ~17800 minutes for City. There's a clear difference who is the better goalscorer, same as who is more creative.


I keep hearing this all the time, but when will that finally happen? When we have players equally good as Mata and better in our other positions, then we can talk about not starting him at all, or selling him. For now we are nowhere near that. And I believe that will never happen anyway because it's not easy to find better players than Mata, but that's just my opinion.

1878~~~
That's a decent beard Mata has.

1879~~~
That nonsense about Silva lacking end product and being a polarising player. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
He has 12 goals and 7 assists in the league last season. He has 1 goal and 6 assists so far (in 5(!) matches). He has the beating of Mata for the past two seasons, yet only one is lauded for being insanely clinical with his stats.

He's constantly seen by City fans to be their best player - ahead of Agüero - yet if he was here, he'd be polarising, like. 

Hugs Mata isn't consistent at all. If anything, he is the most inconsistent because he can be fantastic for three games, then shite for the next three (which is exactly what just happened now) he's also the easiest to mark out of matches and as a result he drifts out too often. Once a pacey, goal scoring RW is found, I really do think he'll drop down to the role of a good squad option. Lingard is already providing him with strong completion.

1880~~~
I just don't get this. If a player doesn't have a great game, why do people label it as shit? So frustrating how fans rate performances either 10/10 or a 2/10. Just because he hasn't produced what we want from him, doesn't mean he has been playing shit.

1881~~~
He was absolute tosh against Arsenal, he was easily kept out of the City game. He wasn't bad against Everton, but that was our best game in a while and he was probably the worst midfielder on the day. He did very little against CSKA too. People are very quick to rate him as our most talented/best player, but when his statistical output is nullified, he offers very little.

1882~~~
I just see him as a player that when good, he's unplayable, but those games are far too rare. If he put in performances like the one at Anfield last season for example, more consistently he'd be up there with the very best. I'm not even talking about ''that'' goal he scored, that's obviously a wonder goal, but his overall play was fantastic and complete. Why doesn't he do it more often? especially against the weaker teams?

1883~~~
The answer is simple, because he's not that good.If Park could play the way he did against Chelsea in that 2-1 win consistently he would be world class.He's not.

1884~~~
Comparing him to Park is harsh.  Mata has all of the makings of a world class talent, he just can't gel it all together consistently enough to be considered in the top tier. A sublime first touch, calm in goalscoring situations, brilliant movement when on his game and a top professional. He's a treat to watch most of the time, he just isn't the player that's going to get the better of a parked bus week in, week out. He thrives more in an open game of football.

1885~~~
Juan Mata absolutely is in the 'top tier'.

1886~~~
I'm not comparing Mata with Park.I'm just saying just because he managed to put in top class display sometimes doesn't mean he's a top tier player.He doesn't have enough in his locker to crack down teams that sit deep and he's quite inconsistent.He's still probably our best offensive player currently all things considered but I think he's a tad overrated here by some just because he's a very likeable character and come with big reputation."Hugs" and all that.

1887~~~
He hasn't been 'top tier' since he has arrived here.

1888~~~
To be fair Silva's last season in terms of goals was far, far more productive than anything he has previously produced. Prior to that his goal tally was 5-8 per season. Whereas the 3 seasons Mata played consistently he's scored 10, 12 and 20 (scoring 7 even when benched for half the season).

I don't think anyone would question Silva's output last season but I stand by my point that United fans are much, much harsher on their own players than most other fans. Look at Arsenal fans with Ozil or Chelsea fans with Mata or City fans with Silva. They all adore their play-makers, even though they do have physical weaknesses and a tendency to let some games completely pass them by.

1889~~~
Mostly because Moyes didn't really know how to use him, and van Gaal mostly uses him as a winger. He's always been at his best when playing through the center (edit: in my opinion). Still, though, he's managed to rack up a decent number of goals and assists.

1890~~~
He really hasn't. It's just a lazy assertion. His best player was out on the wing for Valencia, and he was very good on the right for Chelsea with Oscar through the middle at Hazard on the left. As a #10, he is only truly effective in a side who seek to absorb pressure, not really look to control the game, and play on the break, where his ability in the final third is at it's best - it's exactly why he had those impressive numbers in 2012/13 season for Chelsea.

In a possession oriented system, his best position is actually where he is now. He just wouldn't find the space to manoeuvre through the middle and he'd be marked out of matches even easier than what he does now.

1891~~~
I've been away from this thread for a while, and decided to have a look what's going on. I see typical the typical myths about Mata are still in fashion.
Retreat!

1892~~~
I just watched all his assists at Chelsea and I was surprised to see how many of them were simple crosses/set pieces. Sort of explains why his creativity isn't anywhere near as impressive as you'd expect given his assists record.

1893~~~
Where did you watch that, mate, youtube? Wouldn't mind seeing myself.

1894~~~
Aye, I just searched Mata 12/13 and there it was.

1895~~~
I'm sorry if me being more impressed by Mata when used through the center than out wide upsets you. It must be very hard for you to see others having opinions that differ from yours.

Tell me, how fecking coddled are you?

I'll defer to your judgement on where he works best in our current system.  And yes, it's probably a lazy assertion based on his impressive stats and ability to create something while at Chelsea. At least partially. There's also his ability to find space, which is half-wasted when played out wide. And to me, that's one of his greatest strengths (outside of his ability to pop up with a goal or an assist even on a bad day).

1896~~~
ta

1897~~~
Not surprising, really. I've always innately contributed his stifled creativity down to the negligence of Mourinho, Moyes, and to a lesser extent van Gaal, but still. That 'spark' has always been real sporadic here.

1898~~~
Yep. He took set-pieces for Chelsea - one of the best teams for aerial threat for yonks.
And the majority of the rest involve him being played in behind a defence, or applying a final pass against a stretched defence. He's extremely accurate at playing those finishing passes, but he needs to be put into those positions in the first place.

It's not creativity in the true sense, in my opinion. Which is why I don't see him as a great player. He needs space to do his thing, whereas the best players create space where there is none.
And despite the statistics, hardly anything he did at Chelsea actually suggests he can do exceptionally in a possession system as a '#10'. His stuff at Chelsea stuff has to be looked at within a certain context.

1899~~~
Which games with him in the centre impressed you most?
Arguably his best United performance came on the right, against Liverpool.

1900~~~
That's why I think he deserves most criticism for his crossing. His crosses in general are very average for us and he usually picks the wrong moments to cross or doesn't cross at all when he should be doing it. I am surprised why he isn't criticised more for that.

1901~~~
Oh, he's been shite centrally for us, don't get me wrong. On the other hand, he never got a proper run, so I don't think it's fair to write him off based on that. But as DWelbz pointed out, I was a tad lazy in my assertion, failing to consider the system used when he was at Chelsea.

I guess my biggest error was stating initially stating it as a fact that he'd always been best through the center. It is, of course, just the impression I've gotten through his years in England. I'll chalk it up to having been up since yesterday, worked a night shift, and now just waiting for the game to start (and then for it to finish, so I can go to bed).

1902~~~
Yeah. He had a few like that clip over the top to demba ba vs united, but his set pieces were in general a lot better while playing for Chelsea. Both his corners and free kicks.

1903~~~
Our set pieces have been crap under LVG overall, IMO. Maybe we don't practice them.

1904~~~
It has been absolutely shocking tbf, close to no free kicks from all ranges are dangerous and how often do we even score out of corners? If its not for Smalling at times, we aint even dangerous.

1905~~~
It’s okay to have your opinion. I disagree with it and I pointed out that this discussion has been done a couple of time on the Caf and it’s a common myth. My opinion is he never impressed me in the hole.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I could ask you the same! Don’t take it so personal mate, it’s just some people behind laptops talking about football!

He finds much more space out wide actually. His biggest problem is that once pressed he just starts passing the ball back and you can forget about him creating chances. Agree about the goal out of nothing, even on a bad day though.

1906~~~
Had one good chance and got involved more today, neat and tidy. Took the penalty with aplomb.

1907~~~
He scored but I think it was another average performance.

1908~~~
Involved in a lot of action without doing much.

1909~~~
got on the ball more than the last few games. Don't think any attacker had a great game. What is his penalty record for us like? Think 4 in 4.

1910~~~
He was fine. No more, no less. Took the chance to score as well as he usually does with a nice penalty and was tidy otherwise.

1911~~~
Meh 

He needs movement from other players to be effective. He's too similar to Rooney and Bastian and Carrick.  

We need pace on that right side. Not his fault but even Valencia would add more against bus parkers.

1912~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1913~~~
^^ <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1914~~~
His technique on the spot is very good. I feel confident when he steps up.

1915~~~
Thank god he took Rooney off and not Mata.

1916~~~
Unlucky not to score earlier but yeah, happy he tucked the pen away.

1917~~~
Was OK, should have hit the target  with his early chance.

1918~~~
If that had been the case, it would have been Ander who had taken it anyway. No worries there. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1919~~~
True.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1920~~~

1921~~~
Better performance than his recent matches, but still capable of much more. Tidy and took his penalty well.

1922~~~
Juan Mata in the league for Chelsea: 82 games, 18 goals, 27 assists. 
Juan Mata in the league for Man Utd: 60 games, 19 goals, 11 assists

Most Premier League goals + assists by midfielders since 2011/12: 
Juan Mata (75) 
David Silva (75) 
Yaya Toure (70) 
Eden Hazard (66)

1923~~~
I kind of get the argument mentioned earlier that he got more assists for Chelsea because they were a particularly dangerous team from set pieces.

Why is he scoring more for us though? We're a team that struggles offensively, we've been pretty terrible for most of the time he's been here and he's spend a large part of his time here out wide rather than playing centrally. So how come he scores more for us?

1924~~~
Beautiful penalty, beautiful man.

1925~~~
He wasn't on penalty duty at Chelsea, and I think he scored something like 3 penalties for us. Plus Chelsea had a lot more attacking outlets in their team, so they didn't rely so heavily on Mata.

1926~~~
From BBC:

"Since debuting for Manchester United, Juan Mata has been involved in more PL goals than any other player at the club (30)"

Good stat.

1927~~~
I really like Mata, and I want him in the team, but he makes our right hand side so redundant. There's just no threat coming from there atm. We need a proper winger on the right, someone with genuine pace and skill.

1928~~~
We definitely need a player with quickness and two wingers willing to stretch the defense, hug the line and run diagonals behind the defense.

1929~~~
He has such intelligent movement, if only we could get 1 more pacey winger, or get an in form memphis with lingard on the right we would be absolutely fine. I like when Mata roams around and get's involved with the wings, I think even if he plays as a 10 he shouldnt stay so central and just move around the pitch adding extra numbers to help overload areas of the pitch.

1930~~~

1931~~~
Was better than he has been but still has got to improve.

1932~~~
Because he's actually quite a good player, who gets into good positions and creates a lot of chances for himself and others. I know the Caf might occasionally seem to imply we're an awful team of shit brained average cock-wits who are criminally stealing a living from the ghost of Quinton Fortune, but by sheer random luck, we do genuinely have some quite decent players.

1933~~~
He's a great player to have, but I still feel, he, along with Rooney will be the biggest casualties when we reinforce again. We need guile & pace on that right wing, and he doesn't provide that [not his fault obviously] & there's no place for a true number 10 under Van Gaal. If we get someone like Griezmann, then that's it. He's doing well, very intelligent player.

1934~~~
Agreed.

1935~~~
As biased as I am in regards to Mata, I do agree but you then have to ask yourself, how much more productive would a pacey skilful winger be. Yes, it would make us more direct and attacking but as predictable as Mata can be out there, time and time again he is directly impacting games.

1936~~~
Another OK performance but he is so vital to our game. He is one of those players which puts in tidy performances game after game and the fans continue moaning and the moment he does not play a game, we all start missing him.

1937~~~
I don't think it's that clear cut as just saying if we had a winger on the right he wouldn't score/create as much as Mata did so having Mata is ok. The issue with Mata should be read in the context of our team - we do not have a great attacking right back to give us an effective threat, our left wing is not pulling up trees either and neither is Mata a Ronaldinho type of playmaker that has game changing individual moments. In short I think we need a more balanced attack to make up for our lack of quality in attack so for us to achieve that balance we need to have both wings firing so that teams do not have the luxury of putting three defenders on the only difference maker we have in the side. I genuinely believe that Mata should fight for a spor on the team against Rooney with Young going to the left and Lingard on the right. It's only when we have the threat of pace allround that either player is at their best due to the space they would be afforded in the centre when teams are stretched.

1938~~~
Do the fans really moan about Mata though? I know a few here do but most fans (and certainly the one that attend the games) seem to have absolutely no problem with him. In fact I'd guess most fans think he's pretty excellent.

1939~~~
I hope you are correct too. I really think he is vital for our play.

1940~~~
What do you mean by "game changing individual moments"? Surely goals and assists are as game changing as it comes?

You've actually made a pretty good argument for why Mata is indispensable atm. The lack of quality in attack means we can't afford to drop someone as productive as Mata as a more balanced attack with lesser players like Young, Valencia, Lingaard, and out of form Depay simply won't work as well due to the lack of quality you highlighted.

As the stats posted in this thread prove, Mata is a ridiculously productive player, more so than most of the PL players we'd consider superior to him. Lingaard isn't going to come anywhere near that and I seriously doubt the extra balance he brings will suddenly up the overall output of the team that much either.

1941~~~
I think most the fans on here are big supporters of Mata and rightly so. This season he has shown that he's not just a luxury player.

1942~~~
Playing him on the right wouldn't look so one-dimensional if we had a flying, attacking right back in behind him and a proper, quality winger on the left.

1943~~~
It seems like LVG has seen what we have all been crying out for over the past 18 months and that's pace. Unless LVG can see Mata as a number 10 I think his time as a starter for us could be numbered - I think Mata would be great as a 10 with pace either side of him and Martial up top, it would really bring out his qualities and I think he would benefit greatly from having players making runs in behind.

However it seems as though LVG prefers a second striker, Rooney, or a third midfielder, Herrera to play number 10 and it's starting to make me think this could be the last season we see Mata at OT - bold statement I know but I just can't see him fitting in unless we let him play at 10 which I would love to see.

Thoughts Caf?

1944~~~
People have been saying this for what feels like the best part of a year or so now... yet Mata will constantly find a way back into the team, because of how productive he is.

1945~~~
I think LVG likes him a lot, and he should - Mata has been super productive. I would love to see us move him into the #10 position once we sort out the pace on our wings.


Depay/Lingard-----Martial-----Pacy Winger
---------------------Mata---------------------
-------Schneiderlin-----Schweinsteigger----

Obviously this would mean dropping Rooney, which won't happen.

1946~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nv6rK1dH64Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1947~~~
Hopefully he steps up like he did in September now with martial and Rooney both out, he'll be the main man out there.

1948~~~
Mata creates/scores more goals than any other player in our team.
While he keeps delivering, LVG will keep playing him.
Di Maria was the only other guy in our team last year, who could compete, but LVG sold him because he wanted to leave.
So, I think Mata will be sold, but only if he, himself, suggests it.

1949~~~
Answered my question in the FullTimeDevils video. Best 20 seconds of my week. Hugs.

On the game, like every week I hope to see him behind the striker but there is a better chance of it happening against Watford now. In saying that, I also hope Herrera plays so that will most likely force him back out wide.

1950~~~
Think it might be worth giving Mata a run in the middle and play Lingard wide right, still have Young or Memphis or Perreira to play wide left.

1951~~~
With PSV being such a crucial game, I think Schneiderlin and Bastian will 100% start that, so I'm hoping it's one of them with Herrera today allowing Mata to play in there. If they both play though, it will be Herrera at 10 though.

1952~~~
The world needs more Juan Mata's. What a man.

1953~~~
Really not showing much when playing his favoured position. Very sketchy half, his passing has been off the mark. Despite what people say, I feel like we are getting more out of him from the right.

1954~~~
I'm a fan but he needs to fecking step it up. He's better than this. He and Bastian have been bad.

1955~~~
Still unconvincing at the no 10.

1956~~~
I'm also not convinced

1957~~~
He is making mistakes with final pass, but he is obviously more involved in the build up when playing centrally and is playing more directly than when he is wide. If he could click with his delivery when playing centrally than he could definitely play there all the time. 

People like to write him off after he's played one half in central position, behind strikers who aren't strikers, really weird.

1958~~~
Looking really lively today.

1959~~~
Not playing well atm.

1960~~~
Is his second name ,Slowdown? How are we going to have an fluid and fast attacking line up when our no 10 hasnt got his focus to the opposing goals?

1961~~~
Another disappointing performance. Our most senior attacker on the day but he certainly didn't show much at all.

1962~~~
Hasn't done well at all in the last few games. Really needs to step up.

1963~~~
Toilet

1964~~~
Don't think he's happy with how he played today. Not his type of match. Too much battle in the box with the ball in the air and drifted a bit out on the wing where he couldn't deliver a simple cross. Looked like his team mates and him were not synced in attack. He had a couple of moments where he waited for a movement from Lingard or Memphis, but nothing happened. Instead he had to release the ball and then make the run himself.

1965~~~
He was rubbish in a game where we needed him to step up... Disappointing.

1966~~~
Clearly fatigued but with Herera injured now it looks like a rest won't be coming any time soon.

1967~~~
If I was to consider any of our attackers undroppable, Mata would be the one. Too much quality, too productive and too capable of coming up with something even when playing badly.

That said, I don't think LVG feels the same way. He needs to improve his form and quickly.

1968~~~
... You realise he's shown none of this for the past four of five matches?

1969~~~
Am I only allowed to judge him on the past four or five matches?

1970~~~
Before the Boro game, LVG said he was in the red zone. Might be true. he's looked off pace for a month.

1971~~~
Can a player with 'too much quality', 'too productive', 'too capable' go four or five matches without doing anything? That player couldn't. Mata, could, because he just really isn't that good.

1972~~~
You know something is wrong when you're the senior member of an inexperienced attack and it's you who gets subbed off. 
edit, for another inexperienced kid at that.

1973~~~
Clearly has skill and vision but he's just too slow. Repeatedly got caught on the ball today.

1974~~~
Yes, a player that good can go five games without doing anything. Better players than Mata have too, poor form happens quite a lot in football. It's only five games ffs.

1975~~~
Absolute master of looking neat and tidy throughout but doing very little. Barring a couple of games here and there it's been the story of his season while everyone else around him gets dogs abuse. Not like Lingard and Depay were all that good either but still looked a cut above and more dangerous than Mata. Just goes to show utterly dogshit we are without Martial in our attack. The only attacking player who's good enough for United.

Could you not have come up with a better, more believable excuse? Fatigued? What the flying feck has he done in the last fortnight aside from warming the Spanish bench? Or are we just running out of excuses for him now? I thought pace around him was supposed to unlock some sort of genius inside him...

1976~~~
Not playing well, is he? Needs to up the urgency.

1977~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's like the go to excuse for any small player with half decent technique ever.

1978~~~
I love the man, but not a good performance today. Was a non-factor in any 50/50 ball, lost the ball a few times and repeatedly played the safe option rather than looking for an incisive through ball.

1979~~~
So poor. I don't understand how Mata can put in performances like these. So much technical ability, such a good left foot, yet so unwilling to go on and stamp his authority on the game. He's still a quality player but with him you just feel it could still be so much more.

1980~~~
Not having a go at you, but according to a few people on here pace is meant to get the best out of Mata. Depay and Lingard were making excellent runs throughout the match, so the problem clearly lies elsewhere. If a player struggles to turn and face the opposition goal, he's going to have problems creating chances for us, even if we have attacking players making amazing runs off the ball. It's not a coincidence that Mata performs slightly better playing on the RW, and that's because he has more space to operate in and there's less pressure on him. Whenever he has played as a #10 for us, he's struggled. Mourinho, Del Bosque, Van Gaal all prefer other players to him in that role for a reason...

1981~~~
You could tell from his reaction to being subbed that he even knew he had a poor game. 
He's a really good player but I just get the feeling that after next summer he's going to replaced on the right & won't be given the chance to play centrally. If LVG gets the players or type of player that he wants then I can't see Mata being here much longer than another season.

1982~~~
Not great his stats hide the fact he has been stone average since joining.

1983~~~
Yup. He's a quality player technically, but he's still lacking in key elements. Ozil, who has been the best #10 in the league this season, finds it relatively easy to evade pressure and always creates space for himself, so it seems like he has more time/space to work with compared to other playmakers. If Mata was able to get in the right areas for us, he would be amazing. But it's not going to happen. We need more pace... he has to play as a #10... Van Gaal isn't managing him properly... All these arguments never made sense to begin with IMO. For us to see the best of him in his "favoured role", he would need to change his skillset and that's physically impossible.

1984~~~
Needs to do better. Is coasting by when we need him to be doing more.

1985~~~
My point wasn't that his best position is #10, I like him wide but people like to write him off centrally just after one half he plays there. How many times did he actually got the chance there to perform for us in a fluid team behind striker who can actually keep the ball and make the runs?

I agree that he didn't have good game, and that he should have done better with Memphis and Lingard in front of him, but it's just their first game together and it's impossible to expect that everything will click for them in the first game together, in new formation(s), in a tough away game.

1986~~~
When he plays centrally rather than having that bit extra freedom drifting off the right it allows CM's or CB's to get on him quicker and he lacks the strength or pace to get away from them most of the time.

1987~~~
Goals are goals. I agree he has been a tad underwhelming but it's been an awkward time at the club. 
Weird that a few years ago every team wanted, or needed, a player like him but now it seems it's like it's hard to fit them into a team.

1988~~~
Yep the 433 has killed their positions but the ones with mobility can play in the front 3. Mata should play in the middle 3 at home versus the weaker teams.

1989~~~
That's a bit of an exaggeration. He's had some incredibly average spells for us (first half of last season, and arguably at the moment), but he's had plenty of very good spells for us too.

1990~~~
United score with Mata no longer on the pitch, what a surprise ! Or actually not really, as our scoring rate in the PL is better without him; which was also the case last season and even in his first season at the club.

I'm still waiting for the spell of games without Mata, just to see how we might perform. Complete mystery to me how he gets in the team every week (though not as extraordinary as Rooney's selection)

1991~~~
This is exactly how he plays in most of our games, tbf, except he didn't get a goal / assist to hide it.

1992~~~
Think he limits us.  I've completely lost faith in him.  We need players with power, dribbling ability and pace.  A really nice lad...who won't go into a tackle to save his mother.

1993~~~
Not a fan Cheesy to much of a passenger for me. Yep great stats but overall in games is a burden and we carry him. The sooner he's replaced in that wide right the better. Of the front man is his position and he should get his chance there.

1994~~~
What a stupid logic.

We scored when he was on the pitch, and we conceeded a goal after he was subbed off.

And can you post those stats about us being more efficient without him and if you which gameswere those.

1995~~~
Funnily enough if there's anyone he should look to learn from it's own best bud Ander Herrera who always plays with a great deal of intensity. Mata has so much going for him, but if he could just impose himself more on games, and be willing to take on the mantle that he really should be taking on.

1996~~~
I posted them on Nov 2nd in this thread. If you want the matches, go to transfermarkt, look at Mata's personal stats, it shows all the details, though you'll need to either recall or make note of, when the goals were scored in those matches that Mata was substituted.

This season: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/juan-mata/leistungsdaten/spieler/44068" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/juan-mata/leistungsdaten/spieler/44068</a>

Last season: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/juan-mata/leistungsdaten/spieler/44068/plus/0?saison=2014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/juan-mata/leistungsdaten/spieler/44068/plus/0?saison=2014</a>

Mata may seem an important player when he is on the pitch, but when he is missing we don't seem to have much problem scoring goals or creating chances. The only season in which the fixtures were unfavourable to Mata's stats is the Moyes/Giggs season in which he missed the Hull home game and was a sub against Norwich at home. In the other seasons, if anything, he has featured in a marginally easier set of fixtures so it should be pretty alarming that our scoring rate isn't higher with Mata on the pitch.

1997~~~
Typical Mata performance without that goal/assist for fans to rave about him.We can't afford to start him and Rooney together unless Wayne played as number 10.Too many passengers in one front 4.

1998~~~
Still prefer him as a united player than not....

1999~~~
Just curious, but how would he do at Arsenal?

2000~~~
I found your post:

So by your math, with Mata in the team last season we were scoring every 56,02 minutes, and without him every 53,47 minutes. Yes, that's great improvement, I am surprised how the manager didn't notice those 2,5 minutes difference.

So, to check it out, I'll just post games in which he didn't play at all(I am lazy to look through all games where he was subbed off). So, he's missed West Ham home(<b>2</b>-0), City away(1-<b>0</b>), Arsenal away(1-<b>2</b>), West Ham away (1-<b>1</b>), Burnley home(<b>3</b>-1), so completely balanced set of fixtures, two tough games, few shittier ones. That's 8 goals in 450 minutes, so that means we were scoring at pretty much identical ratio when he was on the pitch, every 56,25 minutes, and that was mostly because of the Burnley home game. Arsenal home in which he played we scored one, and City home with him we scored 4, so there's really no any pattern here so you can come up with any conclusion.

How that proves anything is beyond me.

2001~~~
For a large portion (or maybe all) of the time that Mata has been with us, we've lacked pacey players up front.  Now that we have Martial, Memphis, and Lingard available, I think we're beginning to fully realize how much Mata slows us down.

We complain about how much Rooney is moved around the lineup in order to accommodate him and we should also look at the situation when Mata plays.  IMO Mata is being fitted into 2 positions neither of which he is suited for.

IMO he doesn't have the needed abilities to play as a CAM/10 because he is too slow, too lightweight, and won't try to navigate around defenders with the ball.  His first instinct is to slow play down or pass into safe areas rather than try to force the play and create.  He is also useless for aerials and whenever there's a 50-50 he will always get beaten to control of the ball because he's simply not fast enough.

Similar problems come up when he is on the wing because, again, he does not have the speed or ability (or desire) to take defenders on and create his own space.  This is a large part of the reason why Valencia still has a place on the team, because he is (or was, until Lingard) our only speed going down the right.

His redeeming qualities are that he works hard and he <i>can </i>create great chances -if- given the space to work in.  His skills are some of the best in PL but the situation has to fit.  So it's no surprise IMO that he's struggling because the situation is not always something that he'll get.

I've liked Mata but if we want to have the fast, dynamic attack we've been talking about, I don't really think he's worth the money we're paying him.  I guess we can hold onto him for now but we should be looking to improve his place.

2002~~~
Looking forward to his next goal or assist for all the backflips. Stay strong Juan. Hugs.

2003~~~
Worst performance I can remember from him today. Not sure what the problem was because you'd think having two quick forwards ahead of him would be ideal.

2004~~~
I'd love to get Isco or a proper right winger in for him after this season.

2005~~~
Precisely. Be prepared for all the sarcastic 'I told you so' posts when he does score or assist in a week or two, though.

2006~~~
He's injured apparently.

2007~~~
Did he get a touch? He's not really a last ditch type of player IMO.

2008~~~
Yeah, not the sort of player you'd expect to do much in seven minutes, especially given the way we were playing by that stage.

2009~~~
If LvG planned on bringing him on I'd have reversed his and Fellaini's substitutions. to me Fellaini is exactly the player you throw on when it's time for last ditch attempts tossing balls into the box, Mata needs to play his way into the match.

2010~~~
Aye, I was thinking the same, though after the game LVG complained that the cms had been lying too deep and not supporting the attack so I guess he thought Fellaini would address that problem.

2011~~~
The team had basically given up about 10 minutes before Mata even came on, we were practically running the clock down when he was introduced, pointless substitution, should have been half an hour sooner.

2012~~~
To me though it's his job to get the word on to his players to change what they are doing rather than make a sub. I mean Schweini and Schneiderlin surely weren't just ignoring what they were told and staying deep.

2013~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kVBgUMmZo68?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Aww

2014~~~
Need him on the ball as much as possible. He will create chances, simple.

2015~~~
Really he's a bigger problem than Rooney for me in this right hand side of attack. Usual Mata disclaimer # he's got great ability in and around the box and a talented player # but out on the right he's beyond dreadful.

2016~~~
Beyond dreadful is just wrong and a good example of the modern day reactions to performances. Yes, he isn't what he can be out there, far better suited to a central role but he has put in good productive performances out there. I don't see how he can be labelled dreadful just because he hasn't been what he can be. Especially when that is down to the managers selection and not him personally.

2017~~~
Eric I have been steady in my approach to Mata even when he went through a purple patch. 
He's wasted massively out on the right and hampers our attack when we try and build up. We have no attacking thrust from the right side due to him. When the ball is in and around the box and falls to him then his quality excels. 
I like Mata but in this position he is worse than dreadful in my opinion. Why your saying the modern day reaction is beyond me as I'd have had the same opinion twenty years ago. The same reaction actually I had with Fletcher 10 years ago playing right wing a complete waste of time. And Fletch was quality for us at centre mid.

2018~~~
The term dreadful though, that's my issue. No doubting he is wasted on occasions out wide but he hasn't been dreadful. He is our most productive player. There is no way that a player who has been involved in as many goals as he has been from his position since he has been at the club can be described as dreadful.

He has been misused, sometimes ineffective but not dreadful. Dreadful is someone who loses the ball every time, misplaces every pass, misses every shot, always out of position etc. Those things do not describe Mata.

2019~~~
Nope but someone who stops every attack up the wing or someone who cuts back and kills the momentum allowing teams to get behind the ball is frustrating to watch. He for me is the elephant in the room, not Rooney.

2020~~~
Non existent in his preferred number 10 role.

2021~~~
Games bypassing him at the moment. Still, none of our attackers have done anything remotely impressive.

2022~~~
Average position they show at half time shows our beloved Wayne is playing deeper and more central than him for some reason.

2023~~~
I almost forgot he was on the pitch.  Amazing how we have spent so much but still have as big of a clear out required as before...

2024~~~
Is he playing?

2025~~~
One of his defenders to come along and say 'It's not his fault nobody is making runs' in 3... 2... 1...

2026~~~
Completely invisible. Mourinho was right

2027~~~
It doesn't matter if he's been bad. He will be moved to the right, and after a few poor performances people will be moaning about van Gaal not playing him in number 10 ("his best") position. He will play shit in there and will be moved back to the wing.
Rinse and repeat.

2028~~~
Always useless in this formation, surely one of him or Rooney have to come off if we have any chance of getting something from this game, martial is basically a one man attack at the moment.

2029~~~
Kagawa wasn't this invisible

2030~~~
His lack of pace and ability to win a physhical battle really kills things going forward.

2031~~~
Memory a bit like a sieve right there.

2032~~~
I don't think he and Rooney can play together in this team. Both players want too many touches and are incapable of beating a man.

2033~~~
At least he actually had some semblance of being able to do what he wanted to with the ball this half. Should be giving us more, but he's definitely been the least bad of the forward players.

2034~~~
This. Mata hasn't ever done well at #10 for us.

2035~~~
I'm a little bit confused with regards to where he and Rooney are playing. Are they stepping on each other's shoes? 

When he's got on the ball, he's done decently, I think.

2036~~~
Maybe, but he's been involved sparingly. Needs to have a bigger influence

2037~~~
He is penalty area player, whenever he receives the ball deeper or out wide his lack of tempo is a total hindrance to him creating anything, he is at his best when he gets the ball in or around the penalty area where he can make something happen with only one or two touches.

2038~~~
They are both second strikers IMO so it's not really surprising. Should not be playing together.

2039~~~
Invisible for 90% of the game.

2040~~~
Pointless player has touches of brilliance but for 85 mins of the game an utter passenger. The quicker we get a replacement for him the better.

2041~~~
I'm usually the first to defend him, but he was utterly anonymous today. Assumed he'd been taken off in the later stages, before then recalling that it was Rooney who we took off for Depay.

He does have spells like this occasionally. Hopefully he'll get back to his scoring/assisting ways soon enough, because he's not been offering a lot in recent weeks.

2042~~~
<i>So clinical, </i>eh? More like so invisible.

2043~~~
He was a passenger today.

The Mata at Anfield is the Mata we need.

2044~~~
Big Mata fan but he is anonymous atm. Of course we also learned during the week that we aren't any better with him on the bench either.

2045~~~
Why was that? He was getting into space all right but he wasn't getting the ball. He's got Rooney ahead of him for the number 10 spot so he has to do what he can where he's told to play. Maybe Rooney needs a few games on the bench because when he went off, Mata actually started to play a bit.

2046~~~
He really needs replacing with someone who offers something extra. With the two central midfielders, we have too many other players that make it seem like we're lining up with 3 or 4 cms in that they don't commit anyone and keep possession. Carrick and Bastian, added to Mata and Rooney is too little dynamism in the front 6. When one of the other two is 'Not Neymar', then it's 5 of 6 that can't beat a manner produce any magic.

2047~~~
Oh Rooney definitely needs to be replaced, but it's not Rooney's fault for Mata performing poorly lately.

He just lets the game pass him by. He's too content with playing it safe(like most of our players).

2048~~~
Should be dropped not that it will make much of a difference mind. Everyone bar Martial is different shades of crap.

2049~~~
Requires a heck lot more time and space than his counterparts (Countinho, Silva, Ozil, Eriksen, Sanchez, Carzola) to turn and create. Not to mention his obvious lack of pace on the ball compared to some of them.

2050~~~
He is just so vanilla too often, did nothing of any real note but was tidy enough in what he did.

2051~~~
Today you saw why playing him in the centre doesn't help either. He is completely lost there and gets bullied

2052~~~
Toilet, absolute toilet!

And has been for a while.

2053~~~
Can't remember him doing too much today. Not that he was bad, and I wouldn't blame him at all. Him, Carrick and Schweinsteiger got the ball to our wide players on numerous occasions in 1 v 1 situations. Darmian and Young just have an absolutely woeful final ball and cross. If they could get that yard of space and put in good crosses consistently, what Mata/Schweiny/Carrick do before then would look so much more useful IMO.

2054~~~
It's always like this with Mata he is totally anonymous for 90% of the time, now and then he showes up with a moment of brilliance which results in a goal or a assist but he has never been nor will he never be a player who can dictate the play and have great influence on the game. He is like a offensive midfield poacher.

2055~~~
Even Martial isn't looking all that. Our attackers are not that bad, yet they are all underperforming. I think other managers could get a lot more out of our forwards. Seems like a systematic problem, as if we need elite players to look decent going forward.

2056~~~
Reckon he's nailed on to be sold next summer assuming LvG is still here, do like him though.

2057~~~
Lovely guy, delightful blog, utterly underwhelming player. The guy just doesn't have the strength of character to stamp his authority on a game. He's an adornment.

2058~~~
Mahrez looked like Iniesta by comparison today.

2059~~~
I'd like to criticise Mata, and Rooney, however, when all our forwards have slowly become completely useless, there's more to it.

2060~~~
Bit of an overreaction. Wasn't good by any means but certainly not the main problem either. Second half was quite decent.

2061~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIDBdV7i5Fw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2062~~~
Genuinely forgot he was playing. 

I don't remember him doing anything bad, I just don't remember him doing..well, anything?

2063~~~
Wasn't our worst player but it was unfortunate he didn't do more. He kept the ball well though, which LVG will like. The positioning of him and Rooney confused me though and I wasn't really sure who was playing where.

2064~~~
The fact that he was our best attacking player says a lot about our football.

2065~~~
Yeah I really struggle to blame any of our attackers apart from the wingers/wing backs. They get the ball in one on one situations all the time and their role is the same no matter the tactics. Take the man on, make a yard of space and pick out a man with a good cross or put dangerous crosses in. Our wingers, consistently over the last few years have failed to do that consistently and that's just on them, not the style. The rest are more culpable to the style I think.

2066~~~
He was useless, I hope he is moved on in the summer because he is too limited to be effective regularly. He has lots of ability but is too dependent on other players and having some time and space, when it works it's great but too often he is a passenger and offers virtually nothing.

2067~~~
Since LVG came in, have any of our forwards looked any good? Sure they've not all been top class players but they're not mid table standard players.

2068~~~
He was completely anonymous yesterday, I'm surprised he wasn't taken off because he offered absolutely nothing.

2069~~~
Mata is another enigma like Rooney as far as I'm concerned. Is he toothless because of the lack of movement and tempo around him, or is he a contributor to those problems? I'm leaning towards the latter option. He's so fecking slow and, for someone lauded as having fantastic technique, he needs two, three touches to get the ball under control.

2070~~~
Could say this about Memphis, Rooney, Mata, Young... It was applicable to di Maria, RvP, and Falcao, before them. LvG must have thought the same of Nani and Hernandez, too.

2071~~~
Pure bullshit.

2072~~~
People keep acting as if he has never played centrally for us.He has been underwhelming most of the time he played there that's why he was shifted to the right.He's a luxury player and we have to accept it or move him on.

2073~~~
It bloody well isn't.

He's not in the class of Silva, Cazorla, Ozil, etc.

2074~~~
What's that got to do with his control? He's got the best first touch in our team, and that, too, by quite a distance. Your statement of <b>"for someone lauded as having fantastic technique, he needs two, three touches to get the ball under control" </b>is pure garbage<b>.</b>

2075~~~
He has been at the club nearly 2 years and he is in his peak years. It's fair to conclude that what we have seen from Mata to date is pretty much as good as it gets. He may not be the most glaring of our many attacking problems but we still need an upgrade in the summer. He simply hasn't done enough to warrant a third season here as a senior player.

2076~~~
That's the biggest backhanded compliment I've heard in ages.

Mata is weak, slow and nowhere near enough risky with his passing.

He's a squad level player.

2077~~~
Oh, I wonder why?

Just add him to list of players who've lost all ability under the Messiah.

2078~~~
Ha, I knew you'd say that.

Mata's been pretty consistent since he's arrived here, including under Moyes.

Funnily enough, his best run of form came under Van Gaal last Spring.

2079~~~
That's quite shocking, actually. Footballer manages to play well under one of his two managers.

2080~~~
You originally tried to imply that Mata is inhibited by Van Gaal, yet his best sustained runs of form in the last three years have come under... Van Gaal.

2081~~~
What utter shite that is.

2082~~~
How can I argue with that?

2083~~~
The Mata of United has been nothing compared to the one of Chelsea. 

As for playing at his best for three years, how hard was that to achieve?

The first half of 13/14, Mourinho never played him.
The second half of 13/14, Moyes was his manager.

How hard is it to better the achievements of the aforementioned season?

2084~~~
Totally agree.

So what can we do to get that Mata back?

Sorry, but the current version is a squad player at best.

2085~~~
He's been awful lately but he's never been consistent for us. Remember how awesome he was a month or 3 ago, he'll be back.

2086~~~
Given his lack of pace and acceleration, you're not going to see the best of him while the forward unit is currently so impotent. He's not going to beat men on his own, he's a playmaker and that usually involves a midfield that does its job as a unit (Carrick was a nightmare yesterday) and has runners or at least forwards finding space (which never happened either).

He's definitely not playing well and it's frustrating to see him going 'missing' but his technical game was impeccable as usual. You can have hope with players like Mata unlike others in the squad.

Could have scored yesterday if Rooney wasn't so fecking awful.

2087~~~
I don't actually disagree with this post. He's been a shadow of the player we want and need. However, I, initially, disagreed with your statement regarding his first touch, which has always been brilliant.

2088~~~
It's not so much that he needs three touches to get the ball under control, but rather that he takes multiple touches before making a pass. He's not as quick at recycling the ball as his peers, in my opinion, nor is he as good in tight spaces and under pressure.

2089~~~
He's just really <i>not</i> <i>that good. </i>Like, seriously. How many more matches of sheer anonymity will it take for people accept this?

2090~~~
I don't think he's very good. He can be an effective player in the right system but he plays way to slow and he passes too safe.

2091~~~
To be honest, who's good at doing what you say? Everyone is guilty of moving the ball around slow, just as they are at being so static. The lack of movement in our team is shocking to see, especially, how this was thought to be the basis of our philosophy.

2092~~~
2 years ago he was the most creative player in the league, now he never tries a through ball. Philosophy.

2093~~~
Yeah, hyperbole just like that is the reason people will never accept it, I guess.

2094~~~
Two years ago he was sat on Chelsea's bench. We were suckered into paying top dollar for a player who's level is Europa league/Champions League group stage makeweights.

2095~~~
He is far from great but he is pretty much our best player this year excluding defence, and maybe Martial(who is inconsistent himself). Still our highest scorer in PL, and has the most assists. Most productive in CL too.

2096~~~
He needs runners. This formation doesn't suit him at all.

2097~~~
We seem to collect players who can only perform under specific conditions. I don't think he's good enough to build our attack around so we should move him on if he can't adapt.

2098~~~
We should sign Usain Bolt then. Clearly none of Depay, Lingard and Martial are quick enough for him.

2099~~~
He should be following Rooney out the door in the summer, we need to fill our forward line with pace and power.

2100~~~
Just like he was last season too, although bizarrely Ashley 'huff and puff and blindly cross to no one' Young was given more praise. 

He needs to get involved more, but when he is on the ball he looks like he has the quality to hurt teams. I don't feel that with Rooney at the minute.

For the time being I'd stick Depay up top, Mata behind him, Lingard on the right and Martial on the left. I don't think they'd blow teams away, but it removes Rooney who hinders Mata and the team.

2101~~~
I think it's obvious we need quick transitions to make the use of it, he had that at Chelsea where they defended deep and countered at pace. He's never going to dribble passed a player and sling a good cross in, but he will make a through ball or a good decision when passing at speed. 

Those players you've listed are clearly quick enough, but they need room to run into. When we play the slow tempo passing game it gives them limited room, so their pace is nullified mainly.

2102~~~
I still think he can be very good/great, but I am getting sick of how he is playing these days (whether it's his fault, LVG's system, relationship issues with Herrera or whatever, I don't really care.) The constant looks forward before playing the safe pass back is driving me crazy. I love the man (some might unhealthily so,) but it's time to start making a difference again, as he did in that brief team purple patch last spring, or else bring in someone who can provide a more consistent threat from the wing (I don't think Lingard is that player.) I also think that if we bring in a match-winning winger, like Robben, then Mata could once again flourish in the middle.

2103~~~
Am I the only one who doesn't see anything in Mata? I know he's capable of fantastic football when in absolutely bang on form but whenever he's even a little bit off the pace he's just a nothing player. Very little desire, pace, strength, passing is unadventurous...sure he's a lovely lad but we don't need more of them, we need ones who'll run around kicking people sometimes like Herrera and who would drag themselves through broken glass to get the win.

2104~~~
Irrespective of whether he'd be better with that, and I'd suggest that every player that isn't quick would like that, he was still having a very good season prior to the last few weeks without these rapid runners around him. His form seems to be falling off a cliff at the moment. Not sure what is wrong but his all round game, involvement in our buildup and goal threat have all massively declined.

2105~~~
Classic Redcafe. When he plays good everyone is screaming his praises and when he is terrible people think he is average and start questioning his class. Honestly I really would love for Mata to leave so that people can see how pathetic they look when they question him.

2106~~~
Maybe because that is our whole gameplay when it comes to midfield??

2107~~~

2108~~~
He's been a complete passager today yet again.

2109~~~
More of a liability in our front four, more so than Fellaini. At least the lump has some uses for far post crosses.

2110~~~
He is basically a technically refined Wayne Rooney. . Shite.

2111~~~
It's a pain to see how he slow us down all the fecking time. He's the problem in this team.

2112~~~
He's A problem in this team. Theres basically 4 players who have done themselves credit this season the rest have been garbage. He certainly doesnt work with our current personel thats for sure.

He will improve when the quality of the rest of the attacking personnel improves.

2113~~~
Pace is everything in the modern game, there's no place for him here.

2114~~~
Luxury player. Let him go

2115~~~
True. Should write it as one of many problems in this team. LvG the biggest.

2116~~~
Hope people are starting to notice how much of a passenger he is. He's awful a 5 a side player at best. Yes he scores nice goals but overall what he contributes in 90 mins is us having 10 men.

2117~~~
Seems like he goes through cycles. He goes through a period where he looks brilliant, constantly winning games for us. Then he goes through a period where he's completely invisible and can't do anything right.

2118~~~
Surely he needs to play as a 10? Cracking player and a nice guy but a luxury player nonetheless

2119~~~
He's out of form. But its no coincidence his loss of form is coinciding with us not doing anything. At the start of the season when he was racking up goals and getting involved so were the team.

2120~~~
1/10 performance.

2121~~~
Looks lost with the players around him (some poor, some not doing what they're supposed to do) and the system.

2122~~~
I love the guy, and rate his ability, but theres no denying he has struggled to find a rhythm at united. isn't having anywhere near the impact i'd expect of someone of his proven quality.

2123~~~
His inaccurate passing has been surprising. Maybe it just seems that way, but he's botched a lot of passes that could've been more dangerous if they were more precise.

2124~~~
Lethargic more like

2125~~~
Our most overrated player by far.

2126~~~
He's been poor most of the season. Either play him centrally or not at all.

2127~~~
He has been woeful, but I'm amazed how often him and Lingard had to come deep in the game.We didn't have enough players to attack in many occasions.

2128~~~
I never understood why people were oblivious to this side of of game. He destroys more attacking football done he creates. He has nothing to do with the movements of the attackers. He frustrated Chelsea and he has always frustrated me. What position can he really play? He is a sub at best in any of the top clubs.

2129~~~
Shit passing today and poor decision making overall. Very disappointed by him.

I'm sure you have this break in the second half where a poor weight on the ball completely killed off the counter. That sort of passes is what separates the real playmakers from the ones who aren't so good at it.

2130~~~
Like Fellaini he was not a good acquisition by Moyes. He doesn't get enough scrutiny because he is a nice guy.

2131~~~
Dreadful signing, we need better.

2132~~~
Horrific performance from him today, he just doesn't get involved in games enough.

2133~~~
He was a lot more involved today than usual, but for all the wrong reasons.

His passing was terrible. Either playing passes too early or too late. Most notably in the second half, when he played a pass out right to Lingard that killed our counter attack completely. A more composed head and he puts Lingard straight through to the goalkeeper.

That he needs to play centrally to play well is simply nonsense. He had license to roam all afternoon.

2134~~~
Looks like I'm the only one who thought he was decent today...

2135~~~
The invisible man.

2136~~~
Indeed. He's a squad player at best. He's as slow as a tortoise and really has very little impact on a game. We were robbed of £37.1 million. At least the forum seems to be coming around to the fact he's really nothing special.

2137~~~
Dog shite. Slowed us down more than anyone else on the pitch today.

2138~~~
He was so slow today, not just playing wise i mean in his decision making. And his passing/finishing was way off today too.

Really bad day.

2139~~~
He plays in slow motion. Awful to watch at times.

2140~~~
Disappeared off the face of the earth since October.

2141~~~
Is he the weakest player in the league in terms of body strength?

2142~~~
I can't remember the last UTD player to infuriate me as much as he does, he's so far from what I expect of a top UTD player it is unreal. Genuinely would be delighted if he never played for us again.

2143~~~
When the ball reaches him it's almost certain that he'll delay things long enough for the opposition to regain their defensive shape, he's mind numbingly sluggish.

2144~~~
Far from the player he was at Chelsea.

2145~~~
He's turned into Wayne Rooney. You have 19 and 22 year olds driving us forwards while our so called stars keep giving us nothing. He was actually having a good season but over the month or so he's been completlrt pointless.

2146~~~
I think he might just be. And it's strange because while he's never been the strongest, I remember him always giving us a torrid time and us struggling to get near him/the ball off him. I just don't remember him as timid as this. I thought he had more fire in the belly.

2147~~~
Yep not his fault.... He's in there to be the creative force yet he plays 5 yard passes to fellaini and runs forward.

2148~~~
Yes, but his time at Chelsea was overrated too.

2149~~~
Very dissapointing in recent weeks at a time when we needed him to step up.

Not sure what to expect of him any more. Is he capable of match winning quality?

2150~~~
Completely invisible until he moved into the middle, at which point he became decent... Too little too late though

2151~~~
He needs replacing. Sick and tired of him playing wide. It's doing my head in.

Nice guy, but we can't have a player that goes invisible so often in games.

2152~~~
Every time he's been played through the middle from the start he plays even worse than he does out wide. He really isn't good enough to be one of our main attacking players.

2153~~~
Playing poorly in a side that's playing poorly generally.

Disappointed he isn't playing well but in a way I'm more disappointed that he seems to have lost his usual ability to produce goals/assists even when in poor form. 

It's easy to live with his indifferent form when he's still our most productive player but if he's not producing....

2154~~~
Too limited to be effective week in week out.

2155~~~
In what way?

2156~~~
In the obvious way - he wasn't, and isn't anywhere near as good as the general perception.

2157~~~
That's Herrera.

Mata was poor today though, no doubt.

2158~~~
In the way that he wasn't really as good as people made him out to be, particularly on here. Always is the case with certain opposition players - you notice their good performances but don't notice when they are anonymous. When they play for the team you support however, you do notice.

2159~~~
Yes.

2160~~~
I wish our manager e overrated Herrera.

2161~~~
Apart from the Chelsea fans presumably given they thought he was great?

2162~~~
They fluked the CL but the team that was built around him finished 6th.

He's not a great player.

2163~~~
I agree that Herrera is overrated to and much for the same reason as Mata, they are really nice guys but I do think Herrera is good enough to start for us while Mata on the other hand isn't

2164~~~
I use to get frustrated and claim he would flourish in the middle but I'm not even sure about that now.

Has he always been so painfully slow and weak?

2165~~~
Yes. My favourite moment from last season was his two goals away to Liverpool. But it's too infrequent to be worthy of a first team place imo.

2166~~~
Mata just isn't suited out wide in a setup like ours where the RB is gobshite at attacking. He needs fast movers around him who can make runs that he can find with his passes. With most of our opponents playing deep within their own halves,  our wide players need to take people on and create a bit of time and space which he is completely unable to do. 

To make matters worse, he had the body strength of a grasshopper. He is so easily bullied off the ball that it it criminal at this level. I don't think it is working for him here at all.

2167~~~
He was telegraphing his passes something awful today. I could tell what he wanted to do about 2 or 3 touches before he did it. It made it really easy for West Ham to get into position.

2168~~~
When you saw that lovely early ball in from Herrera against Watford. The god help us he does his hammy. That is what is needed get the ball in early, Memphis anticipated it.

2169~~~
His Caf fanclub make more excuses for him than the English pundits make for Rooney.

2170~~~
Actually it looks like the tide has turned and more and more people are realising that he is part of the problem and not the solution.

2171~~~
There's still quite a few "It's the players around him letting him down" and "it's the position/tactics/systems fault" posts floating around.

2172~~~
I wonder if he's ever been to a gym.

2173~~~
poor today

2174~~~
Seems like you're applying selective criteria. Suarez had a team built around him at Liverpool (for what it's worth, that always strikes me as a dodgy expression, but whatever...) So was he not great? I do agree that Mata has been very underwhelming this year; less so last year and during his half season with Moyes. But then he's hardly alone in that regard.

2175~~~
He takes far too many touches at times. He's one of the reasons we're so slow in the final third.

2176~~~
About time folk are waking up he's a passenger and has been since he came here. Stats tell a different story of course but I watch him week in week out and for 80-85 mins he does nothing but slow us down.

2177~~~
There's no excuse for his current form, he's been extremely poor in recent weeks and that's totally on him. 

Saying he's been like this since he arrived is simply untrue though. He has his faults but he isn't usually <i>this</i> anonymous. Even during previous indifferent spells he at least kept producing a high level of end product but goals and assists have totally dried up. He's unusually poor right now.

2178~~~
I totally agree now and then he turns up with a moment of brilliance but for 95% of the time he has absolutely no influence on the game.

2179~~~
And rest of us are doing what exactly, closing eyes when he's on the ball?

2180~~~
He's a penalty taker and that is all at the moment. He looks unhappy, maybe he knows he shouldn't be out wide and knows his place could be in danger if we bring another RW in.

2181~~~
My point was that a team that Mata was the fulcrum of, actually were quite poor in the league, though they did fluke the CL.

He has never proven that he's good enough to be the main man in a title winning or even challenging team.

2182~~~
Thing is, we're shit and slow when he's in the team, and we're shit and slow when he's out of the team.

So thus, the conclusion is, we're shit and slow... full stop.

2183~~~
like other players he would benefit from better more fluid movement from other players, he need runners, to give and go, he needs someone better then mcnair as fullback.. thats not an excuse for him though, he should do much better, he deserves to start on the bench next game, with depay coming on for him... people try to slate lingard how low potential he has but forget that we live not in the past just now and recently Lingard looked better and much more influential player than Mata, who should still be at his peak..

2184~~~
Hasn't really justified, or lived up to that £37m price tag. Between him, AdM, Fellaini, we've pissed massive money down the drain for various reasons. You might even add in Herrera.

We bought all these players, quality in their own right, without any real plan on how to use them or get the best out of them. Then what happens? They're either in/out of the team, shifted across positions etc. (AdM shitty attitude aside).

2185~~~
At the same time, we tried benching him for our last CL game and ended up putting in one of our worst performances all season. If Depay and Lingard are the answer then the question kinda sucks.

2186~~~
And so is he?

2187~~~
Obviously not, he's a good footballer when he can be arsed... which, like everyone else in our side, was only about 20/30 minutes today.

It's just hilarious that people blame any one particular individual in our team for the slow, shit football we play (yes, I'm even defending Rooney here) despite the fact that, whoever the personnel, whatever the lineup... it doesn't feckin' matter! We still play exactly the same slow, turgid football. I mean, Mata didn't start against PSV and that was probably our slowest and worst performance in this boring run.

2188~~~
Mata and Herrera didn't start in the cup, two of his penalty takers and they didn't play. A trophy chance gone.

2189~~~
It's not just him that slow and shit, I agree, but he certainly is slow and appears shit too judging by the majority of his utd career.

Amazing how people try to absolve the players of responsibility for their performances. It's not either tactics or players to blame, it can be both, and more than likely is. In the Mata thread you'll find criticisms against Mata - show me where people are trying to put <i>sole </i>responsibility for our performances on him?

2190~~~
No one's putting sole responsibility on him - but on this page alone you have people saying "he slows down our attack"... which is ridiculous, because our attack is slow, with or without him.

I'm not absolving the players either... they're playing shit... but they're doing so within a shit strategy.

2191~~~
That is the manager then. He says he wants the ball moving quicker, these are not idiots, so is he actually saying that to them or drumming into them not to give the ball away. They are all playing with fear and look completely devoid of confidence and downright fed up. This is a fabulous job to be in, but it has stopped being fun.

2192~~~
The criticism is more applicable to him than others though, you certainly can't say that Martial, Lingard or Herrera slow down our attacks as much as he does.

What makes it worse is that he's supposed to be one if iur main players, apparently 'world class' when we bought him and at his peak.

2193~~~
They're all guilty of it though (Martial to a lesser extent in fairness) ... the dreaded check back and sideways/backwards pass. I mean there was a point today where Lingard raced away from one defender, then slowed down so another one could catch and face him up - and our entire attack just stalled. The criticism is applicable to our entire side... more so Mata then others? Yeah, you can argue that ... but then it doesn't explain how our slowest, most insipid attacking performance of the season came against PSV, and he wasn't even on the pitch! It's a problem that extends further then just a few players... it's how we currently play football.

I repeat though, I'm not absolving Mata at all, he has been shit of late and needs to step up. You can tell too, because he normally always tries to get on the ball as much as possible, and he hasn't been doing that of late (he did in that last 20/30, where the team as a whole stepped-up ... but it wasn't enough)

2194~~~
Quality player that wouldn't look out of place in Bayern, real or Barca....

2195~~~
I do understand, and agree with your point. I think these issues are mentioned in relation to Mata more than others because we expect more from him than some of the others, with them being either young or new to the squad. Only people that deserves more criticism than him are Rooney and the manager IMO, and they certainly get enough on here (Rooney not so much off here).

2196~~~
I think he is only effective at 10 where you can put quick players ahead and wide of him 

When you have no great passing options you can look dithering - today was a poor game 

I can't understand why we have him on the right at the expense of Fellaini at 10

2197~~~
I think the manager is responsible for that. They are all capable of moving the ball quickly. We know Herrera like to pass and move to create a pass. Yet I think the manager is boring them to death and has put the fear of god into them. Mata looks like he is losing faith in the manager. You have to fill your players with confidence before a game, I am not sure he does that. Funny enough listening now to Terry Gibson on Talksport and they move say Herrera is woefully underused. Gibson has seen him in Spain for both Bilbao and Zaragoza and says there is a very good player there.

2198~~~
Yeah I think that's fair, and completely justified.

2199~~~
He wouldn't make many starts for any of those teams over a season.

2200~~~
Just another one of van Gaal's achievements. We're a machine when it comes to ruining attackers. Just add him to the ever growing list.

2201~~~
Just look back at the forum the previous posts  over the last few months and you'd see the vast majority were defending him. So as you speak for everyone I guess so...

2202~~~
Hard to argue with as post is correct

2203~~~
Agree, except for Fellaini and maybe Herrera. I wouldn't call Fellaini quality and Herrera has mostly been very good whenever he played. You could add Memphis, Morgan and Martial in a few months' time if van Gaal was still here, though..

2204~~~
He really needed to step-up and be the main man in attack but he was really poor. Just a nothing game from him and even his usual tidy passing was a bit wayward. Should be out of the team at the moment.

Also, it doesn't matter if he is out wide, floating around or in the middle - he has been poor.

2205~~~
Not anymore than if Mata is the answer though.He has been the poorest even though he's the only senior player out of them,stop making excuses.

2206~~~
Gotta love the caf, it wasn't only 2 months ago people were singing him praises and now he's shite. He's out of form and so is the whole team.

2207~~~
He probably wouldn't look out of place at Real, because they're a bit of a mess and a mish-mash.

He'd look out of place at Barcelona, because he can't dribble past anyone, can't turn with the ball under pressure, can't keep hold of the ball, doesn't have quick feet. So he'd struggle to play the football that Barcelona play in tight areas, under serious pressure.
He'd immediately weaken the team, because he'd need extra touches, would run backwards/sideways whenever closed down, and would play too safe to occupy one of the forward positions.

Same for Bayern. He's not that good a player. Tidy, can take a set piece and can finish a move off when near the goal, but every thing in between is below 'quality'. He's ridiculously limited as soon as opposition players close him down.

He's suited to a team who don't dominate possession, because there's more space. He needs that space because he's poor at dribbling, turning and holding the ball. Countering allows him to be effective without being closed down heavily.

Think about the 'quality' players over the years - they don't need space. Mata's not quality.

2208~~~
Some have been saying this stuff for ages. I guess other people are just catching on.

2209~~~
I'm not making excuses, he's been poor and that's on him. That doesn't automatically mean benching him is going to make things better though, especially when the last game he was benched in was probably the worst I've seen us play all season. There's a reason he plays so much for us, the alternatives we have aren't good enough.

2210~~~
Yeah Mata was amazing before 14/15.

2211~~~
Aye man, it's frustrating as hell. It's a massive part of the reason our post SAF "transition" is taking so long. We've simply put, got an alarming number of expensive signings "wrong".

2212~~~
I felt he played a hell of a lot better when moved to #10 and so did we as a team. Keep him there and put Morgan and Herrera behind him. It's got to be the way forward.

DM: Morgan, Goss
CM: Herrera, Pereira 
AM: Mata, Januzaj

+ Bastian to add experience.
Get rid of Fellaini and add Carrick to coaching staff.

2213~~~
The whole video pretty much shows how slow Mata makes every move he gets involved in, and how much he lacks the ability to turn or keep the ball under pressure.

But 2:58 sums up why Mata's not a top player, why he wouldn't get into Barcelona/Bayern's team (which some bizarrely claim) and why it's not 'lack of runners' that are the issue, but his own deficiencies.

The second he allowed himself to get closed down, there was never ANY chance of him going forward with the ball or even keeping hold of it. You don't say that about top number 10s or players in that mould - whether it's Coutinho, Iniesta, Silva, Isco...

And it happens all the time with Mata. Which is why many feel he adds absolutely nothing unless he's scoring.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTFdCdu40oM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

The fact that Mata is basically restricted to giving the ball up before he gets closed down - that's what makes him not a top player, or worthy of building around. He can be hurried off the ball, and made to play safe.
He basically stations himself in completely non-threatening positions (in order to escape being closed down) then takes a few touches, either passes it simple, or gets closed down and passes it sideways or backwards. He rarely ever adds any zip or creativity to a move.

Rinse and repeat until he scores a goal or assists, and he escapes criticism.

2214~~~
Had his best half in two months.

2215~~~
Miles better today.

2216~~~
Better today, need to get him on the ball more as he looks the most likely to create anything.

2217~~~
Played well. Nice little pass for the goal, and looking quite dangerous in general. Him and Martial have been our best players.

2218~~~
Great pass for the goal but still most of the half he has been a passenger, in his defense though he is getting absolutely no help from our incompetent midfield.

2219~~~
Yeah, he's been a lot better than usual. Still nothing great, but he's far from the worst performer tonight.

2220~~~
Looking a lot better in the central area than he did the last time he played there, definitely that we need to have a look at keeping it going even with Rooney back. 

The offside was stupid though.

2221~~~
Seriously, what have you been watching. A few of my hairs turned gray reading that.

2222~~~
Such a talent, just let down by a lack of pace and poor stamina

2223~~~
When we improve our squad further, he shouldn't be first choice.

2224~~~
Very good today.

2225~~~
I thought he was very good, there was no way he should have been brought off.

2226~~~
Was one of our two best players while he was on the pitch, taking him off for Powell of all people was very, very strange.

2227~~~
Baffled me that we took him off, especially with Fellaini being left on. He looked good in the first half, and his assist for the goal was decent. A positive improvement though, so hopefully he can start to make more of an impact on games and return to his early season form.

2228~~~
He played his part. Not much more others offered around him.

2229~~~
Didn't think he was good at all today.

Bringing Powell on was odd though

2230~~~
Standards/expectations are pretty low for Mata, it seems.

2231~~~
Our best player alongside Blind today.

2232~~~
Was ok in the first half but second half performance was just same old shit from him.

2233~~~
Very good first half but became sloppy in the second and drifted out if it. Possibly tired.

2234~~~
Not his biggest fan but that sub was weird.Would have put Pereira on if we wanted to sub him.

2235~~~
Faded in the second half so I could see bringing him off, but why not Pereria on? Very odd.

2236~~~
Not sure the 'faded in the second half' commentators were watching the same game as me. Thought the 10-15 minutes before he went off are some of his best in a United shirt and everything good we were doing was going through him.

One of the weirdest subs I can remember.

2237~~~
Why the feck was he take off ?

Bewildering by LVG. He was miles better than either Depay or Lingard.

2238~~~
I've been quite critical of Mata all season and am dubious about the 'needs to play #10' talk but he was key to most of our good moves today and showed some nice flashes when under pressure. Had to come deep a little too often but we seemed to have left the midfield pretty vacant most of the time so it is understandable. Nothing miraculous but he did have a positive and reasonably constant impact on our forward play.

2239~~~
Was good in the first-half. I thought he wasn't as good in the second but should have stayed on. Why it was Powell who came on for him I will never know.

2240~~~
Absolutely stupid of us to sub him off today, especially for Nick Powell of all people. We were controlling the game in the second half while Mata was on the pitch, but after Powell came on, we lost a bit of that control in Wolfsburg's half.

2241~~~
I thought he was great but he looked completely knackered when he came off.

2242~~~
He looked up for it like the rest of our players. Not our day.

2243~~~
Played well at number 10 today but that could also be because Wolfsburg wernt playing as deep as our other opponents.

He done plenty of chasing of their CBs which would explain why he was knackered.

2244~~~
Hearing noise that perhaps he was injured, anything in that ?

2245~~~
Subbing him off last night was easily van Gaal's worst sub during his time here, and he has at least one awful substition every game, which is telling a lot. Subbing our best player on the pitch, and best scorer of this team for a player who didn't play competitive game in 16 months and was never good enough to begin with, in our biggest game of the season for any other reason apart from injury is seriously idiotic on every level, and he deserves criticism for that even if we won the game.

Btw, he was excellent yesterday, did everything everyone here expects our number ten to do, it was probably best game by our number ten in a while. Third most touches in the team(even though he finished the game 20 minutes earlier than others), most key passes, great assist, controlled the midfield at times, kept the ball very well, and all that ahead of midfield which was far from great. The amount of times he had to track back because Fellaini stayed forward was criminal, I almost felt sorry for him, and he still managed to play very well and be active with the ball despite doing awful lot of defensive work.

2246~~~
He is crap today, everything he has been doing has been backwards/negative.

2247~~~
Been worst player on the park by a distance today probably. 

Gets pushed off like every fecking time.

2248~~~
Our worst player in the first half.

2249~~~
Need to really step Up for a change

2250~~~
I thought his touch, awareness and close control would make him stand out in that congested part of the pitch but he just gets pushed off the ball like a little boy.

2251~~~
He's being a coward today. Should be showing an example to the kids, but he doesn't want the ball. Really disappointing. 

Man up Juan.

2252~~~
Would consider taking him off for Powell/Young seriously this time.

2253~~~
Not just today, cant remember him having a really good game for quite some time now.

2254~~~
Very negative today. Looses the ball a bit too often too.

2255~~~
Mixed day so far but still would have him in that position behind Martial over any other player we have, every day of the week.

2256~~~
Too afraid to step up.

2257~~~
Ander Herrera for me.

Unlike Mata, Herrera doesnt get bullied.

2258~~~
Look at the state of the side and he's still probably been the worst player on the field.

2259~~~
His arse must weigh a ton by the looks of how he turns and runs. 

Dawdling toilet

2260~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He has been completely anonymous, innit?

2261~~~
Been awful for a couple of weeks now.

2262~~~
Think his last really good game was the CL game where he set up a goal with a first time flick from outside the box? Can't remember which game that was, only remember it cuz LVG seemed unimpressed when a reporter brought up how good he had been. Since then he's been very poor.

2263~~~
He seems to be alright in the first half, only to go completely missing in the second half every week now.

2264~~~
The Spanish Peter Brady, one of the worst big signings I've seen. Total luxury we cannot afford.

2265~~~
Ander Herrera would not have lasted this long in the game if he was playing.

2266~~~
Take down his blog

2267~~~
Garbage. Where the feck is Herrera? Can't have him back soon enough.

2268~~~
Same old. He never dictates a game. He's not good enough. We never should of signed him. Also, most of this forum is faster than him.

2269~~~
Honestly, try to mention one sequence of play you remember he did in the first half.

2270~~~
I thought he got on the ball a few times and tried to play the wide fellas in once or twice. It's hard to remember precise examples because that second half took about 3 weeks I think.

He wasn't brilliant but I saw him a few times as opposed to the second half where he was totally anonymous.

2271~~~
That moment where he passed it back to Blind? Sumptuous<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2272~~~
It amazes me that people <i>still </i>want to make him a key component (as a 10, no less) when he basically has to surrender possession of the ball <i>as soon</i> as he's closed down. Every time.

2273~~~
The only positive contribution he made the entire 90 minutes was the 1-2 with Memphis. So ineffectual.

2274~~~
Totally invisible whenever we need him to step up. Apart from the Liverpool game i can't remember any notable contribution in 2 years.

Also i thought Kagawa was the weakest player i'd ever seen in a United shirt but Mata wins it hands down. The slightest physical pressure on him and the ball is yours.

2275~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Succinctly put, this is where top players are supposed to step up and lead the younger ones.

2276~~~
It's true though. Dawdle fecking duck. But it's OK because he puts hugs at the end of his blogs <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Prefer if he spent more time perfecting his game than writing stupid blogs

2277~~~
This is a great point i never really considered before. All the top no.10's other than ozil, like Isco, silva, even erikson, have the ability to protect the ball in dangerous areas to wait for the right run to then unleash a penetrating pass.

With mata, if there isn't a runner STRAIGHT AWAY when he receives a pass and turns, he has to play it back to safety, even on a counter attack, because he is too easy to rob of possession.

2278~~~
How did he stay on the pitch? Was anonymous and let us down, badly.

2279~~~
His next assist or goal, watch the u-turn in this thread. It's as predictable as our football how our fans react to Mata's performances.

Either fantastic and misused or the worst signing in the clubs history.

I still love you Juan. Hugs.

2280~~~
His classic "pass it sideways/backwards and jog a few yards forward" move is extremely frustrating.

I hope Pereira gets more chances now, he seems to be much more of a number 10 than Mata.

2281~~~
There's nothing new about that performance that we didn't know.It just like lottery (with obviously higher successful rate) with Mata.On the right day he'll score/assist or when the opponent leaves him with enough space he'll look influential.Else, it's like playing with 10 men with an extra body to pass the ball.

2282~~~
Mata needs to play behind a target-man striker with a deep-lying playmaker in CM behind him (ala Alonso).

2283~~~
Prime Schweinsteiger would be perfect for such a role.

2284~~~
Start of the season, I said that this will be Mata's final season here. He's lucky he has played on the Right before and is left footed.

2285~~~
No pace, no strength. Other than that a cracking player, who's being forced to play out of position in a system which doesn't suit him.

2286~~~
Really struggling isn't he. Needs Herrera in the team badly. Always seems to improve with him around.

2287~~~
Start of the season my prediction for Juan was to give De Gea a run for the best player award. Unfortunately his performances have declined with the team. He hasn't the strength to lead the team but remains a supporting player. Herrera and Tony V have been playing during his best performances; and its no coincidence that his decline has followed their absences. I think but for the injuries he would be benched on his present form.

2288~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Doesn't it sound, word for word, like a certain someone who was played even more erratically than Juan is? I've always said that it's our approach that doesn't suit players like these.

2289~~~
Did he play the pass for Smalling's chance right at the end? If not then he offered very little today for a playmaker.

2290~~~
Nightmare today. Passing atrocious.

2291~~~
Nope. That was Blind. 

Once again ineffectual. No shock.

2292~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
The players couldn't even win for him today. Mourinho is coming to chuck him out.

2293~~~
He must be shitting himself

2294~~~
It was definitely Mata

2295~~~
Spineless, weak little shit. Can't wait to see the back of him.

2296~~~
Indeed it was. My bad.

2297~~~
He's been embarrassing for a while.

Something is very wrong, Juan hasn't been this poor for this length of time for us before I reckon. Something has "spooked" him.

2300~~~
Worst 30m+ transfer since pool bought Carroll.

2301~~~
back in the number ten role and shit yet again..

2302~~~
"Runners and movement..."

2303~~~
Poor lad, plays shit football and now possibly Mourinho coming in <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Valencia or Atletico could save him with a cheeky January bid

2304~~~
better then "he is shit...."

2305~~~
He's not 'shit' (I don't think anyone's actually said that...) 
He's just not great, and not worthy of building a serious team around.

2306~~~
Not good enough for Atletico. And definitely not aggressive/physical enough.
Valencia's more his level.

2307~~~
This is the thing, even if we get a new manager in, he will be stuck with Mata and Rooney as his two most senior attacking players, and they are dreadful!

I don't think I have ever thought less of a man utd player than I do of Mata, such a waste of money and possibly one of the most overated players to ever put on out shirt.

2308~~~
And that's only because they look content to be around 5-7th in La Liga.

2309~~~
Mata is, Martial aside, literally the least of our worries up front.

2310~~~
Nowhere near good enough. Doubt Neville would want him replicating his utd performances for Valencia either. He might do well for a top team in Turkey or Russia maybe.

2311~~~
You're not wrong, but he is still a huge worry. I feel sorry for any manager that has to rely on him to deliver top level performances.

2312~~~
By default.

It's like having a crap car, with a few bits falling off. Mata's the windscreen wiper that doesn't work but occasionally gives about five random minutes. Not a <i>huge </i>worry compared to the rest. But not a help.

Guardiola, Mourinho, van Gaal... It doesn't matter - He's not up to scratch. Why does it matter if Rooney and Depay are worse?

Guardiola certainly doesn't use players as limited as Mata in a 10 position or wide position. His teams have been built on players on a different planet, technically.

2313~~~
through all the doom and gloom, so quite a funny comment in the matchday thread (cant remember who it's from) that Mata was playing like someone who knew Mourinho was coming if we lost.

2314~~~
But a worry nonetheless. The least of the most worrying is still a big worry that must be dealt with. He would easily be on his arse - bench or another side - with a good RW and #10 in the side.

2315~~~
Herrera needs to be playing where Mata is right now.

Scmidfield

New RW - Herrera - Memphis
Martial

2316~~~
I'm not trying to back van gaal anymore but i have to say,  he is a manager who loves balance.  Ever since shaw's injury we have been unbalanced on the left.  We have always been unbalanced on the right because if mata.  As i said at the start of the season; he will become a big problem.

2317~~~
He had Lingard, Martial and Depay vs Wartford and Wolfsburg and created the grand total of one goal

2318~~~
He might not be our biggest worry but in some ways he is the biggest disappointment. After all, we've already accepted that Rooney is crap, Depay and Martial are just kids and the rest aren't good enough. Mata should be our best player. Yet he's been awful in recent weeks. Worse still, he's been awful without producing anything either, which is particularly unusual from him. 

Of course the fact that our entire team (and particularly attack) is playing god awful football means it's unfair to expect him to actually be playing well atm but even still...

2319~~~
He played delightful pass through their whole defence for Rooney around 35-40th minute that was clear one one situation with the keeper(in the beggining it was actually) if Rooney once again wasn't the slowest player on the pitch, and that ridiculous long/thourgh pass for Smalling that was clear goalscoring chance too but Smalling messed it up. Before that he had pretty nice cross with his right leg for Smalling when he fouled their player(if it was bit softer or if Smalling was bit more to the left it would have been another clear goalscoring opportunity he created).

That's three pretty much clear goalscoring chances(two if you don't count) from top of my head he created all by himself for our other players, but of course people will forget it because we didn't score from it(not his fault). Also it's quite popular to hate him lately so it's tough to notice good thing he does on the pitch when you already made up your mind about his performance before the game has even started. 

Can't wait for competent manager who will hopefully make the best out of him because he is clearly better player than this.

2320~~~
Oh absolutely. He's definitely not playing well.

But I think thats all it is, poor form, in a system where he's stifled anyway, where no number 10 has been any good, and its a bit of a perfect storm.

He'd be one of the first I'd expect to improve under a new manager and if he doesn't then, I'd want him out. I think there's far more important things to address first than Mata.

2321~~~
So would pretty much any player in our squad apart from Smalling and de Gea. What a stupid argument.

2322~~~
Uhh... Who else is having this much time in the first team football without any drops due to <i>Vangle-ism</i> or injuries and still underperforming to this extent? Nobody. Juan Mata just is not very good. I don't know why people still won't accept this.

2323~~~
Mata will be the one player hoping it's not Mourinho!

2324~~~
It's very clear that a change of manager won't be the solution to all our problems, half of our attacking players needs to be replaced and that includes Mata.

2325~~~
An imposter of a player can't wait to see the back of him at United. Never a United player an abundance of quality but can't run and has the heart the size of a pea!

2326~~~
I'm starting to disagree with the "he can't run" argument. He even skinned Olsson today and delivered a great cross with his right foot. He's a little apprehensive in his play style, but he's not nearly as slow as he's made out to be. He also runs a lot during games. He is much too easily shrugged off the ball though, and he doesn't impose himself enough, although this was an improvement. He made a couple of chances, should have had a free kick just outside the box and played a couple of nice one twos. I understand the frustration with him due to his price tag and the comparisons between him and Silva, but I still think he can be a decent option, but not as one of three at the front if only one of the other two can run and there are no overlapping fullbacks to create space. He is much, much, much better when Valencia plays - people really should start to notice how important Valencia is because of his physical presence and the width/space he creates.

2327~~~
I thought he worked harder than he has done lately. There was one bit of play where he even dribbled past someone! He didn't really create anything meaningful though, which is his primary job. I'm not ready to give up on him like a lot are, I thought there were some signs he was better.

2328~~~
He will always divide opinion because he doesn't have the power many fans want and because of that lack of speed and power, fans mistake that for not putting effort in but I thought he showed a great desire to win yesterday. Always wanted the ball, always trying to speed things up on and off the ball. You could tell he was hurting but overall, I thought he had a good game all things considering.

I'm torn now though, no secret of my love for Mata but I'm also in the bring Jose in camp. If that were to happen, Mata would likely be out the door which would break my heart but that's life.

2329~~~
Our best attacker after Martial?Bullshit.Memphis has contributed more recently.

I think he'll be better under different setup though.

2330~~~
Memphis <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

The guy on the wing?

2331~~~
Put it this way.Between taking out Memphis and taking out Mata from the team,I think the former will have more negative impact, judging by recent form.

I'm not suggesting that we should sell either of them though.Just that you can't call a cat a lion.

2332~~~
There's no disputing that Mata is a talented player and very likeable personality. He's capable of magical moments and silky touches. That said, at this point I think we've seen why Mourinho was happy to sell him (particularly at such a fee). His positive attributes simply don't outweigh his negative ones. He's not good enough to build a squad around. On a top club, he's a squad player, albeit a good one.

2333~~~
Christ <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2334~~~
Yep agree Mephis has got slightly better that doesn't say much about him but he is way better than Mata who is moving like an aged tortoise and playing these Tom Cleverley 5 yards backward and sideward passes.

2335~~~
Yet he has contributed twice as many league goals as Rooney this season. And about 5 times more assists in all compts. Can you imagine how bad Rooney has been? The worst striker in the league.

2336~~~
Forget Rooney I'm talking Mata he's absolutely shite and needs replaced. I'm not disagreeing with you about Rooney I just don't think Mata can hide behind him.

2337~~~
Mata has not been great by any means. However, I think that he is still our second best attacking player after Martial and it would be a mistake to sell him before getting rid of the rest. Of course, it would be good to sign a better player than him, it is even mandatory if we want to win big tropheys. But he isn't a big problem right now. Signing better players than Rooney, Memphis, Fellaini should be a priority.

2338~~~
We need new players but Mata has been donkey since signing bar the odd purple patch. He's simply not a United player in my opinion.

2339~~~
All the top sides dont have an important attacker thats as poor an athlete as Mata.

The top sides may have small players but they are at least quick or strong.

And what happened to his free kicks?

2340~~~
Silva is neither but is extremely useful.

2341~~~
Silva beats players for fun,  is a far superior passer, mentally more strong... more flair on the ball and has just enough speed to get past players and much better stamina.. he never looks short of breath.  Different class.

2342~~~
He has quick feet and can turn fast and is an excellent dribbler. Mata is useful in a team filled with pace and power but in this side he is useless besides the odd screamer which we havent even seen in months.

2343~~~
The stats indicate that Mata has directly contributed to more goals than any other United player since he signed. Silva, De Bruyne and Ozil are better, but he's still talented enough to have around.

2344~~~
Agreed.

2345~~~
You're basically describing Mata here.

2346~~~
I personally think Silva is quicker all around. Not to mention more creative and brave.

2347~~~
silva is much more mobile, Mata in the middle is pounced on straight away

2348~~~
I'm not so sure he'd be shown the door - I think Mourinho is a pragmatist, and it's not like we really have anyone better than Mata at present (perhaps Herrera, but that's up for debate.) Chelsea had Oscar when Mourinho arrived and Willian had just been bought. So unless we believe he'd prefer Lingard over Mata on the wing, I think he'd find a use for Mata. It might just be the kick up the ass our cuddly Spanish teddy bear needs.

2349~~~
Mata epitomizes the our present team : expensive, slow, lacking power and ultimately not good enough. if Jose comes in, it's goodbye Juan.

2350~~~
I'm not sure he will be out either - it will be much more difficult to find a fool to pay 30+ million for him this time.

2351~~~
Good analogy. Would love Jose so we see the back of Mata.

2352~~~
He was bad in general but was a true 10 yesterday - the stuff that came off (the passes to Rooney and the ball for Smalling) was spectacular. The exact opposite of the stereotype Mata who passes backwards and keeps possession but can't penetrate a defence.

2353~~~
He's in a strange predicament. I don't think he looks happy playing for us at the moment under LvG, and I think he's one of the lot who'd love playing for us under a different manager, but it looks like the next gaffer will be Mourinho and we know how that will end. 

My only hope is that when we get our next manager in he's able to get the best out of Mata. Mata as a #10 could quite comfortably be our best player in a more functional side. It won't happen under the current regime though.

2354~~~
Rumours are Mata and Herrera will request transfers if Van Gaal isn't replaced. It would be shame if we lost either in fairness, I'm of the opinion LVG's system is strangling these talented players of expressing themselves.

2355~~~
Not particularly rumours, it is written in the times by James Ducker.

2356~~~
Why on earth would Mata want LVG gone when Mourinho is the most likely replacement?

2357~~~
lol

Not aimed at you, but at the rumours of course.

2358~~~
This waste of space had better put in a good performance today, he's been atrocious in recent weeks.

2359~~~
I can't believe people actually defend this guy, an absolute fraud of a footballer. 

I hope we get Mourinho and the first thing he does is tell this clown to feck off.

2360~~~
Where is he?

2361~~~
Hope he leaves with LVG tonight.

2362~~~
Possibly the worst player on the pitch.

2363~~~
Such a fecking coward.

2364~~~
Feel like half our squad STILL need to feck off.

2365~~~
As good as he can be when playing like he did at Valencia or at Chelsea, he's one of the big reasons for this shite we have seen. Awful signing. For £37M you expect class more often.

2366~~~
You wouldn't pay 250m for the whole squad including subs, youth the lot... what a pile of shite where has the money gone.

2367~~~
Completely useless player, sell him in January.

2368~~~
If he doesn't improve during the second half of the season I'd sell him during the summer. He shows some moments of genuine class but is invisible all too often. Not once has he ever grabbed the game and led us to victory.

2369~~~
I hope we get Mourinho.

Because one of the first things he will do is bench this useless fecker.

2370~~~
Is he our worst signing ever? £37m or what was it, he is up there with Carroll when it comes to money wasted on a single player.

2371~~~
I'm a fan of Mata's but I'm struggling to see what he brings to the team. The majority of his passes are sideways or backwards. Really poor for someone who can offer a lot more.

2372~~~
He did against liverpool didn't he I swear he smashed them 2 games in a row. But still he doesn't fit us at all and needs to be sold.

2373~~~
For me it's Di Maria. But Mata not far behind. I have been so disappointed about how he's played for us.

2374~~~
Awful footballer.

2375~~~
Just lost any expectations of him ever performing to a high standard again, honestly.

2376~~~
I mean in games where the team is struggling and he is able to carry them. If I remember correctly the team generally played well in those games.

2377~~~
People were having a go at me for saying he should be sold last week. He has the strength of a schoolgirl and hes just had one good game for us in his two years.

2378~~~
What an imposter pretends he's interested when he just constantly hides. Tom Cleverley mark 2 except we paid £37 million for him.

2379~~~
Never rated him. Couldn't understand why he was bought for a then-club-record fee when we had Kagawa. Not good enough.

2380~~~
In his defence he has pulled us out the shit a couple of times although I can't say he's ever carried us. He has nothing to offer at number 10 and is as bad as being a man down at right wing surely we'd be better of playing anyone that can run in his place.

2381~~~
Attacking player playing badly under Van Gaal.

What a huge surprise...

2382~~~
Moyes had no clue about anything he did when he was our manager. Just a desperate signing really. What did he expect? He played Mata as left midfielder in his(Mata's) second game at United, did he have a plan at all? Moyes ruined 26 years of great work and LvG has followed what Moyes started.

2383~~~
Biggest pussy that has ever played for the club.

2384~~~
£37m for a weekly blog post. We could have easily bought a legit blogger instead.

2385~~~
I was wrong. It's retarded to single out certain players if an entire team is playing like shit.

2386~~~
Kagawa had hardly performed for us to be fair.

2387~~~
Same thing we've seen for the last few weeks. The entire team is awful but Mata (rightly) gets more criticism because he's supposed to be one of our best players.

I don't think it's a coincidence that LVG's best period here came when Mata came back into the team looking vital, or that his worst period came while Mata was in abysmal form.

Mata is part of the problem but the fact that we're actually dependent on Mata is a bigger one.

So disappointed with this guy.

2388~~~
Spineless cnut.

2389~~~
Where was he until the 47th minute and the ball into Herrera?

Also lol at this guy having a fan club at one time. At least the forum has realised he's a nothing player and we were robbed. Hope we do get Jose then the waste of space will be sold.

2390~~~
Few posts on here are a OTT imo.  He's a decent player when the team plays well and has the freedom to play, however against stoke on a windy day and needing someone to step up, he's obviously not the player for this type of occasion. 

Dissapointed how he's played the last 5-6 matches.

2391~~~
Still think it's ridiculous to single Mata out when literally the entire team is performing like utter shite though. I mean he deserves extra criticism because we expect more from him but, beyond that, it's pretty clear that LVG is the fundamental problem. None of them are playing well, it's not just Mata.

2392~~~
Don't think he's being singled out, everyone is aware that there are others also playing badly.

2393~~~
Really? This page alone has seen him get called the biggest pussy that has ever played for the club and our worst signing ever. Hardly sharing the blame equally there. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2394~~~
He just gets worse.

2395~~~
He was fine under Fergie until he got injured. But I don't want to get involved with that. This is about Mata.

2396~~~
This is the Mata thread - look at other player threads for criticism of them.

He probably is the biggest pussy to have played for the club in my time.

2397~~~
He only got like 14 games or something under Fergie, right? I think you're right though, he was performing well, particularly when we played a diamond system at one point. But the year or so after he was rather crap under Moyes, and Mata is proven as a top Premier League player. I don't think anyone saw it going this way for him.

I think I'd rather we'd have persisted with Kagawa too though, to be honest.

2398~~~
He always seems to want 5 mins to pick a pass...

Dawdling toilet

2399~~~
I can't believe he is a professional athlete and is as weak as he is, a 12 year old would brush him off the ball.

2400~~~
For him to be this poor for this long tells me he's struggling on more than just a footballing level.

2401~~~
If it was just him, maybe. When the whole team is this bad...

2402~~~
That's a good point actually.

2403~~~
Pathetic support for Young on the right in the second half.

2404~~~
I've said it several times but Kagawa used to give the ball away far less than Mata because he always took up good positions and the ball was passed before an opponent got near him. That said,  with the lack of movement under LVG he was best off out of here as he wouldn't have been of any use to us...

2405~~~
Please leave the club.

2406~~~
So bland and average when he doesn't get the goals to boost his stats.

2407~~~
Is so far below Ozil, Bojan, Sanchez, Silva, Eriksen and Coutinho it's not even funny. Zero pace, zero acceleration, zero ability to dribble the channels, takes too long to take in his options.

2408~~~
Looks like a 12 year old boy playing against professionals.

2409~~~
I can only compare his play to a tennis ball-boy. While the ball is in play he stands off to the side and when there is a foul he scurries on to try a quick free kick.

2410~~~
Definition of a luxury player I'd say.

2411~~~
He was out of position or it was someone else's fault, I dunno.

2412~~~
He is weak, just can't protect the ball and lacks pace so can't get away from players quick enough.

2413~~~
He never looked this slow in the past though - not like this. Our entire team look spent - even Smalling is looking a little more sluggish these days.

2414~~~
Sell him. Moruinho will when he comes.

2415~~~
If there's one player suited to the Spanish league and not at all suited to the premier league, it's him. He's a class player, but way too inconsistent and easy to shut down in the prem because of the physicality and overall pace of the game. We should offer Atletico a money and Mata for Griezmann deal if Mourinho comes in. I love Mata, but I doubt he'll stay if Mou comes, and he's shown very little since he's joined, apart from a handful of great games.

2416~~~
It's not like he hasn't played well in the PL before though. He was one of the league's best players when he was at Chelsea.

2417~~~
He was great in 2011/12 and 2012/13, but they were barely a top 4 team then. In 11/12 they finished 6th even. And their whole team was built around him. If he wasn't such a likable person, his performances would be scrutinized a lot more then they have been, even at Chelsea. He just seems like the type that you need to make your whole team revolve around him to get the best out of him, but he isn't good enough to have that at a team who wants to challenge for the title, and not the type to be able to do that in a team that doesn't have other world class players alongside him.

2418~~~
We are expecting him to run past players; he isn't that kind of player. Scholes wasn't either. We are expecting him to find forward passes, but look at our attack. Try to find passes he should have made - there are no runs, therefore no openings. He's been poor, but he is a luxury player in that he needs movement to play well.

2419~~~
He's lucky that he's so damn likeable. Would be getting Fellaini levels of abuse otherwise.

2420~~~
None of which changes the fact that the PL isn't the problem.

2421~~~
I love Mata but he's done almost nothing in months.

I'd be a hypocrite if i didn't criticise him considering the abuse I give Rooney. Mata has been garbage for a while now.

2422~~~
Oh but I agree with you - our team and style of play are the problems.

2423~~~
I hear you, it begins now.

feck off you sexy Spanish slow suave weak devilishly smooth charming good for nothing cnut.

2424~~~
Remember when me and a few others got slated here for calling him weak and a luxury player.

Nothing player in all honesty.

2425~~~
Stoke have better players than Mata upfront (and that is not based solely on today's match). It's shocking how much money we have wasted in recent years.

2426~~~
It's hard to be critical of him because he's a favourite of mine but you have to be fair. He's been shite for a while now. Offers nothing

2427~~~
I was just going to ask if anyone else thinks Bojan is a better player than Mata? Just look at some of the play he created today. Set up 2 situations that should have been goal.

2428~~~
Yep, he's better. And Arnautović.
Swap either for Mata, and they don't single-handedly transform the side, but they definitely make the attack less limited, less predictable, more dangerous.

Both have quicker feet, turn better, dribble better, make the ball stick more.
Mata... Well.. Mata has a nicer first touch.

2429~~~
Arguably Bojan/Arnautovic/Bojan are all playing better than Mata is at present. Whether a new manager can rescue him is his last chance really, otherwise he needs to go back to spain.

2430~~~
He wouldn't look better if he was playing for us. We actually play a worse brand of football than Stoke...

2431~~~
He'd look better, because he can actually turn/dribble past a man. That alone would make him look better. He'd ,at the very least, not have to hide and avoid receiving the ball under pressure. 

How <i>much </i>better is debatable, I guess.

2432~~~
He's not even a luxury player anymore.

Before he'd at least show some moments of quality but now there's none. Pathetic display again.

2433~~~
Di Maria could dribble like a boss, it didn't stop him looking awful for us. I'm assuming Depay is meant to be able to do that too (though I've seen little evidence of it)? Martial has gradually been dragged down to our level as well.

If just Mata was struggling it would be one thing. When literally every attacking player struggles it's another.

2434~~~
I feel Di Maria looked better than Mata, until he basically decided he was off and gave up trying. His inconsistency on the ball was to be expected. At least he tries something different <i>to </i>be inconsistent. Mata's so limited and safe that it has no use at all.

Martial looks better than Mata. He has no issues receiving the ball all over the pitch or under pressure. Hence he has the potential to be a really top player, which Mata isn't.
And Memphis (although not flat-footed, slow and weak like Mata) is also pretty crap at dribbling past anyone. He's not being dragged down; he's just not that good.

2435~~~
Id rather have any of their atrackers over Juan.

2436~~~
Needs to be the first player to go in the summer. He adds nothing to the team, and his movement is largely awful aside from the odd clever run in behind. He can't play as a false winger and give Young no support if all he's doing is collecting the ball in safe areas and playing safe passes.

2437~~~
Mata needs the team to play around him for him to succeed. Unfortunately he was never good enough to afford such luxury. Been abysmal for a while now. Weak like the whole club at the moment.  Dull blog coming up..

2438~~~
Guardiola could utilise him much better in a correct setup but i fear for him under someone like Mourinho.

2439~~~
I used to like Arnautovic quite a lot. He's actually quite a heavy winger to play against, and yet he's awfully quick and can dribble pretty good. I just don't like his first touch. You could see that when he fell today, and also on his goal he had a bad touch that turned out lucky.

I think Di Maria just didn't want to stay at Manchester. Some people just don't melt in in north of Europe. Other players can't stand being in a smaller city either. I don't doubt Di Marias qualities, he just didn't do well here. It has happened before that big players didn't click in a different league.

2440~~~
Under Guardiola, he's a squad player at best.
He uses/requires players with much higher levels of technique than Mata.

No room for players who want to hide/play safe, due to not having quick feet, a change of pace or a decent turn.

2441~~~
To me he's playing how he has always played for United, it's just more evident due to this run of games and bad form. His statistics are not too bad but when is the last time he properly influenced a game, Liverpool away last season and possibly City at home?

People make excuses about him playing out of position but the likes of Ozil, Silva, KdB and Cazorla have all spent periods on the wing and still affected the game. He doesn't have the ability to beat a man with skill and there's absolutely no chance of him out running anyone as he's so weak and has no acceleration.

I don't know when the last time was the he cut open a defence with a good ball, and that maybe due to the manager but the players have to also take some of the responsibility, he's suppose to be a top class player and he's just coasting through games offering next to nothing.

He was never a United type signing in all fairness, and it just hasn't worked out, we need to get rid for the good of the club IMO.

2442~~~
Yeah, when it's one player underperforming, that player has a problem. When it's all of them, the manager has a problem. Our players are better than this.

2443~~~
It's barely even a debate is it. Does any left back ever have a hard game against him? They must love facing him.

2444~~~
Not saying his performances of late have been good enough, because they haven't, but its crazy how much grief he's getting here considering he must easily lead the way in terms of goals and assists for us (despite this dire period of management).

2445~~~
Easy target for fans.

2446~~~
Easy target? Please. He really only started getting proper criticism a few weeks back. Him and his hugs giddily skipped guilt-free for ages.

2447~~~
I don't think that's true at all; he came in for plenty of criticism last year when he underwhelmed. And he is deservedly coming in for criticism now. I love the man, but his future in this team looks more and more questionable with every indifferent performance.

2448~~~
It was always spasmodic or fleeting, I don't think it was ever unanimous - it was always met with the caveat; of said poster or another; that <i>it's Juan Mata. </i>Or <i>a player of his ilk will get over this. </i>Those sorts of justifications were frequent.

2449~~~
Well that's probably because he had previously been a very good player, and even showed flashes during the cluster-f*ck that was Moyes' last few months. It's only natural that there would be caveats. But I have a clear memory of him coming in for criticism last season - in fact, I remember actively participating in a thread and wondering why he wasn't performing up to standards. If there's a way to pull up his 2014-15 thread, we could take a look.

2450~~~
I just did a search and here is a page from his performance thread last season, posted quite early on - already the criticism was coming in: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/juan-mata-2014-2015-performances.394002/page-8">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/juan-mata-2014-2015-performances.394002/page-8</a>

2451~~~
When we play well, he is key to it, he impacts the game more than any player we have in regards to creating chances and goals. At the end of the day, that's what it's about, scoring goals and he gives us the best chance at doing that than any other player in our team. However, in the current situation, it just doesn't suit him at all.

2452~~~
We haven't played well for ages though and even when we had loads of the ball his contribution has been minimal. He's supposed to be this great creative player yet we create next to nothing each week. When the team's not playing well he can't just hide and be absolved of any responsibility, he has to try harder to get involved and start influencing games. When we do start playing well again, which I suspect won't be until we change manager (which may be a while), I doubt he'll a major part of it because I'd imagine a new manager would want people with a bit of character and creative players who actually create chances.

To say he's an easy target is ridiculous, he's got away with having way more nothing/poor games than good games for United because he's nice, he has a good beard and he writes a blog. I'm just bored of watching gutless United performances where not one player tries to create things or do something different and seeing one of our most technically gifted players getting easily pushed off the ball, not being able to go past anyone and continually just trotting inside and playing a sideways pass.

2453~~~
some great post from <a class="username" data-user="8868, @noodlehair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8868/">@noodlehair</a> and i really couldnt have said it better myself. A year and a half later, still the same issues.

2454~~~
I've said it before, as have others, but his lack of athleticism is just such a huge handicap. He'd really be a superb player otherwise I think. Especially in the PL.

2455~~~
I really don't understand why he's never hit the gym. Ozil did and its done him wonders this season.

His physicality, or lack of it, is just such a handicap its unreal.

2456~~~
£90m+ to have an attack of Depay, Fellaini and Mata

2457~~~
Costa Müller Robben

£40m

2458~~~
He's a brilliant footballer. 

Our team has been dross and never fitted him since he came. Under a decent manager he'd be class.

The last good goal we scored was against Wolfsburg from his through ball.

Under someone like Pep, Wenger etc he'd be one of the best in the league again.

2459~~~
Pep has never based his teams on such limited players. His whole system is based on players who can play under high pressure, in tight areas. The pitch is squeezed, and there's nowhere to hide or to avoid being pressurised.
He requires players who can turn on the ball, who have quick feet, who can dribble in tight spots, and move the ball quickly - literally everything Mata <i>isn't </i>good at.

I don't see how he fits Arsene's mould, either. Again, he's too limited. 
Mata has technique, but isn't able to do enough with it.

2460~~~
He has good technique but that isn't enough. He is a luxury player unfortunately. I was really excited when we signed him but he's been a major disappointment.

2461~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> What on earth would Atletico want to do with Mata?
Just spend wages for no reason on a player who doesn't improve them at all?

He's as far away from a physical/aggressive player as you can get, he's not got quick feet, he wants too long on the ball, he's useless defensively.
I wouldn't even say he's suited to La Liga. He looked good at Chelsea after all. He's just suited to a lesser team, who don't try to squeeze the pitch. 
A counter-attacking team, who aren't that good, and don't expect him to put in a shift or be particularly well-rounded: That's Mata's best platform.

He'd look good at Palace, for example. And they'd appreciate his strengths so much that they'd allow for his weaknesses.

2462~~~
I kind of agree, but Mata needs to step up as well. Great players rise above the dross, and he's not been able to do that lately.

2463~~~
He used to be a brilliant footballer but he isn't anymore. Sometimes players just cannot recover their peak form. It happened, happens and will always happen. He's an average player now who can have the odd good game here and there.

2464~~~
Inclined to agree with you, he's very limited despite his technical ability, and liable to drift out of the game all too readily, I don't see where he has a future with us, does he have the skillset to play right side longterm? No, does he have the required skillset to play centrally, again, my opinion is no.
When he goes missing out on the right side, it's not too noticeable, when he drifts out of the game centrally... defensively, when we don't have the ball, it can really cost you.

Personally think we should let him go and recoup some of our money, Also agree on the Atletico point, he's a million miles from Simeones typical player.

2465~~~
Well you're underrating him massively. While he's not cut out for the very top teams, he's definitely fine for the level below, and just needs to play in the right system. And I'm pretty sure Atletico was interested in him last year, or there were plenty of rumors about it. Otherwise no he wouldn't suit them. But he's a class player, who just isn't suited to us at all, or the premier league. Yeah, he had a good season or 2 at Chelsea and he has his moments at United, but he'd just look better elsewhere where the game is less physical and more technical. After all, he looked our best player in the champions league games for the most part, and generally had a bigger impact then in the league (just like for Chelsea he tore up the Europa league in 12/13, where most of his best games came).

2466~~~
One picture to summarize his recent performances:

2467~~~
I don't think his performances have declined (at least not by a huge margin), he's just not getting the numbers right. He still does the basics right like he always does, what combined with goals make people believe he had a good game. But in fact, he’s hardly influential.

We have better players in number 10 position but it’s criminal we didn’t get a right winger this summer.

2468~~~
Eh?

How does that show anything? It's completely without context, Martial is providing us width as he played on the right that day while Mata was playing as a 10. 

He's also moving towards that space and if the ball was played into he'd be the first to it. If he was actually in that space already he'd have been marked and there wouldn't be that space. 


The biggest issue there is Jones with his head down about to hit it towards Fellaini rather than looking to pick out a better pass.

2469~~~
Funny, but true unfortunately.

2470~~~
Why do we even bother buying no.10's? we just dont know what to do with attacking midfielders. 

That said his performances have been masked by a reasonable Goal+assist return, problem is he should be having more of an effect on our general play, not playing like garbage for 85 minutes then playing a good pass or getting on the end of something.

Id take even that at this point, he just doesnt do anything when the chips are down, actually feck it, thats actually the most defining trait of our squad.

We dont have any players who are capable of turning a game around, or putting in a performance when things arent going well.

All of our players require a "if everyone else is playing well" or "would play better with better players around them" instead of saying feck this and grabbing a game by the scruff of the neck and dragging the rest of the team with them.

We need More Alexis sanchez's and less Juan Mata's.

2471~~~
Was just watching a highlights clip of his 2012/13 season and just wow. He's definitely more second striker-esque, movement and finishing in abundance. 

This slump he is in though right now...will pace around and in front of him solve it? Or is that just an easy excuse and has he done a Torres? Think he is a little gem of a player, hopefully we'll get to see his best.

2472~~~
A really genuine question, are there players like that anymore? Suarez at Liverpool was a good example but there aren't many who can do that whether it's by scoring or playmaking.

2473~~~
Really didn't mean it to sound that Cliche <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, I dont think it would even need to be players of the absolute rarity of a luiz suarez, but players who are able to put in a consistent level of performance regardless of their teammates not having a good game, we have far too many players who shrink under the pressure and expectancy in games and it leads to a bit of a chain reaction and then everyone else starts to play poorly.

Like, look back over the last 7 games, can you remember one player genuinely standing out from the rest? to me every player out there whose job it is to effect a game has failed to do so in any way.

I think willian at chelsea has shown that mentality, Sanchez at arsenal has that quality
in spades, fernandinho at city/aguero when fit. The Javier Mascherano's of this world, Leonardo Bonucci at Juve.

I was really hoping Schweinsteiger would be that player for us.

2474~~~
You're right, we don't have any players like that. I don't expect much more from Mata tbh, people are still stuck with the player he used to be a Chelsea whereas I think he peaked over there and won't probably get back to a similar form.

2475~~~
Mahrez and Vardy? They are surrounded by total donkies, but have dragged their team to first place in the league.

2476~~~
For all the shit he's getting lately, and yes he's not been playing well for at least 2 months now, he's still scored more than any of our other players in 2015.

2477~~~
Just goes to show how absolutely shite Rooney is.

2478~~~
He's letting me down.

2479~~~
That is such a depressing list.

2480~~~
You're not wrong.

2481~~~
Others are shit as well? And to be fair, Herrera and Fellaini are even central midfielders. Rooney is crap.

2482~~~
See I don't think that's true. At various levels, I think Kante, Morgan and even Drinkwater all played at very good levels.

2483~~~
Is that their league totals for the entirety of 2015 as opposed to just this season so far? If so that is pitiful all round.

2484~~~
I've criticised him from the moment he arrived. An unnecessary purchase at the time, has done little to justify his price tag. Seemingly a good guy but not good enough, or not what is needed at this club.

2485~~~
Or maybe he wasn't criticized so much then because he was player of the month 2 months ago?

2486~~~
Ha, Herrera hardly plays an all.

2487~~~
I'm not even sure that he isn't good enough however he is NOT a right winger and we won't get the most from him playing there. How can he play to his strengths when he doesn't exactly have much pace, great dribbling or even much of a right foot to cross?

If we played him regularly behind someone like Martial with good pacy wingers out wide I think we would see a different player.

It's wrong to expect Mata to be Ronaldo, Bale or Robben when he is not that kind of player. It's like trying to expect Blind to be like Rio or Cannavaro at the back. I think tactics and formations are as much to blame as the players

2488~~~
Great game so far.

2489~~~
Get this little boy out of our club.

2490~~~
Started well, but then faded.

2491~~~
Typical performance from him one good moment but goes hiding for the rest of the game. With him, Rooney and Memphis we have some truly awful players.

2492~~~
Not quick and skillful enough to work the tight spaces which is what we needed if we want to play a passing game.

2493~~~
Nice shot that hit the bar but then disappeared for long stretches.

2494~~~
My problem with him is that he does that when played centrally too. 
Hes not a right winger but while he's anonymous for large stretches of the game he has no business in midfield either.

2495~~~
We were much better when he went off. 

Except we were pretty much the same and our right winger(who?) or Depay on the left barely touched the ball after.

2496~~~
He was good at the start but then faded badly. Typical really.

2497~~~
Not going to lie, When I watch De Bruyne at City i'm slightly envious as he is everything that Mata should be for us. When the board finally wake up and got a new manager in place he is going to have to make some big decisions, and getting rid of Mata and Rooney are 2 he should ultimately be looking at. Mata is a great player on paper in regards to the fact he pops up with the odd goal and assist, but we need more.

2498~~~
that shot against the bar must have knackered him

2499~~~
Thats the big problem we don't have anyone better. Mata, Rooney and Memphis shouldn't be anywhere near our starting eleven the way they have been playing this season but we don't really have choice.

2500~~~
Mata would be a great 10 in a team that create an abundance of chances. It goes without saying that we are not that kind of side currently. While we rely on him to create for himself, especially from wide, we are going to be left wanting.

2501~~~
I know. I still can't believe Chelsea let De Bruyne go. Would love to see him on our right wing.

2502~~~
That first line is a bit of a redundant statement. Wouldn't it be the 10's primary job to create the chances?

Mata isn't really a '10' - he's a second striker and needs to play off a CF.

2503~~~
Second half he made some really good runs and you could see him getting annoyed at a few of our players (including Blind) cos the ball wasnt played. He made a run from the right through the middle and it was when Chelsea had a high line. He could have been played in two or three teams (given Blinds ability to do so). Was quite surprised (but not really) when he went for a safe sideways pass to Darmian instead.

He defo plays much better when herrera is in the team but I think subbing at the time was a good decision.

2504~~~
He is basically a slow and weak second striker. His best strength is his composure in the box and finishing.

We literally have no right side when he plays but thats LVG's fault.

Valencia is a big miss. Even though he was hitting shins he still got us on the front foot with his ability to run with the ball.

2505~~~
Disappointing.

2506~~~
He should absolutely be dropped.

Young is the entire right flank by himself, why on earth is Mata being given a free role? He's just popping up in congested areas, not creating anything and playing safe passes. We're just completely carrying him. It's not even like he has the physical presence and ability to cover the ground to make a nuisance of himself defensively. It's utterly baffling, and to make things worse his finishing has gone down a notch too.

Sod it and put Memphis or Fellaini on for him. He's just pointless in this system.

2507~~~
Jesus I'm getting tired of watching him, today he is playing in a completely free role and seems to have no defensive responsibilities and still he is unable to have any impact whatsoever in the game. Biggest fraud in football since Ali Dia.

2508~~~
Doesn't matter if he scores he's so shite it's like constantly playing with 10 men. Get him off asap.

2509~~~
He has a funny way of running.

2510~~~
Been really poor today. Slows it down a bit but it's more than that, far too easy to muscle off the ball, and now not even taking his chances, which usually redeems him

2511~~~
Slow, afraid, won't tackle, can't really pass, can't take a man on...the perfect player...

2512~~~
The average man in the street could outrun him and outmuscle him and he's a professional athlete.

2513~~~
i've never seen such a technically proficient player fail to strike the ball cleanly when in shooting range as many times as he does.

2514~~~
Mata and blind out there making us far less of a competitive outfit. With the injuries we get we really need 2 lb, 2 rb and 5 cbs to live in this league

2515~~~
Hope Jose just comes in to get rid of Mata alone, he makes watching United a struggle for me!

2516~~~
Good second half,  good movement.

2517~~~
Amazing to think people thought Mourinho had gone crazy when he didn't fancy Mata. Now you can actually see what he was getting at, he's such a frustrating player.

2518~~~
Only time he did anything of notice was his pathetic attempt at marking Sigurdsson when he scored.

2519~~~
Stream was in and out, but I thought he looked good in the second half. He's a different player when he plays more directly, with quick passing, give-and-gos, etc.

2520~~~
Thought he played well actually, particularly in the second half. Was good defensively and was neat and tidy going forward. Something to build on after a fair few sub-par performances recently.

2521~~~
He was decent in the second half when our play in general picked up. He more than anybody lives off of the team being active and aggressive going forward. If there is no movement, he'll look poor, it's as simple as that.

2522~~~
Did okay and put in a good shift but slowed the game down a lot with sideways passing when he could've passed forward. He wasn't the only culprit though.

2523~~~
He's sadly too slow and weak if we are honest.

2524~~~
I don't understand what his role in this team is. He makes no impact on the game yet he is free to roam anywhere he likes to do what exactly? Pass it sideways for a few yards? 

It's ridiculous how much better we look with a winger on the right. 

I know he has a lot of fans because he looks so silky on the ball but I find him extremely irritating. He looked better in the second half with a few good touches though. 

Was he guilty of losing Sigurdsson?

2525~~~
He doesn't even bother standing out on the right anymore.

2526~~~
Looked lively in the second half. That's the Mata we need. Not the slow and sluggish Mata from the last couple of weeks.

2527~~~
Don't know about him losing Sigurdsson but was furious with him today for playing so small.  I mean Herrera is not giant but he plays pissed off, which is great.  Mata is unfortunately is all finesse and no bite or nastiness.

2528~~~
Definition of a luxury player. Has a decent skillset but isn't good enough to build a team around which is what he needs. Really nice guy and all but we should be looking to replace him.

2529~~~
Seriously needs to bulk up. That run near the end that resulted in him falling flat on his arse after getting slightly pushed was laughable.

2530~~~
Don't get me wrong, I go crazy when he starts the sideways passing, but could it partly be down to a lack of movement in front of him? Was he guilty of the same thing at Chelsea and/or with Spain? (genuine question as I've mostly watched him play for United.)

2531~~~
He worked hard off the ball but didn't do much on it, very frustrating player to watch.

2532~~~
Needs to be dropped / rotated / rested. Whatever you want to call it. For good of him and the team but I honestly think if we sign players we really want / need he wont have a chance in a 433 or 4231 type formation.

2533~~~
The forwards are static at times, but when they do make runs the midfield never plays them, so after one of two failed runs the forwards stop which leads to more sideways passing from the midfield.

Sometimes with Mata he plays the quicker 1-2 passes but loses it, but passing slow possession based passes sidewards is not really helping either.

Its just not clicking for him, but the alternatives are not great on the bench so what do you do?

2534~~~
Yep. If we had quality out wide, he'd be seeing much less game time.

2535~~~
You're being very kind with that timeline there NL! He's been gash for a much longer time period IMO. So too has just about every other mid/attacker tbf.

2536~~~
He is too slow. There's never the option he could ghost past someone if they focus on stoppin him playing the pass. You don't have to be quick to be a #10 or a wide attacking midfielder (Silva, Isco, De Bruyne) but you do need that dribbling abillity which he doesn't have.

2537~~~
We finally play a good attacking game and you have a go at Mata who was one of the biggest factor. Because of Young's role as a wing back Mata was playing sort of as a #10. He was constantly moving, as was Herrera, which made the team less static than usual. Much better flow in attack and Swansea had a difficult time shutting down the attack.

Seriously, a player has the ball at most for about 7% of the game. The rest of the time he's off the ball and that work is more important. Unless someone dribbles past a bunch of players or scores a long range belter then it's the off the ball movement that creates space for the player that assists and player that scores. Mata did exactly his job today. He created space, he got into goal scoring chances and he distributed the ball well and quickly.

2538~~~
I think Mata really gets a lot of unfair stick at times. He hasn't had a great season, granted but he is not all at fault for everything. It's common knowledge that Mata is very slight and weak. He does't get involved in the physical side of things. There is only so much he can do considering his size. He will always get bullied too easily. What Mata needs is to play in a team where he is "shielded" from the physical side of the game.

He is also suffering from a lack of runners around him, this is where you would see the best of Mata. Everyone around him is too static to make use of his best attributes. 

That said, I doubt United can provide him with best environment for him to be at his best, sadly. But he is not as bad as fans make him to be.

2539~~~
Absolute luxury player. Lucky we have a massive lack of quality or he would be out the side.

2540~~~
Couldn't agree more.

2541~~~
There were quite a few passes on but he took too long and then played safe. Either he's instructed to slow the game down by the coach or he's not got as good a football brain as it seemed when he was at Chelsea?

2542~~~
One stat that shocked me was when they showed the distance run by United players stat around the 60th minute and Mata was actually leading the stat. Maybe he isn't as much of a luxury player as people think.

2543~~~
He put in a good shift but contributed nothing going forward. £37m playmaker is expected to contribute something going forward against Swansea at home.

2544~~~
My overall rating for him is 4.1 And i used to like him.

2545~~~
Well okay it's been more like months not weeks but I felt in the second half we saw glimpses again from what the lad can actually do when he is on form and not totally void of confidence. I hope he and the team can build on this experience and finally get some live back into this team.

It's been more than that. It's been three years since we saw Mata at his peak. Since 13/14, he's been terrible - bar that four game run he went on during the end of last season - and that's coincided with top managers such as Mourinho and Van Gaal using him in a way that doesn't suit his skill-set. This gets said a lot and is somewhat of a cliché, but he's a player who would have been excellent many years ago. Right now though, he's a massive hindrance to our squad and needs to be replaced next summer, or we bring in some competition to challenge him for his spot (with him playing a role as a squad player). Which I've been in favour of for a while now.

2547~~~
I've been very critical of him in recent weeks but he ran his socks off today. Improved second half.

2548~~~
He's pathetic at times nowhere near what we need.

2549~~~
Well that's probably true. Last time he really convinced me for a longer period of time he still wore blue. In all honesty we need to look at quite a lot of alternatives for our attacking quartet if we ever want to get back into Europe's elite. Atm I'm afraid that only Martial really got the quality it takes to make a permanent impact in our attack.

2550~~~
Absolutely. He was excellent for Chelsea. He's a player who knows how to make use of open space and defences that are stretched. He was in a very comfortable position back then. Which had a detrimental effect on that Chelsea side. However, now that he's required to defend and contribute more to our build-up play, he's struggled. He's not strong or agile enough to beat his man - look at Ozil and how he controls his opponents - and doesn't have the right attributes to move away from pressure and create chances for us. 

I think Mata's best performances for us were at the end of last season, but they were overrated to a certain degree. Same applies to the start of this season. He was creating more clear cut chances than I can ever remember with us, but he was above average. He's the true definition of a luxury player.

2551~~~
Absolute marmite performer. goes from 45 minutes of invisibility to 10 minutes of hitting crossbars and lovely 1-2's then vanishes again for a bit.

2552~~~
Not his worst game today but if there is any truth to him wanting to leave United then he should go, and hopefully we'll get a decent price because of his reputation, stats and age - because based on his all round performances I don't think he would get into many other top teams starting line up.

Also, if it is true about him wanting to leave he may be slightly misguided - I checked and he has started more times for us this season than any other player (20) and has played the second highest amount of minutes after Chris Smalling (source: Who scored)

2553~~~
Woody really should look into forming a Man United ladies team. We can make Mata captain of the side. Provides nothing on the pitch these days. We can put in any youth team player and get more out of them than what we are getting out of Mata.

2554~~~
I thought he was good (going by the reaction in here that might be down to my love for him) but good positive things from players like Young and Martial usually involved a little link up with Mata somewhere, wasn't flashy but allowed the freedom of others to come out. My most pleasing aspect of his game last night was his defensive work, he was closing down and doubling up the whole game, even back in our defensive third, really put a lot of work in which just goes to show how stupid some of the arguments are about him.

2555~~~
Thought he was better today, and was better against Chelsea than he has been for some time too. He looks more comfortable when we're not playing standing-still snail-pace possession football. He is at his most dangerous when he collects and plays the ball on the move. His game unravels when he receives the ball on the spot. He's too sluggish from a standing start to make anything happen. In motion, he is very mobile.

I still believe he can contribute to United, and that he is capable of more than what we are seeing. Very talented player, stuck in the same rut as the majority of the squad, but unfortunately his lack of physical traits make him one of the bigger liabilities when we are playing like this. Young on the right would be a better option, and Herrera is probably a better option at #10, as he's got a bit more tenacity and toughness to his game.

2556~~~
Can't even iagine how much better we'd look if we had a powerful player in his place

2557~~~
I thought he played well too. When he has runners around him he produces magic. Our team is just too static to get the best out of him imo.

2558~~~
I don't know why people are telling him to bulk up. We all know he isn't a physical player and never has been. He's always relied on his brain and his technique like David Silva. We can't expect him to grow a pair now at this point in his career, he will always be the same player. The only way we can change his effectiveness is if we play in a way which suits him. He needs mobility around him and strikers who can make direct runs. 

Honestly I hope we do sell him just so people see how good he is again in a different set up. He would get so many assists and goals playing for teams that suit him more than we do.

2559~~~
He's just shite then?

2560~~~
I'm sick of hearing about how bloody likeable he is. If he wasn't likeable he'd have been lynched at this stage. Physically weak and generally cowardly in possession. What does he actually offer? We spent 37 million on him

Edit: and what actually makes him so likeable? he's been shite on the pitch. what do you all like so much? his beard? Don't get it, never have. Every now and then he does something lovely on the pitch but it is happens far too rarely to explain the love this guy gets on here.

2561~~~
I think we've philosophized a wordclass player.

2562~~~
Mata is one of our best players imo.

2563~~~
Was never the case before he came here. I do think he's never going to be good enough for the likes of Madrid, Barca or Bayern but feck me to we need to actually learn to walk before we should be even think about running with those big boys.

And at this level, he's easily one of the most talented players in this squad and should/has before shown that he's capable of a lot more than we're getting out of him - pretty much like every single other attacking player at the club.

2564~~~
fecking hell, people labelling him cowardly?

2565~~~
Think it is the 2 year of backward and sideward passes that does it!

2566~~~
But conveniently forget his goals and assists.

2567~~~
Completely ineffective again. Replace him with a proper right winger and we'd be such a more threatening team. One of our main aims next summer should be to find someone to replace him.

2568~~~
He was better I thought. Not one of our best probably but he is looking to do more in possession. It's a shame his finishing has been a bit off in the last few matches.

2569~~~
I'm going to hazard a guess that it's his genial demeanour and the obvious affection he displays towards the club, its fans and its history. Doesn't seem too hard to figure out.

2570~~~
'Cowardly' has to be among the most overused and annoying adjectives currently employed on here. Cowardly is Nasri jumping out of the way of a RVP free kick.

2571~~~
Agreed.

2572~~~
Embarrassing is the one that grates me most.

2573~~~
And disgraceful. Missing a shot, a poor performance, losing to a lesser team isn't a disgrace. Leg breaking tackles, racism etc, that's disgraceful.

2574~~~
Just viewing the 'Klopp' thread; 'fraud' is another annoying, overused term.

2575~~~
It just makes me so frustrated that we couldn't accommodate Adnan, as a left footed player cutting in from the right he would have been a decent option to have.

2576~~~
A disgraceful, spineless, cowardly, luxury fraud who should be lynched. He's been shit the entire time he's been here and even the time before that when he was actually good was just him dragging another team down to his horrendous level. Most awful buy in the history of both buys and awful things. Still better than Rooney though.

Think I'm getting the hang of this...

2577~~~
It's not enough to be honest he's killing our right side of attack. Imagine we had Mane we'd be much more of a threat in my opinion. I think it's going to happen with Mane so we will see but I think Mata is a huge part of our unbalanced attack as much if not more than Rooney.

2578~~~
Decent is what we have we need better imo

2579~~~
I understand why people aren't happy with Mata's lack of pace but some of the stick he gets on here is unbelievable. He is unbelievelably talented and although he has a few ineffectual games to me he always looks like he wants to play for the team and the club. We have a fair few players at United who could be just playing for anyone as far as they're concerned but Mata comes across as a guy who has genuinely subscribed to United as a whole and loves being at the club. His goal and assist return has been much better than some others in our squad (alright still not astounding) but this seems to get forgotten about at times. I doubt very much that he wants to be playing on the right hand side and I bet we'd see a very different player if he was consistently deployed centrally behind a striker, or striker<span style="text-decoration: underline">s</span> - especially a striker that can offer a bit more forward movement and thrust than Wayne does.

We've already seen the very talented Kagawa misused at United and it's happening to Mata as well. Imagine the qualities he could bring to our team if we had some pace in front and outside of him, rather than simply replacing him with someone pacey. The whole attack is unbalanced and we can't blame a round peg of a player if he's put in a square peg of a position. That comes down to management, tactics and formation.

2580~~~
Too many excuses, Martial, Rooney and Young managed to play well yesterday. Martial and Young provided the 'pace' from the flanks, what more does he need? He wasn't restricted to the right wing either.

2581~~~
Very harsh on Mata. The guy worked his socks off yesterday.

2582~~~
Mata doesn't take risks - he's a coward
ADM take risks - he doesn't want to play for United

Seems like United fans hate both types with equal measure.

2583~~~
Standards are obviously low for Mata. That was the sort of performance that 21 year old Sterling gets the 'overrated' comments for.

He's good at certain technical elements, but lacking in others. And, unfortunately for him, those areas where he lacks prevent him from being a top player who can influence games, especially when there isn't a lot of space.
Influencing games when there isn't a lot of space is what top players do. He doesn't have the skill set - thus it's always the fault of someone else, apparently.

Someone mentioned him needing a system that shields him. What the heck are his team-mates going to do? Create a human shield every time he gets the ball, and bundle through?

Put Silva in this team (yes, even this team) and his superiority in receiving the ball, turning his man, dribbling past people, making the ball stick... would become apparent. He's the type you build around.

Mata will probably leave, and yes, he'll look better. But it'll be to a lesser club, where they play on the counter every week, and they're just so thankful to have him, so they let him do what he wants every game, and ignore his flaws.

He'll look good in the same way Bolasie looks good at Palace but wouldn't at a team who actually look to dominate possession (which requires more skill). Palace would suit Mata, actually. And they're closer to his level than the top teams/clubs in Europe.

Some even call him world class for his two good seasons at a poor Chelsea (where Ivanovic, Drogba, Cahill and Terry made it hard <i>not </i>to rack up the assists from set-plays). Yet they wouldn't call Sturridge world class for his 1.5 years of goals galore.

2584~~~
Just watching the game now, relaxed as I already know the result. Mata has run the furthest of all United players and constantly finds space in and around the box. Unfortunately, we are still static in the box. 

I wish he would take more shots instead of that extra touch he always seems to take. 

When people make runs, like Ashley Young has done a lot of today; even Rooney looks livelier, then he finds space. We all know he is a very classy player, and the difference between his technique and Rooney's is huge. He really offers very little defensively though. I still think that with a pacier attack, he will improve massively.

2585~~~
I think he did well yesterday. He looked like he wanted to create stuff and had some good initiatives and link ups which he was a little unlucky to not pull off. It's obvious that he's not in tip top form though, if he was he probably would have buried at least one of those shots yesterday.

2586~~~
Mata or Rooney at 10.  

A wide forward in the right wide forward position and we are suddenly a much better team.

2587~~~
He was decent, but he needs to take more risks with his passing in the final third. Too often he's just passing it sideways.

2588~~~
Honestly, do you even think at all before you post shite like this?

2589~~~
He's a very good player and had a good season last year, his goals against Liverpool and Man city showed the quality that he has inside the area and I think his best moments come inside the area or right on the edge of the area.

He's getting slated but I can remember times this season where he has been brilliant and provided important assists and goals. Look at the pass for Januzaj goal at villa that was fantastic and the assist for Martial against Wolfsburg. That's just 2 moments that spring to mind instantly. OK at times he's been poor but who hasn't for us this season. 
He has definitely been misued he isn't a winger and he isn't a central midfielder, his best position for me is almost as a second striker dropping off and looking for it then joining the attack one he's threaded it through.

He's very good but hasn't been in form this year but despite that is one of our contributor of goals and assists. I don't want him to leave I think he's a great asset to have and once we start playing a bit better you will see his quality shine through again.

2590~~~
But he got a blog with hugs and by the looks of it that seems to be more important than his actual performances on the field.

2591~~~
Like seriously. What the hell is that post? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2592~~~
Good shout. I completely agree.

2593~~~
It's very similar to how many labelled him as a coward in away performances, and then he gave us that Liverpool performance... among a run of other brilliant performances.

Don't worry, opinions will change if he hits form.

2594~~~
He played as a number 10 yesterday and he was very poor. He just cannot influence the game, his lack of strength is alarming, if anyone comes anywhere near him he is easily shrugged off the ball.

2595~~~
He hasn't 'hit form' in 28 matches. These throwaway comments need to stop. Juan Mata isn't world class, he won't become amazing if we put 'runners' in front of him, and he has to be replaced.

2596~~~
Dude, this is rubbish. 

It's like dismissing the contribution made by the likes of Ozil, di Maria, Sanchez, Iniesta, Pedro etc. because they were just assisting Messi and Ronaldo. 

It's a teams game. He played his part in a team that won two European titles in two years, which, by no means, was easy. 

Just for comparisons: Mata scored 12 and assisted 20 in 11/12, Chelsea won the CL and the FA Cup. In 12/13, he scored 20 and assisted 28, Chelsea won the EL.
On the other hand, Sturridge scored 11 and assisted 3 in 12/13, Liverpool won nothing. In 13/14, he scored 24 and assisted 3, Liverpool won nothing.

2597~~~
I said "if".

2598~~~
He hasn't hit form in 28 games? Didn't he win player of the month during what was probably our best spell this season? When we were actually scoring goals and he was involved in about half of them? He's playing poorly enough as is, you don't need to exaggerate so much.

2599~~~
He won it by 1 or 2%, and probably was awarded it because Smalling and Martial (who were the other two nominees) had won the past two. 

In any case, he's certainly not showing himself as <i>so clinical </i>right now as you once said.

2600~~~
Well the stats are not on his side though? For me he's always been a player who does easy stuff most of the time but pops out with an assist or more likely a goal, but it’s been exactly 13 games since he was directly involved in a goal for us (NPG). You have to admit, it’s quite terrible for a player who gets total freedom to do whatever he wants, wherever he wants on the pitch.

It’s bizarre that some people still think he needs to be surrounded by runners (or whatever is the excuse for today) and don’t see that he is one of the reasons we are so poor in attack (not directed at you, just an observation).

2601~~~
5 goals and 7 assists in a season we're struggling for cohesion is not a bad return. He's excelled with us when we've actually been functional, albeit in a run of only 6 or so games.

2602~~~
Mata's very good at assisting/scoring goals even when he's playing poorly, but even that aspect of his game has been non-existent in the last couple of months. The fact that he's patently good at that sets him apart from most of our other attackers right now, but there's always more he can be doing.

2603~~~
OK

2604~~~
The only one on that list that falls into the same bracket as Mata is Pedro. He'll never look half the assist-machine/goal threat now he's left Barcelona. The rest of them are legitimately world class players. None of them relied on players like Drogba, Ivanovic, Terry, Cahill being aerial threats from set-pieces.

He 'played his part' in the Champions League, by being about the six or seventh most influential player - if that. The reality is: Chelsea, since the original Mourinho days, have been able to grind out backs-to-the-wall wins/draws, and it has little to do with Mata as an individual. They're cup competitions, after all. It's irrelevant when discussing how good he is.

What's more relevant is that Chelsea were largely crap in the league throughout his time at the club. And the league (as always)is a much better measure of how good a side are/were. They had poor balance, a lack of discipline, and this enabled Mata to thrive. 
This lack of balance and lack of discipline isn't a trait of top teams. Top teams tend to play higher up the pitch and require their attackers to be more well-rounded than Mata had to be at Chelsea.

Think of the dominant sides of the last five or so years. Would Mata get into any of them without weakening them significantly? I'd say 'no'.
A team at around 6th place is his level, I'd say.

2605~~~
You think I have to post something to please you?

2606~~~
This is just an assumption based on your opinion. You're completing dismissing everything he did at Chelsea to prove an opinion. If you don't like him, thats ok. He was a brilliant player for Chelsea and thrived in the conditions provided by their team. You can't make rubbish excuses, dismiss everything he did there, to prove your opinion.

2607~~~
What in my post is rubbish?

Chelsea have been a great cup team since the Mourinho days, as evidenced by Grant and Di Matteo being able to get them to finals. When they need to grind out a backs-to-the-wall performance, the likes of Terry, Drogba, Lampard, Cole, Cech were able to do it.
So the cup wins don't reflect on Mata as an individual. Is any of this rubbish?

Mata's assist stats. were boosted by consistently taking set-pieces for a handful of the biggest aerial threats in European football - Terry, Cahill, Ivanovic, Drogba... Is this rubbish?

Chelsea were not a very good side during almost all of Mata's time there. Their balance was off and they played with a disjointed end-to-end style that serious top teams don't do. Is this rubbish?

I'm struggling to see what's rubbish. I'm not dismissing everything he did there. In fact, I've made the point that he'd probably look just as good again, if he joined another lesser side where he wouldn't be expected to play progressively within tight spaces or to be well-rounded.

He'd look a better player at Crystal Palace than he ever would at Barcelona, for example. Because Barcelona play so high up the field that he'd struggle with the lack of space and time, whereas at Palace he'd have acres to run into on the break, and they'd probably not care if he tracked back, or if he got bullied off the ball every now and then.

2608~~~
Feck me, people are praising Mata because he ran a lot against Swansea. I think LvG can take any player from the youth team and get the same results. Mata has done nothing for months. Since he joined United, he's had spurts where he scores a couple of goals and provides a few assists, but then he disappears.

2609~~~
Those set pieces certainly explain away a lot of those assists while he was at Chelsea.

Wonder what explains away his productivity here? Especially his goalscoring? No doubt he just benefitted from our beautiful attacking play....

2610~~~
He's (usually) a good finisher. No one denies this. Still not a top player, though.

2611~~~
He did have incredible set piece targets at Chelsea (Cahill is better in that box than his own, Terry consistently excellent, Ivanovic too and various 9s), but he's earned his goals here with clever movement and finishing. 

Mata is technically solid and can spot a pass. But it's hard to play him as a 10 (for defensives reasons, look at the Sigurddson goal) or as a RW (no pace). Still, after Martial, he is without a doubt our most productive attacking player. So I see him staying another couple of years. 

In theory, Mata should benefit from Martial and Memphis liking cutting in from the left side. But I don't think Van Gaal is a particularly good fit for him. And in some ways, Herrera is an awkward teammate as long as Van Gaal doesn't use the Basque deeper more often.

2612~~~
The season he got that large amount of assists is heavily distorted by domestic and europa league matches. He got 12 assists in 37 PL matches. Impressive, but normally met by the top assister each season, and normally the top 3 (sometimes 5) manage around that many. 

In any case, assists are hardly a valid barometer of creativity. Last season Brunt and an [extremely underperforming] Di Maria got 10. Rooney and Lambert got 10 the year before. In fact, I think Rooney was joint with Benzema for most assists in the CL that year.

2613~~~
He's like a fish on a bike at OT. Feck we have Rooney taking the free kicks and Blind taking the corners. He needs a team build around him for him to shine but the problem he has is he's actually not good enough for that to happen at United. But going to a team like Spurs standing and he'd be viewed as one of the top players in the league. But here when he plays right forward he is meh and his limitations laid bare. He is a massive reason our attack is so poor. Mane would be a massive shot in the arm for us!!

2614~~~
No but it shows the amount of times you have set up a teammate for a goal--The end product of creativity that is very essential to the game.

2615~~~
I would sell him this window if we got a decent offer (£15-20m). A complete panic buy really

2616~~~
Sigh, quality of posts on the Caf have gotten worse in the last year or two. Cant tell if some of you are drama queens or wums either way its getting dull.

Think some of you would only be happy if we sold the majority of our squad.

2617~~~
Selling players this window would be insane. Even the ones that we want rid of in the summer -- squad is far too thin to be offloading anyone.

2618~~~
Based on the last three seasons, only De Gea deserves to be here. The rest aren't good enough... Luckily, our manager isn't thaaaaaat stupid (or is he?).

2619~~~
Who said anything about selling half the squad?
Yes, about half the first team needed upgrades if the team is going to become a proper European force - but that's another discussion entirely.

Ultimately, this is the Mata thread, so people will counter the excuses and constant talk of his lack of movement and runners.

You only need to watch Mata a bit to realise he lacks much of what the top players in the top teams have.
His biggest contributions are scoring and finishing off moves inside the box and against stretched defences. He does little to consistently help create against a flat, organised defence.

The idea that he's being let down hugely by the quality of his team-mates is something I don't agree with. He's really just another player in the squad who wants more space than a good possession team gets, and who wants to be played in, rather than do the real creative work under pressure.

2620~~~
The problem I think with Mata is that he really isn't that effective outside of the final third. He is more of a shadow striker/false nine than a true #10 or playmaker.

Because of this, even if we play Mata in the hole, we need a deeper playmaker like a Scholes or Fabregas - someone who can be creative from a midfield pair - to serve as the heartbeat of the team, allowing Mata to get into the box as much as possible which for me is where he does his best work. Unfortunately we do not have such a player in our squad at the moment, who can consistently pick out good forward passes from a deep position.

I say this as someone who is largely a critic of Mata and thinks he is generally quite overrated.

2621~~~
it is just so hard to see a future for him with us long term, he is no right winger and LvG is clearly desperate to get some pace in there, and with Herrera, Rooney, Pereria, etc he very unlikely to get a look in as the number 10, he also surely not going to want to be a sub in a consistent basis, just seems inevitable now that he will go fairly soon, the question is where and how much.

Wouldn't mind, I think my mum wouldn't mind adopting him either if it had to be the other way around <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2626~~~
Top man.

2627~~~
He has been as productive as Rooney this season from open play. And this is in Rooney's worst ever season.

Mata 5 goals and 7 assists, 2 pens taken IIRC

Rooney 8 goals and 2 assists

2628~~~
You have to consider the positions they play. Rooney has played many of his minutes as a 9, some as a 10 and less than a half out wide. Mata has played mostly as a RW and a bit of time as the 10. The average Prem player getting Rooney's minutes at his spots on the field gets far more goals (assists is probably closer) than the average Prem player getting Mata's minutes at this spots on the field. 

You can't play with 11 strikers. You need players productive at the different positions that realistically exist on a football pitch.

2629~~~
<i><b>Rooney:</b></i> "Mata is very talented, he’s small like Yoda & he's very intelligent. In some way he’s a genius so him & Yoda fit perfectly."

2630~~~
I assume Fellaini is Chewbacca.

2631~~~
And Louis Van Gaal is Jar Jar Binks.

How can someone dislike them

2633~~~
If you think Rooney has even been remotely as good as Mata this year then I'm not sure we are even watching the same sport.

2634~~~
I disagree. He only starts games on the right but he floats all over the pitch. This season there is no excuse for Mata poor stats as he's getting total freedom to do whatever he wants from Van Gaal.

2635~~~
He wasn't very effective today but at times when he came onto the ball there was nothing ahead to try and pick out.

2636~~~
Has he played the last few months? One through ball for Martial and apart from that I can't remember a single attacking contribution for a long time. 

Swap deals never happen, but I'd gladly swap him for a fast attacking player.

2637~~~
He was awful today, our worst player by a distance. Rooney get;s slated over and over again (rightly so) for getting the ball into feet and always turning wide and playing the easy pass instead of turning forward and taking a player on, well Mata does the same thing gets the ball into feet but turns inside and plays a simple cross field pass. No penetration/no ability to go past players just a total luxury. Mourinho was right and I'd much rather see Lingard or Pereira get game time ahead of him.

2638~~~
Once upon a time he was a top player

2639~~~
Easy sit and watch Mata play! It's not about disliking him as a person but as a player with us he's shite.

2640~~~
by far our worst player today. I can't understand what people see in him, he has been our worst player for moths now and not even against a League 1 team he was not able to have any influence whatsoever on the game.

2641~~~
He has no position to excel in. He doesn't fit into the team. Albeit being a great footballer and technician he just is not made for the PL I think. Mou knew

2642~~~
Pretty much defines his United career. He just doesn't have the required physicality to keep up with the PL, sadly. I believe he is one of those players that would thrive with the team being built around him and him having unlimited protection. That said, I doubt United can provide this luxury he needs.

Not a great game today btw

2643~~~
Hasn't been playing well for a long time. If we're going to play him, I'd rather try him out at #10 and have Lingard or Young on the right.

2644~~~
He needs to be dropped. He offers us nothing, he's simply not good enough to play out wide.

2645~~~
I blame Van Gaal's style and a lack of options to pick out with a pass because Van Gaal has everyone in such a rigid formation. Mata can do better, as can everyone, but it's a lot easier for players to be consistent when they are given freedom and encouraged to attack, not like whatever we see on the pitch. With us, just about any player would be shite. Put Silva in our team, and he'd be useless. Same with Ozil. The problem isn't the players.

2646~~~
No real reason not to bench him given how poor he has been recently. Maybe a little spell out of the team would do him good, playing all the time certainly isn't working.

Benching Mata won't have any positive impact on us generally though as the other players in his position are so ordinary. Unless we sign someone else he's still by far our best bet. He just needs to rediscover some sort of form or at least his knack of producing a lot while not in good form.

2647~~~
If he's not going to play as a number 10 then he shouldn't be in the team, he's too slow out on the right.

2648~~~
He's not playing well. Plain and simple, I don't think its a matter of position or anything else, just a very fallow patch of form.

2649~~~
Absolute shite again today. Why is he still getting games as an inside winger. It. Does. Not. Work.

It doesn't work against Arsenal. It doesn't work against the West Hams. It doesn't work against the Norwichs. It doesn't even work against Sheffield fecking Wednesday.

Of course, he has also been shite in almost every appearance in the centre this season too. A shadow of the player he was at Chelsea under Benitez, where funnily enough he played inside right at least half the time too.

2650~~~
Has to be dropped, he has offered nothing for a long time now.

2651~~~
Two vaguely interesting comments from LVG on Mata in the post match press conference:

1. LVG said we needed width today and he wanted Mata to provide it but he wasn't there, which meant it was up to Darmian which wasn't good.

2. He said that Mata has been doing fantastically at RW and always makes a big contribution but he isn't a RW. He'd like to fix that but it's difficult to find someone who'll perform better than Mata even when he's in a position that isn't his best.


I think the first comment is interesting in that LVG was actually expecting Mata to provide width, which seems very strange given he's Juan Mata. Seems a bit stupid to me but there you are.

The second comment is interesting in two ways. First, it basically confirms the fact that we're looking to replace Mata at RW. Second, it suggests that LVG still really rates Mata and is very aware that he isn't playing in his best position. 

It makes me wonder if LVG has been playing Mata at RW more due to our lack of alternatives in that position than because he doesn't think Mata can play centrally?

2652~~~
So shit. I hate him and Fellaini with a passion.

2653~~~
shit

2654~~~
Silva is miles better than Mata and so is Ozil! The problem is the players in the fact that the quality is not there atm. We need better wide attacking players Mane and Moura would be a great start and add an attacking right back like Coleman who we should have bought last season!

2655~~~
Can't believe this was the guy who we hailed as the first of our superstar signings and welcomed with a helicopter whilst he was dressed aptly as our savior in the james bond tuxedo. Feck this shit.

2656~~~
Yes they are better but would be just as ineffective. Silva maybe a bit less so as he cab dribble past players well but overall, players of that sort can't do anything at united for a reason. Mata is a quality player, he just needs a system to get the best out of him and more quality around him. Like Ozil and Silva need at their clubs. Like kagawa needed when he was here and why he's class at Dortmund but was shit at united apart from looking very promising in Fergies last season (and even then, that year was far from our most fluid and attacking under Fergie). 

Mata has shown a decent amount of times how good he can be. But that's all he can do when we play in such a restrictive style with hardly anybody making any runs.

2657~~~
I do think he's playing there because of a lack of options. After mata, the only players who have really ever played there are Lingard, and Herrera a couple of times. Maybe young a couple of times. Its not too good whoever plays there though.

2658~~~
LvG's thoughts on the RW position and Mata (6:10)

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P3wovdAEhVs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2659~~~
Feckin' garbage performance. Him and Darmian together were a sack of shit. It's like they'd take it in turns to not move for each other.

I still think he'd be way better under a different manager... like all our players in fact.

2660~~~
I dont think they work together personally.
I dont think mata works in general unless you've got valencia or young behind basically filling the role of winger.

2661~~~
Mata has shown a decent amount of times how good he can be. But that's all he can do when we play in such a restrictive style with hardly anybody making any runs.[/QUOTE]

Mata is simply not good enough for a system to be built around him. A bit like Berbatov although completely different players. The players must fit the team rather than the other way around. As United are to big a club to rely on one player unless he is a Messi, Ronaldhino, Ronaldo (older) standard as even the young Ronaldo had to fit the team. We have too many players that are better than Mata. 
Mata has played at right of the front three and apart from the odd game Liverpool Spurs come to mind. He has been woeful even as a ten his preferred position he has been meh. Kagawa was much better and he got moved on you can expect the same with Mata.

2662~~~
Oh Juan... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2663~~~
Unfortunately, the way things stand we need people who make things happen out of nothing. We are not good enough to create team goals by just passing it around. We need a creator i.e a player who will beat their man and create chaos or something unexpected. By no means is Mata a disgrace but for me he is a weakling, not in terms of size but of bite. He is just not suitable to a team like ours who plays like us and because of this his shortcomings, no pun intended, are more obvious. He is just that type of player.

2664~~~
100 % pass completion. First name on the next team sheet.

2665~~~
He crossed the ball in the 91st minute, was that his first touch since coming on?

2666~~~
In all fairness, he didn't have much of an impact. I can't remember most of those passes being particularly effective or incisive. Still, he was only on for a limited period so didn't have too much time to offer anything anyway.

2667~~~
Contributed a handball and an important cross, at least it was an eventful outing after a few poor games.

2668~~~
Thought he was very good when he came on. Cross to Fellaini was excellent, and he looked very decent in general. Start him ahead of Lingard next game.

2669~~~
It's fine to be put on the bench from time to time, especially when you're underperforming. Still expected him or Depay to start over Lingard today.

2670~~~
Contributed a bit more than just that

2671~~~
He plays entire season without resting one game and gets dropped for Lingard against Liverpool away, probably his best United game last season.

2672~~~
Thought he changed the game for us IMO. Brought much needed calmness to our play.

2673~~~
This.

Our other players pretty much looked like pub players without any technique what so ever. Mata could bring the ball down and you could see the Liverpool players were reluctant to try and tackle. Against our other players they would just slide in and get the ball every time (bar against Martial). He's slow, but he works his socks off.

2674~~~
Agreed. 

Weirdly the Young injury, forcing Darmian to right-back and CBJ to left-back brought some balance to our play as well.

Anyway, good cross for the goal. #juanfield

2675~~~
Hopefully we see him back in the starting 11 on Saturday

Think is absolutely key for us

2676~~~
Easily the most useful he's looked in our side for ages.

Bloody loves playing at Anfield he does.

2677~~~
Good cross. Was nice that a ball into the box finally went near Fellaini.

2678~~~
Hope not the guy kills our attack, but then Lingard is not any better. Either give Mephis a chance or put Young up on the right but anyone but Mata for me. (I am not adverse to him as a 10 though)

2679~~~
Yep, that cross to Fellaini today was a real attack killer.

2680~~~
Cheesy do you live on this forum? And great we took a short corner and Mata put in a good ball for Fellaini but come on that has nothing to do with our general build up.

2681~~~
No, just had a lot of free time since New Year.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

And today proves that when he plays well, Mata can be key to our build-up. His good ball is exactly what you can get from him. Granted, he's been a bit rubbish lately, but he looked excellent when he came on and was key to our build-up. He's far, far better than Lingard.

2682~~~
Whilst I think he is of a far better quality than Lingard (no doubt about that)I just think he should never be played in that right hand side role as he kills our momentum there. Play him as a 10 if needed and if we must put Young up into the right hand side of attack as he is better than both in that position.

2683~~~
If we are to play a #10 then play him there or not at all. He's not a RW.

2684~~~
How the hell did he get a rating of only 5.8 for yesterday? He comes on with 35 minutes to go and essentially provides a great assist for our goal and has 100% passing accuracy in a time where we desperately need to bring some much needed control to our play. I'm not sure what more a player is supposed to do in those circumstances, surely he was a 7 at the very least?!

2685~~~
I thought he came on and did a very good job. Lingard just kept losing the ball which gave rise to Liverpool attacks. Mata kept it neat and clean and was quite good other than the idiotic late handball.

2686~~~
Hopefully he can regain some form. We are a much better team when he's playing well.

2687~~~
Nice cross for the goal yesterday.

As much as we all criticize Juan Mata, it's because he has so much ability. Players like Lingard simply aren't cut out to start ahead of him, particularly in tough games.

2688~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eQvdhhmVKhq/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2689~~~
This is why rotation in some areas is good, it allows some players to rest, brings back some hunger (as they dont want to be on the bench). Not just for Mata, but I dont think LVG has quite sussed it on that part for some reason.

2690~~~
That has made my day.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2691~~~
We are a better team when any our front men are playing well. But the fact is Mata is a square peg in a round hole on the right of a front 3 imo.

2692~~~
It's interesting how some people here are convinced Mata is at fault for everything wrong in our attack, especially if he is playing on the right. Despite us being equally crap when he isn't playing and despite none of our other players showing absolutely nothing on that right side whenever Mata was substituted or didn't start.

2693~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> van Gaal

2695~~~
Came on looking sprightly but never really got back into the flow after the Darmian injury seemed to stall the entire teams engine.

2696~~~
He kept looking and asking for the ball, even if things didnt work. There were a few times in the second half I saw where he tried to run across the line and bend his run for a ball to him over the top / into the space, twice it wasnt played (I think one time it went out of play) and once was too late and he was offside.

2697~~~
I didn't see much of the match but he looked one of the more lively ones for us out there when he came on.

2698~~~
no blog today? something brewing...

2699~~~
There is. It's on United's website. Just not been posted here.

2700~~~
Mata isn't good enough for United. The definition of a luxury player and should be moved on in the summer along with Rooney/Fellaini.

I'm actively rooting for Mourinho because he will do all of the above and i'm just sick of watching managers fumble around trying to find a system to accommodate these players.

2701~~~
Has anyone ever seen Mata make a successful tackle? Genuine question.

2702~~~
Absolute muck. Bin him and get Andreas on.

2703~~~
Having a mare. Yank 'im.

2704~~~
So easy to push off the ball

2705~~~
Gary Neville's been right about him all along, it seems.

2706~~~
Awful

2707~~~
Really poor performance from him so far. I'm convinced Pereira would be better than him.

2708~~~
Must be physically the weakest player in world football.

2709~~~
Probably the pressure of the incoming deadline for his blog is playing on his mind...

"I think it's important we all stick together and keep believing. Hugs x"

F*ck off!! x

2710~~~
Another passenger.

2711~~~
Nah, he is playing right wing for us tonight.

2712~~~
Nothing new.

2713~~~
Having a bad game, so logic dictates he's always been shit.

2714~~~
He's so useless with his back to goal.

2715~~~
If he hadn't had that spell at Chelsea I'd say he wasn't a right fit for football in this country. Complete lightweight.

2716~~~

2717~~~
This isn't some sort of anomaly, he has been like this all season.

2718~~~
My girlfriend was saying that she used to recognise all the Utd players & I asked her to name the ones on the pitch. She started 'Rooney, De Gea, Fellaini, Smalling, Mata...'

I stopped her there and said that I didn't think Mata was on the pitch. Then realised he was jogging aimlessly around the centre circle. 'Oh, I guess he is playing then' I remarked, surprised. 

That was in the 31st minute. Says everything...

2719~~~
His weaknesses are highlighted greatly in a possession based team.

2720~~~
He's been playing like this all season.

2721~~~
He has been playing like this in more games this season than other seasons, but thats not indicative of his overall level.

2722~~~
Our worst no10, he can go missing anywhere on the pitch, rather play one of Andreas, Januzaj

2723~~~
It quite clearly is. He's had a handful of above average performances this season.

2724~~~
Tbh, one of those two could come on and the same comment will eventually be applied to them/

2725~~~

2726~~~
There's a resemblance there for sure!

2727~~~
I actually happen to rate him higher than the board does with my 5,8 in average compared to 5,7. That's freaking awful for a player costing 46m POUND. Even if he had doubled his contribution to the team I'm not sure I'd be very happy with the stats. It's just unrealistic how fecking bad he is. Slow with the ball. Can't come up with any ideas. Don't take any dangerous shots. FFS, this guy used to run right through defenders and finish the ball in the back of the net. Where's that now? We need to sell him at any price because this is not going to be of any use no matter how you turn it. An honest price and level of play for him would be 12m euro and a club like Portsmouth!!!

2728~~~
Its almost like that criticism could be directed at so many players in the team it suggests that the problem might not be the players but the instructions.

2729~~~
Yep not Mata! He has a great blog.....

2730~~~
Been miles better this second half at least.

2731~~~
Mata is very poor.

2732~~~
Extremely annoyed how crap he's been this season.

2733~~~
Well more to the point not anyone (bar Fellaini, he's shite) we all know who the problem is, so throwing every single player under the bus is pointless.

This thread is going the exact same way as the Di Maria one last season, all we need now is the sale in the summer and then the confused posters, like yourself who's had the knives out for him since day one, wondering how when he tears it up for another team.

2734~~~
Yep the confused posters like me! Wake up he has been utter pathetic for us since signing!

2735~~~
Been shite this season. As have a lot of other players. As has the team in general.

Wonder if these things might be linked in some way?

2736~~~
Hugging, blogging, bottling, paella eating shit bastard.

2737~~~
He'll be back off to Valencia when we sign Jose up anyway.

I couldn't understand why Chelsea didn't want him at the time we signed him - it was probably clear to see how shite he had become, yet every football fan bar Chelsea supporters thought he was still as good as his first two seasons at the Bridge.

2738~~~
Yep he's shite, just like every single other attacking player under LVG.

Not the managers fault though, definitely all the players.

If only LVG didn't have to work with such clowns, all things considered he's doing a great job. It's a wonder we've even scored a goal this season...

2739~~~
He's been decent in the second half, far far better then his shit first half... suppose that doesn't fit the thread narrative though, so I'll bow out.

2740~~~
What a fecking useless cnut.

2741~~~
Mata gon' Mata.

2742~~~
Like I said, crap first half (like pretty much everyone bar Martial) ... but he clearly improved in the second half, was involved in pretty much every single attacking move/chance we had (granted his final ball was letting him down at times, but he was finding space really well)... but because that didn't fit the thread/caf narrative, it's just easier to come in here and rag on him.

Same with Lingard too in his thread, he's been miles better in the second half then in the first too.

2743~~~
And then he scores a goal... <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2744~~~
Great finish but you've got to question Murphy when he says he thought Mata has played well.

2745~~~
Vintage Mata. An easy goal to mask a mediocre performance. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2746~~~
Should get on the Rogaine. 

That bald patch is really coming through in the rain.

2747~~~
Plays utter shite all night then scores a tap in. That'll keep his rep intact for another 6 months then.

2748~~~
Took his goal fantastically, general play has been OK, but his final ball has been really poor today. Had a few opportunities to put players in 1 on 1 but kept hitting defenders.

2749~~~
Had a decent second half.

2750~~~
That's still a 6/10 performance for me, even with the goal. He's been very poor in that central role, each time he's played there this season.

2751~~~
I agree. This forum was drooling in September '14 when Van Gaal had Mata, Di Maria, Herrera, Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao to pick from.

2752~~~
Form in the last three games has improved marginally but I expect more from him. Hopefully he continues to improve.

2753~~~
he didnt, he was poor, it was well taken goal but he has been poor for a long time now and should be sidelined for a while just to start doing something, he looks lost everytime hes on the pitch

2754~~~
Balls to that, he was good in the second half. Kept finding himself pockets of space to play in, was linking up nicely with Martial, and was involved in pretty much every second half attacking move - including both our two goals.

Mata's been crap for a while now, and he was really crap in the first half... but he was obviously miles better in the second half.

2755~~~
dont think he was much better in the second half, the opinions are clouded because of the goals, so many underhit/overhit passes and failed to make better decisions as well but yeah he was at the two goals so his selection was somehow justified for this game..

2756~~~
Feck me you think lvg is to blame for everything? A serious lack of balls on Matas part!

2757~~~
Feck off with this. He was very good in the second half. Great turn to release Lingard in for Blind's goal and a great finish. Got involved in the second half, which is what we want him to do.

2758~~~
just your op, nothing else.-)

2759~~~
He was poor but got a goal, Rooney did the same. When you look at Mata in the role then watch players like Dybala, Griezmann, De Bruyne and Muller in the same SS/AM role you see how ordinary he is.

2760~~~
Yeah, I must be seeing things. He obviously wasn't involved in either goals.

2761~~~
No, but when you can aim the same criticisms at Mata that you can at virtually every single attacking player thats put on a United shit under LVG it more than suggests what the real problem is.

2762~~~
AN was saying he had improved before he scored though.

2763~~~
He isn't as good as his fans say he is. He isn't as bad as his detractors say. He's just a little better than the average footballer, I suppose. You'd expect more from a then-club-record signing for this club. A Spanish Joe Cole.

2764~~~
Thought he was OK today. Had a good second half. 

But thats what you get from him at number 10. His lack of mobility means he can be tracked quite easily and unless there is movement up front all he can do is play balls in to feet. Yet he can still pop up with a goal.

He really needs Martial at #9 to be an effective #10.

2765~~~
No surprise. Sick of the sight of his tortoise pace and dithering. If we got Jose at least he'd be sold.

2766~~~
Worked hard in the second-half. Passable performance without being extraordinary.

2767~~~
Yes, we get it: The manager's crap. But Mata isn't good enough, regardless.

He'll probably go to play for some mediocre counter-attacking team, where the club/fans are just so happy to have him and will cling onto his Chelsea form as proof he's 'world class.'
He'll play better, because he's better at counter-attacking, due to his deficiencies (doing anything progressive under pressure/tight marking.)
And because they'll be so happy to have him and he'll be 'productive', they wont care about the things he doesn't do very well.

He'd be a great fit for Crystal palace, in my opinion. And he's closer to their level than any serious team's.

There's a weird idea that Guardiola would really like him, despite the fact that Guardiola's football requires players who aren't as limited (or easy to force away from goal) as Mata.
Or will Guardiola suddenly give Mata the ability to turn his man, dribble his man, side-step challenges, be strong under pressure...?
Mata has to surrender possession of the ball the second he's closed down. Literally <i>nothing </i>like a Guardiola player.

2768~~~
First attacker out of the door for me. 

He can't play out wide as he's one of the slowest players to have played for the club.

He can't play in the middle because he crumbles when put under the slightest pressure. In any case, his passing is way too safe for someone who is supposed to be the main creator.

2769~~~
Who is the English Messi. So really we've got a bargain.

2770~~~
Scares the shit out of me when he starts running backwards in possession while under pressure. You just know he's going to lose the ball because he's so slow and weak. Decent today, took his goal well and played his part in the build for Blind's goal.

2771~~~
Rubbish first half, could barely stay on his feet and looked low on confidence. Fair play for keeping his head up and improving in the second half and working really hard to make the third goal possible. Good finish rounds his performance to a solid '6'. Basically off-colour Mata for you, meh performance but still a goal and should have had another!

2772~~~
He's been underwhelming this season. There's no way around it.

2773~~~
He seems so satisfied touching the ball every 10 minutes only to play a short, safe, nothing pass.

2774~~~
I can't believe people are criticising him, his build up play last night was very good. His overall record at United is fairly good, he's one of our best players. Spanish Joe Cole <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> whatever next.

2775~~~
Rewatched the game last night and thought he was pathetic. Biggest coward in our team.

2776~~~
That's a bit of a problem.
Mata shouldn't even be in the first team, let alone one of United's best players. The standard within this squad really needs to improve quickly.

He's 'one of the best players' in an unbalanced team that may finish out of the top four, but may (if they're lucky) fluke their way to a cup win.
Sounds familiar...

2777~~~
Much better as #10 than on wing.

2778~~~
He's bossing it so far tonight.

2779~~~
Really, really good today. Setting up our attacks and could have had a goal

2780~~~
Should have scored. Having a good game though.

2781~~~
Can't score every chance - he's four feet tall.

2782~~~
Playing as a proper number 10 today. All over the pitch but influencing everything going forward

2783~~~
He's having excellent game, really great to watch, but what is wrong with his finishing in the last month or two? It's mostly his own fault, but he is at times really unlucky.

2784~~~
Running the show tonight.

2785~~~
Having a great game, magnetic control and quick feet. He really needs a goal tonight. He's been closed down quickly in the box, but no chance he could vae taken them first time with the pace they were given to him. The header was a tough one with Rooney throwing himself at the same ball.

2786~~~
A bit of confidence does wonders for our team. I truly blame this shit system weve persisted with. Only makes me loathe van Gaal even more. Enough talent in this team to be challenging for the league.

2787~~~
What's up with that? He looks almost fast today! Much, much better. Today he is class.

2788~~~
Best player on the pitch in the first half.

2789~~~
Playing well. Like everyone, thrives when we play with pace and a counter attacking style. Not one player in our team is suited to the possession bullshit. Hopefully we keep this up in the next games as well, can get Mata to his old top quality self.

2790~~~
He's always had quick feet, its one of the most bizarre criticism levelled against him.

2791~~~
I know - he's quick on the first couple of yards. He just can't run very well. Works his socks off every match though. About time that he showed his qualities, no matter.

2792~~~
Doesn't matter how tall he is, the ball was at his level. He just botched the shot.

2793~~~
Showing his quality again. Should never be dropped imo

2794~~~
He's been good today but there is one player out there who is head and shoulders above anyone else and it ain't Juan.

2795~~~
That's your opinion.

2796~~~
When I said quick feet, and I meant more that hes getting passes away quickly when being pressed. The pass he gave to Rooney before Martial's goal was superb. He looked a dead cert to be dispossessed, but managed to poke it between two defenders.

He's always been mobile though, but when we slow the play down and the movement, then he usually looks slower than he really is, especially when he's recieving the ball in a standing position. Always seems to be on the move today, which you need to be in the #10 position.

2797~~~
Yes it is.

2798~~~
Agere with this! Good post

2799~~~
Should definitely be in the #10 position from now on.

2800~~~
I am a big detractor of his. He has been sub par for a club record signing since coming in our least creative period ever. But making a great case to be given a run at 10 today, fairplay to him

2801~~~
Very good match from him, has been a while.

2802~~~
He's back.

2803~~~
He plays way better when there's pace and a lot of movement in front of him. Who would have thought ey?

2804~~~
Can't believe I sold him on FIFA yesterday <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2805~~~
Yep pace, movement and most of all trusting him to play in that 10 role.  He was even great defensively today.

2806~~~
He is a great number 10 in a counter attacking side

2807~~~
That was more Silva than Mata.

Let's see if he can put some form together and replicate in tougher fixtures,

2808~~~
His only truly class game as a #10 for us and his best performance since the one against Liverpool at Anfield last season.

2809~~~
He clearly needs pace to thrive, and it's a shame he's been wasted in LVG's shitty philosophy system.

2810~~~
He won World Player of the Year for me in FM when he was 29. But I played him only as a right winger. He was fantastic for me.

2811~~~
Kinda like Ozil in that regards, imo. He has the ability to pick people out especially on the move. Its kinda wasted when its all static.

2812~~~
He gave the final pass for all three assisters today.

In other words, he wasn't providing assists but at least he was getting us playing in an attacking sense today.

2813~~~
Another pacey trickster on the right hand side to mirror Martial on the left and Mata will do wonders for us in the #10 position, whilst Rooney is in this sort of form he can complete the front 4 as well.

2814~~~
He was busy, floating into channels and it contributed to the attacking fluency, still not enough end product from him though, you expect more from dead balls and assists, Martial did it all tonight.

2815~~~
... He was the only bloke on the pitch who was directly involved in all 3 of our goals.

The 2nd one in particular was a brilliant bit of play.

2816~~~
To be fair he assisted the assister in all 3 goals tonight. Stats don't tell you that, but he made an important role in setting the correct pass at the right time. 

I was more than happy with his work rate tonight though, he got up and down the pitch really well and looked fairly nimble while being strong also, quite a rarity for Mata. He looked like his old Chelsea self tonight.

2817~~~
Good players will play better when the whole team does. It is not surprising. Anyone with half a football brain knows Mata is playing for a team which doesn't get the best out of him. He needs movement and energy around him.

2818~~~
Must be a lot happier he's being played in the number 10 role. With pace and width around him, it gives him a lot more freedom to get on the ball and make things happen. Very good game from Mata yesterday.

2819~~~
Yep. That right wing is what we need to sort out more then anything IMO. Lingard has done alright but he's a limited player. I'd give Memphis more time to see if he can perform on the right, and develop into a top player out there, because if so, that would really help us long term.

2820~~~
Decent game from him. Did well to keep hold of the ball in the build up to Martial's goal.

2821~~~
That was always the problem with him. Once the team is in full flow, he's a very good player. If we play poorly (and that happened too often this season) he just cant improve our game. He was very good yesterday even though I thought he messed up our chance for our 3rd goal first <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2822~~~
Who would've thought he would play better as a 10 than as a winger, eh?

Sometimes Louis, the most obvious answer is the correct one.

2823~~~
If he picks up serious form in this position, I think it will doom Herrera.

2824~~~
He's been awful for us at number 10 in many games, and had his finest performances so far on the right eg. Anfield last year.

That said, I though he was excellent yesterday.

2825~~~
Has he really played many games as a 10?

And he's been awful on the right now for several months. When there's running to be done for Mata I cringe.

2826~~~
Key involvement in every goal, can't ask for more than that. He's one of our best passers in key areas of the pitch.

2827~~~
I don't think he's that slow. Compared to normal wingers, maybe but I don't think he has a problem getting up and down.

2828~~~
He was actually rather good last night. Here's hoping he keeps it up.

2829~~~
Personally I see Ander more as an 8 than a 10 and LVG might just agree. A midfield 3 of Carrick/Morgan, Ander and Juan could work, especially when we are looking to play more offensively against weaker opposition (and to be fair, Stoke last night were weak in key areas). In a squad our size and particularly if we stay in the CL there are plenty of matches to go around players like Ander.


He is very composed and is a great passer but sometimes I feel he holds play up a little too much: Not so last night, where he exhibited the vision and speed of thought that we have been sorely lacking recently.

Definitely agree on the tracking back point - working the flank in that way is not one of his strengths - but at his best he is a great player. For a while it looked like he might be a vanity purchase that we couldn't afford but if LVG can come up with a system that suits Juan and the rest of our squad then we could get back to seeing why some of us were quite excited back in the day when we signed him...

2830~~~
Also have to consider that most of his games as a #10 have come when we were playing a 3-5-2. There's no width in that formation, reducing space for Mata to work in. 

Yesterday was one of the few occasions where Mata has been playing as a #10 with pace around him on both flanks, with Martial, Lingard, Darmian and CBJ all bombing forward.

2831~~~
Was very good last night, it helps that Stoke came to play football which allowed him room to operate.

2832~~~

2833~~~
One good game and one good half against Stoke/Derby aren't enough... he needs to turn up and make things happen at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

2834~~~
Absolutely awful. Put him on the right or drop him please. He should not play through the middle.

2835~~~
What game are you watching, sir?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Or is this your auto post in this thread?

2836~~~
He's been absolutely fine.

2837~~~
Are you serious?

2838~~~
Perhaps in the 2nd half.

2839~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2840~~~
His movement was bamboozling Mikel and Matic during that completely dominant spell at the start.

2841~~~
He was one of the main reasosn why we controlled the first 20 odd minutes of the game. Which is why Chelsea have got tighter on him.

2842~~~
Good so far. So much better when playing AM instead of right wing.

2843~~~
Been OK.

2844~~~
He's been alright. No worse than Rooney or Lingard. I don't think he's a long term option through the middle though.

2845~~~
Needs to play on the half-turn more

2846~~~
We just need a better right winger

2847~~~
The feck? I haven't posted in here for ages.

He's done nothing. One chance he had to play Blind through he hits it through his legs.

2848~~~
His movement might be good, but he's been really poor on the ball.

The moment that sticks in mind is when Smalling ran with the ball into open space but his pass was a little behind Mata. Because he has the turning speed of an oil tanker, the only thing Mata could do was pass it back to the centerbacks and kill the moment.

Another moment was when Blind was running in behind the defense, Mata had a simple through ball but completely messed it up.

2849~~~
Really not true. Everyone played well to start off with including Fellaini with Martial being the best.

Once Martial was kept quiet, we've been predictably shit because our attacking players bar him are rubbish.

2850~~~
Average really. He's not the only one, though. Aside from Martial our attack is crap.

2851~~~
Glad we see eye to eye on something. I was enjoying our first 20 minutes but it is clear as day we need to replace Rooney, Mata and Fellaini to take this team to the next level. The basics are all there in place, we play really nice football through the thirds but we are lacking in quality in the final third. It is dead with no real bite.. if we want to win titles long term, this needs to change.

2852~~~
I think he has only been okay.  He cannot/will not take a man on so the defense just closes down the passing lanes and forces the ball backwards.

2853~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2854~~~
I thought he looked more positive in the second half. Fizzled out though, unfortunately. Would of had a fantastic assist but for Rooney.

2855~~~
Agreed, I felt Schneiderlin should have come on for him went we went into "Park the Bus mode".

2856~~~
He was fine. Certainly not "absolutely awful". Yikes. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2857~~~
Thought he was great today. Got motm on sky. Good decision for me.

2858~~~
Amazed he wasn't substituted once we had the lead. One decent cross for Rooney otherwise anonymous.

2859~~~
He was compeltely knackered after around 70/75 minutes. Feck knows why we didn't bring him off for Herrera, instead of bringing Memphis on for Lingard.

2860~~~
Bizarrely got MOTM. I don't think he was anything better than 'alright'.

2861~~~
Why was he still on the pitch?

2862~~~
He played very well, his best game in the prem for a while. Do much better in the center of the pitch.

2863~~~
Ddg was the motm for me, but i agree Mata looked sharp and participative, always at the center of our game whenever we played our best. Fade away in the last 30 min but he did a lot of running.

2864~~~
Mata played well in patches but for me if you are going to let him play there you must have more power and pace in the midfield behind him for when we are out of possession. His understanding with Carrick is very effective when were are in possession.

2865~~~
Linked up really well with Rooney today. Hopefully he keeps his spot as the #10, as he has improved recently in terms of his creativity and being a threat on the ball.

2866~~~
Yeah me too. Assumed DDG or maybe Courtois for motm.

2867~~~
Did well for the first 2/3 of the game but after that he looked completely knackered and should have been taken off much earlier.

2868~~~
You lot are unbelievable. He played well.

2869~~~
Had a very good game, but he looked very tired after 75 minutes, should have been subbed then, I think.

2870~~~
Good game.

2871~~~
Did fairly well. Faded like everyone in the last 20.

I also just realized that if the Mourinho reports are true then his United career is basically over.

2872~~~
Not his biggest fan but he's a different player when not stuck out right wing! Did well today.

2873~~~
Some of the posts in here suggesting he was poor even though he won Sky Sports man of the match <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. He was very good today, the reception he got from the Chelsea fans when he was substituted says it all really.

2874~~~
What the feck am I reading?

He played well.

2875~~~
Mata leaving is the only reason I can think of for not hiring Mourinho. I think he has improved the defensive side of his game since he signed for us. I am bias I have to admit as Mata is one of my favourite players.

2876~~~
I have a feeling he won't get rid.

2877~~~
6/10

2878~~~
Hope not.

2879~~~
Mata winning the MOTM award is irrelevant. Otherwise, let's forget any opinions and go by the MOTM award. Sky's MOTM award is decided by the analyser alongside the main commentator, which today was Alan Smith. So, that means if anybody disagrees with one person's opinion, in this case Alan Smith, they're in the wrong?

Rooney got MOTM, ironically, against Chelsea at home several weeks back. Did he deserve it? No.

Mata got the reception he did from Chelsea fans due to their respect for him. His performance had nothing to do with it. Nor will it ever.

And just to add, I'm not one of those who was of the opinion he was poor.

2880~~~
He was our best player creatively today. Him and Carrick very good in midfield.

2881~~~
Mata played well today but I wish he had a more physical presence, either with power or pace.

2882~~~
I thought he was pretty good. Improving after a pretty poor spell anyway. Nice ovation from the Chelsea fans too.

2883~~~
I thought he played well & as we all know, he's better in the #10 role, with 2 fast wingers making runs.

2884~~~
If our strategy is to sock up pressure after we score then, we should have sub Mata very early,
Completely lost on final 20 mins.

2885~~~
Mata fan but he is not even close in class to Willian who in turn isn't world calss...

2886~~~
Was good, but man of the match?

2887~~~
Just like Rooney his form seems to be significantly improved. Which isn't saying much considering that he was pretty much useless for most of this season. I hope he continues this trend.

2888~~~
He looks so much better as a #10, really hope we continue to play him there. He did seem to get really tired towards the end, the Herrera sub was way too late.

He really needs to stop being so unselfish though. He got in some good positions to score but he kept passing it out wide instead.

2889~~~
Mata was a better version of Willian when his Chelsea team were shite.

2890~~~
Willian seems to have become incredibly overrated because of how shit Chelsea have been this season.

2891~~~
How did you miss Mata's reaction to the news? I posted it in the Mourinho thread

2892~~~
Mata is better than Willian. Willian is a better runner/athlete and free kick taker but that's about it.

2893~~~
I fear for his immediate future if Mourinho takes over.

2894~~~
Depends on who else we can get in. Not like we have an obvious Oscar-type #10.

Mata might survive the summer. Longer term though you'd have to imagine he'll be sold.

2895~~~
Would Herrera not be similar to Oscar in the role? I think Barkely would be the type of AM/#10 Jose would like long term.

2896~~~
If it's true most of the squad fear Mourinho, coming in, watch them play out of their skin.

2897~~~
Ironically, if they just collectively fail the chances are way higher for them to stay here since without a decent PL ending we will not be able to attract decent replacements.

2898~~~
Gets the shot which is rebounded for the goal. He's been brilliant so far, by far our best player.

2899~~~
EDIT: Whoops, wrong player thread.

2900~~~
Yeah he's been very good today.

2901~~~
Playing at no.10 - playing his best stuff.

2902~~~
Echo the thoughts of others here he's been great today what a difference.

2903~~~
Really good today!

2904~~~
Yep, been our best player this first half. Keep it up Juan!

2905~~~
Absolutely excellent display so far

2906~~~
Very positive too, both with his passes and how quickly he is taking a shot when he's in a good position.

2907~~~
Better performance. Still not controlling the tempo of matches as he has never been that type of player but he is getting himself involved in the final third for attacks which is good.

2908~~~
Wish Lingard and Rooney were playing as well.

2909~~~
He's been very good today.

2910~~~
Best player on the park. 

Shame about a lot of his team mates. 

Him and Martial just about keep us worth watching.

2911~~~
I was thinking the same

2912~~~
What a difference when not played right wing.

2913~~~
Great player

2914~~~
Been the hub of all our best play today.

2915~~~
Loved those first time shots. Lovely technique.

2916~~~
Still a great footballer. We have all criticized his performances in he no.10 role but he's never had a run of games there. For the first time he's having a run and he looks excellent

2917~~~
Fecking magician in this role

2918~~~
I don't think he had a good game today. Had and created some decent chances but did not impose himself well enough and part of the reason the forward line didn't look threatening enough. 
Especially in the second half when he basically crumbled like the rest of them, was too busy doing flicks or looking beautiful on the ball than getting the job done.

2919~~~
Agreed. But standards are really low for Mata, and everyone is really desperate for him to be a 'magician'/United's Silva.

2920~~~
I thought he was our best player today. But that says more about the other performances than about his own, unfortunately.

2921~~~
Of course he was good today, especially in the first half. He didn't control the game because he isn't and never will be that sort of player but he was at the centre of any and all threat we posed.

2922~~~
I couldn't decide whether he was good or bad today. 

Sometimes reminds me of Carrick when partnered with Scholes. More than happy to see somebody else take the initiative despite having the quality to do so himself.

2923~~~
Looked a bit weak at times but still did well. So much better as a #10.

2924~~~
Had a good first half but in the second he was no better than the rest.

2925~~~
Good first half, second half, hardly got the ball. I wouldnt blame that entirely on him as the passing towards him was shocking. He looks better as a number 10 with runners around him (eg Martial and memphis). I do think we would see more of him if we had a proper 9 that had discipline and would stop dropping deep.

2926~~~
He didn't lose possession enough to look bad but was likelier to pass to the fullbacks than thread one quickly to the forwards. In my opinion that's not doing his job well.

2927~~~
I think one of the differences in the second half was Rooney started dropping deeper and it made Mata less effective, but he faded in the last 20 minutes or so.

2928~~~
In Absolute agreement.
It was weird how people assumed someone like Guardiola would love Mata.

Guardiola (and any serious manager building a serious side) requires players who make their possession count. 'Keeping it ticking' isn't of any great use to these managers, no matter how beautifully the passes are being made.

So, Mata doesn't give it away very often. Big whoop!
How often does he make the ball stick? take people out of the game with a dribble? Turn his man, and turn a pass to his feet into an attacking advantage? 9/10 he surrenders possession as soon as he's closed down.

2929~~~
Guardiola I believe demands a lot more than Mata is capable of in the final third, especially in that 10 role. Struggling find similiarity to the type of forwards he is used in the past/presently.
For a small and slow player like him releasing the ball quickly might make a lot of difference against physical opponents. It works for him with the shots, why not extend it to the passing.

2930~~~
I thought he was good today.

2931~~~
Want's an age on the ball.

2932~~~
My main issue with him, he does everything slowly and he is slow himself. But he has technical quality, vision and is a goal threat. While not the very best surrounded by the right players he can be really productive and influential.

2933~~~
Brilliant in the first half but went a bit quiet in the second half.

2934~~~
Why does he keep hitting his shots straight at the defenders?

2935~~~
He's still performing better than most of them imo.

Apart from De Gea...which is fantastic for an attacking football team.  Like we were once.

2936~~~
Really wanted to see him being given chance in the middle as a AM, but now I really don't know why since he's done nothing playing there.

2937~~~
First half - Mata of Chelsea. Sharp on the turn, running the game and opening space


Second half - Mata of United. Slow, turgid and easy to mark.

2938~~~
MOM last week.

And it's an eleven man game - the players around him aren't delivering either.

Rooney was pants again today - his season, on the whole, has been worse than JMs.  

So is it the players - or the tactics and the effects of LVG's leadership, especially mentally.

2939~~~
In the second half Rooney dropped so deep, he was virtually a CM. Mata was our furthest player up the pitch and was easily crowded out. I don't know who to blame for that situation.

2940~~~
He was our best player against Chelsea? Don't think so, De Gea was our best player, saved our asses don't know how many times, Mata was good, but so was Martial as well.

Don't care about excuses about other players, it's not other players fault he's being easily bullied of the ball or that he always slows down play with too many extra touches. As for Rooney having poor season, don't see what it has to do with Mata, is it some kind of accomplishment that he's been slightly better than Rooney or am I missing something?

LVG played his part with negative tactics, that's for sure, but still he should've done more. Unlike Depay who has zero confidence, Mata looks like he's confident enough to try something, just it takes ages to pull it of or he's just robbed of the ball by defender. Shame really because I like him as a player, silky touch, good vision and can strike the ball, perhaps that's something that frustrates me about him, has enough tools in the box but rarely uses them.

2941~~~
Best outfield player today, comfortably. Did go off the boil in the second half a bit though.

2942~~~
He is better at writing a blog than actually playing football.

2943~~~
He faded a little, and he does seem to do that quite often, but he was in our top two I thought.

2944~~~
If you take out DDG, our top two isn't exactly saying much.  We got bossed by relegation fodder.

2945~~~
I don't disagree. Just stating what happened - Mata was Man of the Match.  And I have a kind of built in denial when it comes to saying a United GK is our best player!

Can't do it all by himself for 90 minutes

2946~~~
Get this fanny away from our club.

2947~~~
Another 'waste of space' performance. But he was neat and tidy with his uselessness, so I guess it's all good?

2948~~~
Oh dear. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2949~~~
I know <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he's useless.

2950~~~
£37m. What a ridiculous panic signing.

2951~~~
I actually was laughing at Mata that time.

Still one of our best players mind. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2952~~~
Not sure what he was doing for that goal.

2953~~~
The rest of the team are so much better....

2954~~~
Will he write his next blog update in Danish ?

2955~~~
I appreciated that, it just adds to the hilarity of the game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Love and Carrick were equally pathetic of course... but that attempted nick away from Mata... brilliant.

2956~~~
Tbf it's only right that we expect more from Mata given he's supposed to be one of our best players. I do think he's better than nearly everyone else in the team but that isn't exactly high praise atm...

2957~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2958~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2959~~~
If Jose gets rid then I wouldn't care.

He has hardly proved him wrong for getting rid of him at Chelsea.

2960~~~
Not normally one to jump in a thread to criticise individual players but my word that was pure cowardice. 

Stupidity I can accept, gutlessness I can't.

2961~~~
Oh Mata what have ye done? It was an embarrassment watching him during that second goal... it's like something my mate Gregg would do in the park, he just doesn't get paid thousands of pounds to do it...

2962~~~
I don't think it was gutless particularly. He was trying to be clever and launch a counter. It was just epically shite.

2963~~~
He wasn't being a coward, he was clearly trying to flick it over the opposition players foot. Although it was silly to take that risk in that position.

2964~~~
Yep. Rather than focusing on defending the chance, he was looking to launch a counter. The problem was he failed massively.

2965~~~
Just seen the second goal. What the feck was Mata doing?

2966~~~
Probably the most progressive thought he's had in a Utd shirt.

2967~~~
Yeah it wasn't cowardly, it was just hilariously dumb.

Carrick and Love were equally as garbage in the build up to the goal.

2968~~~
Yeah, that wasn't gutless. Just rather hilariously stupid.

2969~~~
In that case I take it back and blame a  combination of the picture quality,  my own eyes and Trevor Francis. 

But there can be no hugs Juan. I must be clear on that.

2970~~~
Can't wait for him to leave. He's become virtually pointless.

2971~~~
Big. Girls. Blouse.

2972~~~
I agree but let's bear a few things in mind...players who were deemed not good enough have moved on and are now playing the football that gained them their good reputations.

Something in the state of Denmark is rotten...

And in Manchester.

2973~~~
Mata can't be forgiven for that. That "tackle" sums up exactly what's wrong with this team.

No fight, no hunger to get the ball back when we lose it. 

He was piss poor all game anyway, did nothing all match and then that rounded it off.

2974~~~
The thing for me is that he's a senior player who is supposed to be a top attacking talent, and we are playing a fecking Danish team who have not played in 2 months and have only won 1 game from the last 10, he should be running a game like that and leading the way, but he was on the fringes the entire time and not effecting things at all.

2975~~~
Shameful...weak as piss bastard.

2976~~~
No wonder Jose got rid, hopefully he will again. 1st he missed a header which was easier to score, then ran away from the ball for there 2nd goal

2977~~~
Yep. The mistake was hilarious but the fact that he was so peripheral (again) was the bigger problem with his performance today.

Of course a massive amount of that is down to the general malaise around the club. It would hardly be fair to expect Mata to be brilliant when the entire team has collapsed. At the same time, he can't escape all criticism on that basis either. He's one of our best players and we expect more from him so it's only right that he gets more criticism than other players when we're this poor.

2978~~~
Hugs

xoxo

2979~~~
Totally fanny, I'm not buying he was trying to attempt a counter attack. He just basically decided to not go in for the ball. 

Get him sold with the rest of the shite this summer.

2980~~~
He symbolises everything that is wrong with this team, no strength, no pace, no character.

2981~~~
Hurts me to say it, but he's a nothing player.

EDIT:

Actually, I can't be harsh, because to be fair to him, he's been good since he's gone back to the 10 role, apart from this and the Sunderland game. Also, can't be easy when we take so long to get the ball in between the lines, which Carrick is normally really good at. Just didn't happen tonight.

2982~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2983~~~
37.1 million pound player. Dubbed as 'one of the finest playmakers in the game today' by the manager who signed him for us.

2984~~~
He was and will be again.

Is there any player who has shone this season?  Mata hasn't done any worse than the others - Rooney has been pretty ineffective all season, even if better of late. 

I blame the manager completely - he inspires zero confidence and his feckin philosophy has just completely robbed the players of any form of individuality

2985~~~
Having great technique doesn't make you a great player.

Too slow, unneccesary turns, no attacking drive.

Nothing player.

2986~~~
Yep. Mata is the poster boy for this.

2987~~~
The atmosphere around the club right now is bleak, I agree, but out on the pitch in a match I expect a lot more from him and Carrick than we got tonight, they were the 2 I hoped would help us control the match with so much inexperience out there, and both shirked it IMO.

2988~~~
Watching him trying to win the ball back before their second goal was beyond embarrassing, he looked very amateurish.

2989~~~
Pure definition of the luxury player.  As flawed as Veron or Berbatov.  

He should only be a squad player and used selectively in specific situations.  His former this season has been woeful.

Let's not forget he was a Mourinho reject and Chelsea went on to win the league without him.

Would not be central in my future plans for the club.

2990~~~
Mata is not strong enough for the EPL. All the teams in the EPL realized this and will dish out robust play against him. He has been pushed aside many times. Wonder why he didn't get more weight training to build up his physical side. He is more a liability when United play against those sides that will harass him.

2991~~~
Our attack is far too static to take advantage of his creativity and for us his best work is poaching, although he's so immobile that he rarely gets into the area to do that. 

He'll kill it in China.

2992~~~
...and yet he's still one of our best players...

2993~~~
Offered nothing at all tonight, and as for that bit of 'defending' the less said about that the better.

2994~~~
Not good enough, whether mourinho arrives or not he will be gone in the summer.

2995~~~
Im not advocating he's been great, but its odd how there are plenty of other players doing less this season and yet theres no talk of dumping hererra or whoever else to the MLS/China.

I think we need to look at the bigger picture a bit more here, all of our players arent shit, there's issues at play there that are making lads who at their previous clubs have been star players, distinctly average in a united shirt.

The sooner Van Gaal is replaced the better, and we can start to take a more detailed stock of, who or who doesnt make the cut anymore.

2996~~~
He wont survive the next manager

2997~~~
nice little free kick.

about time he got one of those beauties.

2998~~~
Nice little lay off to Martial before the freekick too.

2999~~~
Great today. He should be, but he is. Could easily have had an assist there as well.

3000~~~
Very nice goal.

3001~~~
Bossed it today. It's only Shrewsbury, but still.

3002~~~
When the game opened up in the 2nd half he was good.

3003~~~
Shrewsbury didn't even bother to mark him. Criminal tactics.

3004~~~
Lovely free kick despite it most likely being offside.

3005~~~
Same with Pereira despite being one man up. He just waltzed around them without any problems.

3006~~~
Get him off.

3007~~~
Crap penalty - no two ways about it.

3008~~~
Story of his life.

3009~~~
Told you all from the get go he's bloody naff

3010~~~
So soft.

3011~~~
It's not just a penalty, I forgot he was playing, non visible for large spell of the first half.

3012~~~
Can't even stand out against the midgets. feck off

3013~~~
Dreadful pen, struck it so soft and not wide enough.

3014~~~
It's a mediocre penalty. Looks fine if the keeper guesses wrong.

3015~~~
He had a penalty saved. It happens.

It wasn't even <i>that</i> poor a penalty. If the keeper doesn't guess the right way it looks well placed, if he does it looks weak.

3016~~~
I knew he would miss.

3017~~~
Crap performance from him topped off by a shit penalty. This guy really isn't the type of person you want around when it really matters.

3018~~~
Not horny enough.

3019~~~
I thought he was pretty good to start with. Poor penalty though, too soft.

3020~~~
Can expect him to crumble whenever the pressure is on. Not a clutch player.

3021~~~
Bottler. Shockingly enough.

3022~~~
Jesus christ lads. He missed a penalty... we always miss feckin' penalties, calm down.

3023~~~
I was shitting mysef when he stepped up for that penalty. The keeper looked about 8 foot tall. He wasnt confident at all in Mata putting it away.

Has Herrera missed a pen? He seems to slot them away every time I remember him taking one.

3024~~~
Didn't he have a pretty shit penalty record at Chelsea? I remember he missed one in the CL final too.

3025~~~
He's taken one in his entire career... which is probably why you remember it so well!

3026~~~
He's the senior forward on the pitch and indeed has been for much of the season. And he's been dreadful. Young lads have been showing him up. What I don't get is why Van Gaal doesn't just drop him. Hooks him almost every game so he must recognise these terrible performances. I doubt Perreira would be much more effective but at least he'd be getting experience and would put his fecking back into it. We need fewer soft little passionless crybabies in the team and he's the softest of the lot.

3027~~~
Well it was against Liverpool. The repeat viewing must have made me think he'd taken well over a dozen.

3028~~~
Good job we all didn't overreact about a penalty miss aye?

3029~~~
Played very well despite the pen which was quite poor.

3030~~~
He was poor in general in the first half but much better in the second, even taking some leadership responsibility with the ref.

3031~~~
Right before he struck the penalty he must have had a flashback of the awkwardness he felt when asked about Vangle's "horny" quote.

Other than that, thought he was decent.

3032~~~
Thought he could have done more throughout the entire game. He should be able to impose himself.

That said he had very key contributions in the second half.

3033~~~
The problem with the penalty miss is that it's indicative of his character, I wouldn't have any faith in Mata, Carrick or Rooney scoring a penalty for us. As our 3 most experienced players that worries me. 

The way the kids played today showed more character than Carrick, Mata or Rooney have shown at any point this season.

3034~~~
Doesn't really make sense though considering he'd previously already scored 2 pressure penalties for us...

Also, considering he put the miss behind him and went on to have a big influence in our 2nd and 3rd goals, I'd say that speaks pretty well about his character.

3035~~~
He was very good tonight.

Stupid to judge his performance on a missed penalty.

3036~~~
He was alright. Stepped up once others had.

3037~~~
The shit penalty aside, he was solid and buzzed around all over. Some very good touches and our 2nd goal was great play to not give up on the ball.

3038~~~
I thought he just stepped up straight from the off in the second half - as if the penalty miss kicked him into gear. Pretty much the first thing we did after half time was him putting in a peach of a ball into Schneiderlin who should have scored.

3039~~~
Very good game, he's done well lately.

3040~~~
I don't know lads. He would probably look much better in a better United team but as things stand, he doesn't seem to be what we need. I am generally not a fan of special snowflakes and he is one of them technical pumpkins that work great in a great team and seem spineless in a weaker one. Not a fan, never been. For a guy who relies on technique the most he is making too many technical mistakes.

3041~~~
The rest of his performance against a poor Danish side was good, but if he can't do it against them he should probably hang up his boots. I'm considering the whole season, and 4 premier league goals and 3 assists in 23 starts in my opinion is a poor return.

3042~~~
The penalty was awful, but he was a good tonight. Made a lot runs, created space for the other players. A lot better at no10.

3043~~~
Didnt let the penalty miss affect him, and looked to let it spur him on. His set up for the second goal was lovely..

3044~~~
I thought he recovered well from missing the penalty and was linking things up nicely in the second half. His cut back for the second goal was a sign of the little bit of drive that some have felt is lacking from him at times, needed to get to that and did. Also involved in the build up to number 3 (?) and a few other nice moments. The impetus of our other attackers certainly helped him I think.

If we're to do anything in Europe he's to be a big part of it, I feel.

3045~~~
I think all of them could - should - benefit from good performances tonight. Hopefully their confidence will be higher. I really want Mata to do well because he's such a good role model and a great ambassador for the club.

3046~~~
I think he's been rather poor lately. From a player like him, especially now playing as a no.10, I'd expect much more tbh

3047~~~
Apart from the travesty that was the first leg, he's been in good form for the last 5/6 games. I remember was the only player to come away from Sunderland with any credit.

3048~~~
Mediocre penalty but decent game for him. Some of the comments in the match day thread were excessive imo!

3049~~~
Any reason this little man hasn't had his thread bumped? He was first rate today.

3050~~~
Agreed was pure class ball glued to his feet and made loads of nice passes.

3051~~~
He was close to my man of the match. One of his best games for us.

3052~~~
This man was top today, for a slow player against the speedy Arsenal. 

Hugs Juan

3053~~~
Kept on going while he was at it too. Showed real fight and determination for a change, deserves all the credit today

3054~~~
You answered your own question,I think. Pure class

3055~~~
Juan, hererra, memphis and blind where excellent today. Really gave the kids a platform to express themselves. those little skills, just taking the absolute piss. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3056~~~
Played well today.

3057~~~
There were 2 or 3 occasions where his inability toi turn meant we couldn't get on the front foot to counter, but overall his use of the ball was excellent.

3058~~~
Played really well today. Done a ton of running today too

3059~~~
Man of the match for me. He's finally showing he's one of the most talented players in the PL. He's got the potential to be competing with Özil and the rest of the guys for being the best attacking midfielder.

3060~~~
He was fantastic today - I think he excels in a pacy set-up, despite his own lack of pace. It seems to spur him on to pass more quickly and incisively. A real leader on the pitch today. Hugs Juan!

3061~~~
Good game for him. Involved in the build up to all our goals. Still amazes me how much stick he gets on here. Surprised no one has called him a coward, too weak, slow today.

3062~~~
Was one of the better players on the pitch today, excellent.

3063~~~
A GIF of that skill please.

3064~~~
Mata and Herrera should start together, no one at the expense of the other.

3065~~~
He really has some ridiculous talent on the ball. Showed decent pace today as well, surprisingly. Him and Herrera ran the game for us though. Keep him as the 10 and he can show how good he is.

3066~~~
I think he alongside Schneiderlin would have covered the most ground today.. He was everywhere, tracking back and getting physical too. If Mourinho had a problem with Mata's effort off the ball in the past, that was definately not the case today

3067~~~
One of his best performances for us - looked really up for it.

3068~~~
which minute?

3069~~~
After 85. Memphis had the ball in the corner, gave it to mata. He took the ball behind and basically flicked behind his legs and beat 2 players I think. Then passed it back to TFM or someone.

3070~~~
He's been so much better recently. Just shows how much he can improve when you have players making runs for him instead of staying static and passing it backwards.

3071~~~
Was instrumental today. Pleased to see him do well, great player when on form.

3072~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://imgur.com/kH7gfAN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/kH7gfAN</a>

Mata's heatmap from the game.. Guy was everywhere, immense performance. Especially for a guy who Jose sold for being a luxury player that didn't like to get back and defend

3073~~~

3074~~~
Since being moved into his natural position he's been class.

3075~~~
Oh, it was Januzaj. Sorry. But still incredible to do that and hold onto the ball.

3076~~~
He is so much better as the number 10. Excellent the last few games.

3077~~~
Was very good. That skill towards the end was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3078~~~
Another great performance, he was very good almost every game since he got moved in the middle.

3079~~~
Brilliant again today as he has been for a few weeks now.

3080~~~
Has really stepped up being one of the senior players this past week.

3081~~~
Keeps us ticking.

3082~~~
With how Herrera and Schneiderlin constantly kept pressing higher up the pitch at points, he was excellent at filling in for them (at one point he was our DM!) and yeah... was just excellent with how he put himself about and covered ground. At one point he even got a sneaky kick in on Koscielny... which was hilarious.

3083~~~
Ran his socks off.

3084~~~
Quality. When he is proactive he looks a totally different player. Needs to show this kind of intensity more often.

3085~~~
He is a great player. Hope he keeps going.

3086~~~
His defensive effort has improved massively since joining us.

Was very good today. Not a coincidence his improvement in form has coincided with us playing a bit more direct. He's not suited to a possession game IMO.

3087~~~
You could be right about that. One thing he did today more than usual was run with the ball at his feet. He pushed forward into and through spaces more than I have seen in a while. A possession game doesnt really allow him the opportunity to do that as much.

3088~~~
The difference in Mata when he has fast players in front of him compared to when Rooney is our striker is night and day

3089~~~
Yep, when he has good movement around him he flourishes.

He was great today.

3090~~~
I'm not sure if it's a new thing or if he always ran this much, but the last couple of months I've noticed that he runs like his life depends on it, regardless of opposition, form or result. He's nearly always on top of the "Distance covered"-list, and usually covers 10-12 km every match. He also does a lot of "invisible" defending, the stuff that doesn't show up on stats. Reading the game and positioning himself so that the opposition have to rethink their attack and thereby slowing it down, is worth a lot when your defenders and midfielders are still reorganizing.

3091~~~
It's called pressing and it's why players like Xavi and Iniesta (small and technical) were/are able to do it effectively. Sure in a flat footed race a Walcott might beat you shoulder to shoulder but if you ran ahead of him with you inbetween the goal (and thus slowed their momentum), they must be absolutely amazing to beat you AND past the team mates behind. That whole 7 second rule makes so much sense that it's a wonder why we haven't got a pressing plan/regime in place (as other fans have highlighted in other threads) for a club of our size. It's why so many fans want a Poch or Simone.

If you can get the whole team coordinated and able to do those occassional insane 7 second sprints, the rest of the game you are to snuff the opposition out of rhythm and with the physicality AND technical qualities of the type of players we possess, we should be a very dangerous team on paper. Of course Mourinho could do this too but history tells us it, it'll last for 18months and then sh|t hits the fan (and without the progressive football too).

Ranieri is doing a simple/'low-level' of this within the confines of his squad by letting them play simple tactics (counter-attacking by smothering the ball at certain parts of the pitch and racing up the pitch) but getting them in optimal physical condition every week. He's pretty much said so in interviews. It's extremely effective for the situation they are in.

3092~~~
The so called 7 second rule is so horribly misunderstood.
The trigger for Barca pressing hard was not any 7 second rule, it was related to when they had numbers close to the opposition ball carrier. because of Barca's short passing game they just about always had numbers close to where the ball had just been lost. However anytime they lost the ball and the player had been isolated and didnt have support in numbers bearby they dropped, regained their shape and got set to defend.  They only ever immediately pressed when they had numbers nearby.

3093~~~
I think thats because his his best moments are finding that pass (like the lead up to the third). Having runners for him helps. 

Good game especially second half I thought because he had to adapt a bit given the way the game was going.

3094~~~
We can finally start to see where he fits into the bigger picture. when theres freedom and pace upfront with some space to counter his use of the ball and technical quality really is top class. It was definitely him that said he's half the player under Van gaal. He struggles in a slow tempo side.

3095~~~
Were statistically the best pressing team in the league and were last year as well 
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/uniteds-pressing-copied-from-newbies.402466/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/uniteds-pressing-copied-from-newbies.402466/</a>

3096~~~
If I recall correctly, last year when we had our "purple patch", Herrera and Mata were always the top 2 in distance covered.

3097~~~
Mourinho dropped Mata because his position was the No. 10 and he thought that Oscar had more to offer.

I think that Mata should play in the 10 or not play at all. We need pace on the right, and Lingard brings that. Mata can do the job he does well as long as he has pace and movement around him and the freedom to move into different areas of the pitch to break down the opposition.

I love Mata's ability and good character, but long term, I still see him as a bit too slow and lightweight for where United want to be in the future. I wouldn't be surprised if he moves back to Spain in the summer.

3098~~~
His one-two with Herrera that gave us the second goal was excellent.  This is how we should utilised his game to the fullness.

3099~~~
He's flourishing as a 10 with 3 pacey players around him, and i think everyone on here know that's the style of football he's best suited to.

3100~~~
Oscar's probably the most useless player I've seen play at number 10. Does he ever do anything?

3101~~~
I think it would be a bit dumb to sell the one player of ours who is seemingly never injured, and so always available for selection.

3102~~~
Little Maestro ran the show. No doubt he is benefiting from runners around him. Showing his worth now.

3103~~~
He had a very good game and run non-stop. Finally he showed that he's still a very good player

3104~~~
He thrives when the game's open. The gung-ho football is a lot of fun to watch, I don't know if it's a sustainable option long term.

3105~~~
With a solid backline and a 3-man midfield, I don't see why it wouldn't be sustainable.

3106~~~
It's really interesting how good he is in a counter-attacking setup. Somewhat counter-intuitive given his personal speed, but his mind seems to work so much faster than most players that it more than compensates.

3107~~~
Agreed, which makes me wonder what an incredible player he would be if he had the physical attributes to accompany his technical qualities.

3108~~~
Looks more of the Mata of Chelsea.

You watch Ozil and Silva and you see the way they make space by being on the turn. It's no good being technically good if all you do with it is pluck the ball from the sky. That was my gripe with Mata. He wasn't using his technique to good effect. Now he is. Hope we see him get better. Play good and the stats will come.

3109~~~
Was saying for a while that he's at his best in a counter attacking side with space and runners off the ball. When we are playing a slow, possession style, he cant really dribble past players in an organuzed team, and more often then not, there are less runners off the ball and definitely less space to pick a pass.

3110~~~
On the money....

3111~~~
People focus far too much on physical running speed.  Real speed in football is a function of first touch, body position on receiving, skill and most importantly ball speed. Ball speed not being how fast the ball is actually moving but its transition either from player to player or from defence to attack.

3112~~~
Loved the way he went straight for Ramsey after his mate was pushed to the floor <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3113~~~
Just to pick up on the Oscar thing a few posts up.

Mata is comfortably a better footballer than Oscar and a hell of a lot more useful. I really can't say I rate the latter at all quite frankly. I'd have Coutinho before Oscar and I don't even him much either. I hope if Mourinho is coming he doesn't make that mistake again.

3114~~~
FIFY

3115~~~
Don't know what Mourinho was looking at. Mata is clearly the superior player to Oscar. Has he ever missed a game because of injury? Been playing non-stop since 2010.  Remarkable stamina.
I've had the opportunity to watch him live on several occasions and my view is that the notion he doesn't work hard enough is BS.

3116~~~
Yeah I made a lazy reference but I mean it in pretty much the same principle; win the ball back by getting yourself into the most advantageous situations.

I've said it before in other threads, our laborious getting-back-into-shape (that whole phases of attack and defence LVG wanted) mentality instead of (organised) chasing the ball (i.e pre-philosophised Herrera) meant we covered more 'tiring'-type running as a team and as a result we looked fecking shattered and out of ideas in the final third.

Bursts of high speed sprints (pressing and attacking) is the way forward (with measured possession to control the tempo and our physical levels) it's so obvious.

We did do it well in some games (that 6 game spurt) but it was purely physical and emotionally driven i.e it wasn't sustainable and we didn't develop it as a consistent gameplan. As said in by other posts in that thread though, I don't the stats accurately tell us much about something as intangible as effectiveness of collectively pressing, especially when teams were happily sitting back by purpose and not by our game.

3117~~~
Aye, his work rate has been consistently good since he arrived here.

I think some people place too much importance on the defensive ability of attacking players anyway. Obviously they have to play their part defensively but their primary role is in attack and they should be judged on that basis.

3118~~~
You just had to <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3119~~~
Mourinho likes players to follow specific tasks. Remember what he did to Joe Cole? Joe Cole was a tremendously gifted player but Mourinho insisted he play in a restrictive manner relative to Joe Coles strengths.  Same deal with Mata.

3120~~~
He was great against Arsenal, but what's been most impressing (at least for me) in that performance was his work rate. He just wouldn't stop moving around the pitch, was trying to be everywhere and was always looking for the ball and how to create something, big difference from matches in which he would turn invisible for some time.

Hope he builds on that!

3121~~~
More than work rate it's his proactiveness that's been beneficial. Also, he's really benefitting from A) playing as a 10 and B) Having pace in front and decent options on either side. The pass he played to Rashford for the third goal isn't possible when Rooney is up top.

3122~~~
One thing he's surprisingly bad at is protecting the ball when he's on a dribble.

3123~~~
It's not his first match as 10, he's played it before, just wasn't this good!

Agree that he needs runners around to make a good attacking pass, but not just from striker(s), but wingers too, having more than 1 option is crucial in being unpredictable, when you have 1 option up-front and safe pass then you really can't do much.

But him not shying away from duels and tackling, not hiding in the play that's what made the difference from previous matches.

I've said it once about him, he has all the tools in the box to be really effective player, it's about time he starts using them!

3124~~~
I've been critical of Mata playing as a 10 at times but in the past 7 games played in February his impact has been brilliant.
1 goal vs Shrewsbury
1 assist vs Midtjylland
Shot which was parried for Martial's goal against Sunderland 
Played the pass before the assist for 3 goals against Stoke, 1 against Chelsea, 1 against Arsenal, 1 against Shrewsbury and 2 against Midtjylland

3125~~~
He said that about Rashford, Mata has come alive playing alongside faster players who run in behind the defence with pace.

3126~~~
RedCafe podcast discuss Mata's performances: <a class="externalLink" href="https://audioboom.com/boos/4244835-united-hour-e19-juan-mata" target="_blank">https://audioboom.com/boos/4244835-united-hour-e19-juan-mata</a>

3127~~~
Game has bypassed him totally.

3128~~~
Looking very slow so far.

3129~~~
I know we should only mention him when he's playing poorly but he's bossing the game at the moment.

3130~~~
Bossing is an overstatement.

3131~~~
He's been very good. Constantly shifting play when needed and involved in pretty much everything the team has done in the 2nd half. Watford are very tough team to break down.

3132~~~
Nothing player, sell now.

3133~~~
The way he curled that free kick! Artful.

3134~~~
Loved that celebration from him. Classy goal!

3135~~~
DDG would have saved it <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

3136~~~
Cracking free-kick, that.

3137~~~
Never seen him move so fast!

3138~~~
Masterclass from Hoo-an.

3139~~~
Pff, bottler.

3140~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/z33b" width="560"></iframe>

Should be the only one allowed to take direct free-kicks. Memphis must be fluking them in training or something.

Captain's goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Blog gonna be good

3143~~~
Hugs, bitches!

3144~~~
Captain Fantastic!!

3145~~~
Match-winner.

3146~~~
Not the best performance but it was a beautiful free kick. LVG needs to tell Memphis to stay out of his way as Juan is too soft in that regard.

3147~~~
One of the worst players on the pitch for me tonight, but yeah, he does strike the ball very well. I always liked more that kind of curled balls rather than hard strike like Ronaldo or Memphis tries and usually end up hitting somebody.

3148~~~
Just genuine quality that you need to win shitfest matches like that.

No one else in the team can do that.

3149~~~
Should slap Memphis and claim all the free kicks, enough is enough. Wasnt impresses at all by him tho, it's like Blind playing AM, so slow. His dribbling is that good as well, his touches are too heavy at times and he's too slow to still keep hold of the ball. But fair play for winning us the match.

3150~~~
Did you not watch the second half? He was all over Watford.

3151~~~
Doesn't make a difference when it matters

3152~~~
Yep.

3153~~~
Woeful performance but a brilliant goal.

3154~~~
Luxury player really.

3155~~~
I thought he was one of our better players in the second half even without the goal.

3156~~~
I love Juan!

3157~~~
How can people say that was a bad performance after that second half? He was by far our best player after the break.

3158~~~
Some people will never take to him because they want blood and thunder players.

I absolutely love Mata. Fantastic player.

3159~~~
Shoud hit every free kick in scoring range, sick of Memphis and Rooney taking them over him because he's probably too nice

3160~~~
He was let down by his lack of pace on several occasions which sticks to people's mind as it looks bad. He also showed some very tidy foot work. Considering how the rest of the team was performing he did alright.

3161~~~
Truly a valuable player to have on our roster right now.   His experience and quality mean so much.

3162~~~
I was begging Memphis to shoo from that free kick. Absolute quality that goal. Up there with Beckham's finest.

3163~~~
He used his close control brilliantly to create space, spread the ball with intelligence and purpose and made quite a few key passes. Very potent after the break, don't know how anyone could argue with that. He's just held to other standards than others, I suppose. What constitutes a decent/good performance from other players means awful/useless when it's Mata. It's really tiresome.

3164~~~
He did the basics right, and a couple of his classic "run to the left and pass out wide" moves but that's about it. He was alright in the second half but nothing special, and pretty poor in the first.

3165~~~
Shit first half, our best player in the second. Excellent FK. Watching him in physical battles in midfield is <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3166~~~
He was in Titanic turning circle mode in the first half but played very well in the second, his freekick may turn out to be one of the biggest goals at Old Trafford in recent times.

3167~~~
It's bizarre how a lot of people can't appreciate his qualities.

He was excellent in the second half and capped it off with a stunning goal

3168~~~
Would be madness for Mourinho to sell him. I think I would riot.

3169~~~
How do we not have a chant for him yet?

3170~~~
He was great in the second half, seemed like everything was going through him.

No idea what match some people were watching if they thought he was poor.

3171~~~
Not sure if serious?

Anyways, Juanderful tonight. When we needed something special he provided it.

3172~~~
We do!!

3173~~~
Yeah, yet someone like Memphis gets thumbs up by people when his final product is yet again poor.

Mata has made the mistake of setting the bar too high from when he was at Chelsea...

3174~~~
He was maybe a 4/10 1st half, but 2nd half, he was easily the best player. 8/10 easily the 2nd half. Was brilliant in the 2nd half. Deserved that goal for his efforts in that half

3175~~~
Kicked it up a notch and really imposed himself towards the end of the game.
Was great to see. More please.

I'd rate that as his best performance in a long, long time.

3176~~~
Much better in the 2nd half and a great goal to cap it off.

3177~~~
Brilliant free kick.

3178~~~
Surprised he got man of the match... Thought he was sloppy as everyone else in the first half. Class in the second but MotM went to De Gea for me. Mata plays so much better when we try to attack with pace and when we're direct. That first half we basically reverted to how we played at the start of the season, or tried to, too patient and always playing the safe pass. Second half we improved right when we decided to start being more direct in our passing and running with the ball, and Mata started playing a lot better. Thank feck we changed our mind about subbing him (commentator kept saying we were about to), great free kick.

3179~~~
What is it?

3180~~~
Brilliant free kick, he's genuinely really good at them. I am annoyed with Memphis because he definitely can take them well, and it looked like his one the other day was going in, he just can't seem to get it right on them. I'd only give free kicks to him if they really favour a right footer - anything central or towards the right should always be Mata's

3181~~~
"Who's the greatest player in the Premier League?
It's you Juan, Juan, Juan, it's you Juan, Juan!
Ooohh Juan Mata, Ooohh Juan Mata
It's you Juan, Juan, Juan, it's you Juan, Juan!"

3182~~~
I am probably alone in this but  I thought he was one of our better players for the entire game, it appeared to me that it was those around him who were messing up opportunities and situations in the game.  Ignoring the goal he was my man of the match.

3183~~~
He's properly stepped up in the last few weeks. You've got to take your hat off to him.

3184~~~
That was an excellent free-kick and such a vital moment to score.

3185~~~
Stepped up when it mattered (Mata'd?)

Was nice to see him get the winning goal as captain.

Hugs all around <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3186~~~
Wonderful performance in the 2nd half.  Also has been putting in the effort defensively in the middle of the field that demonstrated his commitment.

3187~~~
That's what Mata is all about isn't it? those individual moments of magic.

3188~~~
I think one of his main attributes is his ability to keep the ball moving, the individual moments of magic are what sets him apart from the Tom Cleverleys of the world.

3189~~~
Decided he was going to single handely keep Van Gaal in the job when he heard the Mourinho rumours.

3190~~~
This <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3193~~~
I've been one of his biggest critics for a while but his performances since he has moved centrally have improved tenfold. Not as good as many in here implicate, but a huge improvement nonetheless. I still think he's ultimately too slow, weak, and easy to dispossess but he's a great player to have within the side.

3194~~~
Many have cited some apparent shift to speedy players ahead of him as the reason for his upturn in form, but personally I think it is mainly due to Herrera being introduced to the team. See how they link up and retain possession, and think that that was Fellaini instead in weeks before.

3195~~~
Herrera helps, but it's more the change to a more direct style. Not even just the pace around him, though it helps like herrera does. But playing a more direct, counter attacking style leaves him with a lot more space to pick up those pockets and turn on the ball and pick out a pass or run with it a bit. When we play possession football, it's too congested wherever he picks it up, so he has to pass it wide or back, and doesn't end up doing much. Basically just compare us and him in the first half to second half. Completely different.

3196~~~

3197~~~
First player to wear the armband for us who did not play under saf for i would assume a very long time.

3198~~~
It's amazing how the cheer starts before it hits the back of the net. Sublime free-kick.

3199~~~
Great FK.

3200~~~
He's really carried us lately.

3201~~~
Ha, I was just wondering about that. People who time-travelled back from 0.5 seconds in the future.

3202~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3203~~~
Was poor in the first half - don't know if he started to play well when the team played better, or he played well which resulted in the team playing better - but he was very classy in the second half, which resulted in a great goal. 

Really needs to be first choice for free kicks - I may be wrong, but I remember he scoring a few for Chelsea too

3204~~~
What a beautiful man!

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/02/21/31C9255600000578-3473669-image-a-19_1456955528664.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/02/21/31C9255600000578-3473669-image-a-19_1456955528664.jpg"/>

3205~~~
Nice observation. But hasn't Herrera ever worn for a few minutes?

3206~~~
You are posting some epic pictures today. Thank you! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3207~~~
I dont think so in a competition maybe in a pre season friendly.

As Ander would be behind Rooney, Fletcher (when he was here), Carrick, Smalling.

3208~~~
He seems to always score a free kick from that area when he's given it. I don't understand why clubs with great set piece takers allow other players with bigger egos to take them. Mata is an absolute specialist in dead ball situations.

3209~~~
Step up when its really matter,
that what we need in team, player how can give moment of brilliance and win us match.

3210~~~
He literally could have been subbed on for the FK, scored and then subbed off again. His overall contribution is very minimal and was constantly marked out and forced away from the #10 position by Watson who had quite a good game I thought.

3211~~~
How many free kicks has he scored for us?

3212~~~
Came through when he needed him. Really stepped up his game the last few games, seems to be working a lot harder too, did a lot of running yesterday.

3213~~~
Similar with Ronaldo and Rodriguez at Madrid.

3214~~~
Of the top of my head I remember three. Last night, Shrewsbury a fortnight ago, and at St. James Park in his first season here.

3215~~~
Away at Southampton under Giggs. Decent return as he doesn't take that many.

3216~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportskeeda.com/football/stats-juan-mata-is-the-most-lethal-free-kick-taker-in-premier-league-history" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sportskeeda.com/football...hal-free-kick-taker-in-premier-league-history</a>

Not sure about these numbers though, Beckham only took 54 free kicks for United? I smell bull.

3217~~~
I wish we could watch games on the tele without commentary.

3218~~~
Yeah, those numbers definitely seem a bit skewed. There is no way Beckham only took 54 and only scored 5 free-kicks in the League, surely? This article <a class="externalLink" href="http://nesn.com/2013/05/david-beckham-scored-65-free-kick-goals-in-his-career-see-them-all-here-video/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nesn.com/2013/05/david-beckh...-goals-in-his-career-see-them-all-here-video/</a> says he scored 29 free-kicks for United so Imagine that more than 5 of those would've been in the League. It's got his free-kick reel on there too and from a quick glance it seems that plenty were league goals

That said, Mata does seem pretty prolific from free-kicks. Easily our most productive free-kick taker anyway

3219~~~
If Jamez was available for say 37mill, would you guys take him as a Mata replacement?

3220~~~
id buy him and chuck him at rw and keep mata.

3221~~~
They are Rumours Madrid want rid of Rodriguez. Hasn't been in form for a while. To be fair to him, he's has a stop start season with injuries.

3222~~~
Let's just use our youngsters for now, it can do wonders. Life is always a bet.

3223~~~

3224~~~
Should try more shots from outside the box,like he was doing in the 2nd half, he has a good shot on him

3225~~~
Lovely free kick, he couldn't have struck it any better. What a night for him being captain as well. Does anyone have any idea who got the armband after he was subbed?

3226~~~
Dave

3227~~~
Must be enjoying it at the moment, with 3 pacy players around him, and his Spanish pal starting too.

Hope they keep it going.

3228~~~
He'd have taken that many in one season! Most game we got loads!

3229~~~
I was sceptical about him playing number 10, as he's had some stinkers and was too weak physically, there but he's been our best player in the last couple of months since he got moved back there. His technique is world class, he just needs the right players around him.

3230~~~
Must mean free kicks where he attempted to shoot. Either way, the numbers look dubious.

3231~~~
I think it was a bit unfair judging him in the no 10 position without a run of games. It's the first time since he's come, that he's getting a run of games.

3232~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZ5RSoaLQZA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Influenced so many of our goals since January.

3233~~~
They diidnt start tracking these stats until late into Beckhams United career.

3234~~~
Juan, Juan, you are a short and beautiful man.

3235~~~
How do I rate a player 0/10 on here?

3236~~~
Almost identical to the stupid red card from Smalling last season against City. Just so pointless. It was already afwul 11v11.

3237~~~
No complaints about it all.

3238~~~
That was Smalling v City - esque. Hopefully it has the same affect on him and he becomes world class, as well.

3239~~~
Ffs.

3240~~~
Better at blogs than football.

3241~~~
Stupid from Mata. For a supposed intelligent footballer. Sigh.

3242~~~
Absolutely deserved.

3243~~~
Why do players do this? So strange.

3244~~~
Incredibly silly from him. Especially considering he's never usually a particularly aggressive player.

3245~~~
Don't need/ want players like that.

3246~~~
I wonder what he'll say about this on his weekly blog. You don't expect comedy gold like this from a player like Mata, who's usually quite intelligent and laid back player.

3247~~~
Moron. Absolute moron.

3248~~~
But but he's world class.

3249~~~
Both were just silly yellow cards for him to get. What was he thinking.

3250~~~
Pretty stupid cards that will likely cost us one of the most crucial games of the season. Disappointing after being captain last week

3251~~~
Idiotic and he knew it. You could tell he was even trying to pull out of that. Just stupid.

3252~~~
Second was just mistimed, albeit a real swipe rather than a tackle. First was daft. No obvious danger from the free kick. Ffs, gonna be a long afternoon.

3253~~~
That's his first red card.

I'm not arguing he is world class by any means but how exactly does a red card affect that?

3254~~~
I suppose you could say a more common sense, less c*nty ref would just have a word there. I'd say at least half the refs in the prem wouldn't send Mata off for that.

3255~~~
The most stupid post I have ever read.

3256~~~
Shit happens.

3257~~~
Mata haters are loving this. Some posters care about about some of their drivel happening than a good Manchester United result it seems.

3258~~~
What a perfect name for this post.

3259~~~
Did you need or want him when he won the game on Wednesday?

3260~~~
Or when he picked his username...

3261~~~
Sad thing is he was our best player before that stupidity.

3262~~~
What a Coq.

3263~~~
Pathetic.

3264~~~
It's so great we got rid of Smalling then.

3265~~~
Exaclty. FFS some need to get a grip.

Guy just won us 3 points the other day. He made a stupid mistake and was slightly unlucky to get a second yellow. It was a late challenge but you would think the benefit would be given to him. Referees always seem to want the limelight.

3266~~~
He's been a passenger in quite a few matches this season then 4 days before a big game vs Liverpool he got himself sent off

3267~~~
Inexcusable really.

3268~~~
he was playing well too.

pity.

3269~~~
Yep. Ref saw a very very rare chance to make a name for himself sending Mata off.

For fecks sake, the guy probably makes about 10 fouls a whole season, so 2 in one game is gold dust to a ref.

3270~~~
You just have to laugh. Moronic but I guess it happens from time to time.

3271~~~
I do think hes also unlucky. You will see players commit 8 fouls before a booking. His first was just daft given the timing of it. The second was mistimed, rather than malicious. Surely the ref should have a word with him rather than just, bang, second yellow.

3272~~~
Like the Smalling sending off vs. City last season. First yellow for blocking free kick going nowhere. Stupid

3273~~~
Basically this. Idiotic, but it happens to everyone now and then. Mata is literally the last person in the world you would expect to get a yellow let alone 2 yellows like he did. Shit happens. That's about it. Sucks for today and hopefully it doesn't cost us, but people are going way overboard.

3274~~~
Bet you were always defending Keane and Cantona though, when they did truly stupid sending offs.

Well...if you supported United back then..

3275~~~
A stupid first yellow, but at the time I was thinking thank god it's Mata. There's little chance of him committing a foul for a second booking. 1 minute later and I was feeling a little foolish.

3276~~~
Worst thing is that he was the only one playing relatively well before he was sent off. Idiot.

3277~~~
I'm not even mad, that was just so uncharacteristic of him. It's fascinating in a way.

3278~~~
Yeah. It ruins the game. The ref should be ensuring that the game remains 11v11. 

A word would have sufficed.

3279~~~
Big difference between getting sent of vs a rival and sent off in a must win game vs West Brom. Don't beat west Brom no chance of getting top 4

3280~~~
I know, I was surprised at him even getting booked in the first place.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3281~~~
That was in no world a red. You dont give a player second yellow for such a light foul!
It was stupid, but red is no way justified.
Its like every tackle where ball is not cleanly won a yellow card now

3282~~~
WTF has Mata done to deserve being mentioned with those two legends?

3283~~~
Just seen the replays, very stupid from Mata. 

Can't blame the ref for either of them, two nailed on yellow cards.

3284~~~
... Away at West Brom is a bigger game than away at City? Really!?

3285~~~
We've all seen many many games where the ref has simply given a final warning.

Not every foul is a booking, but 24 mins in, for something that isn't foul play, I'm amazed.

Would never have been a prospect of a second booking in a big game, but I suppose the ref (who incidentally has the highest red card count in the league) thought he'd spice it up

3286~~~
That was no red mist for Smalling. He had time to think about the slide. Still did it. Came back so much better.
This is Mata's first career red FFS.

3287~~~
Seen the replays again. Blatant red.

3288~~~
If those two had been sent off for any possible booking incidents I doubt they'd have played many full games.

3289~~~
Didn't say that did I

3290~~~
What a strange post! A red card proves he is not world class?

3291~~~
On reflection, I think its bad refereeing. No disputing that to the letter of the law its two yellow cards, but a less attention seeking twat of a ref warns him for one of them and tells him to calm down, keeping 10 men on the pitch.

3292~~~
donut

3293~~~
Your post cleary infers it... 

Or at least that this game is more important (it isn't)

3294~~~
He has done well in recent games. He started off well today.
Stupid red and it might cost us.. but its not like he has a history of picking up silly bookings.

Nothing to say about this really. Just forget it and move on.

3295~~~
You have been spouting nonsense tbh.

3296~~~
Why should the ref ensure the game remains 11 v 11?

3297~~~
He was playing well before that as well. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

I did the exact same thing. Thought I'd cursed him and it was my fault, but since you did the same thing I'll shift blame to you instead...

3298~~~
Your point is?

3299~~~
was looking the most likely to make something happen. We are so fecked

3300~~~
You do know he will not be suspended for the Liverpool,game, right?

3301~~~
What I meant to say was that it's more understandable getting sent off vs a rival then west Brom

3302~~~
It's not the refs job to keep everyone on the pitch, nor is there any rules about such a thing as 'too early' for a card. Two bullshit notions.

3303~~~
I don't think any other ref other then Dean sends him off. It was his first foul of the game and it wasn't malicious, just have a word and move on.

3304~~~
That makes no sense at all.

3305~~~
...Do you rememebr what Smalling was sent off for?

3306~~~
I know but most of the 10 will play, they have to work harder so fatigue could set in with 10 min to go in that game

3307~~~
If only a certain someone hadn't made a habit of picking up pointless red cards...

3308~~~
Sorry, why is this even relevant?

3309~~~
Because a countless number of people are watching. Its not like both offences wwre dangerous. Just stupid. Ref could have simply had a word.

3310~~~
2nd was a Rash tackle on James Milner, can't remember the 1st

3311~~~
That isn't the ref's job.

3312~~~
Very stupid of Mata and a shame as he was one of the most important players the last games. also bad that he will miss the fa cup game now

3313~~~
The first was for blocking Joe Hart trying to kick the ball out or something like that iirc.

3314~~~
Could be pointing out that the 10 players on the pitch will have to work harder thus get more tired with one man down or something.

3315~~~
First was for blocking Joe Hart kicking the ball out. Almost the exact same type of red. Shit happens, move on.

3316~~~
Booked for blocking a free kick.

His sending off in that game wasn't remotely "understandable" ... it (also) was stupid.

3317~~~
and scholes <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

a bit rich coming from a poster named paulscholes

3318~~~
I guess. Doubt it will have any bearing on Thursday though.

3319~~~
I don't agree, referees have to use common sense. If players got sent off for every two fouls they committed every time then most games would end with a red card or two.

This is not to argue that Mata was unlucky, he forced the referee to make the decision and he applied the rules of the game, but they'll have been plenty of others who have done as much as much as Mata did against us and not got booked.

3320~~~
Most of these players will play vs Liverpool, when playing with 10 men they have to work harder so fatigue could set in late vs liverpool

3321~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://j.gifs.com/M87vGO.gif" src="https://j.gifs.com/M87vGO.gif"/>

3322~~~
Mata committed two yellow card offences, that's all there is to it. It doesn't matter how small they might be, it'd be the same as pulling someone  back on a break, not malicious or hurting anyone, but a yellow card.

The ref has no responsibility to keep players on the pitch, it's not on him to maintain the spectacle of the game, he's there to enforce the rules. 

I'm always moaning about the idea of refs letting things go because it's too early, I'm not changing my views now just because it's our player on the receiving end of the right call.

3323~~~
That was funny

3324~~~
Here's the thing... If Mata wasn't already on a booking, do you think he would have got a first booking for that challenge? 

As it was his first foul and he just mistimed kicking the ball, I'm almost certain Dean would have just given him a warning... considering we saw Blind kick someone in the head a few minutes before that and he didn't get a card.

3325~~~
Yes.

3326~~~
So why didn't Blind get booked for kicking someone in the head?

3327~~~
Yeah really difficult one Rado, but I think I'd order your view myself. It's very frustrating when you see blatant yellows not given because it's either too early or the player is already booked etc. it's one of my pet hates in football. Yesterday for instance, ref sends off Coq but bottles the Dier decision.

It's not the refs job to "keep the match 11 v 11". Agreed. I think the refs have just sat a precedent through the ages.

3328~~~
Maybe, but given the stupidity of both cards, it's difficult to give Mata any sympathy. Bit of a cliche but don't give the ref a decision like that to make.

3329~~~
I don't know the incident you're referring to, I missed most of the first half and only saw the Mata incidents on HT replays, but an incorrect call elsewhere doesn't change the fact that the calls on Mata were right.

3330~~~
Can't argue with that, and it's that side of things that should change.

3331~~~
Because referees are often woefully inconsistent. I'd say Mata's was fairly borderline, in that a more lenient ref would've given a warning even without a prior booking, but it's still a relatively fair yellow and we can have little cause for complaint. Of course, though, the problem is that certain ref's would view it differently, and refs will make poor/inconsistent decisions.

3332~~~
Unfortunately, this.
Yeah, agreed.

3333~~~
The reason it's a problem is the difference between different referees. Dean sends off Mata, fine, letter of the law and that. But then yesterday in the Arsenal v Spurs match there wouldn't have been any players left if those challenges were yellows. 

I wonder if the coaches prep the players on what ref is in charge. If not, they should.

3334~~~
feck off Mata! All that momentum and spirit down the drain.

3335~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Real talk though, as deserving as Mata is of criticism this season, one misjudged tackled while on a booking can definitely be overlooked.

3336~~~
As poor as it was from him, I'm not sure his sending off did anything to our momentum or spirit. We'd been fairly dire in the early stages of the game too.

3337~~~
This ones on him. Put his team mates under the cosh for no reason.

3338~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3339~~~
He's a liability defensively. He's not a leader. Always fluffs under the slightest bit of pressure. No attacking threat. Terrible performances bar the odd game. 
Complete failure as a United player.

But he writes blogs and hugs so we can forgive him for his ineptitude.

3340~~~
With how we started the game, and our away record... Did you really see us winning this game even with 11 men?

3341~~~
Cost us the game today with his stupidity.

3342~~~
I really want to punch him. ENjoyed that from your VIP seat up there you cnut?

3343~~~
I'm sick of senior team players letting us down time and time again. If that would have happened to a youngster I could understand it but not to a player as experienced as Mata and not like this.

3344~~~
He pulled out of the kick. Never a second yellow. 
Terrible refereeing...

3345~~~
Blind mis-judges trying to kick the ball and kicks someone <b>in the head</b>.... no booking.
Craig Gardner slides in on Lingard and wipes him clean out, stopping him from putting a threatening (ha! Lingard!) cross into the box... no booking.

Juan Mata misjudges kicking the ball and trips Darren Fletcher, whilst trying to pull out of the challenge... and he's in his own half with players around him... second booking and a red card.

It's complete bullshit. Dean would not have booked Mata for that challenge had he not already been booked. He didn't send him off because he had too, he sent him off because he wanted too.

3346~~~
Very stupid from him, tbf.

3347~~~
Oh I should say that it's definitely stupid from him... I realise he's trying to kick the ball, but no need to even attempt it in that situation.

However, Dean absolutely did not have to send him off... based on his own refereeing of other similar incidents within the same game of football.

3348~~~
Stupid and out of character sending off. We struggle enough with 11 men, winning with 10 was never going to happen.

3349~~~
I am of the opinion that the second yellow didn't need to be given by Mike Dean. It was Mata's first foul, not that reckless or dangerous, he was trying to play the ball and West Brom weren't on the break. This doesn't mean that Mata wasn't stupid to put the ref in a position like that, but we are talking about a player who has never been sent off in his career before. A final warning to Mata would have been enough.

3350~~~
Was it really two yellows in two minutes?

3351~~~
Stupid from Mata but both incidents would probably only be a yellow card 50% of the time. When already on a yellow that second challenge would probably only get someone sent off 10% of the time. 

Either incident in isolation should have resulted in a warning, particularly the second when he was already on a booking. 

It's Mike Dean though... I'd like to think managers prep their team for referees who are as interested in making headlines as they are officiating games. He's the worst ref in the League and has been for years.

3352~~~
Although Mata did pull out he shouldnt even have attempted it in the first place. Thats a very dangerous tackle and if he had mistimed it or didnt pull out sooner that could have been a serious injury for either player.

I dont hate Mata since he rarely does this but it sucks. Reminded me of Smallings stupid red against City.

3353~~~
It was stupid but it didn't cost us the game IMO, our style of play is what hurt us yet again, we had plenty of the ball in the second half but the rigidity in the forward line and sloth-like midfield meant we never turned West Brom around.

The only thing that really irritated me was how blase he was about it, although I'm sure he'll write a blog tomorrow aplogising to his crew of mancrushers.

3354~~~
im with you, its a joke of a red as most are this days...fecking no contact sport, makes me sick. But nevertheless, Mata should really know better so it was a pretty stupid card to receive. Shame as he started the game really well.....

3355~~~
That was a great finish <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3356~~~
Come on. You can't really believe this.

3357~~~
It's easy to believe when you consider a) how we started the game and b) our away record.

3358~~~
I do, and it has nothing to do with the Mata love that goes on here, check back and you'll see I am one of his biggest critics. We had lots of the ball in the second half and did nothing with it, that's on us, and the defending on the goal was amateur hour, it wasn't as if we spent 60 minutes manning the fences after he went off.

3359~~~
Many players are having their careers cut short or losing their prime years due to injuries...and you want the sport to be even more physical?

3360~~~
Hugs

x

3361~~~
Agree with this. It was poor refereeing imo but very typical of Mike Dean who always wants to be centre of attention. I seen similar or worse fouls in the game without bookings and can't see why a final warning wouldn't hav sufficed for what was quite a nothing tackle that Mata tried his best to pull out of

3362~~~
Someone DDOS Mata's computer tonight so he can't upload his blog. Stupid moron.

3363~~~
Looked to me recently like he's been told after pulling out of that tackle a few games ago he has to do more. He isn't a natural tackler though and isn't very brave, I could almost see him go to pull out of the second challenge then realise shit I need to make an effort here which was why it was so badly times/rash.

I actually think he has been playing better as well recently. I honestly don't think SAF would ever have allowed a number 10 like him who cannot tackle. We always have had players there who can work defensively as well. We used to expose teams like City with Silva and Arsenal with there forward players not being able to do defensive duties. You can tell Mata tries but it's all to half hearted.

3364~~~
Both Pool and Arsenal went down to 10 men in their games this weekend. Liverpool went on to overturn a 1-0 deficit to win the game. Arsenal were inches away from doing the same. 

We, on the other hand, were pathetic with 11 as we were with 10. Look at our recent PL performances - awful against Chelsea, Sunderland, Watford and West Brom. One half decent game against Arsenal doesn't change that. We haven't turned a corner. We're regressing and there's still room for more (shitness, that is).

3366~~~
The first yellow was unbelievably stupid. The second even more so in the context. I will be very glad to see the back of this lightweight when Mourinho arrives. He might not be the worst player we have signed but, for some reason, he just encapsulates for me how badly wrong we have gone the last few years - signing players without character and without any thought on the part of the management as to how they will make the whole more than the sum of its parts.

3367~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3368~~~
United have always been pathetic when down to ten men. So much so that threads were made about it wondering wtf other teams can put up a fight when we offer feck all once we get a red. All on Juan Mata this one.

3369~~~
We were terrible before the sending off so I really don't even blame him that much. Yes, it was stupid but that's about it, we were pathethic before the red card and I doubt we would have won the game anyway.

Not justifying him because he shouldn't be doing such a stupid thing as a senior player, but I am not really mad either.

3370~~~
I have never seen such a pathetic performance from 10 men before. We went down to ten against City and Arsenal, last season and were 10 fold better than today.

3371~~~
Absolute madness from him, cost us the game, thought we were doing OK before he went off, West Bromwich showed no intention of leaving their half until the red card.

3372~~~
Coquelin, Milner, and now Mata. It's a weekend for bafflingly stupid red cards.

3373~~~
Mata's 1st was sort of justified from ref's point of view. But that was basically a 0.5 yellow card. The second was a foul. Thats it. He pulled out of the challenge, and the referee to just show his authority might have talked to mata that he is on thin ice. There was no need for a card there. Rather, even if he wasn't on a card, I dont think it was a yellow card worthy foul. The 2nd was in no way a tackle that could have led to injuries, or had malicious intent

3374~~~
Maybe, but there is no way he comes out of this blameless. 10 vs 11 is a disadvantage in defence and attack, Mata was a moron. 

We all knew of our average away record and he made the task even harder 20 mins into the match.

3375~~~
Oh boy... Mourinho must be delighted with selling him to his future team. He probably still gonna pull some match winning performances this season so no witch hunt, hopefully. We just need to win most of remaining matches and he still may be extremely useful then.

3376~~~
Turns out you can't give a 0 rating so he gets a 1 from me. Possibly my first 1 rating. He cost us any chance of taking points from today.

3377~~~
His sending off certainly cost us the game, or at least ensured that we were never going to win.

It shouldn't be that way though. We should be able to compete against West Brom even with ten men, at least to the extent that we aren't <i>sure</i> we have no chance of winning. If we were a well run team then going down to ten men would be a blow rather than a death sentence.

3378~~~
Jose's not going to like this. Just as he was getting back into some solid form too. Ridiculous.

The Atleti rumours may grow stronger soon...

3379~~~
Same with me! I was having a chuckle about it and then....moronic from Mata, but shit happens. I'm sure he feels awful now.

3380~~~
The definition of a luxury player. One of the reasons I'm pro Mourinho is to see the back of Mata.

3381~~~
Yeah. It was pretty luxurious of him to pretty much single handidly win us all 3 points on Wednesday.

3382~~~
Thin both yellow cards were deserved, the first one was just stupid. At least the 2nd he tried to pull out but still caught him

3383~~~
So idiotic, so inexplicable by him it's unreal. Could probably understand that from a younger player or somebody rash with challenges but from Mata?

3384~~~
He's been incredibly average/poor his entire time at United. One set piece won't change that Mourinho was right about him and he is a luxury player, he was very poor vs Watford up until he scored the freekick as well.

3385~~~
No he wasn't, he was one of our best players in the second half... like he was one of our best players against Arsenal,

3386~~~
Agreed. Not the player we thought we were getting. But I guess Arsenal can say the same about özil.

3387~~~
And what about the first half when we got completely overran and should have been 2-0 down? He certainly wasn't one of our best players vs Arsenal.

3388~~~
I feel like the phrase 'luxury player' is a bit daft in general. I assume it implies someone who's alright, but fairly expendable...but it's never really explained in depth by those who use it and has become a weird cliche that people seem to use a lot regarding him whenever he has a poor game.

He's had spells this season where he's largely been anonymous, but I'd still have him down as one of our better attacking players this season (not a great feat admittedly) because he's produced some good goals/assists at times. I mean, our 3-0 win against Stoke a few weeks back was probably one of our best this season (again, admittedly, not too difficult), and Mata was involved heavily in the build-up for every single goal. If a luxury player is someone who produces a few nice touches but doesn't do much else, then I'm not sure how Mata applies...because for all of his faults, of which there have been plenty in his time here, he is actually quite productive. Which isn't a luxury at all...it's an essential.

3389~~~
He was brilliant against Arsenal. Anyone saying otherwise has agenda tinted specs on... hell, even some of his biggest critics on here praised his performance in this very thread after that game.

First half vs. Watford everyone was crap... so at least he and a few others turned up for the second half.

3390~~~
Nah, both were yellow cards.  Both were silly yellow cards.

3391~~~
Can't expect much from people that speak in phrases and bullet points without explaining themselves whatsoever. They're best ignored.

3392~~~
Memphis/Herrera/Varela/Rashford all rated higher than him so be realistic. I have no idea who his biggest critic on here is so that's a non argument. He has the odd moment of quality games but his overall contribution is average.

3393~~~
He was excellent against Arsenal. Even posters who dislike him said as much.

3394~~~
So typical of him - his entire Utd career has been one step forward two steps back. I can't wait til we aren't relying on the likes of him anymore and I wish we had never bought him.

3395~~~
It may end up being another "world class" debate since people are likely to have different definitions of what defines the term. For me he's a luxury player because he can't perform to a high level without having the team built around him or playing to his strengths specifically. When he's out wide he's wasted due to lack of pace/ability to beat players, and when he get's played in the 10 and has a stinker it's because we need pace in the wide areas to get the best out of him or because Rooney is the striker (which I partly agree with for the record) or the CM's don't offer enough support and play too cautiously etc, there's just always an excuse and it doesn't surprise me that our midfield regularly get's overran when he's at the 10 and players who've looked excellent in previous clubs/teams are far worse with him around I.E Darmian/Schneiderlin.

He's not Messi/Ronaldo/Aguero etc He's not good enough to build a team around and there's plenty of attacking midfielders in Europe we'd be better off with in the team.

I don't recall using too many bullet points but next time I'll be sure to respond within 5minutes so you don't get so upset.

3396~~~
I don't like him and he wasn't one of our best players, as I mentioned above 4 others got rated ahead of him in the match day voting so let's not go overboard. Even if he was having the odd game here or there isn't enough to justify his inclusion when he's completely anonymous for long spells of the season. Mata is a 37m international on huge wages, sure he's done alright when you compare it to Lingard/Memphis but he should be getting compared to the alternatives we could and should be looking at. Griezmann being the obvious stand out name.

3397~~~
You mean players who were anywhere between .2 and .4 higher rated? I can be realistic if you don't want to be pedantic.

Personally I thought he was one of our best players... Objectivity he was excellent.

3398~~~
I'm using an actual rating system since the argument really doesn't go anywhere if it's based on your eye test and opinion vs mine. There's also a number of players who are within .2 and .4 of him rated lower.

3399~~~
Very stupid of him but oh well, it happens. He's been one of the players that has stepped it up recently so I can't be too mad at him. We still should have won today as well.

3400~~~
Completely agree.

3401~~~
Even by using the "official rating system" he's still one of our best players along with those other 4. There is no real limit as to how many can be your better players.

The rating also shows he had a very good/excellent game... So you're whole argument is completely self defeating.

He was voted MOTM on this forum vs. Watford. You said he was crap... Go figure.

3402~~~
He was good vs Arsenal, doesn't excuse him idiotic display today though.

3403~~~
Mata's one of those players who even when he's having a good game there's loads of posts in the match thread giving him grief. 

He's an important cog in our team and talk of dropping him for the EL game because of today is just silly. A couple of daft yellows don't justify pulling him from the team, that's the epitome of knee jerk. 

I'm also not sure what this 'luxery player' concept is all about. Sounds like something Redknapp would say.

3404~~~
You for example said "he's the definition of a luxury player". What the hell do you mean by that? Luxury is something that's not needed but what you enjoy. Like having yourself an ice cream or going out to eat at a restaurant. What has that got to do with Mata as a player?

3405~~~
When you're talking about being one of the best players it (in my opinion) clearly infers the few best so there would be a limit. 

We were absolutely awful vs Watford and no United player deserved MOTM. He certainly wasn't alone in his performance but it's just another example of how average he is and how many things have to be put in place for him to succeed. He's not close to good enough for a club like United to consider building a team around.

3406~~~
Really weird thing for him to do, there was no need to block the free kick from been taken, and the tackle is not something he is really known for, so to do it straight after his first yellow is pretty bemusing.

Don't really blame him, we weren't playing well before he went, and he shouldn't be used as an excuse, but just find it odd from him.

3407~~~
I've already explained what I mean by that. Maybe you should scroll up or do you only read posts with bullet points?

3408~~~
Apart from the four fouls Craig Gardner committed, including one which stopped Memphis from bringing the ball into the box.

No consistency.

3409~~~
The sending off was stupid but it was also totally out of character for Mata. LVG said he's never been sent off before and there's a good chance we'd never see him get sent off again even if he stayed here for the rest of his career.

As such it's totally irrelevant when it comes to assessing him as a player. It was literally a once off. People who already have a negative opinion of Mata are using today as another stick to beat him with, even though it has absolutely nothing to do with why they were criticising him in the first place.

It's fair enough to criticise him for being stupid today but it's pretty ridiculous to hold this up as an example of why he's a luxury player or why he should be sold.

3410~~~
You haven't explained shit. You said that he's been poor his entire time at United which is rubbish but you didn't further explain yourself at all. Saying "I like chocolate but not strawberries" is not explaining why you like one and dislike another. It's just stating a preference.

3411~~~
Totally agree. The last time one of our players was crucified on here for being stupid and getting himself sent off, it was Smalling. Some people wanted him gone even!

Mata was stupid but you can also see how important he is to the team by how devoid of ideas we looked after he went off.

3412~~~
Spot on.

3413~~~
The player least likely to get sent off, gets sent off. Ugh. Thought he was playing really well too.

3414~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> can it be less physical then it is now?

3415~~~
It's becoming a bit of a common theme for him to let us down at a point when we are trying to kick on. Wether it's a bad performance, a missed penalty, or today a stupid sending off - he's made a habit of letting us down.

3416~~~
Aye, not like he went on to skillfully set up our very next goal or anything.

3417~~~
He won us the previous game. 

I know it's a long time ago, but still.

3418~~~
You seem to be under the impression that every goal or assist he provides is some type of bonus - something we should thank him for. It isn't - he gets paid millions to actually play well once in a while. I'm not going to blow smoke up his arse for sometimes doing what he should be doing all the time - I will criticise when he lets us down again and again however.

Your obsession with him is becoming a bit obvious by the way. He fecked up today (and numerous times in his utd career) - people will point this out.

3419~~~
First one out the door when Jose comes in the summer, please.

Thanks.

3420~~~
Win us one game and then cost us another, maybe even two. Story of his utd career - one step forward and two steps back - and I can't see why so many are happy/willing to accept it.

3421~~~
I do think you make some decent points there, but I do think it does a little bit of a disservice to Mata in that he's put in plenty of decent performance from out wide. I don't think it's particularly fair to blame the poor performance of other players on Mata. Darmian being horrid going forward has nothing to do with Mata, and nor does Schneiderlin regularly being completely anonymous.

3422~~~
When someone claims he let us down in a game where he actually went on to do something that actually got us back into the game... Then that's a bit daft isn't it? That's like saying he let us down against Watford cos he was shit in the first half.

I'm obsessed with giving players their fair due... If someone says Mata was crap against Watford and Arsenal I'll call them on it... Similarly, if someone claims he let us down by missing a penalty, despite the fact that he attoned for his error later, I'll call them on that too.

At what point did I say he didn't feck up today? Just cos I don't think Dean had to send him off doesn't mean I didn't think it was stupid. I've already said he was stupid for giving an overly officious referee like Dean a desicion to make.

3423~~~
He didn't cost us the game today.

I'm not excusing him, and he sure as hell didn't help, but I honestly don't think having 11 players would have changed anything. You only have to look at the similarity to countess other games to come to the conclusion that we'd have likely created the square root of feck all anyway.

Edit: not to mention that we should still be able to beat that shower of shite even with 10 men.

3424~~~
He <i>does </i>get assists/goals on a fairly regular basis though, and has generally done so since he arrived. I do think he often needs to be offering us a lot more, but when youhave a player who has decent productivity, it's only fair to praise them for that.

He doesn't regularly cost us games, though. He's one of many players who have often underwhelmed at times. Even today, our defeat extended beyond having 10 men, since we were poor from the start...although I'll agree Mata has a large degree of culpability for his stupidity.

3425~~~
The club should just put him out of his misery. Hopefully this summer.
Nice guy, pretty technique, occasional great performance... But ultimately not good enough for where the team needs to be. Today's red card isn't even a big issue. He's unlikely to ever receive another red in his career. But he's just not good enough anyway.

3426~~~
I'm more talking about his utd career in general, every time he looks like he's playing close to what we expected when we bought him, he throws in a horrible performance, pulls out of a vital tackle, misses a penalty or gets sent off - there's always something and it's happened too often now. Very disappointing signing IMO.

3427~~~
Agreed.

3428~~~
Huge out of character mess up today, but I still think it was harsh that early. Plenty of games you'll watch where someone is deserving of a booking but the ref just lets it go as it's "too early". typical little Dean to be an ass.

Won't hold it against Mata, everyone's allowed a mistake. Hasn't exactly made many with us has he, whatever you think about his overall contribution.

Back in the team Thursday for sure, as he'll now obviously miss the West Ham game.

3429~~~
Two of those four things that apparently always happen have happened once each.

3430~~~
Might not cost us directly but being so ineffective so often is damaging enough - particularly for a £35M signing who is arguably meant to be our creative fulcrum.

3431~~~
The bad performances happen every other week - so that makes up for it.

3432~~~
Yea that's plainly not true either.

3433~~~
So missing a penalty isn't letting the team down? Bullshit. Of course it is - even if you do set up a goal later in the game.

You guys clearly don't want a proper discussion on this matter.

3434~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3435~~~
Well explained.

3436~~~
So you're saying there's no way to atone for missing a penalty? Regardless of what you do after, you've let the team down and that's that?

3437~~~
Yeah.

You're meant to score penalties and not get sent off - not doing this is letting the team down. Doing something good later in the game goes some way to make up for it, but doesn't take away from the fact that it was a let down in the first place.

3438~~~
Thanks.

3439~~~
Pretty negative way to view football... but fair enough. What about own goals / errors leading to goals / missing open goals?

3440~~~
So Aguero let City down yesterday then? Even though he also scored twice in the game?

In reality Mata's penalty miss would barely have been mentioned if, say, Martial had done it. Another example of people using a relatively minor and excusable mistake as a stick to beat Mata with because they don't rate him generally.

3441~~~
You must be an incredibly hard person to please.

3442~~~
I never used today as an example of him being a luxury player. 

Yes I have, if you can't be bothered to read through previous posts then that's on you, Cheesy however did respond to my post.

Decent performances every now now and then yes I agree with you on that, but is that really the standard we're setting for our attacking players and specifically someone who cost 37m and earns big wages?  I wouldn't be surprised if the performances of Darmian/Schneiderlin are considerably better when he's gone but only time will tell. 

Agreed. There's a number of players who can make us better in his specialist position alone nevermind if we were to change the team's structure and go for a 4-3-3 without a standard number 10. The guy isn't good enough and one of the reasons I'm pro Mourinho is he knows it and is ruthless enough to sell him with no hesitation. 

Barca were already one of the best sides in Europe when they had Pedro/Sanchez but moved both on because they could upgrade to Neymar/Suarez. When there's 10+ players minimum we could look at who could offer us far more than Mata it's time to say goodbye.

3443~~~
Errors are errors, there's no escaping it. A missed penalty, an own goal, both could cost you at the end of a season (goal difference for example).

Problem with Mata is that he probably has as many bad games as good - meaning his overall contribution isn't enough.

3444~~~
Yeah I must be - wanting professionals to score penalties and not get sent off. Such unreasonable expectations!

3445~~~
A missed penalty is a let down yes, he had the opportunity to boost their goal difference but failed, which could be costly. The goals he did score, he should be credited for, but it doesn't mean that his penalty miss is excusable.

3446~~~
Maybe this is even true, but we have much bigger issues. Surely the logical thing is to spend big on the best, fairly young, mobile, passing CM we can get to play in a trio with Herrera and Schneiderlin and then Mata will be the 10 option and get lots of starts when one is out or we play a diamond or need offense or whatever.

From where I sit we have bigger holes at RW and CM than at the 10. Mata ain't perfect, but he's a productive, technically solid player. Unless James wants to come here, I think replacing Mata with a better 10 is a luxury problem for us at the moment, and I think we missed our chance to do it this past summer when De Bruyne, who would have been perfect as the man here. After those guys, there's no 10 out there I think we could actually get that is dramatically better than Mata.

3447~~~
Mata is a great player with a good head. Today he fecked up and got his first ever red. Shit happens. I still love the guy.

What bothered me the most was not the red card, but the overall shit performance. We just dont play very well and the red card is just a stupid excuse. 

It has been some good results lately, but our performance has not been great in all our wins. The only solution is LvG and his staff out. So this season is a write off.

3448~~~
I agree Mata is not the biggest problem but, if the verdict is that he is not good enough to help us return to the top (and that is certainly my opinion), then it makes sense to get a high earner off the books who still has resale value. He can be replaced either with a genuine elite level number 10 or, if that is not feasible, a younger, cheaper player who has the potential to develop into an elite player. Basically, United shouldn't be carrying people in their mid to late twenties on big wages who are good, top 6 type players.

3449~~~
Mata's contribution to the team is like Blind's contibution to our defence, excelent performance in one game and poor in the next two or good first half and awful second half. So  overall his contribution is below average.

3450~~~
Funny how people give Mata so much shit. He is a great player playing for a shit manager.

3451~~~
I'd concur with most people on here...probably not at the level we need but not our biggest issue. Still has a role to play in the short term

3452~~~
The least of our problems right now ffs.

Those that say he's not "United quality" demanding for him to be sold when we have Jesse fecking Lingard as our starting RW, relying on Rooney for goals and having a CM as our <i>ball-playing</i> CB. Feck off.

3453~~~
Yeah, I do find that a bit strange. For all of his aforementioned faults, Mata remains one of our more technically gifted players and is often quite productive. He's arguably one of the last players we should be getting rid of in this current side.

3454~~~
really bright start to the game, really loved that dribble down the right but both yellow cards = absolutely stupid, let alone the second yellow which was dark orange for me, frustration all over the place..

What was he thinking?! It had to be a rush of blood to the head because he's not normally like that. His stupidity cost us the game today and potentially a late push on getting into the top four. Only gave him a 2 in his rating because of that excellent bit of play with Martial otherwise it would've been a 1.

3456~~~
I just don't get it. He was fully committed to follow through on that kick, even when it was obvious that it was only ever going to be a foul. I really wonder what the feck went through his mind.

3457~~~
Yeah. Attempting to give youth a chance and minimize the amount of transfers, I'd have something like this as the 2016-17 squad:
<span style="text-decoration: underline">
Martial, <b>RW</b>, Memphis, 
Rashford, Wilson, Januzaj, Lingard

<b>CM</b>, Herrera, 
Mata, <b>CM2,</b> Pereira

Schneiderlin, 
Schweinsteiger

Shaw, Varela, 
CBJ, Darmian

<b>CB</b>, Smalling, 
Blind, Fosu-Mensah

De Gea, 
Romero</span>

I really don't want any more mediocre players. But that team is real threadbare so a couple versatile pros probably should stick around. One of Rojo or Jones, one of Valencia or Young and either Rooney or we sign an attacker without breaking the bank, like with Chicharito or OGS if it goes well, or Diouf if not quite so much.

3458~~~
Mata is arguably the most technically gifted player at United. But his overall play is too inconsistent to be the catalyst for a top team...unless he's surrounded with the top quality that is needed for him to truly flourish over an entire season. United currently don't have these players or their quality isn't there yet.

Mata let himself down and his team down today. It was always going to be difficult breaking down West Brom going into today's match, not even considering their form of the past two weeks has been good. He's too frustrating and too inconsistent to fully rely on. No excuses for him today.

3459~~~
What pisses me off so much about him is that the bookings were so damn unnecessary and out of nowhere. The game was just getting started. A real let down today.

Hopefully he pulls a Smalling and comes back from this in beast mode <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3460~~~
But no ref gives a yellow for that after 25 minutes if the player is already on a yellow

3461~~~
Thats a stupid pracitise though. We quite often hear "oh if it wasnt the last minute of extra time the ref would surely give a penalty for that tackle". Timming shouldl not.affect refs decisions.

3462~~~
Leaving the timing aside, the 2 yellows as a combo to get a red is just not justified. Individually they are yellow, although the 2nd one IMO wasnt, but no ref gives a player his 2nd yellow for a tackle with no harmful intent

3463~~~
I feel for him, it was a silly challenge but the stupidity was the first one. Completely pointless in that case, the second was him just trying to win one and getting it wrong. What I really want to see from this is Pereira come into the team or the team switch back to a 4-3-3 that we threw in the bin to accommodate Mata in the middle and not on the right.

Blessing in disguise, chin up Juan. Hugs.

3464~~~
The problem was Mata, not the ref.

3465~~~
Why don't you ask Luke Shaw.

"Oh but freak accidents happen!"

Yeah they happen precisely because of high risk tackles that suddenly go from harmless to dangerous when mistimed. That's why high risk tackles should be punished accordingly.

3466~~~
Thing is, by Deans own refereeing of that game, he wouldn't have booked Juan if he hadn't already been on a booking.

3467~~~
But what if Mata didn't pull back in time? Then what happens? Someone's leg gets broke or a player goes flying through the air? That was a very reckless challenege at full speed when both players are sprinting for the ball, and we were fortunate that Mata just barely managed to pull back enough in time. But he almost didn't, he was almost too late, since the guy did go flying anyways. And we all know these guys are wearing lighter and thinner shin guards than what us normal people can buy at the store for our local pub games.

Wacking each others shin's when standing still is one thing, but doing that at full speed is something we should never see in football so I think Dean made the right call, if based only on the "what if?" factor.

3468~~~
Eh? You can't book someone for something they didn't do.

What if Blind had followed through and kicked Berainho with full force in the head? What if Gardener had launched in with two feet on Lingard? These are both "what ifs" ... yet neither happened. Mata DID pull back out of his challenge, so he didn't follow through, meaning it wasn't reckless... If Mata had followed through and kicked Fletcher with full force, you'd be right... but he didn't, and he didn't because Juan Mata made sure that he didn't.

3469~~~
Respect for his apology. Something was troubling him yesterday and out of character with his normal behaviour on the pitch.

3470~~~
Like <a class="username" data-user="56592, @Annihilate Now!" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56592/">@Annihilate Now!</a> said, the tackle even had it been a full swing would have been at most a slight knock and the game would have resumed with the players on the pitch. There were tackles in that game itself that were more dangerous in intent: Blind's high boot, and that wasnt even carded! Look at the tackle on Shaw that broke his leg. That was a hard but clean tackle, but there wasnt even a yellow card shown, hell wasnt even given a foul, why just because it was clean.
Thats what the refs need to differentiate. A clean tackle that may be reckless should be given a foul and a bad tackle with no intent should be given a foul but not carded at the very least.

3471~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3472~~~
Why didn't Dean book Daley Blind then? Or Craig Gardner?

Remember, the question isn't that Mata's challenge warranted a booking... it's that Mike Dean had decided - in the same game of football - that other challenges that were similar in certain ways, didn't warrant a yellow card.

3473~~~
The most injuries happen when there is no one around you and when you running alone, shall we remove running from football? Its a contact sport(at least it was), they now the risk and they are highly payed to take that risk. You realize the game was a lot more aggressive in the past and they were no more injuries then today, in fact i would bet that today we have more injured players.

3474~~~
Feel bad for the lad against West Brom.. It's one of those embarrassing moments as an athlete, you know you lost your head at the wrong time.

3475~~~
Mata won't miss the next game will he? 2 yellows aren't a ban rather than a straight red?

3476~~~
2 yellow cards are one game ban.

3477~~~
he's class, made a mistake, get over it.

3478~~~
The thing I don't understand about people who want him sold... Are these the same people who say we need 7 new first team players? Because in terms of our starting XI you could only really put DDG, Shaw, Martial and Smalling ahead of him in terms of performances. Surely we have around 5-6 other positions to worry about (CB, RB, CM, RW, CF) before even thinking about a new number 10 (particularly one who has been in really good for since returning to that position)?

Then you have to also think about the fact that aside from the aforementioned 4 players the whole squad has looked poor this season, which is a key reason why people want Van Gaal out (and the reason I don't believe we need 6 new first teamers). Is Mata one of the few that's difficulties are solely down to himself rather than the awful tactics we often seem to employ (which wouldn't make sense as he's starred on the few occasions we've actually played well)?

3479~~~
Mata couldn't tackle a fish supper, with the ball very good, without hopeless.
What this team needs more than anything is players with a bit of aggression who can get stuck in to the opposition, something sadly lacking.

3480~~~
Liverpool got 2 gifted goals from Palace.

3481~~~
I'm not doubting there were inconsistencies, just doubting that they occurred because the ref was desperate to issue someone a second yellow.

3482~~~
So if you admit it's inconsistent, it's not out of the realms of possibility that Mata wouldn't have got a first yellow card for his second challenge is it? When we've just seen Daley Blind kick someone in the head and not get a booking, Mata doing similar - just to a different body part - also stood a decent chance escaping a booking... considering the precedent set by Mike Dean himself.

3483~~~
Out of the realms of possibility? No. What is your point - that the ref wanted to send someone off?

3484~~~
That Dean (and this is Mike Dean we're talking about here - the man who has issued more red cards then any other ref this year) took the opportunity to send someone off.

Again, when you take into account the fact that it is Dean, and how he didn't caution other similar offences, it's hardly a bold statement. Mata was daft to give Dean the decision to make... but Dean absolutely didn't have to produce the yellow card - based on his own officiating in the very same game.

3485~~~
Ok, I don't believe that he had some type of agenda to send someone off but I don't mind that you do. For me, both cards issued to Mata are easily justified - when it comes to controversial red cards, this one hardly counts. Utter stupidity on Mata's part is far more annoying to me than some (crazy) theory that Mike Dean has different parameters for what is a yellow and what is a second yellow.

3486~~~
I was annoyed as anyone with his sending off but yet again, his detractors are just waiting for any excuse to put him to the top of our problem list.

He's far from it. Although I suppose Jose might still not fancy him.

3487~~~
Both cards were definitely justified.

In that sort of situation a referee will often use his discretion and give a warning rather than a second yellow though. Given the nature of the game, the type of fouls, the timing of the fouls and the player involved it would have been very reasonable to give Mata a final warning in that situation rather than send him off.

We were just unlucky that we had a card-happy ref who chose not to show any discretion this time. Mata still shouldn't have put him in that situation though.

3488~~~
Someone needs to tell him he's not sent off.

3489~~~
Useless, luxury player why he stayed on his feet I don't know, go down stonewall penalty

3490~~~
His thread is usually bumped somewhat harshly. Surprised no one has come in today. Anonymous in that first half.

3491~~~
And some idiot made him captain of Man Utd..Pathetic

3492~~~
There is really not much point in playing him for a start if we are meant to play so defensive and not even try to get out of our half.

3493~~~
I don't understand how you can play him with Morgan and Fellaini. He keeps having to drop behind Fellaini to get the ball.

3494~~~
There is zero point in having Mata on the pitch in this kind of set-up... he doesn't have the pace to run the ball out himself, and he's got nobody to pass the ball to when he gets it because we're so deep. He's basically playing as a CM anyway as he's been dragged back into midfield as we've got deeper... so yeah, pointless.

3495~~~
Dont rate him at all, replacing him will be as important as replacing Rooney. Has the odd nice free kick and the odd tidy goal but nowhere near good enough to be our no 10. Just compare him to the likes of Ozil, Cazorla, Silva, de Bruyne, Coutinho, Isco, James, Gotze and even Mikhytaryan. Just no comparison. He misses that extra quality.

3496~~~
Only catching parts of the game but sounds like he was bad today. Now <i>this</i> is a fair time to criticise him, not when he's had a penalty saved or a one off red card. Knock yourselves out.

3497~~~
The most pointless player on the pitch.

3498~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so funny but so true

3499~~~
Criticism has been fair all season bar that stretch of the three games in the Midtjylland week.

3500~~~
Looks like a 14 year old out there at times, his lack of physique is shocking. Another nothing performance. I'll be delighted when Mourinho bins him.

3501~~~
Worst player on the pitch tonight.

3502~~~
Least inspiring United captain ever?

3503~~~
But but, he's a world class player.

Ripped off of 37 million pounds.

3504~~~
He plays like this more often than not, that's the problem.

3505~~~
Absolutely awful. Van Gaal's tactics completely limited him (and the side) in the first half, and he completely limited himself in the second (whilst Van Gaal's tactics limited everyone else)

3506~~~
What annoys me is Herrera has proven time and time again he is built for these big games. Mata was gonna get bullied, it's so fecking obvious and it takes LVG 80 mins to realise it.

3507~~~
What the actual feck was he doing?

3508~~~
Nothing. If you're generous.

3509~~~
Unlucky not to get on tonight I thought, seemed strange to rest him since he's banned for Sunday.

3510~~~
He's going to be sold by Mourinho, I hope.

3511~~~
For a supposedly number 10, how the hell is he so slow and how is his awareness so inconsistent??

3512~~~
Even by his standards he looked fecking slow and weak tonight.

Terrible performance.

3513~~~
Uninspiring choice for captain. Didn't do much.

3514~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3515~~~
Criticising his performances is fine, even when I don't agree with it. OTT criticism for having a penalty saved or getting the one red card of his career is objectively stupid though.

3516~~~
Really poor.

3517~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3518~~~
I like Mata but he's just far too inconsistent and he has no middle ground with his performances, he's either good or completely useless, like "it looks as if we've got ten men", useless.

3519~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3520~~~
I was labelled "mental" by one poster for criticising him in the match day forum (comparing him to Joe Cole) but Mata just brings up bad memories of the pre-Fergie era. A skilful player bought for huge money who produces the odd great moment but ultimately is not able to consistently perform on the big stage despite looking good for a lesser team (as Chelsea were in that period). He's not our worst problem by any means but, based on cost and experience, he should be organising our attack.

3521~~~
No point discussing him when you give Fellaini and Morgan behind him. Morgan is not a great forward passer and Fellaini is rubbish. He wasn't effective but the link between defence and attack involved Fellaini as the more attacking CM. Its obvious he needs a positive footballer around him and had his best performances with herrera on the pitch

3522~~~
Taking a shit penalty deserves criticism as does getting stupidly sent off.

3523~~~
Not if people are holding those incidents up as proof that he isn't world class, is a bottler, is a coward, is useless, or should be sold. Even if you believe all those things, an incident as one off as a Juan Mata red card isn't evidence of <i>anything</i> given it doesn't reflect what he's like as a player at all.

3524~~~
It reflects him letting us down once again when we are just starting to build momentum. It reflects his career at us being one step forward, and then two steps back.

3525~~~
Should have gone down. Seriously, its bonkers he didnt even try to win that penalty.

Should have been subbed off much much earlier than he was. I have no idea where he was playing either.

3526~~~
He has no presence on the pitch. None. We're better with a paper bag floating in the wind.

3527~~~
Or you're twisting two mistakes countless players regularly make to suit your pre-existing narrative of Mata letting the team down.

People don't rate Mata, so anything bad he does becomes proof of why they're right not to rate Mata, even if those things have absolutely nothing to do with the actual flaws that made them not rate Mata in the first place. 

I think one poster actually said we don't need "that sort of player" at the club after the red card. As if Mata suddenly turned into a Costa-Suarez lovechild. Like I said, that is objectively stupid criticism.

3528~~~
Couldn't believe it when I saw he was captain tonight.

The most uninspiring captain I could think of in that team.

I bet Scholes' rant was aimed at him in particular as well.

No fecking *hugs*, no fecking blogs, fecking start standing up & be counted, or get the feck out of the club you spineless twerp!

3529~~~
Meanwhile, back in the real world where it isn't always bogbrush's fault.

This guy, Rooney or Carrick as captain. What chance do the young players really have? 

So tired of this guy and his stupid, effete blogs about how "sad he is" and how "the team weren't good enough."

3530~~~
He was poor today but so was everyone else, bar DDG. Our negative tactics and system made things difficult for him, and he's not much use when we barely have any possession.

3531~~~
Shit performance followed by a shitier blog apologizing for our shitiness, rinse and repeat.....That's 90% of his time with us.

3532~~~
Clear as day why Mourinho sold him.

3533~~~
Thinking about it more the choice to make him captain is just so strange. Another decision of LVG's that can be added to the 'didn't work' list.

3534~~~
Lmao at him being captain. One of the biggest cowards I've ever seen on a football pitch. £37.1 million. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3535~~~
By that logic, I take that you would have loved Fellaini as the captain yesterday. Not a coward by any chance. Loves elbowing and stamping.

3536~~~
Nope. The fee for him is even more laughable. He's just a lumbering oaf who wins some headers. He's part of the reason our team is so rubbish. Probably not a coward, he's just nothing really.

3537~~~
This must be the thread with the biggest swings on the Caf.

3538~~~
Given the starting line up LvG had chosen, making Mata was not a bad call IMO. It was not of any use maybe. But it was not harmful.
Anyways the way the game was played by Mata and others made sure that who was the captain was the least of the problems.

3539~~~
Yet people will still make excuses for him. Clear to see not good enough for us. But currently the best 10 we have.

3540~~~
Yep Smalling should have been captain for me. LVG and his weird decisions, there are a million of them (Jones taking corners is up there) but last night we had our regular centre half playing left wing another centre half playing left back and so he puts on a midfielder and puts him at centre half! Idiot of a man.

3541~~~
What exactly is he playing?

3542~~~
He's done absolutely nothing in open play and put in 2 or 3 dogshit set pieces.

Woeful.

3543~~~
I don't get why he started on the right, I couldn't see any tactical reason for it, just LvG messing about as usual.

3544~~~
Can't wait until he's sold.

3545~~~
He's so useless apart from the odd free kick, really hope we sell him and get a proper no 10.

3546~~~
Rubbish again. Putting him on the right was criminal considering they'd be targeting the wings to counter attack and he offers feck all support.

3547~~~
Bad Mata is back again. I'd get rid in the summer.

3548~~~
Yep, someone with a bit of pace and acceleration and can do things like Coutinho just did.

3549~~~
One of the biggest disappointments for me this season, as far as individual players go, and he's not doing anything to change that impression tonight.

3550~~~
Bit anonymous thus far.

3551~~~
What was he supposed to be doing in that first half? Even his freekicks were shite.

3552~~~
He runs like he's under water.

3553~~~
Massive miss. Really poor from a player with his technique.

3554~~~
He's no Ozil or even Cazorla.

3555~~~
He's unreal, everything he touches turns into shit.

3556~~~
Don't get me started on this little turd.

Pathetic. Will carry Mourinho to Old Trafford on my back if it means Matas the first out the door.

3557~~~
Once again when we need him the most, he has been underwhelming. Basically all our good attacks are going past him, and he does not exactly construct our attacks.

I think it just was not to be for him at United. I like the player, liked him at Chelsea even, and you look at his stats, the goals he scored and assisted and he was not bad. But overall he looks out of place.

3558~~~
My opinion on Mata is that people consider him very good because of his silky technique on the ball. Very overrated player and not good enough to be a central player for a top team.

3559~~~
Horrific match, we should sell him this summer asap and try and get Isco.

3560~~~
Gutless heartless paceless fecking hopeless

3561~~~
Are we allowed to have a go at him for this performance?

3562~~~
Just a poor player at this level, can't believe how much we paid for him.

3563~~~
Tbf to him he arrived here at the worst time. Halfway through Moyes doomed reign, just before Van Gaal's doomed reign, then (hopefully) before the arrival of a manager who doesn't particularly rate him.

Comparing him to Berbatov (another silky player who contributed a fair bit without really fitting in) would be fair. Except Mata has the extra excuse of arriving at the worst period in decades.

My favourite of our players but, like you said, it doesn't seem like it was to be for him here, at least in terms if him fulfilling his potential.

3564~~~
Pretty awful tonight

3565~~~
Not good enough, guys a weak slug!

3566~~~
Yet again he lets us down as one of our senior players. For me this has happened once to many. He should leave this summer.

3567~~~
Complete shit today. Wouldn't be against selling him in the summer.

3568~~~
That was horrific, can't even defend that, there's no real in between with his performances but that was inexcusable.

3569~~~
Yep not like we spent £30+ million on him to try and help us out! Must be someone else's fault as he has a great beard and is so apologetic on social media. Get rid asap

3570~~~
Considering he was by far our most experienced attacking player, you'd have expected him to offer a lot more. Or, at the very least, something. I like Mata, and would hang onto him, but he doesn't do himself favours in games like that.

3571~~~
Ridiculous playing him on the right but he's just not good enough I'm afraid. This was such a game for Herrera.

3572~~~
I am with Mourinho on Mata.. he is good for youtube videos , for technique.. but football is a lot more than that now.. Pace, Strength are vital.. He would be good for Italian football..

3573~~~
Fanny.

3574~~~
I'd gladly sell if an upgrade was available. Heck, considering the performances he's put in, we'd be no worse off giving Pereira/Januzaj some minutes.

3575~~~
SAF would have never signed him for Manchester United.. Berbatov was signed in as a  striker.. when we had Ronaldo/Rooney are their peak..thinking he was another Cantona...

3576~~~
For me, I would be happy if he goes this summer or is benched.

He's a fancy dan that's great when the going is good, but against a team where individual quality is needed he just cannot do it. It's a shame as he always tries but he just hasn't physically got it. 

Even tonight his technique let him down badly, missed good chances to score and his passing was pretty awful. I can see why Jose wanted rid of him now, he just isn't reliable when the chips are down.

3577~~~
The difference between him and Coutinho was staggering. With the inexperience in attack we needed him to step up but he was the weakest of our attacking four.

3578~~~
Beats me why he would be played on the right wing. Absurd tactical decision.

3579~~~
He should've probably been central, but I'm not sure that really made much of a difference. His problems tonight weren't being isolated on the wing...because he had plenty of the ball. He just did absolutely nothing with it, and never showed any signs of actually creating anything dangerous, or making clever little runs in behind defenders to receive the ball. It was just a completely uninspired performance from him.

3580~~~
I think (hope) it wasn't really about him playing on the right wing. Rather it was about playing Lingard in the middle where his dribbling and pace could help push us through the middle of the park. Which actually worked quite well at times, and really showed why we should be looking to get somebody for that position who has that ability.

Of course, if we do decide to play like that then the question is whether Mata should be playing on the right wing or whether we drop him and play somebody else in the attack (Memphis being about the only available person, which would have meant Martial up front and Rashford on the right).

3581~~~
Pathetic. No shock. He's slow and is so often very little threat. Get rid.

3582~~~
this

3583~~~
Lingard isn't even that tricky to push them back, would have made a lot more sense to play Memphis through the middle if that was the plan. He's atleast strong and capable of riding tackles from the likes of Sakho. Lingard is way too weak.

3584~~~
Been shit this season, but honestly under Moyes, and last season, he was never this bad, everyone has regressed immensely under LVG

3585~~~
Even when he came more central he offered nothing, he just gets brushed off so easily and he turns like he's wearing legwarmers from Flashdance laced with led. People said he'd be great with pace around him but he's not done much with Martial and Rashford offering him jet engines ahead of him.

3586~~~
Coutinho is like what we thought we were getting when we bought Mata. Unfortunately he's anything but. Just a slower, weaker, far less goal threatening version.

3587~~~
Yep again not our Juans fault.....

3588~~~
Pathetic performance again, I don't know whether to blame him for being rubbish or LVG for playing him on the right.

3589~~~
As the senior member of the attacking trio (or foursome if you include Lingard) he really should have done more. He was just anonymous and offered nothing. Probably should not have been played on the right but he still failed to impact the game. He doesn't offer anything even when he is having a bad game, unlike say Martial who can still run at defenders, should probably be dropped and maybe sold.

3590~~~
Think he'll be off in the Summer

3591~~~
Hasn't been influential enough, shouldn't be playing on the right but not consistent in the middle either. Should be looking for a replacement sadly.

3592~~~
Cant wait till he scores a free kick winner against City and everyone loves him again.

3593~~~
I like him a lot, but the raw numbers aren't great, think he's only had about 3 assists (in the league) this season. That's not enough from a 10 in a team fighting for the top 4. He's hardly the worst we have but he hasn't done enough.

3594~~~
4 league assists. Villa A, Liverpool H, Southampton A then Sunderland H.

That's right. His last league assist was on the 26th of September. Since then he scored 2 goals, a free kick v Watford and a penalty v West Brom.

3595~~~
Nice one. Bloody hell, stats only tell part a story but... that was almost half a year ago.

3596~~~
The free kick against Watford and a few pretty meaningless goals (results wise) at the start of the season have masked how terrible he's actually been.

3597~~~
Why was he on the wing? And I need more then just " Van Gaals is a moron "...

3598~~~
Another nothing player. We have quite a few.

This guy cost £37m. He was one of the best players in the league and Europe before Mourinho rejoined Chelsea. 

His United career has been nothing short of dissappointing - and he's been one of the better players since Ferguson retired!

We signed him to be a creative spark. To lift the players around him. 

No doubt he has wonderful technique but I am bored of seeing the same shit from him. Get the ball, inside, too many touches, defer. He's not physically quick or strong but where's the speed of thought? A half arsed Ozil creates more. 

We signed him six months into the Moyes era. In other words six months into the post Ferguson era. He's been a problem so don't dress it up. A truly top class player may have got us out of the shit before it even prolonged. Mata is as culpable as the others.

3599~~~
Without saying those exact words...
If there's one thing I've noticed with LVG it's that if something works for him once (usually through luck) he'll desperately try to repeat it thinking it was his good judgement. 

Mata has had some of his (few and far between) better games against Liverpool on the right wing so LVG was probably looking for a repeat.

3600~~~
if we finally give chance to Pereira than he could easily fill his shoes and be his faster stronger version...

A lot of knee jerk reactions here but I never rated Mata. 
He has great technique but is incredibly slow and with the ball.. slow dribbler, shows too much of the ball, loses it often, no strength, pace and goes missing in games. Basically the epitome of a player not suited for this league or fast flowing football.

3602~~~
I used to be a big fan and once upon a time when a debate about him, Ozil and Silva was valid. The Mata I saw at Chelsea and hoped to see here knitted the play beautifully and made the killer pass and scored.

He has become truly shit now.

3603~~~
Didn't realise he's been that shit.

3604~~~
He needs to play #10 position with fast players around him or dont play him at all. Playing him on the right (especially without Herrera on the pitch) is crazy.

3605~~~
Disgrace

3606~~~
Yep. Mata slows our play down so much as well.

3607~~~
Sorry, did you just say he "slows our play down?!?!"

He doesn't slow it down. He shits himself half the time and passes the buck. But, he writes a blog so, in his mind, he's fine. He's a leader.

Almost a bigger fraud than Fellaini ffs

3608~~~
Shit Rossi. For a second I thought you were going to have a go at me <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Yeah, Mata's time at United has not really impressed me at all. And he gets a much easier ride than some other guys.

3609~~~
Sorry but, after that shambles tonight, I will come across as aggressive. Apologies

3610~~~
Not getting the Fellaini stuff! Fellaini is an honest player that is very limited and one dimensional but he gives his all every game and never hides. He's the complete opposite of Mata.

3611~~~
Never hides? 

Said it the other day but, the time Liverpool hammered us 3-0 at Old Trafford, he went out kicking the smallest players on the pitch. Gerrard wasn't having it and put him in place with an elbow....The result? Fellaini shat himself and wasn't seen for the rest of the game. Now, imagine that was Keane, Butt, Ince, Robson, Scholes or even Becks......Gerrard would have had to be helped off the pitch. 

Fellaini hides. Committing a few fouls, throwing elbows and jumping for a few headers does not constitute as "never hiding" 

The guy is a fraud along with Mata. Both talk the talk but hardly ever walk it

3612~~~
Such a strange footballer. Taking into account his natural talent, and in fact, his first 3 seasons at Chelsea, he should be one of the elite players in this league, but instead he's often impressive, sometimes decisive and frequently pointless. I don't think I've seen such a talented player at United lack authority, ambition and drive to the extent that Mata does. With Berbatov, he was languid but he did have the bollocks to to play his game. Di Maria had a miserable time here and was affected by off the field factors. Mata is given all the opportunities in the world, and you can't say he is bad for us, given he often has spells of good end product and other spells of good number 10 play, but there is simply no reason he shouldn't be the star of this team. The only reason I can think of is that he lacks of the authoritative mentality that should come from a star player, and is past his best (Chelsea).

3613~~~
He's physically weak and lacks pace. When playing in a dysfunctional team like he is now he's exposed more often than he would be in a team where he could rely on his team to offer good runs, passes, touches etc.

3614~~~
I think so much comes down to the fact he's not very capable of shielding the ball well or going past people (due to not being quick, having a great turn or strength with the ball.)

What compounds it is that he's fully aware of his limitations. And, as a result, he basically surrenders possession as soon as someone comes near him. He rarely gives himself the opportunity to hold the ball in dangerous areas for long enough to do anything effective.

You could give him that pass Coutinho scored from all night, and he still wouldn't attempt to go past his man. He just wouldn't. It would be a pass inside before the man closed him down.

At Chelsea, he tended to receive the ball in transition, carry it a bit (as the stretched opposition defence retreated), pass it off wide, run into the box, and shoot quickly. Very rarely did he need to dribble past players towards goal. Alongside that, a chunk of his assists where aided by having Drogba, Terry, Cahill, Ivanovic heading in his set-pieces.
Many of his assists were also cut-backs, having been played in behind the defence.

3615~~~
He has loads of technical ability, passing ability, and shooting ability, though, to make up for it. How many great long passes has he made this season? How many beauties has he hit from long range? No doubt that you are correct a dysfunctional team brings everyone down, but the great player are supposed to stand out regardless (even if their stats are effected). Martial is a good example.

3616~~~
It does make you wonder if he was a bit overrated due to his time at Chelsea where everything was tailor made to make him a success. I get the dribbling bit, he's a puny little fellow who scares no defender, but I think he could be showing a lot more initiative. The bolded bit is key. There's one things having limitations, and another being consumed by it. As I said in the previous post, where is his famed left foot? Why aren't we seeing him play at least a few wonderful long passes or long efforts once in awhile? He hides IMO.

3617~~~
He's programmed to keep the ball so even if there are interesting runs and openings ahead of him but they require creating a little space for yourself by dribbling or accelerating, he'll more than likely pass it back. I think he is a good passer but he doesn't put himself in the situations where he can showcase his passing. The rare times we saw great passing is when he has acres of spaces, under no pressure and even then he can still pass it back. I truly hate this lack of initiative from someone who is supposed to be one of the leaders, who captains the team at times.

3618~~~
Seems like internal programming to me. I don't think we saw much of this from under Moyes either?

He's a second striker for me. We need to stop even considering him as a number 10. A number 10 is a completely different sort of player, one who dictates play, gets involved in intricate moves in the middle of the pitch open up space for everyone. Mata does very little of any of that. He has great ball control, is a safe and reliable passer and can (sometimes) score goals. His natural movement is to play a short pass and move forward, and very rarely to pick the perfect pass to set up a chance.

3619~~~
For me, the type of player he is doesn't relate to the kinda passer he can be under certain circumstances. Suarez is a striker but whether that was at Liverpool or now at Barca, if he can quickly release his teammates, he does it. Mata can pass the ball much better but he prefers the safest option. It is annoying because we were screaming for pace and movement in attacking and we have that with Rashford/Martia and even Lingard.

3620~~~
Would you sell him in the summer? Our options are Mata, Herrera and Rooney in the #10 role. I mean, it's alright, and I'm sure they'll look better when we get a better manager in, but for me, A) Rooney is not a 10 B) Herrera is a CM and C) Your main 10 being weak, slow and lacking in leadership (Mata) would be a worry. I'd personally get one top class #10 in, or at least one with top class raw ability on the ball.

3621~~~
I would tbh but then again if it were up to me, you wouldn't call it  a clear out but a decontamination.

3622~~~
I agree with the second striker bit, and have said it before (though it's perhaps a bit pedantic).
He's a player who works best once defences are stretched; not one who stretches defences himself. 

His best work is pretty much inside the 18 yard box, and he struggles to make any mark once he moves away from there. How people consider this to make him a top number 10 baffles me.

3623~~~
Yep. I've actually always considered him a SS. But I thought with possession play and a lack of creative players, he'd step up and show his "true creative side", which apparently, as it turns out, doesn't actually exist.

3624~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Christ. Creative #10 my arse.

3625~~~
As touched upon a big factor could be that he's mentally tired/demotivated/scared of making mistakes after being coached by Moyes and LvG for 3 years. That said he clearly isn't as great as many would've thought when we signed him from Chelsea.

I find it difficult to judge a lot of our players simply because our team is/and has been dysfunctional for so long that any player would lose his spark. Would be interesting to see how he would do under a new manager, if he even gets a chance. Would Mourinho find him good enough for his style now compared to at Chelsea?

3626~~~
That's the issue. Should we take the risk of going into the new season with Mata, Herrera, Rooney and Fellaini as our #10s?

3627~~~
No need to apologise mate. I meant more along the lines of "i thought you were going to defend Mata!". 

But agreed, alot of these players, along with the manager, needs to hang their heads in shame and feck out the club.

3628~~~
Not if we have any ambition of competing for the title, no. Then again Mata is the least worry out of those four, and there is no reason to sell him before Rooney and Fellaini. The new manager might prioritize other positions in the team in more urgent need of replacements.

3629~~~
Yeah, I'd personally sign a quality AM, and have Mata and Januzaj as his backup. Herrera back to CM, with Rooney and Fellaini leaving.

But the problem with that is selling Rooney which is going to be difficult. Only last night, Roy Keane was hugely critical of us and mentioned how important Rooney is to us. The whole club is engulfed with this misconception about this huge importance and relevance Rooney has, and I can see it dragging his United career on, pointlessly.

Also I suppose it depends on what sort of #10 the new manager likes. Mourinho, for example, would prefer Herrera and Rooney (hard working ones) to Mata

3630~~~
Tbf, Mata cant operate when Fellaini is playing. Whenever Fellaini plays we generally play that hoof ball crap and the physicality of the player comes into play, and that is Mata's single biggest weakness. He has been inconsistent, but there is a pattern that has to be noted. Whenever there is Herrera behind him, he plays well, whenever Fellaini- not so great. He plays well with Schweini behind him, but not so well with Carrick

3631~~~
Juan needs dropped and given the boot in the summer.

So many gutless performances. 

90% of his games for us he looks and plays like a child amongst men.

3632~~~
I think the point is that they are both gutless, and this is reflected in our play. For players like Fellaini and Mata there's always another pass backwards or sideways rather than a pass forward or taking a shot.

3633~~~
You are taking one isolated example and also presenting your view on it. Fellaini is more than happy to dish it out and mix it up. Comparing that side of his game of his character to Matas is just way off in my opinion.

3634~~~
Cant wait til this fraud is no longer at the club.

3635~~~
Put on a great team display in the first half. He has hustled his ass off defensively and won 3 key tackles, and set up Rashford for the goal.

3636~~~
His new mean streak is weirdly hilarious.

3637~~~
Excellent in the first half. What's werid though is that his average position is more defensive than Schneiderlin's, on average he is almost next to Carrick.

3638~~~
Maybe we should start playing 3-5-2 again and have him as a wingback

3639~~~
No more mr nice guy!

Johnny Kills!!! (That's his name in english)

3640~~~
This

3641~~~
Juan Smasher

3642~~~
Not a bad game but he really shouldn't be playing on the wing anymore.  Great effort today and solid defensively (he Mata-ed Sterling).  But that's like asking Messi to play right back.  What's the point.

3643~~~
Played very well, especially in the first half.

3644~~~
His rating today is a joke. People complain about him having no defensive clout and being lazy in that regard. He puts in the biggest defensive shift in his time here and has a great assist to boot and is rated as one of our worst players. 

He played very well today.

3645~~~
Agreed 7/10 from me today, he's get a rough ride but bar the West Brom game he's been very good since new year.

3646~~~
I thought he did ok, certainly put in plenty of running, he still just can't get turned or win a 50/50 though, I think switching Linbgard into his role in the middle has given us an ability to switch from defense to attack quicker because Lingard can turn and run with the ball.

3647~~~
Had a good performance, one of the reasons might have been tomorrow's blog where he cant get away with apologising for 2 games!

3648~~~
I don't mind people not liking the kind of player he is... I watch football with people that dislike Smalling massively, but they at least make good points (although most of them are basically that he isn't Rio Ferdinand who is a once in a generation defender).

With Mata he gets criticised for things that we never expected him to be able to do, which means he should have a flood of those posters praising him for today's performance.

He worked hard, had a great assist and was defensively good. Anyone giving him less than a solid 7 I'd say has preconceptions.

3649~~~
This.

3650~~~
I second this.
I also enjoyed watching the occasional 1 touch passing with him and Schneiderlin.

3651~~~
Good first half performance from him today.

3652~~~
He simply does not have the ability to turn with the ball. How can a #10 be so poor in such a crucial aspect of that position?

Another one of your players that lacks a fundamental ability to play their position - Blind as a CB who can't really head the ball, Fellaini a CM who can't pass the ball, and Depay a winger who can't beat players.

3653~~~
Had a good first half but disappeared in the second, taking him off was the right decision from LVG.

3654~~~
Guns.



Hugs.

3655~~~
If he played like Silva did today or for a while actually he would get hammered. Needed to perform after a disappointed performance against Liverpool and he did.

3656~~~
Him in the middle with pace around him (on the wings and up front). He will find them.

3657~~~
This thug kicked poor old Sterling out of the game today. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3658~~~
The quicker we replace him the better roll on Jose.

3659~~~
i thought he was stone average but then again I think he is pretty average.

3660~~~
He was very good today, but he isn't a winger.

3661~~~
Was thinking about that Silva comparison earlier too. For all people have complained about Mata and compared him unfavourably to Silva, I'm pretty sure our guy is having the better season (even after taking Silva's absence through injury earlier in the season into account).

3662~~~
That doesn't surprise me given your contributions to this thread. You to Mata is the antithesis to Mad Winger and Kagawa. You go beyond the realms of reasonable criticism such that you can't be taken seriously with regards to his performances.

3663~~~
Was pretty good today, but there was this one moment when he received the ball and had acres of space to run into in a straight line, and yet he leisurely strolled sideways and passed it that way. If he instead had sprinted (well...) towards their goal, he would have opened up space for the wide men. Instead he sort of cluttered that area and delivered a five yard pass. He does that from time to time. With Lingard, it's always a run in a straight line, so whilst Mata is the superior player, Lingard carries the ball to our attack so much faster.

3664~~~
You repeat the same thing every time. Take a brake, he played well today.

3665~~~
Yep you are probably correct my mates say the same when we go down to games so hard to argue with. But I just can't abide a player so soft centred.

3666~~~
I don't honestly think he did and if that's him playing well....

3667~~~
I appreciate that, he is certainly a player who polarises opinions and it's quite refreshing hearing someone admit they aren't at all objective!

3668~~~
Mata has turned into a luxury player.  Great to have for back up but what does he really offer?  He can't carry the ball and he doesn't ping killer balls like Silva et al.  He doesn't get into the box and is far too slow.  United are slowly turning a corner and we need pace to match our quick counter attacking/possession football.

3669~~~
Fair play to him. He was crucial to us having that good a first half. The touch, 1-2 with Carrick and pass to Rashford for the winning goal was quality play.

3670~~~
Yeah he's been a lot better then Silva this season without a doubt.

3671~~~
Mata - I can never work out whether he's a really good player or not

Still, I guess it won't Mata if Jose comes in

3672~~~
He's like the epitome of Van Gaal on the pitch.. consistently shite and then pulls off a half decent performance once in a blue moon and suddenly half the fans think he is worth persisting with again. 

He needs to be sold in the summer - end of. We're not winning any major titles while he is a pre-eminent member of the team. Top 4 and FA Cup glory maybe but even that will be a big struggle.. he holds us back more than enhances the team in the long term.

3673~~~
Even if you don't think he should be a starter... why should we sell a player who is never injured, never complains and will - at the very least - be a great squad option to have... especially since we have an incredibly thin squad as it is, and half of this thin squad spends the majority of its time on the treatment table - except Mata. Whilst I get that some people don't like Mata, the idea of demanding him be sold is completely irrational when looking at our current squad.

Also, Van Gaal is holding us back, not Mata.

3674~~~
I agree he has a tendency to disappear for huge chunks of matches, but he also comes up with the goods just when they're needed too.  He has 9 goals and 10 assists this season, when we've scored 38, so he's been directly involved in half of our goals this season.  I'm not saying that's an amazing record considering he's probably got the most starts this season apart from Dave, but is it really an asset we want rid of when we're struggling to score?

He seems dedicated and has a pretty good health record (a rarity in our squad, so worth pointing out) and a lot of a fans love him.  If he's sold it's because Jose has beef with him, and I think that's a shitty reason to sell a player that could be of use.

3675~~~
Never complains? he has a face like a smacked arse every time he is taken off or is on the bench. I don't see him as a great squad player.. at the moment he is pretty much a starter in 9/10 games and therefore he hasn't thrown his toys out of the pram. Under someone competent like Jose, he'd barely get a look in and I can't see him accepting such a role.

He also has a fair amount of value attached to him, we could recoup a fair bit from selling him (maybe in the region of £25-£30m). 

I wouldn't sell him until replacements are brought in first. It is irrational to sell players and then completely flop in terms of bringing in replacements.. lets nail some transfer targets first and then we can balance the books by letting him go. 

Van Gaal of course has held us back but I can't help but feel that he has suffered greatly due to decisions taken by Moyes and he has exacerbated the situation by not rectifying these mistakes. The signing of Mata, Fellaini and the contract extension of Rooney was three of the most catastrophic decisions taken by United in the past 4 years and the main reason why we are the cumbersome mess we see today.

Whenever Van Gaal has been forced to play youngsters/quicker players.. his philosophy doesn't look all that shite and we look half decent on the ball. 

Ultimately he himself is responsible but Mata/Fellaini and Rooney will epitomise this era for me.. Cannot wait for the day when all three of them as well as the manager are not at this club.

3676~~~
I mean, does any player look happy when they're taken off or on the bench? It's not like he's refusing to come on when he is on the bench, or throwing his shirt around when he's taken off or anything. There was also a big stretch of games last season where he was on the bench... much like there was when he was at Chelsea, and neither time did he really throw his toys or anything.

Also, not sure I agree with the last part... we've looked shite at various different times under LVG... regardless of youngsters/quicker players or whatever else... his philosphy has, more often then not, been complete bollocks.

3677~~~
You are clearly just seeing what you want to see.

3678~~~
He is just not consistent enough. He showed in the past that he can be a very good player. But then again, too often he is just poor and doesnt find his role.

3679~~~
This

3680~~~
Although I agree that he isn't very consistent, he should right now be the least of our concern. There are far too many positions that need to be replaced before him. DDG might leave, our RB hasn't been as good as Mata this season, We need a CB, maybe 2. We need to replace Carrick and we definitely will be going for a RW. We should be in the market for a ST as well. That is atleast 6 players. Add to that a CM as well if you dont think Schneiderlin and/or Herrera should be starting. 
Also, we have 20-22 players as of now. If we are to play a season where injuries don't majorly affect the outcome then 2-3 squad players as well.
Even if Jose comes, I dont think he'd sell Mata. At Chelsea he had options. He had Oscar who is a works harder than Mata on field and thats what Mou wanted. At Utd, he doesn't have an option. He knows he needs to buy 6-8 players at the minimum before he can even think about replacing Mata

3681~~~
I only watched from the 50th minute on, but I thought he looked great: silky touches (including one that set up our goal,) hard work (including feisty moments,) and great recycling of possession. He's underwhelmed quite a bit this season, but I have no complaints with what I saw today.

3682~~~
he started to be good from around that 5Oth minute

3683~~~
He was non existent in the first half but played pretty well in the second, not a long term starter for me though.

3684~~~
You picked the perfect time to watch him and the game.

3685~~~
I have no idea how he manages to start on a regular basis. It's like when Rooney was starting game after game. Surely you have to try other options because it would hardly be a great surprise if they contributed more than Mata has done this season.

3686~~~
Was among the best players in 2nd half. Had a fantastic touch in buildup to 1st goal.  sent in a good cross that should have been scored. contributed defensively. Was stringing good 1-2s as well. But loved him have a go at Mccarthy after he literally climbed at Rashford

3687~~~
That was some Jedi level stuff. How he pulled that ball down out of the air so softly I'll never know.

3688~~~
Yeah that's the impression I'm getting!

3689~~~
Yeah McCarthy knew better than to feck with Juan 'thugs' Mata.

3690~~~
that control of the ball with the outside of his left foot made me vote for him as MoTM.

I will remember that for a long time. I hope Jose has buried the hatchet with him.

3691~~~
Great wingback, isn't he?

3692~~~
Great nothing when anybody gets close to him.

3693~~~
Similar to Rashford at Anfield last month.

Really cant wait for van Gaal to feck off.

3694~~~
We can add him to the number of players who've played full back this season now.

3695~~~
Going to get caught out down our right if were not careful.

3696~~~
Can't blame him. LvG and Giggs have thought it wise for Mata to track Rose while Lingard sits in the middle.

3697~~~
If we're demanding him to work so hard defensively, we should have just played Young, Valencia or Lingard on the right. He's done okay for the most part, but we're asking for trouble.

3698~~~
Strange way to play Juan Mata.

3699~~~
I'm not a big fan of Mata but this role has to be intentional and is ridiculous, he's basically a Wingback.

3700~~~
Better RB than Darmian

3701~~~
One of the only games where he'd be a safe choice through the middle with Alli, Lamela and Eriksen pressing high up.

3702~~~
He's a number teeeeeeeennnnnnnn! Never been a right winger.

3703~~~
Just dont get why Mata is playing at RW. You have a RW in team, you have a CAM in team, no point playing 2 guys out of position when it can so easily be none

3704~~~
Exactly....

3705~~~
Is this a competition to put as many players on the pitch more suited to the role Mata is playing than Mata himself?

3706~~~
We need a massive upgrade on him, one of the most pointless attackers/attacking midfielders I've seen.

3707~~~
The most pointless player in the history of football. I can't wait for Mourinho to come in and get rid.

3708~~~
The position he's played in is the least of his problems. He'd have been even more anonymous if we played him as a number ten. His best form for us actually did come playing wide right.

3709~~~
It's impossible to judge his performance today. The way he was being asked to play was utterly insane. I'd struggle to think of a worse player to play in that position covering the entire flank on his own.

3710~~~
Completely retarded to keep playing him on the right but yeah I agree with you.

3711~~~
LvG's tactical setup this game has been bizarre. Mata was clearly instructed to play deep and help out Fosu-Mensah a lot but why him? Start Valencia instead if you're going down that route ffs.

3712~~~
He is too limited.. Rose was killing on the right because of Mata.. if Young or Lingard played on the right we would have been a lot better

3713~~~
He's not good enough at this level but he (and every other player) are very much secondary issues at the moment.

3714~~~
He has played plenty of times at AMC/AMR/AML and wherever he plays, he has been shite. The amount of flak Depay gets for trying to make things happen and yet Mata gets away with playing so cowardly ever week

3715~~~
Extremely stupid to criticise him today given the way he was used.

3716~~~
He was played out of position today and was useless but even when in his preferred role he isn't very good anymore, he is getting worse and worse. Hes is finished at this club after this season IMO.

3717~~~
He's been better than people have given him credit for at times on the wing, so I don't think that can be used to excuse him being incredibly quiet today.

3718~~~
Ok how about since he signed? As he has been shite!

3719~~~
Mata is a better player than Depay. He was playing right back for most of the game. It's impossible to judge his performance today because asking him to play that way was batshit mental.

3720~~~
Cheesy he is chronically a bag of shite on the wing. It's laughable you're coming out with that. He is a coward of a player, great in flashes but contributes nothing the whole match apart from a minute or two. Get rid asap!

3721~~~
Mata should have swapped positions with Lingard for the second half. 

He spent most of the game having to play fullback. Meanwhile Lingard did absolutely nothing in the centre.

3722~~~
Yep

3723~~~
He's been okay in parts. Needs to do a lot more to the impact the game as a whole, but he's often contributed with goals and assists. Today he did little though, and I'd happily criticise him for offering us very little.

3724~~~
Should never play him on the wing again. Just keep him on the bench until he can play at #10 or just sell him for ffs.

3725~~~
Yeah I don't blame him as such, but the question has to be is he good enough even in number 10? He's no where near as good our rivals equivalents.

3726~~~
Even if we accept that playing him at RW is sometimes a good idea, was this the game to do it? Watching him try to deal with Rose and, as people above said, playing so deep he looked like a wingback at times....

Literally nobody would have expected him to play well in that role, whether they're a Mata fan or a Mata hater. Nobody except Van Gaal that is.

3727~~~
Nah, major mistake to play him there today. Mensah was often drifting into a central role to help the defence out, so it was a game where we should've really been looking to play someone who has more pace than Mata and tends to get back more often. Mata did it occasionally, but it's not something his game's really suited to as such.

3728~~~
I'm genuinely not bothered by today I'm not judging him on today's game I have watched him week in week out and he is rotten. No surprise we had one shot on target with this guy choking up our attack up the right wing every week. He's a massive part of our problems in the team. Add Rojo and Darmain to that! Not yet sure about Depay or Lingard other than knowing they are not good enough to be starters week in week out if we want to be challenging for titles.

3729~~~
That's fair, he hasn't played well enough to suggest he's any sort of answer for us long term. Plenty of fair things he can be criticised for generally.

Today was about LVG rather than the players though, especially for people like Mata and Young who were dropped in it by his weird decisions.

3730~~~
So where should we pick him then? He offers nothing. I hesitate to use the word "deluded" but how often are we going to keep making excuses for some of these players as of its magically going to click for them one day? If he had played 32 good games up to now and had an off day today I would accept your point but you can count the number of really good games he has had on the fingers of one hand since he signed.

3731~~~
You know what, Mata showed some guts today in his defensive work in some spells. He was effectively a RB at some point. Not sure what ppl expect from him when the staff are losing their minds!

3732~~~
I'm not really debating whether he's good enough or not. This game isn't one to judge him on at all is my only point. He was basically playing as a right back. Of course he was going to be shit. That's not his fault. It's the manager for picking him and forcing him to play that role.

3733~~~
He had to track the fullback all game.

Once the full back became an issue, Lingard and Mata should swapped positions. That would have tempered Rose's forays forward and Lingard was shite in the center anyway.

3734~~~
I can't believe we played him as a defensive winger <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he actually did well tracking back but we should have swapped him and Lingard.

3735~~~
This season has shown that the way forward in the PL is pace and directness. He's as weak and slow as they come, we can still fetch a good sum for him, should be moved in the summer.

3736~~~
He tried his best, not his fault the manager is incompetent, every other manager in the league would have seen it wasn't working and swapped moved mata centrally. It was an obvious and necessary change but not if your manager is LVG.

3737~~~
He can tick "Play a game as a Wingback" off his bucket list

3738~~~
He actually did better as a defensive winger than he has done offensively for the past however many months.

3739~~~
He seemed pretty feck off on the bench, or just in disbelief at the state of things

3740~~~
Yeah, he looked annoyed and disillusioned.

3741~~~
Maybe he can't believe how bad he has been since he signed. Kagawa wasn't any worse we have wasted £34m here. It's the same with Darmain as Rafael was better. Nani is better than all our wingers and Hernandez would be our best centre forward and Welbeck would walk into the team, Evans is also miles better than Rojo. Alot of bad decisions have been made. Fellaini don't know what to say at this stage.

3742~~~
id be inclined to think its what LVG asks from the players. Half the team forever swapping positions to places they shouldn't be, then inevitably look poor. Mata on the wing, jesse in the middle looking poor while our right side is getting ragged because Juan cant cover. then get flak for it from fans/media

3743~~~
Really?

Kagawa: 63 appearances, 6 goals, 10 assists = 0.253 goals/assists per appearance.
Mata: 105 appearances, 28 goals, 17 assists = 0.428 goals/assists per appearance.

I'd say those numbers suggest Kagawa was quite a bit worse than Mata. Especially when you consider the fact that Mata has only been here for the Moyes/LVG era of gloom, whereas Kagawa's one good season happened to be in the title winning one under the greatest manager of all time. I suspect Mata would also do better if you put him in a side that was capable of scoring 86 PL goals a season as opposed to the current version of our side that has yet to reach 40.

3744~~~
One of the worst tactical decisions you will ever see is playing mata at rw against an attacking full back like rose. I mean where is the logic ffs. I don't blame him to be honest. Absolute stupidity.

3745~~~
Can't judge him off yesterday as his position was just idiotic by LVG, but I do think we could use an upgrade in the attacking mid position. I wouldn't mind keeping him as he does often play well I just think we need more speed through the center.

3746~~~
We should certainly try and bring in an upgrade for the first eleven. I just don't get people saying we should sell him outright in the summer when he is objectively one of our best players right now, faint praise though that is. There's no way we're going to strengthen so much that having Mata as a squad player wouldn't be useful.

3747~~~
I know Mata has his fans on here, but I seen absolutely nothing from him as far as creativity is concerned. Yes, he seems to run around a lot more, but not seen him done anything on the pitch for months. Not sure why he is played in every game. Maybe we need Maureen to come in and kick him out again.

3748~~~
Are they per 90 minutes?  They mean nothing otherwise. And considering Mata takes a lot of set pieces the assist stats are terrible.

3749~~~
I wouldn't say playing on the wing is a lost cause for him as he has had some really good performances there but he needs a full back like Valencia or TFM to be effective. His whole game is based on using the pace of other players around him as a decoy to pull off his passes and maneuver in tight spaces.

3750~~~
Poor Juan, did you see his little legs tracking back into the RB position all bloody game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3751~~~
Mata on the right wing against West Brom or somebody is just about acceptable, but that's only in games where we boss possession. Against a team who are our equals, who have quick and willing fullbacks who bomb forward at will is tactically very stupid. LVG usually prides himself on "preparing" for the match, but I can't believe any of the coaching staff, Giggs or LVG himself didn't look at that and think, hold on this might fail badly?.

The fact that people who aren't paid to win football matches can see it, but they can't is quite baffling.

3752~~~

3753~~~
We play too far apart on the pitch for his liking. LVG is so keen not to break formation that the combinations we could be doing to break a defense down are almost non-existent.

3754~~~
Some of the criticism is really unfair.

Mata has been one of our most productive players since he joined, in fact he maybe the most, however, he's barely played in his favoured position. 45 goals and assists in just over 2 seasons is a good return in a team that's scored around 170 goals since he joined. Mata has contributed towards 1/4 of our goals whilst playing in the worst possible position for a player of his traits.

In addition to this, he's never complained, his attitude has been incredible. Not once did he shed is responsibilities the other day against Spurs, when he was run ragged by Rose for 70 or so minutes. He ran up and down the pitch, albeit in slow mo.

I can't help but feel that we wasted a talent in Mata. A player capable of so much constantly played in the wrong position, yet could leave in summer with impressive figures.

3755~~~
Didn't offer much today except that neat little corner routine with Blind, and yet he saw plenty of the ball.

3756~~~
He had a 5-10 minute spell when he came alive (2 through balls for Rashford). The rest was neat slow possession and losing it in exciting areas.

3757~~~
All said and done he really is average

3758~~~
Wasn't poor, wasn't great but should have had a goal and two assists.

3759~~~
Hilarious how Villa fell for that corner routine twice.

It's quite a clever one but we never seem to do anything from it.

3760~~~
He laid Rashford up twice and his movement in general caused their defense issues.

3761~~~
He needs to stop playing on the right.

If Rooney had to play today, play him on the right and Mata left, because Mata is more creative than him.

3762~~~
Our players look as surprised as the opposition when it comes off. Everyone's stood there flat footed with their mouths open.

3763~~~
Too true.

Only we could catch ourselves out.

3764~~~
Good first half shit second

3765~~~
He's better on the right and has spent the bulk of his career on the flanks. The incessant moaning about him playing on the right needs to stop. He barely even sticks to the right in any case and is generally very underwhelming when starting through the middle. 

Complaining about him playing on the right today is just taking the piss given the positions he took up.

3766~~~
Fixed that for you.

3767~~~
Please add 'for us'!

3768~~~
He'll be gone when Jose comes, not a moment too soon. Not good enough.

3769~~~
Funny how he is the whipping boy of the moment.

3770~~~
Doesn't offer anywhere near enough for a side with our ambitions.

Too slow, extremely weak, can't dribble, inconsistent crossing and not that creative.

3771~~~
TBH, hes only good for us if were going to play 4231 (and hes part of the 3 or we play 4411 and hes the 1 behind the striker). For the counter attack style of a true 433 or 442, I dont think he has a place.

Granted he was part of our best run last season when we played 433 but for some reason we dont seem to be doing the obvious of trying to replicate that (with Tony, Herrera and Mata forming the right triangle).

3772~~~
He's class when playing as a 10 in a faster paced, direct style. He's not suited at all to a slow possession game, which is funny because he is a very good passer and is so slow himself. But when the game is slow, it is congested and he can't weave between players or pick out an opening and play little give and go's. He needs to have runners around him, space to work in so he can play passes into them. He's actually similar to Rooney kind of in the position and play style that best suits him. Still only room for one of them, just like there was when Kagawa was here with Rooney and after when we signed Mata. We can't have both in the starting 11 otherwise we become too slow and lopsided in our attacking. 

Not sure what's going to happen to him when Mourinho comes... It'll be both funny and sad if he sells him right away, as there is a brilliant player in there, he just needs to be utilized correctly and I don't think that'll happen at United. Put him in Arsenal and he'd look class (though not as good as Ozil). Hell I'm sure he'd be class if he went back to a big team in spain. Just premier league and United specifically doesn't suit him because of his lack of pace and any strength.

3773~~~
Except for the 2 nice chances he created early in the second half, he is just so pointless.

3774~~~
Agree with almost everything, except Rooney and Mata can't be playing simultaneously

3775~~~
The enigma

3776~~~
Reminds me of Berba to an extent. Both record signings, both very good technically and quite intelligent, both had great games vs Liverpool, both lack a bit of pace and aggression, both a bit underwhelming...Berba played for a better team and contributed to two titles and some other cups and finals. Mata will hopefully win the FA Cup.

3777~~~
For me this is the sort of game where Mata has no excuses, it should be the perfect stage for him to rack up some assists if not goals.

It's funny how the whole world and his dog can see how badly Hazard has played this season, but statistically he creates 2.81 chances per 90 minutes played against Mata's 1.68.

People really need to be honest and ask themselves were we better yesterday for Mata being in the team, or was the West Ham performance and indictment of how little influence a £37m player has provided.

3778~~~
Didn't watch the game, only saw MOTD but he seemed to be involved/created most of the chances we had.

3779~~~
Probably because Chelsea are better at attacking than us? 

Even whilst being garbage all season, they've managed to score more than us.

3780~~~
He was ok I thought, tried to move it a bit quicker but it was awkward having him and Rooney playing square of each other as supposed #8's when neither have pace or mobility to outmaneuver the opposition or support the striker.

3781~~~
Another match in which Mata did ok without ever looking like he deserves to be a permanent fixture in the team. Completed 80 out of 84 passes. 2 shots on target. Created one opportunity.

3782~~~
Quite good when opposition doesn't even try to press us.

3783~~~
I actually thought he was really good today alongside Rooney - both were good, equally so. Mata ran around a lot and put in a decent defensive shift, I thought. His passing was really good as well. How much ground did he cover?

3784~~~
Good game. Carried on from the one against Villa I felt. Kept finding the runs of Valencia, Lingard in good positions. But he needs to find himself closer to the penalty area. It's been too long since he had an assist/goal. 

I know people here say he has no pace, no real physical strength, but his tracking back is pretty underrated. I remember reading somewhere that he covers the most distance among the United players in average. Saw a bit of that today.

3785~~~
I'm a fan, he did alright but he'll have to do better. They were terrible tonight and a player of his quality should be doing more.

3786~~~
Felt he was pretty good today. His 1 touch passes are simply outstanding. Although, shouldn't be on wings taking part in overlap runs. Him giving the pass is fine but he shouldn't be the one chasing those

3787~~~
Easily our best attacking player tonight.

3788~~~
The commentator said he's got ONE goal/assist in the last 22 matches!

Is he not in the team to produce things and make stuff happen? Terrific guy, but ultimately a rather pointless player really.

3789~~~
I find it hard to judge Mata, because he's played for two shit United managers. One was a clueless idiot who'd long lost the dressing room by the time Mata came, and the other's an arrogant deluded idiot who's got us playing non-existent attacking football.

 He's had his moments, is an intelligent pass-and-move footballer and is a relatively good goalscorer so I suspect we'll always be wondering about what-ifs.

3790~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.aol.co.uk/sport/2016/04/24/mata-id-take-a-pay-cut-for-football-to-become-less-of-a-business/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.aol.co.uk/sport/2016/04/...ut-for-football-to-become-less-of-a-business/</a>

All those transfer talk about players made me post this. It's frightening to see how much Mata earned at Madrid's B side.

3791~~~
Have to admire his honesty. Not many players would come out and say something like that.

3792~~~
Yup, the last line in particular is so true. It isn't just about the money they name, they have someone assigned to take care of everything facet of life.

3793~~~
Have to admire his humility. One of the many reasons why I love him and Herrera. They actually look at football as fans and take efforts to connect with them.

3794~~~
Well, in part I have to agree. But then I remember some video that popped up last year or so where he didn't celebrate with the fans when others did or something. I don't remember the exact incident, but it sort of left a bad taste in my mouth.

3795~~~
I have never heard anything about that, and frankly don't believe it.

3796~~~
I like Mata as a personality. Seems really humble and nice. But as a player he's been a huge disappointment. I used to think of him as an artiste, but aside from some nice close control, and the odd (very odd) good goal, he's just been a nothing player since he arrived. He does close to nothing every time I watch him play. For an attacking player, he's useless. He honestly looks like he's accidentally left the handbrake on when he's running. He's such a little guy, and so weak on the ball, you'd expect him to be quite nippy, but physically he's just puny. Honestly, if he's going to be that slow, he needs to be strong on the ball to make his talent shine. A complete waste of 37M, and a sign of our desperation when we signed him. I imagine he'll be gone next season, and I hope he goes somewhere and does really well. Back to Spain I imagine.

3797~~~
He's a very good player who deserves to be starting for a very good team, but in this particular team, I think most of us would agree that we need a change towards a more dynamic style of player and he feels like hinders that.

3798~~~
I don't get it anymore. Juan Mata at Chelsea was magical at times. He's had some good/decent performances here at United but you all know what I am saying. We haven't seen a run of magical performances that we saw back around 20012. Is it the team composition? Is it the playing style?

3799~~~
He's a floater in a system player (much like Rooney) and this is a completely rigid system where every moving piece has to perform a mobile role. He'll never work under Van Gaal, much the same way Rooney up front won't.

3800~~~
Get down on your knees and wish this guy a very happy birthday! He did it for you:

3801~~~
Definitely his finest hour <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3802~~~
Seemed to suggest on BBC Five Live this morning that he'll be here next season.

3803~~~
I have a feeling Mourinho wouldn't get rid even if he came. Still has two years left on his contract.

3804~~~
Plus he's with Adidas, so not certain Mo would be able to just do away with one of their major marketing 'tool'. I don't think anyway...

3805~~~
What did he even do after coming on?

3806~~~
The least impacting impact sub in the league?

3807~~~
What did anyone do? We were dreadful in the second half.

3808~~~
Waste of a shirt. Hoping he follows Fellaini out of the door at the end of the season.

3809~~~
Wasn't able to make an impact when he came on.

3810~~~
Terrible sub today, against a team whose greatest strengths are pace and strength, of which Mata has neither.

3811~~~
Play out of position is what he did.

3812~~~
He bustled about a lot when he came on but didn't manage to effect the game.

3813~~~
Another pointless game from Mata.

3814~~~
MOTM for me. Looked like only player capable of creating something in that front 4. Also scored the winner.

3815~~~
Easily the best player today, although, that doesn't tell anything. Did create a few good chances- Rooney in 1st half, Valencia in 2nd, Herrera once

3816~~~
9th competition goal. Very good player when he does not end up missing in games.

3817~~~
Only player who did anything really. Good finish from him.

3818~~~
I never have any doubts he'll finish a chance off.

3819~~~
Still the best finisher at the club.

3820~~~
Better second half. One of only a couple of players that wanted to do something about the scoreline.

3821~~~
He was the only outfield player who looked like he wanted to win. Mighty Mata v Norwich, mouse v everyone else.

3822~~~
Don't think he was great today, but he has a knack of bailing us out when we're at our shittest.

3823~~~
Was very good in the 2nd half.

3824~~~
10 goals and 10 assists is pretty good in a LVG season.

3825~~~
Only player that looked like creating anything, easily MOTM not that there's a lot of competition.

3826~~~

3827~~~
Good game from him and played on the right shock horror.

3828~~~
What a top guy.

3829~~~
In the second half, he started to run things. But then we kinda stopped passing him the ball until he turned up for the goal (made it look much easier than it was).

3830~~~
Finish was trickier than it looked with it just bouncing slightly

3831~~~
Lovely man.

3832~~~
For a guy that plays very deep for an attacker, those are decent numbers.

3833~~~
Lovely stuff from Mata with that young fan at the end. The match was so terrible that every attacker looked bad but he made the one decent support run we managed all game and was clinical with his finish.

3834~~~
He is a genuine class act.

3835~~~
He had a really good second half. Pretty much ran the show for us.

3836~~~
To bad he will be gone if cnut comes in,JM and his pet are allergic on anything classy.

3837~~~
MOTM.

3838~~~
I honestly don't want Mourinho to come if he's gonna get rid of Juan, but I can't stand another season of Van Gaal. ARGH

3839~~~
10 goals and 10 assists in a train wreck of a season are really decent numbers.

3840~~~
Great guy.

3841~~~
Fantastic person and a great footballer. For such a slated player, he has won us a lot of points this season.

By far our most productive player. 

Commentary mentioned him running most the pitch to get in the box for the goal, refreshing after a lack of drive on display today.

3842~~~
When used correctly and in proper formation, he can produce highest quality.

Opponent wasn't that hard but secured three points matters a lot more and he delivered that with huge act of class on the pitch and outside.

3843~~~
What a lovely fellow.

Added bonus: The username of the guy who posted the video. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3844~~~
Brilliant stuff with the young fan, tidy finish for the goal as well. MOTM for me.

3845~~~
Said it before, don't think Mourinho will get rid. He always plays with a 10. And I can't see us buying any this window.

3846~~~
Wouldn't make any sense. Why stick with a player who doesn't suit you, and risk a real mismatch between your ideas and his abilities?

3847~~~
The mourinho issue seemed to stem from a perceived lack of work rate from Mata at Chelsea. He regularly covers most ground for us this season. I hope mourinho doesn't get rid, he's a classy player.

3848~~~
I really don't believe that crap about lack of work rate. In the two seasons here I have seen a player who works his socks off in the vast majority of games. Even when he's rubbish. 
I simply think it came down to a choice between Oscar and Mata. And he chose Oscar.

3849~~~
Tbf it's not like Mourinho outright trashed Mata. He just said he preferred Oscar as his #10 and that meant using Mata in more of a squad role.

Given that we don't really have a #10 like Oscar, we've tended to play Mata on the right anyway and we probably have other areas that need strengthening too...

Mata's days are obviously numbered when Mourinho arrives but I could see him lasting another season. Even if he doesn't fit into Mou's plans it would still be pretty stupid to sell one of our most productive players before you've replaced him properly.

3850~~~
It's not about work rate. Mata has never been lazy. But he is doesn't have the physical presence or pace to contribute defensively.

Let's see what happens. If Jose gives up a bit of his obsession for discipline and leans more towards quality and class, then I have no problem with that.

3851~~~
Right, of course. We have to have a replacement to let him go. But I do think the #10 is a position that we need to review irrespective of Mourinho's preference. Noone in that position is top class and we arguably have Mata, Herrera, Lingard, Fellaini and Rooney who can/do all play there. Although I a couple of those could improve under Mourinho, still think we need more from our central attacker.

3852~~~
Massive improvement in the second half from him. The majority of our dangerous attacks went over him Rooney and Valencia in the second half.

3853~~~
I agree with this, it's a bollocks claim. 

He must have had another reason, perhaps not fast/combative as Oscar.

3854~~~
Agree.

3855~~~
Exactly. If Mou decides to sign maybe even 5 players for 1st team, dont think CAM will be one of those positions to be strengthened

3856~~~
A beautiful man.

3857~~~
A class act through and through. He's underwhelmed at times, but he's been far from our biggest problem. Why LVG moved away from playing Mata in the middle, I'll never understand. I'll cheer for him, wherever he ends up.

3858~~~
I agree it was great to see, he's a top bloke.

3859~~~
Inexplicably played on the right again in favor of Lingard playing the no. 10 role (WTF?), but Mata showed his class today. That finish was harder than it looked as the pass from Rooney was a difficult one to control in a situation like that, but Mata made it look easy.

3860~~~
Mata is a weird player for some fans. He seems weak, very safe players etc but most of our goals in last 2 seasons came from him one way or another.

He might not be in his Chelsea form for us but it is ridiculous some fans compared him with Kagawa. He is miles ahead of kagawa in united shirt.

3861~~~
Saw one poster say he's been about as effective as Fellaini during the week....

3862~~~
Mata does work very hard but he's not athletic or quick which means he's not the best at closing down.

3863~~~
I hope we do get rid of him when Mourinho comes. He's been a dissapointment overall

3864~~~
*facepalm*

3865~~~
When Mata doesn't play well there are usually posters quick to say "that's why Mourinho sold him", like Mourinho obviously made the right decision.

The other side of that argument is that Mourinho chose Oscar over Mata. In hindsight was that even a good move? If Mata has been disappointing then Oscar has been straight up awful. Would you guys really prefer to see Oscar-type players favoured here?

3866~~~
I can, James and Griezmann comes to my mind immediately.

3867~~~
I get the impression the problems this season might cause Mourinho to give his tactics a big re-think. It's worth noting that he does like creative number 10's, he bought Ozil after all.

I'm a big fan, I hope he stays. When he has movement in front of him he his extremely dangerous.

3868~~~
That's the thing. I'm coming around to the idea of Mourinho (likely due to not being able to bear another year of LVG.) However, Mourinho's judgment on players hasn't been that great since coming back to England. Putting aside Mata, he made horrendous calls on DeBruyne and Lukaku and struck out badly with Falcao. Again, I'm willing to get behind his coming here, as nothing can be worse than the dross we're currently being offered up on a weekly basis, but he wouldn't be my first choice (if the likes of Guardiola, Pochettino and Simeone were available, which sadly isn't the case.)

3869~~~
He has disappointed in fact he's been poor.

3870~~~
Strong contender for MOTM against Norwich

3871~~~
He looks like a scared child each time he gets the ball. If he doesn't dispose it off in one or 2 touched he'll get brushed aside simply..

3872~~~
At points he's had to be deeper than Valencia to cover him ffs. Why is Mata a clear #10 being used as a defensive winger.

3873~~~
Another assist for Mata. Great work.

3874~~~
That's your 47m right there!!!

3875~~~
That's why Mata rightly plays all the time. For all his flaws he's one of the only players we have with that sort of composure and class.

3876~~~
I'd say the only player.

3877~~~
He did well for the assists but struggled a lot of the time with the tempo and aggression of the game.

3878~~~
Excellent assist.

3879~~~
Poor first half. Better 2nd half. Did play a good few passes, but was as bad as the rest of our team

3880~~~
Well done for the assist but hid for much of the night I think.

3881~~~
He is a luxury player to carry in such high intensity games.

Goes hiding mostly. Didn't at the time but clearly now see the reason Mourinho dispensed with him.

3882~~~
Again a highlights reel player. Great for the goal and then not a lot else. This is what he does here. Not influential enough.

3883~~~
Not the right player to be criticizing tonight. Did a lot of hard work defensively, especially in the first half when he was constantly covering for Valencia being out of position. Then showed his class with a nice assist in the 2nd half. His passing and overall play could have been better but it wasn't an easy game to play in, with West Ham's pressing and physicality.

3884~~~
Least of our problems today. Did well for the assist and was covering as last man at times. We should have moved him to #10 position as soon as it went 2-2.

3885~~~
He had his head up to track Martials run whilst receiving the ball, beating the defender and releasing the pass. 

Class and intent to make sure the ball he put in was not just an aimless cross.

3886~~~
As <a class="username" data-user="26997, @Sylar" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26997/">@Sylar</a> said, least of our problems tonight.

I actually feel the 'he goes missing' comments are a bit unfair, I think he's always trying his hardest, his work ethic is pretty good, he's not Suarez but he's better than people on here would have you believe. There's only so much he can do with it given his physical...capabilities but I can't fault him for trying.

Lovely moment for the goal, after getting the winner Saturday. One of few players I'm not incredibly pissed off with right now, though I am a fanboy I admit.

3887~~~
Scores the winning goal on the Saturday, sets up the equalizing goal on the Tuesday. I wish we had more of these luxury players in our team.

Mourinho sold him because he preferred Oscar as his #10. Oscar has since been much worse than Mata. Maybe not the smartest move after all.

3888~~~
I think we should cash it this summer. I really love the lad but he is not what we need, he flattered to deceive at times even if he put some good performances here and there. If somebody offers anywhere near £25m (as we always get trounced when selling players), we should let him go.

3889~~~
Dropped by Spain.

3890~~~
Who has taken his place?

3891~~~
Here's the squad

<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Squad</b></span>
<b>Goalkeepers:</b> Iker Casillas (Porto), David De Gea (Manchester United), Sergio Rico (Sevilla)

<b>Defenders: </b>Jordi Alba, Gerard Pique, Marc Bartra (all Barcelona), Sergio Ramos, Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea), Juanfran (Atletico Madrid)

<b>Midfielders:</b> Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta (both Barcelona), David Silva (Manchester City), Mikel San Jose (Athletic Bilbao), Koke, Saul Niguez (both Atletico Madrid), Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea), Thiago Alcantara (Bayern Munich), Isco (Real Madrid), Bruno Soriano (Villarreal)

<b>Forwards: </b>Pedro Rodriguez (Chelsea), Alvaro Morata (Juventus), Aritz Aduriz (Athletic Bilbao), Nolito (Celta Vigo), Lucas Vazquez (Real Madrid)

3892~~~
More surprised by Costa and Torres not getting a look in.

3893~~~
Spain has never really favoured him, have they?

3894~~~
No surprise. I certainly wouldn't fear Spain if Mata was starting for them against us.

3895~~~
Shit yeah. Didn't notice that. Who's Soriano too? Did he used to play for Sampdoria (dunno why I know that)?

3896~~~
he isn't that good.  Its only because he plays for us that he gets an inflated status on this site.  

Mata is not much better than Fellaini vis a vis the positions they play in: both of them are top 7 club material AND NOT Champions material, which is why we are where we are.  

Would be one of the first players Id sell if I was Mourinho.

3897~~~
From Wiki. Never heard of him myself

I'm just waiting for Stobzilla to come along and make a shit copying and pasting joke/reference now.

3898~~~
Doesn't look great up front. Surely Costa would have enhanced this squad?

3899~~~
That's a different player, ain't it? The one in the squad is a midfielder who plays for Villareal.

Edit: ohhhh, it's Bruno. Not sure why they've got him down as Soriano like

3900~~~
Mata's problem is he's a luxury player that can't play CM, isn't really a winger but isn't as good as various other No.10s for Spain. He's bloody good, still, but like a lot of others has lost out to competition in a strong era for Spain.

3901~~~
I still haven't heard of him ha

3902~~~
Do you think he can be our 1st choice no 10 or luxury player in a Mourinho United?  If so, where does he fit in?  

I really don't know.  Even a flushed Rooney is preferable at no 10 for me.  Plus is Ibra comes in, then increase in competition for no 10 and also wide right from Rooney, Rashford, Memphis and Januzaj (plus new signing).  Does not look good for him.

3903~~~
Not better than Fellaini? Honest to god. I mean seriously. Ffs.

3904~~~
I think Mata's been wasted really, at United. Never been played consistently in best position and, if I'm honest, he'd be part of a large clear out if it were down to me. 

I've the same problem with him that Mourinho had - he's too lightweight and unbalances a team selection. You can't really play Depay on the left, Rooney deep and Mata at No. 10. Our whole squad is poorly planned and balanced and two of those three should be moved on, allowing the future to be planned around Depay.

3905~~~
If you have Hazard and De Bryune firing balls into him, he's bound to score at some stage tbf

3906~~~
<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'"><span style="font-size: 15px">He may be more talented but performances relative to position this season, I don't think so.  I think Mata has been as disappointing wide right as Fellaini has been in central midfield. 

Even the redcafe average rating for the entire season (Mata 5.7 vs Fellaini 5.1) shows this could be true, the scores are quite close and I think Fellaini is always under scored because of a negative bias and Mata over scored because of positive bias.  

Lets not forget how many games Mata has gone totally missing, how many times his stray passes led to a break down of our few attacking moves, and how few assists he has contributed.</span></span>

3907~~~
I don't know if he should have been called or not, but I see that the likes of Fabregas, Isco and Pedro were called and they had worse seasons than Mata.

3908~~~
I think its different though, the position Mata plays means a play will almost always go missing if you can't get him the service. I don't think we've had a single player thats looked great playing number 10 under Van Gaal and thats a large part down to the fact we suck at getting them the ball quickly in positions where they can hurt teams. The same defence can't really be offered for Fellaini. 

Personally I'd like to see Mata utilised properly for us and then judge him, but if its not going to happen then he's better off leaving.

3909~~~
Very good tonight. Hope he can at least keep up this form for one more game.

3910~~~
He had a couple of decent moments in the second half.

3911~~~
Very good tonight, and would have had a penalty if Moss wasn't blind.

3912~~~
As did Silva, though injuries contributed there.

3913~~~
Oh Juan, hugs <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3914~~~
Only reason he should be here next season is to be the backup #10 to a new signing. 

Isco please.

3915~~~
Moving just as fast anyway

3916~~~
Bizarre comment considering that difference between Mata and Fellaini (0.6) is similar to the difference between Mata and Smalling/Rashford (0.7) who have both been hailed as excellent this season. Which would mean 0.6 is the difference between awful and decent; and decent and very good (with all ratings being between 5.1 and 6.9, a difference of 0.6 is huge)

In terms of attacking players with 20+ appearances he's second only to Martial (albeit with poor competition like Fellaini, Rooney, Lingard & Depay).

If there are two players that have been hindered more than most under LVG and deserve a chance under a new manager it's our two (outfield) Spaniards.

3917~~~
Added some fouling and bookings to his game this season  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3918~~~
His hugs don't extend to the opposition

3919~~~
Barely touched Souré. Clattenburg carded him because he had some making up to do this game.

3920~~~
Cant wait till Mourinho is here, one of the most pointless attacking players I've seen.

3921~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Easily our second best player in the first half.

3922~~~
What has he actually done? Nothing noteworthy, as usual. He's an attacking midfielder who's biggest impact is mostly ball retention, wonder why we hardly ever score. Martial, Rashford were better attackingly and Rooney has played more incisive passes besides that.

3923~~~
<a class="username" data-user="79807, @Sammyjunn" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79807/">@Sammyjunn</a> <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3924~~~
He's not wrong, it was a pointless goal.

3925~~~
One of the few genuine winners at the club.

3926~~~
Always seems to score important goals.

3927~~~
Has he scored or assisted a goal this season that wasn't very important?

3928~~~
He's still shite

3929~~~
Tbf pretty much every goal/assist is important when you're as crap as we are in attack.

3930~~~
Obvious jinx! Glad he's got the goal, doesnt really change my opinion on him tho.

3931~~~
Pointless goal? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3932~~~
Why did we take him off?

3933~~~
Must be tired I guess? Apparently LVG was going to take him off just before he scored.

3934~~~
I guess we could have waited 5 minutes and assessed after this current break.

3935~~~
Wasn't that involved but showed great awareness and a calm head for his finish.

3936~~~
Had a good first half then a bit quiet in the second half until he scored the equalizer.

3937~~~
With Jose practically confirmed, what will happen to this little Spaniard?

3938~~~
was fuming when he was taken off, as Palace were obviously playing for Penalties after we scored, and I felt his dead ball skills were vital in the situation. 

But who knew.

3939~~~
Thank you Juan for the goal, wish you all the best wherever you will end up next season <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3940~~~
Thank you for the cup final goal, the Liverpool double and generally being a great human being. All the best for the future Juan.

3941~~~
I see him staying, one difference I have noted between his time at Chelsea and his time here has been the amount of running he gets through, he does nothing at a great pace but the effort is certainly more there than it ever seemed to be at Chelsea.

3942~~~
Thought it was an excellent finish on the volley. Lot of pressure there, but the execution was brilliant

3943~~~
Where's the queue of cnuts waiting to apologise?

3944~~~
I hate seeing him play out wide, but he's scored some really vital goals here and he's a gentleman I'm proud to represent the club.

3945~~~
I can't help but continue to be perplexed by this.

No matter how much you hate the guy, calling a late equalising goal in a FA cup final we went on to win pointless? I mean really? 

Just as a Man United fan, did the goal not illicit a slither of happiness out of you?

3946~~~
Big goal! Going by the stats I don't think the situation is the same as the one he had at Chelsea since I think he's right now better then anyone we do have. So unless we sell half the squad, I think he'll be here next season.

3947~~~
Brilliantly taken goal today. 

The timing of the goal, straight after they scored was critical too.

3948~~~
He is the best in the box finisher in the entire club. If there is a ball in the box I would trust him to put it in the back of the net more than anyone in our team.

3949~~~
Prefer him centrally cos he can act like a second striker. Feel he should only be used on the right when we have Herrera and Valencia in the team as well.

3950~~~
Not with Jose <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3951~~~
I feel he would stay even with Jose as our manager. At chelsea, Jose had options, he had a CAM who was too defensive and hence Jose preferred him. He isn't having those options here

3952~~~
He has been fine this season, could certainly be improved on but I don't think we have seen his best at all so in the right circumstances he could be lethal. Given the scale of what we need I think we have more important areas to look at before we get to replacing him.

3953~~~
Been important for us in the last couple of games but that hardly gets a mention around this parts. 

Hugs Juan

3954~~~
Huge goal that. Hopefully it will help him to find a place in Spain's squad, if it is not too late, that is.

3955~~~
I hope yesterday wasn't his last game for the club what with Mourinho's almost certain arrival at the club. I don't think we've even seen the best of him yet because he's not played regularly enough in his best position.

3956~~~
MEN said one player was hopefull that we would make Luis Enrique as our next manager and it would not be Mourinho. Easy guess who that would be.

3957~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Luis Enrique? Cant believe Mata really hoped for that, no chance it would have happened

3958~~~
Jose has all summer to buy one. I love Juan but he is not good enough to build a team around. Would love him to stay as a squad player but he deserves to play. He may do better back in Spain.

3959~~~
Bet he's shitting it now

3960~~~
He's in trouble under Mourinho.

Might keep him for a season i suppose but don't see him in the starting plans beyond that.

3961~~~
With bigger holes elsewhere to fill I don't think its prudent to shell cash on a #10 that's a clear upgrade over Mata. I'd say keep him on and let him play a season in his preferred position and spend money on central midfield, center back, striker and right winger. We have Mata, Rooney, Herrera and even Pereira capable of playing the #10 role to good effect.

11 goals and 11 assists isn't half bad for a season's return with him playing on the wing most times.

3962~~~
Mourinho doesn't like his overall contribution as a #10 though. I think he'd even prefer Rooney there.

Actually when Mourinho arrived at Chelsea the 2nd time he preferred Oscar over him despite Mata being even more brilliant the previous season under Benitez where he was among the player of the year favorites alongside Bale.

Then he'd have to be played on the right but even there Mourinho would prefer a sort of a Upgrade on a Lingard type of player than Mata especially with Martial or Depay on the other side anyway.

3963~~~
I think he overestimated Oscar and got burned as a result, ending up using Hazard or even Fabregas as a #10 for a bunch of important games so I hope he has learnt his lesson and recognizes Mata's skill in close spaces, which is rather important for that position. Mata gives you goals, consistently no matter where you play him across the front line.

3964~~~
Poor Mata, will most likely face being sold by same same manager at 2 different clubs.

3965~~~
In comparison:
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/uRfEwTf.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/uRfEwTf.png"/>

3966~~~
Apparently he played in every single Premier League game this season, surely the only player of ours to do so?

I remember a few months ago he was being framed as one of the 'victims' of LVG - surely this is a myth which needs to be dispelled. LVG seemed to have a lot of faith in him, even if he played him out of position or in a system which wasn't quite suited to his talents.

3967~~~
Yeah I was wondering about that, you originally said it was inferior to Depay and Herrera... which I knew couldn't be right.

3968~~~
I had the wrong stats for cup ties. Even those times/stats above are approximate for FA and league cups when a player was substituted on or off.

3969~~~
Yep. 34 starts, 4 sub appearances. The closest to him are Blind and Smalling on 35 each.

3970~~~
so isnt this the reason people say he is compromised?

3971~~~
7 yellows and a red as a winger? The guy has anger issues.

3972~~~
Sample sizes bias? Only Martial has played comparably same minutes as Mata.

3973~~~
Mourinho won't sell him.

People to need to get away from this idea that Mata was sold because he didn't work hard defensively (Which wasn't even true iirc). This is the same guy who had no issues in playing Ozil at Madrid. His attacking play was something Jose had a bigger issue with and he seemed to prefer quicker, more athletic players for that role.

I don't see him being a regular starting XI player though. LVG found a way to fit him in the team by playing him out wide (Albeit he almost almost always ended up in central positions anyway). Mourinho won't play him there so he's in for tougher competition. Wouldn't surprise me if he tried playing Herrera instead in a Lampard sort of role.

3974~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NT4YelvPz8M?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
If I was watching this as an outsider I'd think mata had a great season playing as a #10.

3975~~~
I wonder if Mkhitaryan means the end of Mata at United.

3976~~~
I wouldn't be too fussed if he's sold, personally. Great little player but I never thought he was a good fit for United.

3977~~~
Not surprise. Always a player who is good at picking his moment, but doesn't really influent the whole game too often. Very similar to the Rooney in SAF last year, Moyes season.

3978~~~
Can't help but like the guy. He has come up with the goods when we've needed it on numerous occasions.

3979~~~
If we were to sell him today we would get embarrassing money like 18m euro, perhaps 25m euro for a package of him and Fellaini. I rather let him go on a free than have that humiliation.

3980~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3981~~~
I think the problem as been we've had soooo many players who arguably their best position is 10 when we don't really play with one....

3982~~~
More like many incompatible players being put together and a (former) manager who played a style that suits very few players!

3983~~~
Saw a surprising stat that Mata has many goals for us as he had for Chelsea in a pretty identical number of games... Dispels the myth I've always had that he was more effective for them than he has been for us

3984~~~
Wouldn't argue that either....

3985~~~
I thought we've moved away from this buzzword.

3986~~~
There has been no link with any club. There was an article by Steve Bates last week saying Mou will give him a chance. At least, he will not get rid immediately.

3987~~~
He is as good as anyone in our team for the last 3 years in term of goal/assist output. 

But something about him does not make people like him here. I myself think he is a bit too weak for no 10 in EPL. That and new toys being outshining him in transfer market etc.

That's not to say we couldn't create a system around him to bypass his weakness but is he that good? Not sure. I would still like Jose giving him a chance this season and see. We really don't need to get rid of decent players of the squad in a hurry atm.

3988~~~
I didn't know anything about that. I believe there are far worse words out there we should deal with in that case.

3989~~~
He played a slightly different role for us most of the time, further forward with the accent on his goalscoring (especially at the beginning). I'm pretty sure that his assists numbers aren't close to his Chelsea times.

3990~~~
I think it is pretty much opposite with his playing positions. He plays deeper/wider for us than he did with Chelsea.

3991~~~
His goals and assists tend to mask mediocre performances whilst his general play was a lot better at Chelsea, with slightly less clinical ability in front of goal.

3992~~~
If you are contributing for goals and assists like that, you are good. He has been decent for us. There is no doubt about it. You would wish the likes of Ander would put numbers like he does.

The reason his general play looked shit is that well our overall general play was shit for the last 3 years. It is not like other players were outperfoming him in the midfield or wings bar Martial.

He looked a safe player to me which frustrated me a bit but then again it could well be down to the system we have been playing. His passing and thru balls were generally good when we had spaces up front. I would wait one more season and see how he plays in a bit different system.

3993~~~
I'm not talking about position but about the role. In Chelsea, Mata was their main playmaker, with us (especially under Moyes) he is much more focused at the goalscoring. That's my take on it at least, maybe I'm just wrong though.

3994~~~
This is very wrong. It's not all down to the system in Mata case. Play making requires touch/control, dribbling skill, quick feet, agility ,... Mata for most part is final ball, shoot only. He is slow, weak, slow turn. His control in tight angle is not top class. He's not true play maker for us. We have seen enough.

The way you describe Mata's goodness is also fit the Rooney in SAF later years. Who brought great goals and stats playing second forward. You can tell Rooney role apart from true #10 play in Sneijder, Ozil easily.

3995~~~
Have you seen Mata's touch and control? He can't dribble for sure. Lack of agility, strength, sure.

You should watch our games a bit more careful and closer if you think Mata's close control, touch are shit. He is the best we have in our squad.

3996~~~
Touch of play maker. Compare Mata to David Silva. Learn to distinguish play maker touch vs just touch. Why if someone disagree then you associate the opinion  with the term can't?

3997~~~
What is touch of play maker?

3998~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rg_pkgqW31M?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Compare David Silva's one of the shitiest season with the Mata's. You're welcomed

3999~~~
Mata's close control and technique in tight spaces is excellent... it's one of the strongest bit of his game. His weakness comes when he's faced up with a player, as he can't really dribble past them, but when defenders get tight to him is excellent touch, quick feet and close control generally allow him to turn away from them.

Silva was much worse then Mata this season, not even close. It seems like you're criticising him for not being the same player as Silva.

4000~~~
Gonna have to disagree here. Mata may not be much in your book but to criticise his first touch is just ridiculous!

4001~~~
So basically you are saying it is first touch, close control? Silva has been better overall in EPL no doubt. But to say that Mata close control and first touch are shit is a bit ridiculous. He has them as good as anyone in EPL. Also mata is all about final ball which is eh play making? And shoot only? hello? football is all about scoring. Not to make hollywood passes around all day. no?

4002~~~
Mata's first touch is arguably the best at the club.

4003~~~
Anyway, he's been tweeting United stuff lately. If he was surplus, surely he would have been told by now?

4004~~~
Also people forget the fact that we have been generally shit in last 3 years and had some record low scorings for past 2 years yet he is pulling those kind of numbers.

Sometimes people are too fickle and conveniently forget about things like that when they want to put a player down. When they want to hype a player, you would see them pulling all the stats and making excuses.

4005~~~
I'd like for him to stay and see how this season goes at least. I agree he is a bit of a luxury player due to his physique and he will need for the team to built around him, in the sense that he would have other players doing the graft around him. But this still doesn't mean he is a poor player because of that. He's slow, he's weak, blah blah. What have the fast and supposedly physical players done for us in the couple of seasons. What he lacks in size ( something he can't do anything about) he fairly makes up for it in other aspects. On the other hand, the so called strong players are not lifting the roof with their awesome technique.

4006~~~
Typical Caf.

4007~~~
My take on about him is similar that he wont be good enough for us to build the team around. But he is far from a shit player like some people saying he is. Also, our squad is thin and lack of creativity.

Unless we are getting some big names who are sure to perform for us (no one knows), no point getting rid of players like mata or blind etc who have been performing decently for us. At least we know how exactly they will do for us.

4008~~~
Where did I say shit? You made shit up and point it at me. I said Mata is not a real #10 for us. He is similar to SAF's latter year Rooney who master the art of final pass, scoring. Doesn't mean shit at all. But for true play maker, you see Iniesta, Messi, Ozil, James Rodriguez... all has the play maker touch, that protect the ball well, elegant on ball, even in tight space to beat the defenders.

Ironically your sarcastic tone betrays you. It's the lack of shooting that was last 2 years problems. And no, play making is not final ball only. Invest a went through a period of nearly a year without a goal or an assist, and he was still one of the best play maker in the world. Play making makes "play". Shift the defense off by touch, dribble in tight space, turn to throw marker off to create space for yourself and draw more defenders out of their defensive positions, *** organizing their system. There space's created for your teammate, a play for your teammate and your self to attack. No need for Hollywood pass. Patient, accuracy pass Play maker doesn't necessarily the assist or goal.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLS3AMQInjo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

 A less final ball video that illustrate the play making.

4009~~~
Agreed. There are others I'd ship out before him. Yes, he might not have been at his best since he signed, however, he's still contributed handsomely towards the end results.

4010~~~
He is probably our best player technically. There are much bigger problems that need to be addressed before we even think of shipping him.

4011~~~
Are you still talking shit?

4012~~~
I don't think he has much of a future at our club, which I think is a shame. With two good wingers around him and a clinical striker I think he has plenty to offer in the #10 position. If nothing else he could be an excellent backup option to have. But if we can get a decent chunk of money for him then I expect he'll be off.

4013~~~
You're the shit talker from the beginning. Bitch please.

4014~~~
Sure.

4015~~~
Has someone seen Ozil this Euro Cup? That' a bit of what we should expect from a no 10. Mata is just a tidy player, with tidy passing and good finishing. Not good enough to be our play maker because of his quite average dribbling, lack of strength, balance, and his quite cowardly passing (also the reason why Iniesta, Silva, Cazorla, Isco are all ahead of him in Spanish NT), we all know that he is nowhere near good enough to play on the wing. The only position where I think he could play for us is in an attacking line up, just behind the striker. He's a clever player, makes good runs, is a good finisher and still has a lot of technique and skill, some kind of Bergkamp role.

4016~~~
To be fair, the same ozil has been laughed at so many times on this forum for being a bottler when arsenal needed him the most etc. Mata was rated very highly on this forum a few years back. Also, it is not exactly a shame that you can't get in spanish midfield in that kind of generation.

My point is people are just a bit fickle. We tend to think our cows are not as good as other cows outside of our fence till they become ours and so on.

4017~~~
He still is a bit of a bottler in a lot of big games, no question about that. But couldnt that last point you made be relevant to Mata as well. I'm not sure if a lot of people actually watched him or just checked his amazing stats. He's still a very good footballer, undoubtedly but he's not a play maker like Ozil, Silva, Eriksen, Cazorla etc, he has the same build but is more of a clinical player in the final third.

4018~~~
My issue is this pretty much describes Mkhirtyan as well except he's quicker. He's not a playmaker but in a counter attacking setup he would have racked up very good numbers. Even at Chelsea he spent quite a lot of time drifting in from the right wing.

4019~~~
I can see where you're coming from, although I think that Mikitaryan being quicker, more explosive, a better dribbler with more power in his shooting as well, gives him a bit more dynamism in his play that Mata lacks. But it remains to be seen how we'll play under Mourinho. Will he continue on the van Gaal road and try to make us an excellent possession based side, will he try to make us a very fast attacking team who create loads of chances (we would need some better players for that), or an all round balanced side like Chelsea 2014-2015.

4020~~~
It depends on if you want to make things a bit complicated and call what kind of stuff as play making. When LVG talks about his philosophy, people were annoyed coz he was making things too complicated.

Then people would complicate things themselves when they want to hype/put down a player as I said earlier. If an attacking player is making/scoring goals enough, he is good enough for that team generally. No need to over-analyse it just because you don't want to admit that he has been good at it or you want someone else.

Also we see mata often so we know exactly what his weaknesses are (in some cases with some people, they only see those) and tend to overplay them to complain while almost the opposite is true with players from other teams because you don't watch them enough or not with same passion as you would with your team. You will hear more or less complains from some fans of those teams about their players's weakness and wish they could get a better player at some point.

4021~~~
Why would that bother you?

4022~~~
I see a point that you are trying to make here that a playmaking is more than making assists but more of making key passes and generally setting the attacking tone for the team. Modric, one of the best play makers has a relatively low assist rate but is still a top playmaker. But for him to still be an effective playmaker, he needs the runs of his team mates. All the players you have mentioned flourish through the centre generally and do not have the task of having to always be defensively alert out wide. How much room to open up play do you think Modric will have available if he was shifted out wide, in a rigid formation? Have you ever wondered why Mata seems lost out wide until he drifts into the middle? The lack of shooting wasn't the biggest problem imo but movement and runs. 

Having players like Rooney up front, who instead of making forward runs drops deeper starts ball hunting all over the park to curb his itchy feet or Fellaini (bless his absolute inability) who is just Fellaini, or the lack of runners from the middle of the park, what would you expect from a physically weaker player on the ball? He will either hold on to it waiting for a run that would never happen and get knocked off, or simply look for a safe pass that the CAF now refers to as cowardly. 

The best time to make use of Mata was when Rashford came into the scene in the place of Rooney and was making some runs but instead we opted to keep Mata out wide and use Lingard as a #10. 

My point is that Mata, though the best player, thrives on runs, It's no wonder that most of his goals have come from him making runs into the box. I'm sure he would love if more players did that instead of him.

4023~~~
I don't have anything against you. I actually agree with your assessment that we lack movement and our play maker  the last few seasons suffered too. I was having a discussion with this "someone", who tried to put word into other person's mouth and name calling, when can't make a valid argument. In no way I said Mata is bad. The point I tried to convey was Mata style of play making is luxurious. You also notice the issue with Rooney and Mata having the similar preferred area, which means they often step onto each other foot while lacks a man who make run. It's extreme hard to coach these 2 to play well together. It's much so simpler try a different type of player in place of one of them.

<a class="username" data-user="79807, @Sammyjunn" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/79807/">@Sammyjunn</a> did a good/ better summary than I did about Mata.

4024~~~
I read a rumour here a few weeks ago that Mou told him he would give him a chance? Maybe bullshit, but i hope he stays for another year at least. Could still be useful.

4025~~~
The debate about whether Mata is an advanced play maker or not is really tiresome. It hasn't much to do with his touch per se, it has to do with which role makes him happy and takes the best out of him on the pitch. Let's get one thing clear, end product doesn't make you an adequate play maker. If that was the case, nobody would be talking about Zidane nowadays. Ozil has achieved double figures in goals (in all competitions) three times in his career and Silva twice. On the other hand, high numbers have always been an important aspect in any of Mata's good seasons because that's what he offers to his teams.

Ask yourselves which was Mata's best performance with United. 9/10 people will say the win at Anfield in 2014/15 and rightly so. That was when the better coverage of space (433) and the triangle on the right between Valencia, Herrera and Mata allowed the latter to position himself further up the pitch and constantly look for opportunities to attempt runs behind Sakho. Now, compare that to the numerous times you've seen him dropping very deep in order to get on the ball and organize our plays. He always struggled because he can't turn his man or get past people in tight areas and as a result he always had to drop deep or use his first couple of touches on the ball to move backwards or sideways just to find some breathing room and turn around to face the goal without a defender breathing upon his neck. And that's what the comparisons with Silva and Iniesta are all about.

My opinion is that LvG didn't get the chance to see out his contract and had the majority of the fans turn against him in the end because he made two important mistakes at the start of his second season. The first one was to believe that Rooney would become the 20+ goals striker in his system and the second was that he insisted on Mata as an advanced play maker (central or wide doesn't make much difference). I don't know if Mkhitaryan and Ibra will be successful in England but it's a clear sign that Mourinho wants to address both these problems instead of giving second or third chances.

4027~~~
Then miki is just the better player. 

You want top notch performance but tolerate underperforming "need the team to be built around him"  excuse then 5th place is what we deserve. 

He's mata not messi

4028~~~
A very good pre-season and i can see Mourinho gives him a second chance.

4029~~~
I don't mind him getting another chance at all but I don't think Jose will risk him as a first teamer. Mourinho will want to hit the ground running and with it very unlikely Pogba is coming.... I imagine Jose will either play Mkhitaryan as a No.10 with a new right winger brought in such as Draxler or Perisic or will keep the Armenian out right and sign a new No. 10 such as James Rodriguez etc

4030~~~
I agree he's quality compared to many others. You wanted Mourinho here overwhelmingly. So you can't complain about his team selection. Mata is on such big wages (~ £140k/week) he needs to play when he's available. I don't think Mourinho will select him that often due to his defensive weaknesses (e.g. tackling, not so fast, aerial duels, ...). Don't be surprised to see him go.

4031~~~
If we want to move on and go back to the glory days is obviously we need to get rid players who are not good enough and there are so many of them and the first list will be the most ineffective one which IMO is Mata, he is 28 y.o and better sell him now before the price is dropped due to his age. Poor work rate, too much ball watching, no power, no pace, no any physical attribute, so pointless if you expect a player with no pace, no power and physical attribute to make a run and beat players. He doesn't offer many good long shots either. Probably the version of slower Kagawa + set pieces ability.

4032~~~
Poor work rate? You must not have watched him play too much this season, he works very hard.

4033~~~
I will ask the question back to you then, have you watch him play much this season? And if you answer Yes to this question and still think his work rate isn't poor that means you must not have watched a player with a good work rate at all before.

4034~~~
...





















I could find a lot more but, unlike Mata, I'm lazy.

4035~~~
He has good work rate, just isn't particularly good or effective at it because of his size and lack of speed. He does try his best to close down and defend though. In the end I guess it's still ineffective, but there is a difference between saying he doesn't do it or doesn't work hard, or just isn't good at it.

4036~~~
Mou will give everyone a chance on pre-season.It's silly to get rid of anyone before that, will send the wrong message.

4037~~~
You are questioning me if I watch him or no this season. But what I can see here your assumption about Mata's work rate are based on people quote not based on what you watched. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
And some of the quotes are also talking about his weakness aren't able to support his to do more works which is ineffective. Well, what's the point if your work rate is just running like a headless chicken and ball watching

Remember costa last minute goal? If Mata would have stick his leg or closed down Fabregas instead of being ball watching, Fabregas wouldn't be able to pass the ball from the first ball.
Wouldn't be better if Mata helped Darmian when we got smashed 3-0 by Spurs?

4038~~~
Stats from 14/15 season:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11570622/Revealed-Juan-Mata-is-Manchester-Uniteds-hardest-working-player.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...anchester-Uniteds-hardest-working-player.html</a>

He isn't the greatest tackler, no one denies that, but he is an attacking mid and I don't think there is a huge difference in his defensive contribution between him and that of other player in his position. 
As far as Costa goal is concerned, it's amazing how you are blaming Mata, when Depay lost the ball, Schneiderlin was out of position and I think it was Blind who was marking Costa.
As far as the Spurs game was concerned, everyone saw Mata wasn't able to cope up, should have been brought off a long time before. Also, Darmian was poor in positioning as well, so instead of laying all the blame on him, be a bit unbiased in his judgement

4039~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4040~~~
No. What you're seeing here is that other people (who also watched Mata this season) agree that his work rate was good. Yet despite these posters and myself all noticing it, you somehow came away with the opposite opinion.

The point is that "poor work rate" implies lack of effort or commitment. If you want to say he's poor defensively then that's fine, a lot of people woul agree with it. Your "poor work rate" comment is clearly untrue though.

4041~~~
I would say that it's innacurate, he has been efficient which is a quality of his but he didn't created enough, he hasn't a big enough threat nor a big enough creator.

4042~~~
He created more than Martial according to Squaka (which is quite reputable by way of stats).

4043~~~
And that's not enough for a player of his standing compare him with other players in the league.

4044~~~
He played for LVG and Moyes FFS. Everyone knows how talented he was when he had more freedom upfront and movement around him. He created about 1.3 chances a game, which really isn't that bad when you look at the circumstances and compare to say, Firminho, who had a very good season and created 1.5 chances per game.

4045~~~
It's fine then. But it works for all our players.

4046~~~
And relative to all our players, Mata was one of the biggest chance creators.

4047~~~
In a team that creates nothing and ended the season 5th. Basically the best player in a really bad bunch.

4048~~~
And you blame him for creating little rather than the system he plays under. Baffling, especially when I've named two very good attackers he created more chances than.

4049~~~
I didn't blame him, I didn't blame anyone. I said that he didn't had a good season.

4050~~~
?!

4051~~~
That's not a blame, I didn't said that we weren't good because of Mata. But if you want me to blame then all the players and the manager are responsible for the poor performances, Mata wasn't the worse but he wasn't good either.

4052~~~
Fair enough, but you're saying Mata didn't create enough. By this logic, nor did Firminho or Marital, which is quite baffling.

Maybe your standards for judging player seasons are quite high, but with being on the right wing and having lesser full backs in support, I'm one of the few that think Mata had a decent/good season for us.

4053~~~
It's not baffling, they are all members of pretty poor teams.

4054~~~
For me he is a player who make good attacking team even better but can't do it on his own when a team is not playing well. And it is pretty clear why, his weak sides are dribbling, his speed and lack of strength. That are qualities you need to make things happen on your own and he is clearly not that kind of player.
But technically he is very good, great first touch, have great vision and great passing. I think he improved his attacking sense and his finishing touch. Play him in number 10 role with quick (and good) wingers and a good striker upfront in a functional attack and you will see a different Mata. 

Problem with Mata is that he played in a team which was badly organized in attack and which needed a players who can make things on their own and that just showed his weaknesses even more. He also played in a position in which he can play of course but it is not his best position. That made United fans think that he is not as good as he really is but if we will have a functional attack next season, which I think we will have, he can surprise many people.

4055~~~
They were one of the better performers in the premier league, irrespective of the club they played for. Yet, you say they did not create enough. Odd.

4056~~~
Feck knows about Firmino but Martial and Mata didn't create enough. When we would go through matches and be lucky to have one shot the whole team isn't creating enough chances. I mean obviously that isn't because Martial and Mata aren't good players, I'd be an idiot to suggest that. But there's no point pretending they were creative enough because none of our players were.

4057~~~
Squaka has Mata creating more chances than Firminho. When looking at the rigid system he played under, it baffles me how some think Mata didn't have a decent season for us.

4058~~~
Yeah he had an alright season. Obviously with Jose coming in he might struggle though. But you never know he might have been watching us and think he made a mistake letting him go.

4059~~~
Juan Mata is our best creative midfielder in the team. he should play No 10 next season surrounded by players with pace. Put Herrera on No 8 then our CM will click

If the problem is about his lack of height and physicality then the same should apply to Jesse, Rashford, CBJ, Adnan, Pereira, Shaw, Martial, Depay, Wier

4060~~~
Talk here is of Mata going to Dortmund. Might just be rumour with no substance but smoke and fire etc

4061~~~
Those are some really weird comparisons to prove your point.

4062~~~
It would be a very good move for Dortmund and Mata. I bet he'd flourish there but wonder whether they'd play Kagawa and Mata together.

4063~~~
Mata likes to occupy the same sort of position Zlatan will drop off into, if he's to stay and start next year he'll have to play more like a second striker like he did at Chelsea at points.

4064~~~
I see no reason to sell him, even with the new signings coming in. We are a team that lacks goals and creativity, wouldn't make sense to sell Mata, he gives us a good option though I don't see a regular starting spot for him

4065~~~
I think some people interpretated my 'poor work rate' in a different way. Work rate isn't only about defensively duty. It's part of it but Mata is also doesn't show any good rate in general. You don't see Mata being involved in 90 minutes so often both offensive and defensive. That's why I called him ball watching and poor work rate.

4066~~~
I have faith he'll be capable to do that. He can still have a good future with us if Mourinho gives him a proper chance.

4067~~~
Agree. The fact that we don't even create enough chances or scored goals last season means Mata's stats is pointless.

4068~~~
Keep him, we need more than 1 player per position. 

Having Mata/Mkhitaryan/Rooney/Lingard for the CAM position is good options.

4069~~~
Hoping the rumours of him leaving are false. Very good player technically and can be lethal when used properly. I want Blind and him to stay, there are many oafs in this squad that have to be cleared before even touching these two.

4070~~~
Now that we have some actual quality in attack, I'd really like to see Mata given a chance.

4071~~~
Rumour going around that mata has agreed personal terms with everton.

4072~~~
This. I really hope we don't sell him.

4073~~~
Source

4074~~~
Hope its false. The news source was some "MUFC exclusive news" handle. He is easily among the better players in our team.

4075~~~
Mata must not leave without being given a chance. Despite his lack of pace and strength, he is technically excellent, has good vision and is a goalscorer.

He is much more suited to the no.10 role than Rooney as Rooney doesn't have a good enough first touch to play that role. Time and again he has broken down good moves with poor touches this season. On the other hand, with Martial and Mikhytaryan on the left and right respectively, we will finally have quality wingers on each side to stretch teams and free up space in the middle for our no.10 to exploit. That player must not be Rooney.

As a result, after ruling out Rooney as our no.10, (and assuming Mikhi plays on the right) , the best option is Mata.

4076~~~
Better players for United than mata the past season:
<ul>
<li>Martial</li>
<li>Rashford</li>
<li>Lindgard</li>
<li>Herrera</li>
<li>Rooney</li>
<li>Schneiderlin</li>
<li>Fellaini</li>
<li>Blind</li>
<li>Smalling</li>
<li>Young</li>
</ul>Mata is slow, weak, and cowardly. Usually going for the safe square pass, very rarely manages to dribble past players or defend the ball. He is a huge money waste and would fit better in a slower league such as Serie A.

4077~~~
Seen the videos of Zlatan asking what number he'll be and the response is '8'? 

No audio but it's pretty clear what the conversation is...

4078~~~
If he isn't gone, he's definitely going to be on the bench next season if Miki hits the ground running. Even if he doesn't, Mourinho will not want Mata on the right wing.

4079~~~
Anyone thinking pace is important for a technically gifted player is not having a fair assessment of Mata. Mata is going for the safe pass because LVG was coward. If he's given the free attacking framework, he will deliver. That's what technically gifted players do.

Zidane or Pirlo did not need to be fast.

4080~~~
Mata isn't a technical wizard, that's been evident since he's signed for us. Silva and Iniesta are the players you are describing, Mata is more about goals and now we have a player in Miki that has pace, goals and creativity.

4081~~~
What did the players in old do last season that made them better? I feel Lingard was also not better but he did decent in comparison to the expectations

His first touch, work rate, passing are excellent. His finishing is very good. Hell he managed to score more goals in his worst season than Ozil did in his best season.

4082~~~
Can't see him playing a big role. Mourinho won't play him on the wing, so it'll most likely be second choice #10. Though who knows, he may impress in training and make the #10 position his own, finally being surrounded by quality and pace. Love him but I think his days are numbered.

4083~~~
Juan Mata has consistently got double figure for goals and assists in his time here. It would be madness selling him immediately.

4084~~~
Herrera and Fellaini better than Mata this last season? Wow. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Rooney and Young are also wrong.

4085~~~
So bring Mata in the middle behind the front 3. If you really think Mata is not at Silva level at least on the ball, your memory is tricking you. He has fantastic control and passing ability. His shooting is good as well.

4094~~~
I have a feeling that if he leaves it won't be because Mourinho asked him to leave, rather he decided to as a 28 year old who's just seen a manager who benched and sold him before sign a marquee player who plays in his position. 

Fair enough too.

4095~~~
He's shown he has excellent technique with some brilliant first touches and goals over the years but I feel his passing is very overrated. He opts for the easy pass the majority of the time and when he does go for the killer pass or a long range one it is 50/50 on how well it's weighted. Most of the time, I feel he's either underhit or overhit the pass leaving the attacker with more to do than he should have in terms of keeping it under control.

It was particularly evident in a game last season at home (I can't remember which) where we were losing and Mata decided to try and dictate the game from deep and just completely failed. If he wasn't passing the ball sideways he was giving it away with poor passes. Maybe it was due to not having runners off the ball as our movement under van Gaal was non-existent at times, but that didn't excuse some of the awful passes he made, and the fact he didn't create anything.

I mean, di Maria was on another level in terms of wastefulness but at least he created a decent to good goalscoring chance a game; something I've rarely seen from Mata at his time here. The one time I've felt he's done a decent job at that was against Southampton at home in a 1-0 loss ironically. It was like the complete opposite of the Mata of norm in that he had a real grip on the game and was dictating it, but was incredibly wasteful infront of goal missing 3 good opportunities. Away to Wolfsburg he was pretty good, too, but was bizarrely subbed off for Powell.

He's just not good enough to be a primary playmaker for a top team in my opinion. Though, I'd still like to see us keep him for another season at least.

4096~~~
You also have to look at losing his place in the Spain squad, so would want to be playing all the time to have a chance of getting back in. Not being at the Euros will have hurt his pride.

4097~~~
Fecking hell.

He's been better than most in that list. Quite odd you say he usually goes for square safe passes when he's created the same as (or more than) Martial (source: Squaka).

4098~~~
With the additions of Zlatan and Mkhitaryan our first choice attack is strong, but a couple injuries where would we turn to if Mata is sold? I think it'd be careless to get rid of him this summer. I'd keep him another season until we can continue to strengthen next year.

4099~~~
Agree. Aside from the wages we're paying him (which shouldn't be a problem anyway given our resources) there's no real upside to selling Mata if he's happy to stay, at least until we're in a stronger position.

4100~~~
IMO Mata shrinks on big occasions and hasn't justified his price tag. One only has to compare him to the likes of Ozil to realize that he's been quite underwhelming given that he cost us nearly 40 million (only 5 million less than ozil) and had the tag of being Chelsea's POTY.  If a club offers the right price, we should sell him.

4101~~~
Because Ozil never shrinks on the big occasion?

4102~~~
This post is BS

4103~~~
Please re-read what I've written. I'm referring to the meager return from our 37 million pound, then club record signing. Ozil on the other hand has been a success at Arsenal.

4104~~~
Yup, a lot like with what van Gaal did with Hernandez/Welbeck et al. I can see Mourinho doing the same. 'If you stay, you're x choice and will be spending most time on the bench.' Decision is yours type of thing.

4105~~~
I know. I'm just pointing out that one of the things you accuse Mata of doing is also an accusation that regularly gets levelled at Ozil.

4106~~~
I doubt it's even been anything that personal. Just a message to all players confirming that he isn't going to be looking to offload anyone before he's had a chance to see them train and that they'll all be fighting for their place. Mata is the only one with history and a fair idea of what is to come for him.

4107~~~
Yes. And that's a testament to how poor Mata has been for us. Out, out out.

4108~~~
The Caf is officially a breeding ground for comedians!

4109~~~
should add Januzaj and Wilson to that list, would make it more believable

4110~~~
Ozil makes up for it in all the other games while Mata doesn't. It's as simple as that. Any comparison between the two is futile. For nearly 40 million you expect the quality, performance and stats that Ozil delivers.

4111~~~
His name is ''free Herrera'' after all, so not surprised by that post.

4112~~~
Just to point out regarding your point regarding stats, Mata scored last season than Ozil. So its just assists Ozil delivers, and iirc Mata's were more the season before

4113~~~
No real upside? Getting an under performing player off the books is always a bonus. He's going to be 3rd or 4th choice for right wing or no 10 role, so really what's the point of keeping him?
Jose simply won't play him unless we suffer a complete injury crisis. So what is the upside of keeping him?

4114~~~
Can't imagine him staying past this next season.  He isn't a Mourinho player.

4115~~~
"It's just assists that Ozil delivers" is a surprising statement. Firstly you undermine his contribution and you neglect the role he plays as a permanent fixture in the starting XI of Arsenal which cannot be quantified. 

As far as stats are concerned, you chose to ignore that Ozil played less games than Mata the season before. So if you look at per game or per 90 min contributions Ozil is ahead of Mata in every respect (excluding goals) I.e. In key passes, assists and attack score (squawka). 

It's clear for anyone who watches the game a) Mata has been an average singing while Ozil has been a success at Arsenal (so far) b) Ozil has always been the superior player (most assists in the last 5 yrs in all the top5 leagues in Europe)

4116~~~
Only Martial was better. 

Rashford played barely a third of the season, and fell away after that lightening start (still better than Mata). 

Blind and Smalling were nothing special, good seasons, not much more.

The rest were inconsistent.

4117~~~
Wouldn't be surprised if he left, for obvious reasons. However I would side with the people who see his value and would like him stay.

He has weaknesses but he's still one of the few players in the squad with outstanding technique and short passing. Putting aside his knack for goals and assists.  I guess it's also whether a club makes a cheeky offer to take him off our hands.

4118~~~
Ozil has been underwhelming during his time at Arsenal. He had one good period until January, this year, of around 6 months, in a better and more cohesive team than ours. 

Ozil for Arsenal: 22 goals and 46 assists in 113 starts. 
Mata for United: 28 goals and 17 assists in 89 starts.

4119~~~
I don't really know what to think of Mata. He just hasn't delivered in his time here, but that is also due to the managers he's played under and their turgid style of football. He obviously is a big talent, but he needs to prove to Jose that he deserves to be here.

4120~~~
He's just not that good. He shouldn't be considered one of the better players, if the squad is to the appropriate standard. He wouldn't get into any top side, and I can't see any top managers playing him very much.

His biggest assets are his shooting and final pass (once he's been played in behind a defence)
But there are a number of players who offer that and quite a bit more.

The fact that he has a nice first touch and good close control is pretty much negated by the fact he can't use that control to beat a man, shield the ball, or move the forward. 

Everton genuinely is more his level, to be honest. For a top team, he's merely an impact substitute.

I don't disagree that Ozil is the better player. Its just that you said ozil has been better even statistically, which isn't true which Di Maria's Angel pointed out as well

With stats like this given the situations he has been,  how can you not see that he has been obviously influential. While he may not be a first XI player I'd definitely rather want him as a squad player over Fellaini and Rooney.

I love how DeGea didn't make the list

Lovely guy with a lovely blog. I'll miss his cuddly hugs but there's not a hope he'll be anywhere near Mourinhos first XI. Jose probably see's him as a very handy squad player to keep when he needs to give first teamers a rest.  There are players who you simply can not critisize at Utd no matter how average they are most of the time. Berbatov and Nani are 2 other examples of players who turned up in only 1 in every 5 yet you'd be signing a death warrant if you said a bad word about either of them on here

I don't fully agree with this.

From Feb to May in his first season, he scored a couple of goals (6) in a mere 14 games. Not that they meant much in the end, however, he contributed well in his first 4-5 months.

In his second season, he bagged some vital goals, especially in the big games - goals against Liverpool and City (among others) were fundamental to our 4th place position. All in all, he had a very decent season.

This season, we expected more, however, given the circumstances with our team, manager and style, we probably got the best out of him. 11 goals and 11 assists isn't a terrible return in a completely dysfunctional team.

Since he signed, I think, he's been our second (if not first) most productive player which tells you that he has delivered, to some extent.

He's on $140k/week. You shouldn't pay bench warmers that kind of money. I agree his passing is a little over-rated. He's good but not that good. He's just too weak for the PL.

4127~~~
Out, out, out! That's exactly what I feel when I read these type of posts.

4128~~~
We have players that earn that much and some much more that should no longer be at the club.

I think it says a lot that my primary concern with him once Mkhit was in the bag was how much I'd miss his blog.

4130~~~
Wherever he goes (and I hate that he will almost certainly go) then I dread to think how badly screwed we are going to get on the transfer fee - particularly in light of the ridiculous offers for the likes of Deeney and Benteke <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

We're a team that has struggled for goals. He's one of our most productive players (our second highest goal scorer since he arrived, I think?). While I expect Mourinho, Zlatan and Micky Targ to improve us in that regard, we're still a team without a huge amount of firepower.

So the upside would be that even if Mata is relegated to a squad role, we at least have that productive squad player to turn to. As opposed to selling him and being forced to turn to inferior players with inferior levels of productivity if/when players lose form or are injured. 

You're basically asking what the upside to having squad depth is. It's pretty self evident really.

Not players, only player (I assume you meant Wayne). Top earners:

<b>Wayne Rooney</b> ----------- £250k/w
Zlatan Ibrahimovic -------- £220k/w
David de Gea -------------- £200k/w
Juan Mata ------------------ £140k/w
Bastian Schweinsteiger --- £136k/w
Henrikh Mkhitaryan ------- £???k/w
Ashley Young -------------- £110k/w
Morgan Schneiderlin ------ £100k/w

4133~~~
From that list I would certainly see Rooney, Young and Schweinsteiger go before Mata does. Young really got the most out of his time here. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I agree. Those 3 before Mata. Yet I still wouldn't want anyone on > £100k/w benchwarming.

4135~~~
A lot of talk that he's agreed terms with Everton.

This is a performances thread, if you want to discuss rumours of him leaving make a thread.
