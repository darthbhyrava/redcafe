hi.

2~~~
hey.

3~~~
I have quite high hopes for him this season.

He has pace, good skills and can pass. I hope he plays this season

4~~~
Always impresses on pre season tour, but hardly gets a chance. Hopefully that can all change this time.

5~~~
Where does he fit in in 433 though?

6~~~
Well he did get injured after starting the 1st game of the season and was out for almost half the season after that.

7~~~
Did he get any game time the other night? How's he doing recently?

8~~~
Always looks good in these pre seasons. But for some reason gets loaned out or stays on the fringes of the first team.Hopefully LVG will give him his chance.

9~~~
Was expecting him to break through last season really. At 22 you'd think it's now or never.

10~~~
He came on at half time and played the second half on the right. He didn't see to much of the ball since most of our attacks in the second half went through Pereira on the left.

11~~~
It's going to be really hard for him to break into the team this season. I think he needs a PL loan to a team like Sunderland or one of the newly promoted teams

12~~~
He is going to have so much competition. I really like this guy but he is going to have to compete with young and delay for the LW spot on this team or di maria, janusaj, and Mata on the right.

13~~~
Van Gaal complemented his play and his holding width.

14~~~
Probably a make or break season for him, seeing as how he's 22 now and if he doesn't see many chances, he might think of moving on to a lower club. I think he can be good as a wide forward in the 4-3-3 but he has to play some games to show his level.

15~~~
Actually rate this kid. Seems to impress on every loan out and every pre-season tour.

16~~~
Injury completely wiped out his breakout season. i feel it for him. Hopefully more luck will come his way this time. talented kid

17~~~
I really like the look of him, quality assist too. Will be interesting what the future holds for him..

18~~~
Great energy and tidy on the ball, thought after Pereira he was the youngster that impressed the most in the second half.

19~~~
He should cross more instead of giving that job to McNair who's not a very good crosser.

20~~~
I like him. But he might be lacking that last bit of quality to break through here.

21~~~
I really like him.  Has an eye for goal, very intelligent, and is an excellent pass and move player However, I don't think he has enough quality as a dribbler to make it here as a wide player.  I would love to be proven wrong.

22~~~
I thought he was good again. Measures his passes and crosses intelligently rather than just smashing it in at every given opportunity. I like him. If he happens to go on loan again it should be to a team in the PL. If Newcastle are still interested we should be all over it. He'll get more time there than he will here, they've got a good manager who knows and trusts him.

23~~~
Think he'll be a good deputy to Mata (if the manager trusts him enough).Seems to share some similar traits and roles.

24~~~
I've been a Lingard fan ever since his great performances 2 pre seasons ago when we went to Asia, I would love to see him making it through at United. However I also feel he hasn't shown that extra bit of quality since then. I hope he impresses LVG more and gets a chance to show something this season.

25~~~
He will be behind Di Maria Mata and janusaj in the rw position.

26~~~
bigger squad required this year and I think it means he and a few others will get regular football between reserves, league cup and on the fringes of the first team....

he seems to keep his best football for the US though

27~~~
I still like the look of this guy. And I'd really like to see him play in a side closer to our first XI.

28~~~
Why hasn't he been used on the left during the tour? He's got lots of quality, expect him give us quality minutes here and there.

29~~~
Remembered this tweet from Rio last year. He obviously rates him.

30~~~
Rio rates everybody

31~~~
He's right about Lingard though. He is quality, although that still may not be enough to challenge the established 1st teamers we have.

32~~~
i know, i also rate Jesse but im just saying....dont think there is any player in the world that Rio doesnt rate, WC muppet <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

33~~~
I love Lingard's technical ability which is a cut above the usual hyped English youngster. He has an ability to score goals too. My concern is that he doesn't have the pace to really be a wide player and he's not going to get minutes in the center for us. Probably just bad timing with him, he will have to go to a midtable club and earn his stripes there. If Tom Cleverley can land with a club like Everton, why not Lingard?

34~~~
I have said it for years now, he is not good enough. He good speed and decent ability in many ways, but not good enough at anything I feel. Considering his age I think the ship has sailed. He will be loaned out to a good championship side or sold this summer I think.

35~~~
Lingard is a football player, great football brain, i think he'll be a good Premier League player somewhere, if not here. He's an LVG type player, I think, able and willing to change speeds, slow it down and keep possession, but also very comfortable playing quick pass and move football on the ground. 

Give him the freedom to switch places with the AM and come inside at times, I'd say. That's when he's at his best.

36~~~
He can be useful this season

37~~~
Like to see him start some matches on the right.

38~~~
I really hope he gets a fair chance.... or go out on a premier league loan.. Another year in the reserves and 3 month championship loan would be a waste.

39~~~
Efficient scorer, doesn't waste many chances, never has.

Doesn't have massive power on his shot but excellent control.

40~~~
Fine player who probably won't make it here due to the abundance of attacking talent but he should have a very good Premier League career regardless. Hope he makes it though.

41~~~
Great assist !

42~~~
Mata better be looking over his shoulder, because Lingard's looking very good. Great goal and assist. Another good cameo from Jesse.

43~~~
He's not the flashiest but barely makes a bad decision and got very good technique and works hard.

44~~~
1+1 as tidy as player can be and it's hardly his best position..

45~~~
The master of pre-season.

46~~~
He deserves to be in the squad this year, can be competition for the RW/LW spot, he is a very clinical finisher and good at linking up.

47~~~
LvG praised him, but did say that he could have done better in defence a few times.

48~~~
Another pre-season, another good run out when called upon. Hope hes given games / minutes as he never looks out of place in the United shirt.

49~~~
Good performance, though I hope he steps up this season instead of ending up as just another year of pre-season wonder.

50~~~
I'll be sad if we get Pedro and he doesn't get a fair crack at the first team.

51~~~
Couldn't have done more with his 30 minutes, cool finish and quality assist, hopefully we can get hijm a good PL loan this season, maybe to Swansea or Everton.

52~~~
Maybe he could do with a move, and probably United can insert a buy back clause like what Barca and Real are doing at the moment. Needs game time playing in the highest level instead of loaning to championship team every year.

53~~~
We could still send him out on loan to a decent club if LVG doesn't see the opportunity to fit him into the rotation. The talent is there, no doubt about it, and he's proven it for a second year in a row in preseason. I think if it wasn't for his injury last year, we'd be having an entirely different discussion right now.

54~~~
I admit I writ him off. I know it's only pre season but there's something about him.

55~~~
Always wanted to say that but scared to be ripped apart by the caf.

At least he's taken his chances.

56~~~
Thought he was bloody brilliant today. Goal, assist and he picked out I think Adnan with another great ball. The assist in the other match too, he seems to pick out through balls with ease.

57~~~
Has he ever been anything less than impressive in the pre-seasons for us?

58~~~
Didn't he score 4 goals once in a championship game on debut?

59~~~
He certainly has perseverance if nothing else. At the start of each of the last 3 seasons I've thought he's going to leave and yet he comes up with excellent performances. Deserves to start vs Spurs for me It's be a fecking crime if we signed Pedro when we've got someone really talented who can make the step up.

60~~~
Pedro is a far better player than Lingard though. Lingard is almost 23 and barely has any PL games to his name, Pedro is a multiple times CL and La Liga winner and a vital part of the best Barcelona line up in recent years. Pre-season games should not skew anyone's view.

61~~~
Yes for Birmingham.

I think Newcastle might come in for him in the next few weeks. McClaren is a fan so we'll have a decision to make as to whether we think he'll make it here.

62~~~
One interesting thing to note is that Pedro's breakthrough season at Barca came when he was 22. Prior to that he'd been playing for their youth and reserve teams. So it's not necessarily too late for Lingard.

63~~~
Yes, I know Pedro's better but Lingard deserves a chance to show what he can do. At some point you've simply got to the throw a player in and see what he does. Pedro wasn't exactly teenager when he made his mark either.

64~~~
You feel it's now or never for Lingard here. I just wonder if the minutes might go to others ahead of him who we're looking to develop and block his route. I think van Gaal rates him, but with that in mind, he might offer him the chance to go elsewhere to play regularly if an offer arrives which I'm sure it will.

65~~~
Hope he's given a chance, looks like a player determined to make it. Pacey, hungry to score goals, give him a go LvG!

66~~~
One of the players you would love to see make it but he will need a lot of luck to fall his way. New signings will severely impact his chances.

67~~~
has to go on loan. hes 22 and needs to be starting nearly every game and playing 90 mins. would be nice to see him at newcastle with him on one side and aarons on the other.

68~~~
He wouldn't be guaranteed starts at any decent PL side. Newcastle have Cabella, Goufrann, de Jong, Riviere, Sissoko plus youngsters of their own they would like to develop (Aarons, Vuckic). Clubs would rather invest in their own players than loanees in terms of playing time unless they are a significant and immediate upgrade.

69~~~
yeah youre right. im just hoping he gets a manager who believes in him like mcclaren does and a side that plays at a high level. he deserves so much better than what hes got so far. has not been rewarded for his patience yet.

70~~~
Van Gaal should take a gamble on him and put him in the team or the squad. I really think he can make that step up.

71~~~
You always need someone in the team to do the dirty work. Not everyone can be the focal point of the attack. Sometimes I feel that Mata doesn't get used enough on the right side to be worth the spot, only so many playmakers can be fit into a team, at some point you need someone like Young or Park to do the running and spacing.

Of course Mata doesn't need to go to make that happen, but I can see an argument for Lingard on the right instead of Young on the left to do a lot of the dirty work. That would let us put Memphis or Pedro out left in lieu of Young, with Lingard doing the dirty work on the right side. 

He can also provide goals and assists, probably more than Young. And he has the endless running and energy of a 23 year old. After barely playing last season his legs are super fresh, as far as wear and tear he's gained a year, in a sense, not wearing himself down over the last year.

He has a great understanding with Pereira and Januzaj, having played a lot with the former and a fair bit with the latter. This was evident in preseason. Of course it's just preseason, so we'll have to see if he can handle the weekly pressure of having to perform, if he does get a starting spot.

72~~~
Got that the wrong way around, he's played with Adnan a lot more than Andreas. I could only actually find 5 starts he shared with Andreas for the u21s and a further 3 times Andreas came on for about 10 minutes with Lingard on the pitch.

73~~~
The time for loaning is past for me. It's sink or swim time for him at United.

Reckon he'll do very well if he's given the chance.

74~~~
Didn't watch the game last night. What position was he playing in?

75~~~
Right mid.

76~~~
Don't say 'writ' again, or I'll kill you.

As for Jesse, he's not flashy, but is technically sound and has an instinct to score goals. The Ashley Young shot that got saved first half showed the difference in this respect. The game opened up for him, and he seemed reluctant to shoot for a few seconds, despite being open in the box on his stronger foot. It seemed once there was no pass on, he had no choice, so shot, with little conviction I think. A wide man like Jesse or Depay would be more direct and aggressive in such situations,  if the shot is on they will take. This is why they will always get goals from wide.

77~~~
A big part of me would rather we didn't buy Pedro and just gave Lingard and Januzaj games instead.

78~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> sorry

I think the first sentence describes Lingard pretty well though.

79~~~
Either play him or sell him. It would be pointless to send him in an another loan. He has been very good in a few pre-seasons now, so I hope he gets a fair spell in the team. Although looking at our attacking options (and also that Januzaj, Pereira and Wilson are more talented) I think that chances of him making it here are slim. He looks such an intelligent player though, and usually I like those types of players. Keeping him for a season in the first team and giving him the chance to prove himself is the right way to go, IMO.

80~~~
Honestly I'd rather see him given a chance rather than buy Pedro for big money.

81~~~
The funny part is Pedro broke through at Barca at the same age as he is now (Pedro wasn't really considered a top prospect at La Masia as well).Assuming we have a 22-year-old Pedro in our book he wouldn't even make it if we splash the cash on the 27-year-old himself.

82~~~

83~~~
still think he needs a regular starting XI role in a higher standard team before he makes the jump to united,  as opposed to being on the bench, playing the odd game and coming on for a few minutes in some games. training with better players is always good but real match situations are better at training players and i fear he wont get enough of that at united. but i guess thats just my opinion.

84~~~
Really? Adnan didn't spend much time with the U21s, one season I think before Moyes called him up. He played there a fair bit last season but Lingard didn't. The season before I wanna say Lingard spent mostly on loan.

Pereira has been with the U21s for what feels like 3 years but maybe it's just two?

Odd, anyway. What site are you using for those stats?

85~~~
Yep, Adnan and Lingard were u21 regulars in the 12/13 season so played with each other quite a bit while Andreas only played 7 minutes that season. Andreas didn't really break through to the u21s until around January of the 13/14 season by which time Lingard was already out on his loans. The age gap between the two means they've never really overlapped.

86~~~
Timing eh, I think he could have a very strong chance of making it here as he is a decent player, but he's potentially competing against two other players in similar positions who also happen to be our two most talented prospects through the academy.

87~~~
it's never too late for a player to start shining. Coquelin is the example imo, he stepped up when it mattered and Arsenal fans have all of a sudden gem in their team. Shame Lingard won't have such luck in terms of what position he plays and the playing time as he's clearly best as no10 or as one of the most advanced of midfield three which is currently and seems to actually always be the most occupied position in our team. 

Anyway good luck to him, he needs now to take every chance he's given. He will get games he's versatile enough. One day he could be used as Young, an experienced always 7/10 player..

88~~~
Wondering if with his 'natural ability to score' he could play as a striker for us (not first choice of course but still).

89~~~
Feels like we've been watching him for ages but most of it was in the U18s.

90~~~
He better fecking make it. I'll lose my shit if he doesn't. Good technique, very intelligent, very good on the ball, quality finisher, versatile.

91~~~
Greatest united tour player ever<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> hope he really kicks on and fights his way into the team

92~~~
Nah, I wouldn't think so. He's not particularly got the attributes of a striker. He's just one of those players who always manages to score lots of goals. Combination of being a very reliable, clinical finisher over a variety of ranges, and having that knack of arriving at the right time and place. Always seems to be the player who scores from the rebound/deflection/loose ball.

93~~~
Thinking about it we've also got wilson, pierrera and junazaj knocking on the door for first team football.

if anyone needs a loan it's lingaard

94~~~
Just seen you added stuff, yeah Adnan didn't even really spend a full season in the u21s and his big season there was 12/13 when Lingard was still playing there too. Andreas has played only 1.5 years for the u21s with the odd appearance off the bench before that. Andreas only started to get played once Lingard was already on loan. 

Transfermarkt, they have the line-ups for every match. 

fecking hell, learn how to spell some names.

95~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

96~~~
Considering that basically every bottom half Prem teams uses 2 wide men and that 4-5 and 5-6 assists is considered a fine season for a starting winger (see Bolasie, Yanick), I think Lingard should go on loan. He can put up those numbers and get 30-35 starts and we can see what we have.

97~~~
I thought he injected some direct pace and drive into our attack when he came on.

98~~~
i like him as much as the next guy, but he was on for ten minutes and i don't remember him having the ball more than twice. not much of an opportunity to do anything.

nevertheless, i have a feeling he'll be out on loan this year even if he is 22.

99~~~
Its rumored that LVG is going to sell him...and Bristol City want him for 2.5M. Its the Sun though.

100~~~
I'll be pissed if we sell him without being given a chance.

101~~~
Jesse is a great player, intelligence, speed, confidence, no way he will be sold, he will play his part this season.

102~~~
If Van Gaal sells him, then everything he said about giving youth a chance (Lingard's not exactly that young anymore) if they impress on tour is bs. He's arguably been our best player.

103~~~
It's probably the right time to let him go and get regular football with a settled spot somewhere.

104~~~

105~~~
This is the exact view I had watching the game live at the stadium. I was behind the United goal

106~~~
It's probably time for him to move on for the good of his own career.

107~~~
We rejected a 5 mil move for him last summer.

Well obviously it's bs.We're filling up our bench with the likes of Matas and quick fixing our XI  with Pedro etc so when will Lingard play?

108~~~
It isn't "obviously" bullshit - there may be something to it. We should be worried if there is. Schweinsteiger singled him out as quite a talent, so to let him go would seem odd.

109~~~
Quick fixing?

If he was good enough then he'd play. You also forgotten Pereira is ahead of him also.

He's also going to be 23. He should have by now shown something that he would justify a first team spot and I am not talking about pre season. Three managers have not picked him for the first team. There must be a reason for that.

110~~~
I'm not saying the rumour is bs...Bristol City might as well have already send their bid.

He's a late developer.Fergie has said himself that Lingard will be a first teamer by the time he's 23.Obviously Fergie isn't always right but I only refer to the late development part.Pedro broke through at Barca at the same time, did you ever ask the 21 years old Pedro what had he shown to justify a first team spot?

Pereira has played on the left and middle whilst Lingard played exclusively on the right so far on LVG's system.

Pedro is a quick fix yes.No shame on that though, we need to go for the title this season.

111~~~
Comes down to this really. LVG's record has proven he has no problem giving youth a chance as long as they're good enough.

112~~~
Ferguson said a lot of things. Fact is Ferguson did not even give him any minutes in the league cup. Moyes did not give him anything and started Januzaj on the wings. Only LVG started him, when we had injury problems and he got injured himself. 

Pedro was 21 also. Two years difference and he also broke through in the greatest ever team. Big difference. And Guardiola knew him very well from the B team, when he coached there. 

Like I said, three managers have given him a grand total of one appearance in the first team. So there is something to that.

113~~~
We really should be aiming to give the lad a premier league loan first if we're not going to give him first team minutes.

114~~~
Did you even read my post?Like I said he's a late developer hence so patience is needed from the managers.Not a big difference from Pedro's case, if Barca bought an older player to play in Pedro's position Pedro wouldn't have make it.For those players who aren't "special youngsters" in the youth team like them opportunities to showcase themselves are very important.

I'm not saying buying Pedro is a wrong thing to do or anything, I think he will be a good player for us but there's always a victim of a transfer and it seems to be Lingard in this case.

115~~~
How do you know he's a late developer? Are you mystic meg?

Maybe he's not good enough? You giving me the opinion of a manager, who never gave him one minute of first team football. Great. 

Fergie always went overboard with his comments about young players. Just like every manager tends to. He said Phil Jones will be one of our greatest players ever. 

The fact is three managers have given him one appearance. Can't you see there is something odd to that? Or are you just going to keep telling me comments Fergie made after pre season. 

Victim of transfer? Pedro is replacing Di Maria not Lingard. 

One thing you shouldn't question and say it's bs is whether LVG gives youth a chance. He will if you are good enough.

116~~~
It's now or never tbh.

I think I'd keep him and give him game time. It's not exactly like we'd make much money if we sold him. Knowing us I'd be surprised if we got 3m for him!

117~~~
I like him, he's a good player. I hope he gets a fair shot this season.

118~~~
If he doesn't get a prem loan may aswel keep him on hand. A waste in the championship

119~~~
This. I highly doubt he will play much this season but I would rather keep him than send him on loan to a Championship side. I would be actively looking to send him on loan to a Premiership side though.

120~~~
You really dont have to be psychic to see he's a late developer.

Its pretty simple, he wasn't ready for United's first team before, but now age 22 he is. Everyone who has worked with him knew it would be that age before you saw the best of him due to his physique.

Plenty of room for improvement yet also. He is still 3-5 years away from his peak.

121~~~
surely he can do better than Bristol City!

I could see him doing well for a team like Swansea who play the right way and develop their players fully. I do think hes got a higher ceiling than Swansea but regular football somewhere like that would do him good.

122~~~
Don't see that he suits their style at all, I rate him as a very good player too but I think he'd do better at a team that gives their wingers more attacking freedom than assisting responsibility.

123~~~
In fairness, LVG picked him for the first game last season. He got a bad injury and was then farmed out, so it was down to bad luck really. If he'd stayed fit, he might have got a decent run?[/QUOTE]

124~~~
if he wants to succeed at a club like United then he needs to learn that other side of the game

125~~~
[/QUOTE]

LVG picked him primary because Valencia and Rafael were both injured. And he was asked to play a role he's never really played.

126~~~
Thought he did well in pre-season but don't see him getting much game time with our mid-field. Assumed he'd go out on loan.

127~~~
Fergie always planned to wait until he was a bit more physically mature before giving him his shot - he said he expected him to be 22 before it happened, so he retired too early to do it. Moyes rightly chose to promote Januzaj ahead of him, and in such a difficult season he was hardly going to have leeway to blood two youngsters in the same position. And LVG did try and give him his shot, but he got that terribly timed injury, something which LVG has actually expressed his disappointment about.

So whatever you think of his chances and ability, you can't really damn him based on that.

128~~~
Does seem a bit of a strange move if true. Newcastle are rumored to be interested.

129~~~
Seen he was being linked with Newcastle

130~~~
Saw that too, would rather he went there on loan. If United are getting Pedro, Lingard is really going to have trouble getting games.

131~~~

132~~~
A lad that was in the same year as me is in that video. The one in the yellow bib, with blonde streaks in his hair, called Michael Potts.

133~~~
He's playing for Conference North side AFC Fylde.Used to play in League Two for York City for a season.

134~~~
Good pre season and not even a place on the bench, despite Fellaini, Januzaj, Rojo, Jones and potentially a new winger not being available to pick for the bench. Doesn't look good for him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

135~~~
What's the point of him going on preseason then? He had a really good showing in the states.

136~~~
No injury and only 7 on the bench what can you expect?

137~~~
Any more news on whether he is going on loan? It doesn't seem he's likely to get near the match day squad anytime soon with Fellaini, Rojo and Jones all due back to add to spots on the bench never mind the starting 11.

138~~~
I still think all three options are available for Lingard; kept with us, loaned out or sold.

Genuinely not sure what will happen with him between now and the end of the window.

139~~~
He'll be given a run in the LC, if we do well he will stay with us to play in the FA Cup and as cover. Otherwise we'll loan him out to give him games.

140~~~
I guess the fact Adnan went from not making the match day 18 to starting means LvG could put him in the squad for the Brugge game if he's using one young attacking player in each game, Pereira being in the first match day squad but not the second.

141~~~
Would like to see him on the right with Adnan or Pereira in the center and Depay on the left. 

When is our first league cup game?

142~~~
Mid September.

143~~~
I hope he starts the European game personally. Keep a good solid midfield and defence and play him, Pereira and Januzaj in the attacking midfield slots.

144~~~
Any news on this front of a loan / permanent transfer? Surely he can't sit in the reserves for the season. He's a talented lad and needs to move on for his own sake.

145~~~
If Martial is the last signing we'll make that will be good news for Lingard and Pereira. They'll be alot closer to the first team than I thought and offer us alternatives out wide (if Martial plays centrally) and maybe even at 10 (although I doubt the latter). Lingard has done well in preseason and on loan, he might get his chance this year.

146~~~
We can still loan/sell players to Championship clubs, right?

147~~~
dont think we can sell them but we can loan them thats for sure....

148~~~
I do find it quite amazing that he's still at the club, yet Januzaj isn't.

I wonder if LVG has any plans to use him much? He didn't get much playing time on the tour, and spent last season on loan, so it wouldn't seem that likely.

149~~~
Even after all the outgoings he's still way down the pecking order.

The loan window opens next week and I expect he'll join a championship club again. Powell too if he's fit.

150~~~
Playing for the reserves. Poor b@stard.

151~~~
Dont know how he will get games this season, another loan coming. I feel for him though.

152~~~
Scored as well.

153~~~
He's going to be 23 this year. Definitely needs to start playing somewhere soon. He's had only 50 odd senior appearances through various loan spells.

Van Gaal always seems to name drop him so it does look like he's rated.

154~~~
Van Gaal definitely rates him or he'd have shipped him out without thinking twice about it. 
He's in the same boat as McNair, too many players ahead of him to get a chance immediately. I guess the Carling Cup game would be best shot to make an impression though I think Van Gaal prefers to make a decision on players by their training performances

155~~~
He's not even getting on the bench when the only other attacking option on the bench is Fellaini.

Not sure why he is even still at the club.

156~~~
Coming on for Mata

157~~~
Bit surprising.

158~~~
Still alive apparently.

159~~~
Good call by LvG. Up 2-0 and a big game at midweek.

160~~~
Don't mind him deputizing for Young whilst he's out injured.

161~~~
Wasn't great. Wasnt poor. Didn't look out of place. 
It's always hard for players to make an impression when the game is won and the team is happy to sit back and hit on the break. 

Would like to see him get more minutes.

162~~~
Helped stem the Everton attacks down the right hand side, offered up a threat out wide which Mata doesn't, though it wasn't a potent threat.  I think more minutes would help with that, but if he can continue to perform like that when called upon, certainly for now he's ideal to have on the bench.  Though I'm sure he'll be wondering how he didn't score towards the end.

163~~~
Seeing him getting back to cover that Barkley shot was very satisfying. Lots of young players (and a few seniors) would've been caught napping there. 

Thought he did very well.

164~~~
i thought it was a good cameo, specially as he wasnt playing in his best position(left winger) and we decided to defend the lead while he prefers to play possession game. Good defensively, did great on that Barkley chance and was always in the right positions. Offensively he did okay, was calm with the ball in dangerous areas, good movement, played one great backheel, put some decent crosses but missed one solid chance - wrong decision to hit it first time.

165~~~
I was impressed. Thought he was fine. Worked hard defensively and offered a threat going forward. I only noticed one careless control that cost him possession though my stream did freeze a few times so I might have missed other moments. Having said that, his shot wasn't great.

166~~~
True he is certainly good enough to play a squad role for this team, him and Perreira.

167~~~
We're a bit short on numbers in the squad so it'd be good if he can establish himself as a viable option.

168~~~
So true, it was very important too at the time. He did just enough to disrupt him.

169~~~
A pleasant surprise to see him play. Thought he did well enough with the limited opportunities he had and it was nice to see some width on the right as well as a few dangerous crosses. Hope to see more of him midweek as I doubt he'll get a look in for the derby.

170~~~
Not his best performance, the cross he made for Herrera was his best moment but tracked back well when Kone was drifting wide.

171~~~
He didn't look out of place. Should have tested the keeper, though.

172~~~
Great that he got some minutes. Decent performance. Should have done better with the shot. Would love to see him get more minutes with the first team this season.

173~~~
He's got the pace which gives us a different outlet to Mata on the right. Something like how Valencia used to be, hope he gets more minutes this season.

174~~~
Agreed with those who'd like to see him get more game time, and who thought he didn't look out of place. Hopefully he may start vs Boro at OT in the league cup.

175~~~
On the basis of that performance he should be getting minutes in the League Cup and against weaker teams at home if we need rotation.

176~~~
Liked what I saw. Uncharacteristically skewed his shot wide. His finishing is usually very good. I think he did enough to move up the rotation to 5th choice behind Mata, Memphis, Young, and Martial on the wings.

177~~~
Great to see him getting some game time, we hadn't killed the game off when he came on so it wasn't a token gesture to get him some minutes, it shows LVG does really rate him.

178~~~
Happy to see him get a half of premier league football under his belt. His inexperience showed at times but that is expected with a young player. Hopefully this should see him in and around the first team if he can prove himself consistently.

179~~~
He's like a young Young.

180~~~
Why was Mata subbed off for him by the way? Was it a tactical decision?

181~~~
LVG's quote from the official website:

182~~~
Glad he come on today. He wasn't great today, but he did what he had to do and had good performance. It also shows that Van Gaal has faith in him because both, Pereira and Memphis, who were on the bench today, could have come on for Mata but they didn't. Hope to see much more of him this season.

183~~~
Didn't really stand out in a good or bad way for me, but was disciplined in helping Darmian.

184~~~
That's even better. This wasn't a token gesture of giving game time. He wanted to play Lingard. And he did well. And Mata is actually not injured.

185~~~
Probably because Mata was struggling with their full back's speed.

186~~~
Good performance from Jesse today and he keeps the record going. Needs a wee bit more composure but that can be coached into him.

187~~~
Glad he got minutes. Looked decent enough to hold a place on the bench without too much worries. Look forward to seeing him appear in the League Cup.

188~~~
Memphis was rightly dropped today and Lingard made the most of his opportunity. Makes for healthy competition and I'm pleased for the lad. I also hope that Memphis gets his head down and fights his way back.

189~~~
I really like him. Very composed professional performance.

190~~~
LvG on Jesse today: 'Very good 2nd half'.

Pretty much all it was needed to hear, just don't be afraid to play him more. We simply need attacking options and he was extremely patient with getting just this one chance and he didn't blew it.

191~~~
I thought he looked nervous. He's got a lot more in his locker than that.

192~~~
Probably yeah. Got out muscled rather easily by (I think) Galloway and got skinned by Barkley in a dangerous area too.

193~~~
Love him.Hope he'll prove his doubters wrong.

194~~~
great to see him finally on the pitch, he' better centrally but certainly can do a job for us from the wing if we need him there. 

Very rarely you can see miss like that infront of the goal he's normally very composed player. I hope he gets minutes also when we need to attack and not only defend, it was obvious for which reasons he was sent on. I think he could have tried to bring the ball forward more if he wanted, he's certainly capable of that but showed "maturity" and what Van Gaal wanted, it's similar to how Ander plays under Van Gaal as no8, very patient and cautous, trying to never lose the ball if possible.. But I hope we will see him soon again. If it's not Januzaj then it should be him gven gametime, he's late bloomer and I'm 100% sure he could thrive here if he's given proper chance. He's another no10 though..

195~~~
Looked a bit nervy but with more playing time he'll feel more at home and he'll fit in nicely with Ander. Still don't think his finishing is as good as some seem to believe, nor would I even consider it one of his strong points.

196~~~
Also Mata kept giving the ball away. Had a poor half, we were up 2-0 and going to be defending more and playing on the counter. Lingard is faster and can't be worse defensively out wide. Also, Mata will need rest at times this season. Great sub.

197~~~
Liked what I saw. Good confidence booster for the lad.

198~~~
So people should remember that LVG doesn't just criticise players.

199~~~
Didn't look out of place. Seemed to just slot in nicely. 

I hope he plays more and gets the chance to show us what he can do at this level because the pre season jokes have gotten tedious among United fans

200~~~
Did really well considering it was his first competitive game of the season. I think he played well and kept Galloway quiet in the 2nd half..

201~~~
Was completely shocked when he came on, especially for Mata but really glad at the same time. Always great to see youth products out there, especially in key games.

Thought he did a good job, especially as Everton had us under the pump for that first bit of the half, dealt with it well and really grew into the game.

202~~~
Wait, wasnt he injured???

203~~~
You mean Mata? No, LVG said it was a tactical switch

204~~~
It was a great tactical change from LVG, spotted the danger and brought on Lingard to nullify it.

205~~~
No, i meant Lingard mate.

206~~~
Really happy that he got a good run out yesterday, even if it was surprising. LVG obviously has some tactical ideas around using Lingard, so it will be interesting to see is he starts to feature a bit more regularly

207~~~
Hope he gets some more minutes, probably a start in one of the Capital/FA cup qualifiers. See how he gets on. Hope he grabs his opportunities.

208~~~
He started the very first game of last season against Swansea then got injured that game and was out for a huge chunk of the season. I think he went on loan to Derby(?) for a bit. I don't think he's been injured this season though.

209~~~
He was lightening to get back when Barkley went for the half volley at the back post. He did well considering he's barely had minutes, hopefully he gets a few more minutes here and there.

210~~~
At 2-1 that game would have been different altogether, Everton started the 2nd half really well and had quite a lot of momentum. Lingard's interference there was vital.

211~~~
I was pleased with Lingard yesterday. His composure in front of goal let him down, but you can understand the kid's heart must have been pounding at the idea of getting his first competitive United goal. Lingard was much less panicky than Pereira was when he came on as a sub a few games ago. Everton really came out of the blocks strongly at the start of the second half but Lingard kept his head. Van Gaal's faith in him was totally rewarded. Signs he can hack it in the Premier League. Always good when one of the kids comes through and does okay.

212~~~
About time he was given a chance. I think this kid has genuine quality and can make it at United if given the chance, he's always impressed me when I've seen him play. Good for Van Gaal, great management too to throw him in the deep end against quality opposition. Shows real faith in the lad.

213~~~
I think he might get a run out in mid week depending on if we can get the game done and dusted with X amount of minutes to spare and then a full start against Boro a week Wednesday.

214~~~
Happy for the boy, want to see more of him and Pereira. I liked his cross to Herrera, which Stones cleared. Other than that, i thought he did well overall.

215~~~
Terrific performance from Jesse yesterday.  Hopefully we can sustain long runs in the league and FA cups so we can see more of him, Andreas and other young players this season.  Jesse has real quality, though I wouldn't expect to him being preferred to our regular wide players any time soon.

216~~~
About bloody time he was given a chance, i feel like this is the last season for him here at the club unless he shows what he got in the few apperances he will get.
Could be an alternative to Memphis on the LW, he is a clever player with good link-up and finishing, could be the perfect LvG player.

217~~~
Agree. Think he can create a spot for himself in the rotation for wide players because of it. He doesn't quite have the extra bit of quality to be a regular for us but sure can  offer something similar to Young.

218~~~
I've been impressed by him the last three preseasons and think he has some kind of a future with the first team.  Hopefully he keeps getting opportunities.

219~~~
He turns 23 in two months. I'd rather give Pereira the minutes.

220~~~
Why? You just pointed out, hes only 22. Players peak at different points..

221~~~
Different players. Pereira, though has got minutes on the left, is mostly a central player. Jesse plays wide and has ability to play all three positions behind the striker. 

Also, he wasn't merely getting "minutes" on the pitch. He was asked to play a role of maintaining width on the right, help the full back and keep possession; which he performed very well.

222~~~
There's no guarantee that Lingard will make it but everyone and his dogs know that he's a late bloomer so talking about age is quite irrelevant.

223~~~
I thought he did well. Didn't stand out, but wasn't the odd one out either on the pitch. With consistent playing time, I think he can become a useful squad player in the future.

224~~~
Because he is less likely to develop into a first team regular than Pereira, and I fear that Pereiras lack of minutes on the pitch is tempering his development.

225~~~
both players can play anywhere behind striker. Lingard's best as the most advanced midfielder in midfield three centraly or in a role Mata plays now, he lacks pace to be a proper winger, he's great playmaking abilities, linking up the play between midfield and attack so I hope he's utilized in other fashion than helping out Darmian with Galloway..

I hope both players will get a chance to shine this season but Lingard doesn't have as much time as Pereira so I hope he gets the minutes now if it's between the two..

226~~~
Can't wait to see him play more for us, hopefully he's in LVG's plans.

227~~~

228~~~
It would seem so. Likely to get a run-out coming off the bench for Mata again judging by those comments. Or maybe even a start to keep Juan fresh for City?

229~~~
Good to see him getting mentioned as a first team player. Lets hope he gets game time and delivers.

230~~~
Delighted for him <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

231~~~
I have to be honest, I don't think he's good enough to ever be a first XI United player. Maybe a squad player at best, but my feeling is he'll end up being a lower PL club player eventually.

Always nice to see youth players getting their chances though.

232~~~
In for his ability to get back faster than Mata. Could prove to be a smart move by LVG,

233~~~
I suspect the same. Good enough to give a chance, though.

234~~~
Van Gaal clearly rates him, would have played for us a lot more had it not been for that injury last season.

235~~~
If he, Herrera & Pereira are the key to unlocking pacey and attacking Manchester United then LvG can play them any day.

236~~~
I agree, but he doesn't have to become a first XI player. I'd be delighted with a squad player from the academy.

237~~~
hopefully he wont spend entire game on the right side, he is much better from the left side....delighted for him, one of my favorite players<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

238~~~
People forget that we had to spend money on squad players as well so if we can use academy players who are good enough instead, why not?

239~~~
Definitely! That's how I've always seen it, we should try to supply the team with as many squad players from the academy as possible imo.
It's very difficult to produce first team players, but our academy should be capable of a steady supply of squad players.

240~~~
Absolutely, although obviously that depends on whether the player would rather be a United squad player of a first teamer at a lesser club, as the years progress. Different characters seem to have differing views on the subject.

241~~~
He's not looking at all out of place at this level so far. Good to see.

242~~~
"This level" has been pretty low, to be fair.

243~~~
Champions League level I mean.

244~~~
Yep, I thought he was decent too.

245~~~
our best player in first half with Schneiderlin, his movement is first class.....

246~~~
I thought he was average at best. Overran the ball a few times. Only thing I thought he did well was the nutmeg. Which he followed up by overrunning it. Had a good chance to play Rooney in and angled the pass very badly.

247~~~
He's been decent but lacks that cutting edge.

248~~~
Got in good positions but wasted them really. On par with the rest of the side in that half, nobody was even decent for us.

249~~~
Looks a good player based on this half. Very good technique and movement.

250~~~
Smart player who will definitely fit the tactical plans. Give him time.

I'm so excited to see him being given a chance, hopefully over the years Pearson and maybe Rothwell are too.

251~~~
Clear to see why LVG thinks he's deserved his chance.

252~~~
At least he can end the half with some credits, unlike the fantastic captain and co.

253~~~
Yeah, I see this as well. I like how he tracks back to help out.

I think he's had a decent half. His footwork looked very good as well.

254~~~
Been meh but then who hasn't?

255~~~
Playing on his wrong side but still is always looking for the ball, being let down by others around him.

256~~~
Encouraging in parts.

257~~~
Knew he would got in an one on one situation the moment he suddenly shifted on the left, that's how good his off the ball movement is.Weak shot though and obviously wrongly ruled out for offside.

258~~~
looked proper meh

259~~~
Lingard, he was far from 'meh' surely. He was trying things, made spaces for himself and displayed a decent change of pace. Encouraging.

260~~~
I thought he did pretty well, hopefully he gets more opportunities. I think it's very difficult for the wide players in this formation when the centre forward is so off the pace.

261~~~
He was decent. Some encouraging signs here and there but still pretty raw.

262~~~
Really? He looked much more dangerous than Martial in the first half. He also seems competent with his duties defensively as opposed to giving a stupid penalty away. Yet Martial is getting endless praise and Lingard is meh? Very harsh on the lad imo.

263~~~
Did well Lingard. Faded a bit in the second half but I think he's proving himself a really good option in the team. Gotta remember that wasn't an easy match to play in by any means.

264~~~
I liked his performance, great that he is given a chance.

265~~~
Very good first half, then faded in the second. Overall he showed us that he can do a good job as a squad player this season.

266~~~
Retained the ball well but didn't do much going forward. Hard to judge him because everyone struggled. LVG would probably have liked his performance as he kept the ball.

267~~~
Thought he was one of our brighter players. Almost seemed as if he was given a free role to roam all over. Just lacking a final ball, although Rooney never seemed to be able to get in behind. Well done Jesse.

268~~~
Not too shabby for his first start of the season but will need to show a bit more creatively if he wants regular playing time IMO. A reasonably tidy shift from him though and used the ball better than Martial and Memphis (apart from the one lovely cross from Memphis).

I like him and hope to see him in a game where the team seems to have a clue and give a f*ck. Should give us a better idea of his chances.

269~~~
he was definitely among the better performers tonight, tried things was actually the most lively player on the ptch in the first half and didn't had a worse game than 6/7 Memphis' games this season. When you compare him to Martial who also tried things but lost ball more than often you could easily say who was better overall even though Martial kicked on a little in the second half. 

Looking forward to seeing him in some home game when we go full attack, he's really smart little player and deserves another chance in an easier fixture to who how creative he can be..

270~~~
I thought he looked our most likely player in the first half, very good for a first ever CL game, faded a bit in the second but plenty to build on.

271~~~
Was ok. Forgot he was on in the second half, until he came off that is. Should see some more minutes.

272~~~
pleasantly surprised and gave a good account of himself under the circumstances

273~~~
I thought he was decent, always kept trying to make space and help out in attack, but also did his defensive duties. Lets take into consideration that it was his first start since the first match of last season.

274~~~
He's the one i've wanted to see get a chance the most and glad he finally got it, did ok but not great or poor. Hopefully he gets a game when the rest of the team are performing unlike tonight

275~~~
Nice enough player, but no real cutting edge as an attacker. Mata is a class above and expect him to be back in the team very soon.

276~~~
it was his only second start after the unfortunate Swansea game last season, and debut in tough away champions league fixture. He will show much more once we play home and attack.. he was our arguably best and most creative player in the first half...

277~~~
+ he barely played this season as our legends team play more often then our U21.....

278~~~
oh yeah, I think Poborský himself collected more minutes than Jesse this season

279~~~
This is my view, too. I like Lingard fine, but to play big minutes out wide at a club like United you need to be scoring or creating a high number of goals and I can't see him doing that. He isn't a great dribbler like Pereira, isn't going to get on the end of too many through balls like Memphis or have the class and creativity on the ball of a Januzaj.

Lingard is a tidy player who should be able to get a healthy but not great number of goals from out wide. That suggests a solid Prem player, but not a United one. Like Cleverley or Shawcross, a player who could have a fine career, but one we won't miss.

280~~~
He's the main hope now the keep the youth in matchday squad record going (again I don't think it's that important but preferably it's better to maintain it to avoid another stupid media meltdown).Pereira seems not to be trusted at the moment when things get rough and McNair is the 5th choice CB and 3rd choice RB, no more no less,Wilson seems to get niggling injuries and illness all the time.

I'll play him ahead of the current Memphis no doubt.All for some healthy competition though.

281~~~
Good movement but no penetration whenever he got on the ball. He was one of the players contributing to the turgidity of that first half. Happy to see an academy player get minutes, but he doesn't look quite good enough yet.

282~~~
Wow

283~~~
Im so happy for him.

284~~~
He's a tidy player that doesn't look out of place in the team but he ultimately lacks the kind of quality needed to make it here, particularly as an attacker.

He did well last night, but his moves tended to break down when it most mattered.

285~~~
This. I was so psyched when he started against Swansea. Thought the boat had passed for him to be honest after that but really glad to see him being given minutes! Hopefully he's given more gametime though I suspect if Young and Mata were available, he won't even see the bench.

286~~~
Like the quality that Young, Valencia or Ji Sung Park had? He is still finding his feet in the first team and hopefully when he does we will have a squad option that can fill in when needed like he did today. I'd rather a player from the youth team occupy that squad role than spend millions on an equally limited squad player.

287~~~
Love to see Memphis being given excuses after excuses but Lingard was deemed not good enough after his second start ever for the first team and his first ever CL match.

288~~~
I've said before that I see similar traits as Thomas Mueller in him. I could see him potentiallty developing similarly, even if not to a Manchester United standard (whatever that is these days).

289~~~
1 Lingard is older. 2 Lingard has done nothing in his career. 3 Memphis is more talented

290~~~
1.Lingard is a late bloomer and it's much harder to break through at top English club's academies 2.Morrison was more talented than both of them, where is he now?There are more things about football than talent.

I'm not saying Lingard will become the better player (I doubt it) but these points are really misleading and (some) people are too quick to jump on their guns here.

291~~~
Did well, deserves to be ahead of Memphis in the pecking order.

292~~~
I thought he did alright, he's only played a couple of senior games so you can't expect too much but I don't think he has looked that out of place.

293~~~
I'm not sure I agree with the quality comparison.

Park was a very good player and Young and Valencia were once two of the better wingers in the Premier League. If Lingard has a career as good as those two then he's done very, very well.

294~~~
I dont see how based on last night anyone can claim he is lacking in quality. He stuck to the instructions from above to the letter. Its obvious we has little desire to get three points. That is why both he, Martial and Valencia didnt prioritise running at their full backs till we badly needed the goal....we instead had them cutting in to keep possesion

295~~~
We have time to find out whether he will have as good a career but that can't stop us from giving him a squad role until we find out one way or the other. He hasn't cost us points (too small a sample size to make a definitive assessment) and hasn't looked out of place playing in the first team at two of the toughest away venues in European football, he deserves to be given the chance to fail not to be dismissed outright when we have bought and given more chances to worse players over the years.

296~~~
Any highlights vids of him? I had to miss the first 30 minutes of the game but my impression was that he's decent on the ball, knows how to "attack the space" but didn't quite have the final ball.

Edit: I only speak in clichés now.

297~~~
He didnt offer much either. A couple of times I thought he should take on his man but never did. Showed some good movement though

298~~~
I'm all for giving him chances and I agree he didn't look out of place. But based on what I've seen of him at youth level, reserve level and the small amount of game time he's got at senior level here, I don't think he'll be good enough.

I could well be wrong, but that's my gut feeling as of right now.

299~~~
On the contrary, I thought he was pretty good first half, faded a bit in the second, but even then one of the few players who carried the ball forward.
When he got the ball, he usual first instinct was to turn and go forward, huge contrast to anyone else on the team.
He even almost got Rooney in with a through ball, but tbh his execution (And Rooneys position) were both a lil poor.

I for one have never seen anything particularly special about him, but when I have seen him play (yday and for Derby i think) he seems to be very effective.

300~~~
I thought he played reasonably well. I noticed a couple of passes that he under-hit but otherwise he didn't do much wrong. 

I'd like to see Lingard get at least 10 starts this season. Then it might be possible to assess his attacking contribution.

301~~~
Yes and after that we decide whether to keep him as a squad player or let him go to some midtable team in the Prem. Assesing him after one and a half of start in both tough away games is ridiculous considering he certainly was instructed to help the defense and was said to play it tidy. You could see Herrera at times is too tidy as well, it's Van Gaal's drill, you make mistake play it too risky lose too many balls and you're dropped. 

Lingard is tidy player by nature but he certainly has attacking qualities which he can show once he grew in confidence and  cement his place in the team. He can't go out and try things all game and expect Van Gaal to pick him the next game. It's not even his best position. Lingard's best games come from CAM position and I think he could play even deeper, sort of attacking b2b midfielder. He's not quick enough to play as winger, neither he is as polished dribbler as it needs to be for that position but he's certainly good enough dribbler to play deeper, he has fantastic movement, works hard for the team, links up the play really well across the pitch, can carry the ball forward, pick a pass here and there, he's got good vision and maturity about him which is needed in the middle of the pitch. 

I don't think we could have expected more from him last game as CSKA had been closing the play down really quickly and there was no space for pass especially when you have the pub player up front.. I really liked how he roamed around the pitch with purpose, he's got some playmaking qualities for sure and looked our most lively player who wants to mae something happen but again it was too tight yesterday and we will see what he can bring when we play at OT.

Hard to predict now but in few years time when we decide to sell young he could be that good squad player to have in the team, he so versatile so he can paly almost anywhere. he's got the discipline and brain to get those chances from Van Gaal and he certainly has bigger potential than someone like Blind who so far got huge amount of time on the pitch. Also his career could go really upwards if Van Gaal puts trust in him like Fergie did with Fletcher who looked really out of his depth first couple of years and then boom became one of our most important players due to his hardwork and manager's trust

303~~~
I think he has a shot at taking Young's squad player role over the next 18 months.

304~~~
I like him - he is plucky. I can see him being used in a similar way as Park Ji Sung was used under SAF, but I don't think LvG would do something like that. Sorta like an attacking utility player/someone that harasses higher up the pitch.

305~~~
Call me crazy but I'd happily see Rooney benched for him on Sunday with Martial playing up front if Young still isn't fit.

306~~~
Woah, now that's <b>some</b> unpopular opinion there Sham!

307~~~
Well they don't call me "Crazy Opinions McSham" for nothing.

308~~~
seconded

309~~~
He is technically very good and has a goal in him but I think United is too big a club for him. He is 23 soon so it shows you how long we have waited for him to grow a pair. Too timid on the pitch for United if you ask me.

310~~~
Was thinking this exactly, he's got very good stamina and work-ethic and seems very safe in possession.

311~~~
He actually started last season as a makeshift wingback against Swansea, didn't he?

312~~~
Correct

313~~~
Coming on now

314~~~
Outrageous attempt to beat Hart - loved it.

315~~~
Thought he looked very bright when he came on.

316~~~
That would have been a bloody beauty if he got it.

317~~~
Doesn't look out of place in our team at all, he should easily become our squad player, IMO.

318~~~
I like the way he is positive and will make runs and drive forward rather than look for the sideways pass.

319~~~
Got a bit more physicality than Mata. There's a good player in there but it's testament to how poor our other options are that he even gets a look in to be fair.

320~~~
Bright as a button, always positive, similar to the Moscow game, he was again let down by the lack of movement a few times.

321~~~
Looked sharp, fed a good ball in for Rooney shortly after coming on and then was very unlucky to not grab the winner with an excellent run and deft lob.

322~~~
I wish he'd started.

323~~~
Good game when he came on. Stick to his task well and almost scored.

324~~~
His off the ball movement i incredible, Always putting himself in positions to score. He looked quite inconsitent on the ball, One moment he is threading a pass to Rooney or attacking the free space and the next moment he looks rather untidy with the ball and lacks penetration.

325~~~
Would have been so perfect for him to score that chance <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

326~~~
Wish he'd start instead of Rooney.

327~~~
Keep wishing.

328~~~
Worth a run of games. So unlucky not to score. Intelligent run of a type that we see so rarely under LVG. 

I thought he did really well. Sometimes struggles when there aren't any obvious options to pass to.

329~~~
Because movement around him created the oppurtunity. If everyone is static and not looking to shake their marker then of course he will look hesitant.

330~~~
I'm becoming quite the fan.

331~~~
Like to see him start on the left and Martial restored back as a striker.

332~~~
So unlucky to hit the bar, brilliant flick. Looked good though. He's a very clever player and finds pockets of space really effectively. Definitely has the talent.

333~~~
Not convinced he'll still be here next season. Squad player is his level at best.

334~~~
I wouldn't even mind trying him up front instead of that pile of shit, he's got excellent movement, could beat the offside line easily, he's got goals in him too, but Martial is proly a better option and Jesse from the wing now. Didn't look out of place again which is really nice to see. Really shame he couldn't score but he showed what he's capable. Actually showed more than Mata the whole game...

335~~~
I actually thought he did poorly with the chance. Rooney was all alone next to him. He only needed to take one touch and then make a simple sideways pass. There was no City defender close to them.

336~~~
You're making it sound like that would have been easy. Only needed to take one touch? He was on the run, stretching with his foot almost over 4 feet in the air, it would have had to have been one of the greatest touches of all time to bring it down and lay off a pass before Kompany or Hart were on top of him.

337~~~
Your two points are actually conflicting.I think nobody here predict him to be a regular.

338~~~
He done well to muster a chance out of it imo

339~~~
I'm sure he's still dealing with the pace of the game at this level. I would say he's an exceptionally steady and consistent player, at least he was at youth level. 

I can't believe he's only 22, I feel like I've been watching him for 6 years.

340~~~
Maybe not easy for him but it's something Mata could have done fairly easily. These kind of balls aren't really that hard to control. Harder to manage to pull off a good attempt like he managed.

341~~~
Against CSKA he showed a brilliant touch to bring down a long ball dropping over his shoulder. He's clearly capable of that sort of touch. The fact he was within an inch or two of scoring validates his decision too.

342~~~
we have a solid winger/striker option in this lad.

343~~~
Has a very good first touch and also has a fantastic eye for a killer ball, I certainly think he's playing himself into the first team picture, used mainly as a squad player of course.

344~~~
Not convinced. Don't think he has the craft or guile to cut it at the very top table. Would he get in Chelsea, City, Bayern, Barcelona or Madrid ? Say no more.....

345~~~
Sure, if he was practically born into the Barca system I think he would get the same kinda chance.

Of course he's no Juan Mata, no one thinks he is.

But he could score and assist goals, I have no doubt, and be very useful tracking his full back. He's intelligent and always moves into space. You can do a lot with a good head and good physique.

346~~~
He's better than Barca's Munir for example.This is a daft argument.Nobody is asking him to be first choice for us.Would Park-Ji Sung get into any of those sides?

347~~~
I really like him, he's very classy on the ball.

348~~~
Did he edged Depay's performances this season, quite clearly yes. Depay was good only against Brugge where also Rooney starred... we are talking about player who came on at Goodison Park to defend... and another tough away game against CSKA being the most lively player on the pitch in the first half, also debut in champions league.. and today he almost scored a winner by making a run which we haven't see from a United player for a while.. he's refreshing player and if he can bench Depay who came here as an almost 30m talent, next ronaldo, new United no7, with massive backing of LVG and still being very inconvincing... just compare the two you could say Lingard has got a chance. 

He's very clever and reliable, if anything he can be a great squad player and btw one funny thing: right winger is not even his best position.-)

Let's judge him after some other performances... hope he's given chance to paly more centrally btw

349~~~
I would love it, absolutely love it if this guy could prove he is good enough for the starting line up, not convinced just yet that he can do it, and am kind of thinking that LvG is chucking him in at the deep end to make a final decision on him, but I am really rooting for him to pass the test.

350~~~
I would expect any of our attackers (except maybe Fellaini) to be able to control that ball most of the times. That's why I have this expectation. I probably wouldn't have thought much about it if it wasn't Mata he replaced because those are the kind of runs and thoughts that Mata has.

351~~~
It's a shame he didn't score, it really could've been a defining moment for him to have a future here. He's offered a lot more than what Memphis has recently.

352~~~
how so?

353~~~
Good to see him finally getting a first team run as we've watched him impress on a few pre season tours up till now and still not get his chance, and he hasn't let himself down so far. Been quietly impressed by how composed he's looked even at 22 years old. A good deputy for Mata so far.

354~~~
Ball retention and work-rate to name a few things.

355~~~
He's a team player for a start. Don't get me wrong Memphis is far more talented than him but right now he's not really shown it apart from one Champions League qualifier.

356~~~
Memphis has been frustrating at times and i knew that would have happened as it is normal for players his age. I can understand the disappointment but i dont think i would go as far as saying Lingard has offered more than him. But that's just my personal opinion. <a class="username" data-user="73643, @Acole9" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/73643/">@Acole9</a> <a class="username" data-user="21214, @BAMSOLA" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21214/">@BAMSOLA</a> . Lingard has been neat and tidy and safe which is fine if your looking for a draw. Thats just how i see it.

357~~~
I would agree with you that overall Memphis looks the better player, however the key word in <a class="username" data-user="73643, @Acole9" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/73643/">@Acole9</a> post was "recently".

358~~~
well Memphis has hardly actually played much at all recently so i guess by that logic he is correct.

359~~~
The through ball he played to release rooney on the right flank was also a brilliant bit of vision. Impressed with him so far, quietly he's playing his way into more chances.

360~~~
He's only been dropped for the last two or so games, before that he was a regular starter and was struggling for his last few starts after a promising beginning, so nobody is saying he isn't a highly talented player (at least i'm not) but he hasn't offered the basics you would expect of a player at this level for about his last 3 games, Lingard has got the basics right and not let the team down.

361~~~
Never let us down when given chances (actually looked good in pre-season three years in a row). Was unlucky not to get more minutes before this season imo. I like him and what he offers.

362~~~
Mata wouldn't have got anywhere near the ball given how slow he is; that or he would have been offside if he had started his run earlier. Notice the moment when Rojo broke up a City counter-attack and the ball went straight through their defence but Mata failed to get near the ball before Joe Hart cleared; that looked like an opening but for the fact that it was our slowest player involved.

363~~~
It looked like an opening because Mata anticipated it. The pass comes in relation to the run. Martial wouldn't have passed it the same way if it were Mata making the run.

364~~~
Martial's pass, while not perfect, was the best he has managed so far for United. The chances of him coming up with a pass that would allow Mata to get through in a similar situation are practically zero.

365~~~
Really grabbing the opportunities with both hands and legs. Has looked sharp and determined. Always want to make things happen. It is high time we drop Rooney and Play Martial up front and try Lingard on the right from the beginning.

366~~~
rather just play him instead of Rooney

367~~~
people shouldnt be surprised with his flick yesterday, he is very good at finishing and he does have a history of spectacular finishes. Check out this beauty, one of the most beautiful volleys that i saw:


<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKiDQ0oK_GE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

368~~~
Pogba <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

369~~~
Lingard has been neat and tidy in three high profile tough games where we needed to defend a lot, in Everton game we didn't push for attack at all, CSKA was a tough away game in freezing weather, debut for Lingard, he was arguably our best player in the first half.. last game he showed he has goals in him, great run to almost score a winner, great weighted pass to Rooney.. lost couple of balls too but that's what Memphis shows all the season. 

I also don't know why the two are compared that much, they are different players, Lingard's not a winger and just got into team. Give him a bit of time to show what he can do also in some lower profile games so he gains confidence. Anyway great to see him being backed now. Let's see if he can get run of 15 games like Memphis without being dropped after one horrible performances Memphis ad been showing us.. 

He looked much more threatening then Memphis so I dunno why should we consider him as a player who comes on the pitch when we are looking for a draw, that really doesn't make sense He's done better than Memphis offensively while being organized and reliable in defending...

Let's judge the players not by their reputation and name but simply by what they showed. Lingard's hardly exciting for yome of you as he's come from academy and proggressed really slowly while Memphis was a top scorer in Dutch league but it's never easy to break through when you're in Manchester fecking United. Fergie himself told Lingard will be ready at the age of 23.. so I 'm looking forward to seeing him bloom. Darren Fletcher was quite shit at his early age but given the thrust from coach he wored hard and became key palyer for us, despite not being the most talented and Lingard has more talent than him, just started a bit late and with the transition after fergie Januzaj being picked to be given thrust he didn't always had it easy to breakthrough, got injured in his first game last season but I guess he's a good chance now..

370~~~
While alot of what you say is quite true and i would say i agree with alot of it. I can promise you im not basing anything off of prior reputation. Lingard has been played for a couple of games and to say he has done more than what Memphis has done, I simply don't agree with that. Thats the core point im on. Im not arguing who has more potential or who should be playing or who is more exiting than who. I just think that its a little unfair to slag off Memphis like hes done feck all for 2 months.

371~~~
People forget quickly that's true but he really was poor most of the time and his best games came against really poor sides like Brugge. Memphis will be good, he just needed this time on the bench to realize what he's done was too little for Manchester United. I think he was also backed countless times when he was on the pitch like noone in the team, the new no7 excitement, young prospect, likeable player from the day one.. Now when he's finally dropped people can see how poor he was, he needed break and not to be automatically first option, now some other players deserve to be given chance while I don't think they will get as many as him...

372~~~
Again I agree with alot of this. We though, need to remember he is new to the league and is only 21, even younger than lingard. He has every right to be benched. It was never the issue.

373~~~
I can't believe it too. I am very very happy for him though. I have been pulling for him to make it and I am glad he is being rewarded.

374~~~
Ravel. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

375~~~
It dosen't excuse him from losing the ball or being untidy with it on certain occasions. You are right, he wasn't get much help and he is being played out of his favorite position, but not everything should be blamed on the others who are around him. Fine player though.

376~~~
Think he'll find his opportunities limited again once Young is back though.

377~~~
I've always felt he is our most reliable youngster coming out from the academy, ever since I watched him play in preseason few years back.

378~~~
He's better then some people seem to imply. He's unlucky not to have a goal or two and he doesn't over complicate it. He could be a very handy squad player for us this season and he could be a very good player for us in time. It's good to see LVG having a look at him.

379~~~
Simply should be ahead of Memphis in the pecking order now.

380~~~
He's tidy enough but not really very threatening if we're being honest.

381~~~
Did well, needs to find his finishing boots though.

382~~~
At least he tried and worked hard.

383~~~
Slightly bit more luck and 2 goals in his last 2 games for certain.

384~~~
Did fairly well but he lacks that X factor frankly.

385~~~
Looks a solid player, worth persisting with for now.

386~~~
Needs more minutes with the first team (playing with the likes of Herrera, Martial, Basti) will do him some good.

387~~~
Very unlucky not to have 2 late game winning goals now, but for a few inches people would be raving about his performances in here.

388~~~
Also put in the ball for the Fellaini header at the end.

389~~~
I am actually surprised that Van Gaal is giving him some gametime. He looks reliable when I have seen him play. I would definetly have him ahead of Rooney this weekend against Palace.

390~~~
And the Martial's miss as well if I'm not wrong?

His crossing is surprisingly consistent.

391~~~
Against Everton he was unlucky from a Martial pull back with the ball not falling for him. Against City he hit the bar and today, he hit the post/bar...

He's doing well, you just don't rate him.

392~~~
His first touch is quite poor.

393~~~
I still rate him higher than current Rooney and Memphis to be fair. I'm all for giving him a chance but I think it's inevitable that he will ultimately end up plying his trade at Norwich or Villa, that's all I'm saying.

394~~~
He does surprise me every time I watch him. He always seems very aware around the box, makes good runs and overall is just a clever player. Considering our options on the wing, he certainly offers something at the moment.

395~~~
His two chances were two difficult volleys which he struck well, I have no issue with his finishing. Tidy player full of energy, I suspect he will get goals and assists if he plays.

396~~~
He at least looked like he could make something happen and played with his brain. I like him, I don't see him ever being a main player here but he can join a long list of valuable squad players that have served United well over the years.

397~~~
Been impressed with the lad to be fair

398~~~
Looked sloppy to begin with but grew in to the game and despite not appearing to be the overly creative type ended up being involved in or on the end of most of the good work we did tonight. Unlucky not to grab a goal (again) and kept running for the full 120 minutes. Hard not to be at least a little impressed. Shame today's contribution will probably make him a sub at best on the weekend.

399~~~
He is, quite simply, a very good footballer and should be given a run.

400~~~
Don't agree mate. He's quick, carries the ball well. He can put some nice crosses in but he's a goal threat. He's been unlucky. Another day, he'd have got the winner but wasn't to be.

401~~~
he's the best crosser in the team, always finds a teammate and has a good whip on it too...

overall pleasing performance in this despair. I can imagine being very very usefull if he had a player who he could pass to and play one two with, Darmian is just horrible, someone like Bellerin would up Lingard performance hugely, he still did very good on his own there.

EDIT

Oh and I am quite surprised that he's still yet to score, his composure is surprisingly off, he's usually very good and composed finisher but I guess it will come, he was unlucky again today..

402~~~
he will certainly play higher than that. If anything he is atleast Everton level player in the making, if he works hard he can be vauable to us as well, already looking better than some overrated kid from Holland who we paid 30m for.. and captain fantastic.. he need a game time and good palyers around him who understand him ie. quick one-twos in which he excells.

403~~~
I like him, he's not the most talented, but he's smart, skillful & fearless, attributes you can't coach. He deserves more chances in the first team.

404~~~
Just seems a very intelligent player. I know he's always been highly rated by the club, but I always felt that since he hadn't really made the step up by now, that he never would. Has good pace, seems very neat on the ball, and can pick out a good cross along with having a good shot, good movement, and good interplay.

405~~~
I'd rather give him and Pereira as much opportunity as possible ahead of Memphis. Both are just very smart football players even if they lack the raw eye popping physical traits, they make good decisions and most importantly circulate the ball very well if they don't see an option to attack instead of looking for the hollywood shot.

They just "get" football and have great attitude.

406~~~
depends what you count as talent.....why should dribbling count as talent and movement & decision making not?

407~~~
Good performance again, he should firmly be in the rotation now.

408~~~
His dribbling seems to be quite good anyways, so I wouldn't say he's not the most talented. Has a good touch and close control, along with a very good shot. Just seems a smart and technical player. He's very slight so that's a weakness, always has been for him, but he's very talented for sure.

409~~~
He look mature player and know his role very well.
I love Mata but I would say he is more suited for Right wing role in our style. His positioning is quite perfect for rigth wing player.

410~~~
We should try Martial as a striker, Mata behind him and Lingard on the right. 

Unlucky for the boy easily could have had 2 goals in 2 matches with a bit more luck

411~~~
Thought he played quite well, I'm not convinced his ceiling is much higher than an Ashley Young type player, But still a good player to have in the squad.

412~~~
I thought he and Pereira were our best players last night. I really hope they can both continue to build on their performances thus far and continue to get minutes in the first team.

413~~~
I like him. A decent squad player. He doesn't have the trickery to slow things down and then go like say a Nani but he's good enough technically to get out of tight spaces.

414~~~
He isnt a dribbler, never was and i doubt he will ever be. But he did add something new to his game and thats running with the ball into space which is very useful as now he doesnt always need to look for pass and move play.
Always liked him, one of my favorite players so im very happy that he is getting the chance and by the look of things he is taking it.

415~~~
Start this lad from the off please.

416~~~
Not the most talented, he just doesn't have that talent you immediately see in players like Martial, Reus, Gotze etc. I didn't mention anything about dribbling.

417~~~
Did well again in the short time he was on. His pace is useful in the wide areas.

418~~~
Looked lively when he came on. Would play him instead of Mata.

419~~~
Am I the only annoyed by him constantly coming on for Mata?

So Van Gaal wants to use his pace in the wings, why not start with him, and play Mata in the centre attacking midfield position?

420~~~
Deserves a start in the next league game in my opinion. Would have preferred him to start today in place of either Rooney or Mata.

421~~~
Even when he doesn't seem to play particularly well, he is still more of a threat than the rest of our attack with the exception of Martial.

422~~~
I didn't think he really got into the game today, by the time he came on Palace were getting a second wind in their attack.

423~~~
Al though he is not really looking bad out there, it is quite beyond me he is getting the nod over Pereira who has outperformed him every time he had the opportunity to play.

424~~~
At least with him you know what you can get.Consistent player.Mata is a great player on his days but then went missing in many matches.

425~~~
Very good in short period of time.
Help defense and have very good sense of his position.
I think he deserve chance to start game in place of Mata.

426~~~
He puts in a shift, but tbh I don't think his skills are being used in the right position. Don't think he should be playing as a winger, he doesn't have the pace or dribbling ability, would be more suited to the second striker role where his movement and shooting ability would be maximized.

427~~~
I might be in the minority here but I never get the feeling that he might win us the game when he comes on. He's nice and tidy but not really very effective or dangerous. I'd rather Pereira got those minutes, to be honest.

428~~~
Despite him coming within centimetres of winning 2 of our last 3 games?

429~~~
As would Mata, the real issue is the fact we don't have a right winger, I get the impression LvG is getting sick of Mata playing there so has brought Lingard in to give it a try, but as you say Lingard isn't a right winger either.

Rotating Mata and Lingard in the number 10 role would be great to see, but then Herrera misses out, the whole front four is unbalanced.....still.

430~~~
If anything he lacks physicality.  I think that might bring out the best out of his bravery that he seems to have.  

He's 22 and looks like he is still in high school. 

Funnily enough; i thought the same about pogba before his move.  Some players need to focus on being a man to get the best out of them and pogba's move to juventus did just that.

431~~~
Based on the 3-4 game sample size?

432~~~
Didn't he play the ball in for the Martial blocked shot?
He creates something almost every game. And does his bit defensively.. and is tidy at other times.


Could something like
------------martial
Young---Mata/Ander--Lingard
work as a front 4?

Cant do much worse than what we are doing right now.
Mata moves central. Darmian gets more help if needed. Martial moves up top and Young, who looks like an attacking threat gets to play in an attacking role.

433~~~
He was also a very consistent performer in the U21s.Pereira for example blew hot and cold at that level despite taking massive stride on his game last year.

434~~~
I actually loved how he got on the pitch, full of movement and his firt touch was quick one two, never hesitates to play tidy pass. Give and go is good when you have clever players around him who are eligable to roam around or want to do it. Darmian is just dire, Valencia who doesn't posses any kind of football brain and sense for combination at least makes runs but I guess if we try Young as rb, Lingard will thrive, just needs to start more games and become accustomed to other players. I think that some of the players still wonder what is this plyer doing here, he's keeping it really simple and he's quick moving around. with Mata who always took an extra touch they weren't used to it..

but he's certinly not out of place and i'd like him to start next couple of games..

435~~~
I agree.

436~~~
You are not the only one. Would love to see Mata more central with pace either side of him.

437~~~
The first thing he did when he came on was lose the ball. That's all he seems to do really. Never seen someone run down so many blind alleys.

438~~~
Well if you're going to use Lingard's U21 performances as a way to say he's a more consistent performer, then we may as well include Mata's Chelsea performances, in which he was also very consistent and spectacular. I like Lingard, but it's ridiculous to want him starting over Mata (in my opinion, of course.)

439~~~
Mata is a scorer, Lingard will never score like that!

But out on the right he certainly has some advantages. 

Id like to see Mata at the no.10 and Lingard on the right.

440~~~
Lingard is also great goalscorer, he played as striker a lot or as second striker in the academy, then used as winger and basically anywhere around front four, he always scored during preseason, once won a "golden boot" I think druing preseason... he's go poaching qualities as well as quality shot from around the box. He weirdly showed poor coposure in finishing over the 4 games he featured in but on the other hand it is clear that he knows how to get to the chance. He was unlucky not to have at least three goals at his name.

He must transform his calmness and goalscoring record from the reserves to the first team, once he settles down I am sure he will score goals if given chance from the start. What sort of chances Mata created himself lately btw?

441~~~
Lingard is a goal scorer tbf to him

442~~~
Look, I'm trying to keep myself from putting on the red tinted glasses, will you please not tempt me?

I've been watching Lingard as long as he's been with the Reserves, I'm a huge fan of his! I agree he can score goals, but he's probably never going to have the pure quality of Mata, nor will he likely ever score as many in a season as Mata did in his best season so far.

If Rooney is going to be moved wide or dropped deep, Mata surely has to get first crack at taking that no.10 position. But I'd love to see Lingard beat him out for it! Surely that by itself would put Lingard down as an Academy legend!

443~~~
If you could not feck up every attacking move you're involved in that would be grand.

444~~~
Not his best game so far tonight.

445~~~
Very harsh. He's been positive, taken his man on consistently and always involved. Excellent movement, the rest will come with experience.

446~~~
You can see he's got a good pedigree about him, especially in the possession orientated approach (18 of 20 passes completed as I type this) but his end product thus far is off. Seems to be trying too hard if anything and letting his final ball / shot  or touch in a take on be affected. Have to say his defensive work has been very good.

447~~~
He's the mould of player we need, but not the right level.

448~~~
I don't think he's good enough for us. In fact, nowhere close to the level we should be aspiring to. Just my opinion of course.

449~~~
Standing out in the team today. For the wrong reasons...

450~~~
He's getting forward well but his passing/crossing/final ball hasn't been great.

451~~~
An intelligent mind but lacks the quality to act on his initial good work.

452~~~
No end product, atleast he's trying to take people on.

453~~~
?

He's messed up everything he's attempted.

454~~~
Picks up good positions but has wasted pretty much everything.

455~~~
I desperately hope he proves me wrong, but I just don't think he's quite good enough. He's been dreadful so far today.

456~~~
Horrific end-product but great movement and link ups with Rojo.

457~~~
Memphis has got to be wondering what the heck is going on being left out for this lad

458~~~
He's trying hard and is obviously a talented player.

459~~~
He is poor. I had doubts.

He shouldn't be starting for us. He's not even better than someone like Zaha, who is younger. Prefer Periera to play on the left.

460~~~
Not as bad as people are making out, but it was an odd decision to start him and that isn't really looking like one of LVGs masterstrokes.

461~~~
He has been terrible today. I think people just want to see him succeed because he's a youth talent, but I really don't think he's good enough.

462~~~
I thought he was our most lively player in the first half kept on moving into good positions but is lacking any end product.

463~~~
Would you rather he did a Mata& turn around 5 times and pass it back to the midfielders? I'm happy we've got someone trying something. This is exactly what people are asking for, and yet he's being slated for it. feck the youth, get in the big names always works.

464~~~
I'd be surprised if he makes it out for the second half. He's earned his place ahead of memories because he's positive and takes his man on but it's not his day.

465~~~
The kind of performance you'd want to see him making on loan at another club so that he'd mature and learn from it by the time he was playing for our first team.

466~~~
Yeah let's bash Mata.

Lingard has been shit.

467~~~
Disappointed to see some of the comments about him in the match thread but nothing about Mata's performance who has been equally bad if not more.

468~~~
No, he's being slated for messing everything up. What about that short corner he booted woefully back to Carrick? Christ. Memphis "tried things" as you say and got rightuflly slated too. He's been appalling.

469~~~
He's got the right ideas he's just not executing them very well tonight.

470~~~
Memphis is just returning from injury, so I think there was zero chance he'd start tonight.

Not sure why Pereira didn't start though. He looks significantly better than Lingard when he plays.


Lingard seems to have a streak of Welbeck about him. Works hard, good at finding space and looks to run direct at goal with the ball, but his composure in the box has been very poor.

471~~~
on the other note, what has mata done so far on the right? Lingard's trying, his touch is awfull but he makes so many runs that all our chances comes from the left hand sie... good linkup play, awfull end product, but it was never his game, he's best a bit deeper where he doesn't need to dribble, dropping deep from caM and making the play, he's playmaker not someone who will beat his man all game

472~~~
He's getting at his defender, we need that pace in the team.

473~~~
Our best chance came from a cross from the right.

474~~~
think the problem is he is trying to hard today to impress, he is taking people on at every occasion and that is not his game. He cant dribble and when he loses the ball few times in a row the confidence drops and everything else goes to shit. Good movement as always, good partnership with Rojo but the final ball is lacking and he should just stop dribbling. Its okay to try it occasionally but not every fecking time, just play your game.

475~~~
He is afraid, he always takes the easy way out and fails to execute a lot of that. He is out of his depth. He has some decent mobility but that is it. Hopefully he gets taken off for a player who belongs at CL level.

476~~~
He is not terrible, he is involved in lot of good things but end product is lacking, he is basically just having bad luck in the first half. It happens. If he stays on the pitch I am sure he'll score or assist if we keep playing like in the first half.

477~~~
He's done ok but I think he can certainly improve. He's got a better end product then he's shown so hopefully we see a better end product second half.

478~~~
Well what has Mata done that Lingard hasnt? Has he attempted to take responsibility or move into space for others to benefit from? I'm a Mata fan don't get me wrong, but I'll not agree with you on this at all.

479~~~
Bullshit.

480~~~
Control the ball and make 5 yard passes?

481~~~
Can we take him off. Score. And then bring him back on?

Shame we're not winning as he's showing enough to suggest he can excite us. But woeful end product which is what we desperately need right now.

482~~~
Surprised the criticism has been so harsh and so early. Admittedly I only saw from 20 minutes onwards and he wasn't great at all during the 25 minutes I saw but it's only 45 minutes and he's a young player. He's shown a lot of promise in the other matches.

483~~~
Just lacks some composure.

484~~~
I have never seen the promise of a Champions League player of him in any game, seriously, have you?

485~~~
That's fine. But he's been shit tonight and should be subbed.

486~~~
He's played about 5 games for us? And tbh he's done well in almost all of them, almost winning us a Derby and a late winner against Boro. 

I absolutely give up with United fans, they preach about youth and  attacking play. Yet when it's given to them, they want something else instantly.

487~~~
Yes I have.

488~~~
I agree wholeheartedly.

Edit: Just as I type that he puts in a great cross that nearly provided Rooney with a simple tap in.

489~~~
And a nice assist there...

490~~~
Have that you spoilt bunch of cnuts

491~~~
Great ball, much better in the second half in general.

492~~~
hehe...

493~~~
Looks a class above our other attackers.

494~~~
People whining about his touch and composure in the first half. 

He just dropped the mic.

495~~~
Exactly my previous complaint of Lingard before. Always took the easy route, but there he tried the hardest thing and we score.

496~~~
Oh shut up.

497~~~
I think he's been really great today.

498~~~
Eh, it was. OK. Feel smug, well, smugger than usual.

499~~~
That second half  makes him motm for me.

500~~~
Surprised people are moaning about him. I missed most of the first half, but from what I have seen since then he's probably been our best player

501~~~
Think he's been ok today. Was pretty poor in the first half but his movement is quite good. Nice assist. Still don't think he's anywhere near good enough for us.

502~~~
Looked good today from the bits I've seen. Still not massively impressed with him generally, mind.

503~~~
Poor end product in the first half. MOTM in the second half.

504~~~
Nah Smalling can take it for that block.

505~~~
He's been fantastic in my opinion. . Constantly running at the opposition is not easy, he has added a lot of dynamism to our attack.  Just needs to release it when he gets past his man rather than take on3/4 men.

506~~~
We've missed someone like him in the team lately, someone willing to take risks and make things happen. Just needs to work on his end product.

507~~~
Lingard has been "fantastic"? Feck me our standards are at rock bottom at the moment.

508~~~
Good second half after a poor first one but to be honest, he's been given tons of space, something the likes of Martial and Memphis have never gotten, so he was due to create something.

509~~~
Needs to work on his end product, but he's an exciting talent.

510~~~
I thought he was excellent

511~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Well....

512~~~
He was quite good 2nd half.

513~~~
He was impressive in the second half. Good on him.

514~~~
Nervy first half but kept at it laid on a chance right at the start of the second half we should have done better with and was a threat, capped it off with a great asasist.

515~~~
He did well tonight showed alot of willing and courage to take people on, OK he's not anywhere near a top winger but he was our best forward today by a long way and deserves credit for his performance.

516~~~
He seems to be "given" a lot of space quite often, maybe it's something to do with his tireless and intelligent movement?

517~~~
Altough, he was far from great but he definitely deserves to keep his place in the team.

I still have no idea why was he dribbling so much today though, it's not his game at all.

518~~~
Awful first half, superb 2nd half. 

Did well to recover from such a poor first half. 2nd half was a constant threat both on the left then on the right after Memphis came on.

519~~~
Stick to your guns. He won't nail down a place at United. He has talent but he is too much of a confidence player.

520~~~
Terrible first half, decent second half. Great assist.

521~~~
He was always positive, and that alone made his performance fantastic for me.

522~~~
Excellent performance. Always running at the opposition and trying to make things happen. He took on the responsibility to actually create.

523~~~
He lacked the support at times. I don't think he's the type to dribble needlessly all the time when he has options on.

524~~~
never seen a player made as many runs as him today. Absolutely fantastic movement all game, better end product in the second half, you can safely say he outplayed Memphis and Mata together in the game.. great shift from the lad with a fantastic first time assist which set the crucial goal in our champions league campaign...

525~~~
Had some blips but still a great performance.

526~~~
In this game it had a lot more to do with Martial attracting a load of defenders any time he just got near the ball. Teams simply don't respect Lingard as much of a threat yet compared to other players on our team.

527~~~
I never said he was good, or wasn't good enough. Just that he should have been subbed at half time.

528~~~
I think he's brilliant, so positive, comfortably my motm.

He's been inches away from becoming an instant Hero for us in the last few games and unlucky not to get on the scoresheet again tonight soon after a brilliant assist.

No end product? Piss off.

529~~~
Tries too hard

530~~~
Frustrating in the 1st very good in the 2nd

Great assist

531~~~
I could barely stay awake never mind pay attention during the first half so have to say he put in a MOTM performance!

532~~~
Was very refreshing to have a player besides Martial who takes players on and runs with the ball. Martial, Mata and Rooney all had a poor game today so maybe that makes Lingards performance look better than it was but for me he was the obvious choice for motm and he desrves to start the next game after that performance.

533~~~
Had their left side shitting themselves every time he ran at them. 

Guaranteed starter now in absence of other options. 

Thought he'd get subbed at half time. Great attitude to turn around a very iffy first half into a superb 45 minute performance.

534~~~
He showed more balls than Depay and Rooney have ever showed us this season in just a game. Must have lost the ball ten over times but he just kept pegging back.

535~~~
He seemed to get space just as often even after Martial came off so I'm not sure that's the only reason, even if it was a factor. You'd have to be blind to not see that his movement is one of his best assets.

536~~~
My MOTM, was excellent throughout.

537~~~
He brought much needed urgency in our game. Direct and threatening

538~~~
Great performance imo. Looked sharp, lively, and in contract to pretty much everyone else very mobile.

539~~~
Should have been subbed like all the geniuses on here were saying <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

540~~~
That's why patience are needed.Although he has been wasteful in the first half he looks like he can make something happen if given more times.His finishing is normally better mind.

541~~~
A fantastic performance at OT used to so much better than Lingard having an ok half of football. He wasn't fantastic; that's just nonsense hyperbole. He was poor in the first and ok in the second. He was better than our other attacking players but that isn't saying much. I don't think he's got the ability to play at the top level but he has intelligence and good movement. He's 23 soon and has barely played a PL game so it's really now or never for him to shine.

542~~~
Positive player, but he needs to find the back of the net more often. We need goals and he's had opportunities in front of goal that he should of scored, but I'm confident that will come with continued playing time.

543~~~
I don't think he was that good at all. Got a bit lucky that everyone else was that shite that the ball kept coming to him. He was bound to do something at some point. It was a good cross, but it is very telling when the best praise a player is getting is being 'positive'.

544~~~
How can you call a player who had a poor first half and then comes on with a point to prove in the second (proving that point very well) a confidence player? A confidence player's head would have dropped by that point.

545~~~
omg just stop this shit, Mata created absolutely nothing in the first half, Lingard tried things, end product wasn't there but at least he was trying.. wasn't poor at all, and second half he was the best player on the pitch, our best attacking force. great assist.

546~~~
He makes the game look so easy.

Run at players, beat players, look for a pass. 

His end product is erratic, as you'd expect, but he produces moments of real quality too. No idea how people think he's got no chance of making it. Got a damn sight better chance than Memphis imo.

547~~~
Thoroughly enjoyed his performance. Wasn't quite coming off for him in the first half but kept going and grew in confidence in the second half. Just needs a goal now.

548~~~
Other people have great movement as well and don't get acres of space. The main reason is teams don't respect him, it's that simple and the first half showed why.

549~~~
His end product on the ball hasn't been great but I like the way he takes the game to the opposition. His first thought then he gets the ball is to attack their defence.

550~~~
Probably because he has been looking at the caf and saw some said he can't beat a man.

551~~~
"Lingard tried things" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> If that was Rooney, the tone would be "He was so wasteful", which he was, as simple as that. So yes, he was poor in the first half.

If you can read, you can also see I said he turned it around in the second half, so take a chill pill.

552~~~
Christ give the lad some credit.

553~~~
nice assist with first touch cross to rooney

554~~~
I thought he was great all game. He shows real intent with his play and isn't afraid to take chances.

555~~~
Can you read? I said his second half was good. I'm just not gonna get overly excited just because he's an academy player.

556~~~
First half he really wasn't.

557~~~
I like how involved he is. Would play him over Mata on the right.

558~~~
My MOTM. Yes, he was pretty wasteful at times, especially in the first half, but at least he tried to force the issue. Too many players in our team are happy to just get the ball and pop it off. We need more direct players like Lingard, especially against teams that play so deep.

559~~~
Poor first half, thought his link up and movement was pretty decent but he was so prone to a shoddy touch or losing the ball.

Turned it around in the second half.

560~~~
that's why he was doubled all the time right? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> And marked even tighter in the second half.. 

it's very hard to mark player with such fantastic movement all game, that's is one thing you should remember from now .-)

561~~~
First half he was erratic but certainly the most positive out of our attackers out there.

562~~~
Massively frustrating first half, better second which keeps him in the team over Memphis come the weekend

563~~~
Play a right footed winger on the right side and he crosses with his right foot to get an assist. Logic eh?

You could see what he was trying on the left but didnt have the end product which was not surprising at times. He needs to play on the right tbh so he can cross first time. Glad he got his assist and finished the game.

564~~~
I liked that he kept taking their defense on and trying to make something happen, eventually getting his rewards. I'm surprised how harsh some are on a 22 year old Academy product who has about half a dozen senior appearances, it's the same ones usually defending their favourite import no matter what.

565~~~
He produced nothing.

566~~~
Positive performance, worked hard but lacked a bit of end product at times. Still, he got an assist.

567~~~
I swear some people think that great movement is easy. Despite us having had dozens of laboured, static attacking players play for us over the last decade or so who rather suggested otherwise.

568~~~
Yeah sure. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You're simply too infatuated with him.

569~~~
The most positive thing about Lingard's performance was that he never let his head drop. Jesse messed up a fair deal of good moves and some players would've let that get to them. Depay, for instance, has allowed things not falling for him to really get on his back. 

Our goal came from the fact that, instead of going into hiding after squandering chances, Lingard kept playing his game. Obviously we want him to stop being so wasteful, and given that in the past his finishing has been good in the past, you'd imagine its just the pressure of scoring his first United goal that's got him messing up. Still, I was impressed by his willingness to keep receiving the ball and keep running at the CSKA back line. 

Very promising.

570~~~
Well done son nice and positive

571~~~
Yes I can read. You qualify his good second half by essentially saying it's not really to do with his movement but because he's so shit that the other team just lets him have the ball instead of our other attackers. You must have watched a different game to me.

572~~~
problem is Rooney tries to control easy balls nd to basic stuff.. Can I ask you who you rate better Mata or LIngard this game? f it's Mata for you even for the first half where he didn't do absolutely nothing then amen..

573~~~
Get's at his man, he's maybe fell into the United side as we are seriously lacking pace, having said that he's took his chance and now looks like a first team player.

574~~~
Frustrating moments in parts but kept his head up and finished the game brilliantly. Created some very good chances out of nothing. Fair play to him.

575~~~
Mata didn't have a good game, but just because Mata didn't do well in the first half doesn't mean Lingard did.

576~~~
I think that it is his 6th professional game, some people should keep that in mind.

577~~~
I never said his movement wasn't good but as I also said before, other players (not necessarily in our team) move around well to and don't get this type of space because teams are more aware of them.

578~~~
I'm not joking, it annoys me so much seeing the slating he got after the first half and the faint praise that some are giving him after an excellent second half. At times he looked relentless.

This is a local lad and he's done very well with the chances he's been given this season. To me he's something to get excited about.

579~~~
For us you mean? He's had plenty of loan spells.

580~~~
Thought Jesse was fantastic tonight, just his final pass / finish let him down. Thankfully he got that cross spot on for Rooney which was more than difficult, but he did it perfectly. 

He made great runs all night and really dribbled well, often 2v1 he made something happen. I can't believe Some people are criticising him tonight and wanted him subbed, he looked out liveliest player all match!

581~~~
maybe 6th game for United, he has around 50 games in his professional career.

582~~~
these forums are full of people like you who lack football knowledge unable to judge player by their overall performance, you don't see the bits of play which we lacked for so long and were so refreshing even if it didn't always come out for him. If everybody played like Mata. That would have been as boring game as last three 0:0 games. that is the reason he was subbed off, you know.-)

583~~~
I really like Lingard. Not afraid to try and take on defenders and doesn't let his head drop when things don't pan out for him. Very hard working and has a lovely touch as well. Some more game time and I think he'll develop quite nicely.

584~~~
doing the basics well. running at his man, making runs, always on the move to make himself available for a pass and working hard for the team. depay needs a slap on his face and needs to watch lingard.

585~~~
Don't get the first half mass flack. Everything was coming down his side. So many other players that did nothing.

No doubt about it he's better on the right.

586~~~
This is my opinion too. I don't think he will develop to the right level either.

I liked his positivity today, ordinary first half, but he got much morw joy in the 2nd. Our best attacking player, gets a 7/10 from me

587~~~
Obviously for us and at that level of exigence.

588~~~
also I'm glad he's finally getting the chances to shine on our first team after only having pre-season stints and being loaned out afterwards.

589~~~
He was relentless and kept probing and attacking until they broke down.  That is exactly what LvG's system is supposed to do in theory.  A wide player is never going to be a high percentage player unless he is extremely cautious and controlled more like Mata.  We don't need any more caution and control in attack right now, we needed someone to take the game to the opposition and he did that today.

590~~~
Are you related to him or something?  You respond to nearly everyone who doesn't praise him. 

He was shocking first half but much improved in the second. Did very well to cushion the ball into Rooney.

591~~~
Codswallop. Martial is a fabulous talent and looks a nailed on top class player but ultimately Lingard provided the most threat of anyone today. More dangerous on the night, simple as that.

592~~~
Loved his attitude, he just kept going at them!

Starts on the weekend for me.

593~~~
Some people are talking utter shite about him and he's a local lad so I have no problem arguing against those people.

594~~~
His finish for sure but he had an assist, should of had another early in the 2nd half and set Mata though for the chance Rooney should have put away.

595~~~
Looked sloppy in the first half but didn't let his head drop and kept looking for the ball and trying to make things happen. Looked sharper in the second and was involved in most of our best moments.

Still think there is more to come (and he'll need to bring it to stay in the team long term) but even now he is developing a the habit of looking like our most dangerous player whether that is scoring or creating (him and Martial anyhow). 

It is refreshing to see someone running with the ball from midfield areas on a consistent basis, didn't expect too much of that from him.

596~~~
aye, pretty much spot on.

didn't have the best of first halves but still looked dangerous. stayed positive and got an assist.

i'm still not convinced he'll make it here, but he deserves his chance and i really hope he proves me wrong. should start at the weekend.

597~~~
Yeah I don't lack football knowledge, I simply know not overrate a performance. I see good movement, I also see plenty of free room for him to move into.  Martial was active in the first half as well, you know, but didn't have the space Lingard received. If you wanna deny that, maybe you should learn to pay more attention to how the opponent plays us. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

598~~~
For us maybe, he's had plenty of professional football out on loan. He was a fan favourite in Brightons successful run.

599~~~
Had a very good game for someone who has had so little action in our first team.

He was always looking to take people on and was very direct. 

He gave it away a lot but I think the more he plays the less of that we will see.

600~~~
I am certain he will make it here and very happy he is being given an opportunity.

601~~~
Just want to add. Despite the number of times he lost possession, he never stopped trying. There's players who go into their shell, but he showed a strong mentality, which is vital when playing for a club like United.

602~~~
Not so good for a very soon to be 23 year old. Now or never time for him. Hopefully he will take some confidence from the last 15 minutes of tonight's game and remain in the first team picture. He lacks so much but if he can find a way to add more to his good movement and positioning, he could have a role to play here.

603~~~
I believe he is talented but lacks confidendence, he is a little weak too. First half he was playing it to safe all the time, which I criticised him for because to me he looked nervous. Second half he triying the hardest thing, the volleyed cross and got his reward. That was my point. But I don't see him being a United player long term. Congratulations to him for tonight but we need much better players than him to move forward.

604~~~
Well that's to be expected from an academy lad.

605~~~
Always thought that he has this "X" factor on the final third of the field. Hopefully he can improve on the other 2/3.

606~~~
That means nothing, some players are late bloomers.

607~~~
Yeah well it's not great is it.

608~~~
Not necessarily. Playing in the first team is a big step up to the academy. Expectations are so much different. For example, when he played a sloppy pass tonight, there were groans of 75,000 people. You wouldn't get that in the academy.

609~~~
He lost possession because he was being direct and taking risks which is exactly what we need. He did well - especially considering he's not best suited to constantly dribbling at defenders and playing ambitious passes, but he was happy to take on that extra attacking responsibility that was needed rather than playing the safer pass and move approach that he is best at.

610~~~
Went Super Sayan mode in the last half hour of the game. Think he was our most influential player. Was very pleased for him and voted him my man of the match. Has very good pace and his dribbling was spectacular at times. Great assist and should have had a goal or two.

611~~~
there is nothing great in being an early bloomer, as long as the player manage to reach a high level that's great.

612~~~
I'm enjoying the run of games he is being given, and it was a nice reward for him that he got an assist after driving our team forward again and again, even if not every one of his attempts came off.

613~~~
well he certainly didn't have a poor first half and his second half performances was actually best of all our players with the crucial assist. What's nothing to be excited about? It almost seems like you and other peope like to discredit him and can't see the benefits he brings to our team... he's no ronaldo and noone raves about him like he is but he deserve credit and to be praised unlike some other frustrating players we've seen. 

I won't discuss how much space Martial had nd how much lingard, he certainly attracted more attention but he also played more advanced role where it's natural. Anyway I never compared Martial and Lingard in this game and discredited the frenchman so why do you even bring him up.. If he made a bit of space for his palyers than okay but Mata couldn't make use of it and Lingard even not even him is a winger.. there were so many times he wasn't even spotted or some of our palyers were scared to pass it through to him, particularly Blind. Lingard's movement a finding pockets were excellent and that made him top 3 player of the game... encouraging thing is that he and his performances means that he gets gametime over 28m wonderboy from Holland and will probably get game time over Mata next couple of games who still belongs to one of the best palyers in the premier league.. so we will see but hard not to be excited..

614~~~
Good effort Jesse lad! Not a great first half but you didn't hide, kept going.

615~~~
Not sure why some posters are so adamant in writing him off. Have your opinion, but don't knock him unfairly. His second half performance especially was a big part in getting that goal and win. I wonder if the people unhappy with Lingard hold every other player to the same standards...

616~~~
They are tbh. That said, he was a livewire, a great source of creativity and was very brave. Short of quality? yeah but our team is so devoid of threat, we need someone like Lingard at the moment.

617~~~
Jesse was part of a lot of terrific youth sides at the club where the off the ball movement was exemplary. It was so much fun to watch people like Ravel, him, Larnell and Adnan etc score some class goals for the team and I feel that he has carried that over to the top level. He is one of the few players who is never still and always trying to make good runs which is massive for aa static offense like ours

618~~~
I bring Martial up the same reason you bring Mata up, who I never mentioned in any of my posts until you did, which is to make comparisons to show my point of view. I also don't wanna discredit him in any way, but every time an academy player has a good performance, people tend to overrate them. I think he can be a squad player for us for a long time, no doubt about it. But I also want to put his performance of tonight in perspective because I know once he doesn't play well, things will turn the other way really quickly. It's the same procedure on here every time. Young player plays well and he's the greatest thing since sliced bread, young player struggles and he's the next Bebe/Obertan/Nani. 

The same happened with Adnan. He had his breakout season under Moyes, struggled under van Gaal and at those times when he still put in decent performances, people couldn't view them as solid or good because the expectations that were previously set were so ridiculously high that his follow-up performances could only be disappointments.

619~~~
Fair play to him, he did ok and was at least positive, but unless he is given the number 10 role then he'll be on his bike when we get some proper wingers in, he just doesn't convince on the wings for me.

Maybe LVG will give him a go just off the striker, but the competition is fierce for that spot just now.

620~~~
I don't think he's good enough to be a consistent starter considering the level we wish to aspire to.

That said, he is a good squad option. And he was good today. Good mentality shown throughout the game.

621~~~
Can't knock that second half performance. He played with a lot more conviction. Still lacks real star quality, mind you.

622~~~
Did decent. Won't do him any harm. Works hard and is quick, can dribble, and undoubtably can finish better than he showed tonight, hopefully that will come with experience, was this only his 3rd or 4th old trafford game?

623~~~
I think he's doing well. Nearly in every game, he's assisting or almost scoring. He just needs to take his chances. I think he showed a great mentality today because he started to take responsibility as the game progressed and he will only get better with more confidence.

624~~~
Developing into a fine player

625~~~
He was frustrating at times but he was also the only player that really looked like creating something. Really pleased about the assist, it was a great touch by him.

626~~~
If nothing else, he's showing that the gulf in quality between reserves and first-teamers that we're always being told about when we talk up the youngsters is massively overestimated. He's always been a good player and he has a great brain on him but make no mistake, we're not looking at a player as gifted as Januzaj, Wilson, Pereira, Harrop or Pearson here. Just a good young player with a sound head on his shoulders and a great attitude who's actually being given a proper opportunity.

627~~~
Would love to see a front three of him, young, and martial with martial in the middle. I think that group would create a lot of chances.

628~~~
Dunno how you define "gifted" but he's a much better player than both those two, who still have it all to prove. 

I thought he was excellent tonight. Really came of age. Delighted for him.

629~~~
Two different things entirely. I'm comparing raw talent, by looking at how good they were at the only level that they've all played at on a level platform - for the United youth teams. I won't argue it with you anyway, because in terms of those two I wouldn't claim there's that much in it. Harder to compare to Pearson of course because he's a very different player.

Lingard's a great little footballer and my actual point is basically that you just have to play these kids, not caution about some imaginary gulf which they'll never be good enough to bridge while not giving them the chance to prove you wrong. Which seems to be what we're doing. Hopefully when Januzaj comes back from a so-far-successful loan at Dortmund we'll continue the trend with him. Depay's lukewarm form certainly leaves an opportunity there, especially if Rooney eventually gets dropped:

630~~~
I'm not his greatest fan but I thought he did well tonight, especially last twenty minutes. Certainly the best I've seen from him in a United shirt. He does look a touch weak which is worrying considering he's 23, he should be at optimum strength at this stage of his career.

On tonight's showing he's worth persevering with for a bit longer but the clock is ticking as far as making as a regular is concerned. I'm hoping his development might be a bit like that of Fletcher. I thought he looked weak in his early games but then suddenly - well when Keane left - this top class footballer full of strength and power emerged.

631~~~
I don't think he was good. Positive yes. But seemed nothing pulled off for him. I found him very frustrating.

632~~~
I don't think that's true though. We've given a fair youth products a chance recently. Just maybe not the ones that fans rate the highest. I'm happy enough that these decisions are based on what they're showing in training, rather than some sort of strange personal dislike for them as individuals. Our fans tend to be fairly crap judges of who will/won't make the step up from what I've seen (including myself in that, by the way!)

633~~~
You've probably already heard this because it gets mentioned ad nauseam on here, but he's always been way behind the curve physically. Fergie actually predicted that Lingard wouldn't come into the first-team situation until he was 22ish because of his size.

634~~~
Apart from the brilliant assist and the through ball to Mata which almost ended up in a Rooney tap in, you mean?

635~~~
Sorry, you misunderstood me - by 'what we're doing', I meant that we <i>are</i> giving them a chance. Badly constructed sentence.

636~~~
Ah. My bad. Re-reading that it makes more sense.

637~~~
His end product needs improve but he was our most threatening player. Always positive and trying to take players on with good dribbling ability. He got on the ball many times and was pretty wasteful in some occasions but did get the assist and as I said he was lively. He's got to start vs West Brom in my opinion.

638~~~

639~~~
It is a learning curve for this guy, getting his first consistent piece of first team action and he has looked pretty damn good especially when you consider that he plays out of position a lot. Really good second half from him.

640~~~
Exactly what we've been crying out for. Someone to share the burden with Martial.

641~~~
I dunno, Wilson has been fairly anonymous since being promoted for the most part and he tore things up for the reserves. Could be Lingard's loans are playing dividends or something has just "clicked" for him at the right time.

642~~~
I think he's better suited to the right than the left.

643~~~
Just glad he is playing, magic little player, thought he was a bit uptight in the game, lacked a little of his normal composure, on his game a wonderful natural footballer full of confidence and doesn't make a fuss of anything.

644~~~
Massively. Hes right footed and due to that, he can deliver first time with more confidence (which we saw with the goal).

645~~~
Not sure what all the negativity's about here - he had a very good second half, was one of our only players trying to take people on whenever possible, and made things happen quite a few times. In fact I'd go as far as saying he was our main source of creativity in that half.
Also, the way he was dribbling past players near the half way line shows that LVG can't simply be telling his attacking players not to try stuff.

646~~~
The negativity is probably due to him losing the ball a lot. Not just a little but a lot. Besides that assist pretty much all he did was losing the ball. Basically Depay with pace. He needs to show more to stay in there. I was surprised that he didn't come off for Pereira who's a better player.

647~~~
Thought he was brilliant, all things considered.

648~~~
He did well, for a young player, but overall I thought he was decent at best. Lost the ball a lot and ruined a lot of chances. But he definitely has potential and a good attitude as well, never gave up despite things not going well before the assist. Put it this way, with the chances he had and positions he was in, if it was a better/more experienced player in his position, we probably would've scored a few and it would've been a comfortable victory for us.

649~~~
Absolutely.

650~~~
It looked like he was out the door during the summer, but he's been playing very well. Really good attitude.

651~~~
His mentality is excellent, just keeps trying and keeps working hard.

I think he can make it here as a good squad player for sure.

652~~~
He has taken these starts very well. Like said by others can be a good squad player or even become a starter until we bed Memphis into the team or sign someone. He needs to start converting those chances and you never know he might become our next Young.

653~~~
First half was very meh but improved loads in second half. Never ever hides and stop trying which is commendable.

654~~~
That mentality is probably his most important strength and which will be key for him to successfully establish himself in the squad.

655~~~
In the first half, he was constantly losing the ball but yet had the confidence to again be creative and make something happen instead of choosing the safer option.

One thing which has surprised me so far in his first team stint is that his shooting usually very composed.

656~~~
What I liked about is how he never gave up and never stopped trying, even when things weren't working out for him. There was a big difference between his two halves.

657~~~
Really like him. He does so many things so well. Also, has a bit more pace than I thought he had. 

The confidence to shoot and make the better final pass will come as he gets more game time. May be I am insane, but I prefer him over Mata on the right. Last night showed that if we played more direct and with width, we are still capable of bothering the opposition defenses.

658~~~
Hope he gets more games. Has very quick feet and works hard. I wish he'd play on the right wing over Mata.

659~~~
Yep agree it's refreshing to see someone be so positive on the ball. Him and Martial really ask questions of opposing teams.

660~~~
I liked his eagerness to take on defenders and run till very end. Kept going and going. Clearly LvG rates him given the chances he is getting and he can get better in final 3rd/penalty area with more games.

661~~~
I mean the work ethic. Generally all the players we bring through have a good work ethic and keep trying no matter what.

662~~~
I like his work ethic and he seems to pick up good positions and move well off the ball. After that, I'm struggling to see any kind of quality that will make him become a long term option here. As I said though, I'm hoping he can use his positive attributes to get a run in the team or at least stay in the first team picture. That way, it'll be evident whether he can add more to his game.

663~~~
Did much better than Memphis. He's very promising.

664~~~
It's nothing to do with being an early or late bloomer. He's 23 next month and has barely played a PL game, it doesn't bode too well for him. I feel last season he should have went out on loan to a PL team and it would have been a good development period for him. Instead, he stated the first game against Swansea and got injured. He then went on loan to Derby at the wrong time. He went when they pretty much imploded. Before that, they looked odds on for promotion and were playing some good football.

665~~~
He was by no means perfect but I gave him motm purely down to his constant attacking intent. He brought genuine urgency, something we've lacked of late, and never gave up even when he messed it up. Got his reward with a delicious assist too. 

It was the sort of performance someone like memphis should be producing right now, it doesn't have to be clinical just aggressive and urgent hopefully seeing jesse take his place will inspire some imitation on his part

666~~~
The assist reminded me of a goal Muller set up for Lewandoski earlier this season (or maybe towards the end of last season?) which I remember watching and thinking how depressing it was that we don't have anyone capable of such a a decisive first touch. Which made it all the sweeter.

667~~~
It's been a real feature of his game whenever he's played. Remember his pre-season screamers? If anything, his shooting has been a little below his usual standards this season.

668~~~
That's what I meant actually. His shooting has been very composed in all the pre seasons and youth matches I've seen him play. 

feck knows what's happening to his shooting right now but I think that will improve, also think he'll start the next few matches now which will be very pleasing.

669~~~
Ah. Gotcha. My bad.

670~~~
Very happy for Lingard.

Might not have Martial's level of talent but he works hard and has a great attitude. I think the best is till to come from him and I really hope he makes it at United.

671~~~
In one word: Positive.

Lord knows we need that in our game now.

672~~~
Our worst player in the first half, our best player in the second. I was a little surprised at how often he looked to take his fullback on, it's something I haven't really seen him do until yesterday. Perhaps LVG specifically asked him to try and beat his man to add a little directness  into our game?

673~~~
thought he played well last night, very impressed. great composure for the assist.

loved the fact that he was prepared to take players on repeatedly.

sure he lost the ball a bit but Giggs did too at that age. We need some players taking risks

674~~~
Thought he was excellent, and our Man of the Match personally. Should have gotten himself a goal in the first half though, and was also a bit greedy at times. Was still refreshing to see a player running at defenders and using close control to get past them. He could become a very good player for us.

We are still in desperate need of one top class winger though.

675~~~
The first half he was shocking really. Everything was done at 100 miles an hour and in turn fluffed everything he touched. Second half was much better and showed great composure and touch to cross first time for the goal.

676~~~
I would have taken him off at HT, so I'm delighted he stayed on and did well. Probably Depay has a "higher level" than Lingard. But until Depay has his head in the right place to use his talent, then Lingard is a good option for us.

677~~~
I always think it's a great sign of character when players can produce a good second half, after a poor first one. Lots of young players would have gone into their shell, so huge credit to him for doing the opposite.

678~~~
MotM yesterday. He was direct, positive, and confident, and even though the quality wasn't always there, the endeavour was. Rewarded with a fantastic assist. The cushioned / inside of the boot pass/cross to Rooney was excellent.

679~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AqI4pzxtAU4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Its ambiguous whether or not its at LVG's behest but you would assume so.

680~~~
He was also doing that in the last CSKA game too, suprised me also, but I like him in the team. He has a very positive engergy (as does Young)

681~~~
There's definitely an element of luck required for it to 'click', as you say.

But I don't think Wilson's really had a shot like this, either. Lingard's featured in six games in a row now, starting three. Wilson's never been trusted with a run like that. And it's particularly hard being a proper #9 in a team that aren't creating anything - Lingard's been able to impress in these recent games by getting involved and trying things in games where we're playing badly and losing. When Wilson's played in games like that it's been hard for him to do much about it, because he relies on service from others. Also Lingard's actually playing in an appropriate position, whereas Van Gaal has mostly played Wilson as a winger, which he 100% is not, and never was when he was 'tearing things up' for the reserves.

682~~~
What about most of the 92 lads? They were similar age and don't forget Jesse lost a season with us because of injury. Though at that time LVG had him at fullback...bloody hell. I think if he keeps his composure, he'll do well for us. He gave us a good energy yesterday when others were strolling or taking too long

683~~~
People need to decide what they want from our players. I thought he was very good. He took players on. He took risks. He got the assist and had defenders back peddling all game. So what he lost the ball a few times that's what happens when players take risks. Go win it back and start again. It's not like we struggled to keep the ball what did we have 70% of possession? I'd rather see someone like Lingard having a go than the constant backwards passes from our front and wide players this season. That's why we create so little in games.

684~~~
Noted that Van Gaal told him to ignore the fans.

685~~~
Agreed, it seems a lot of people want players who takes risks that always come off well. 

Personally I'd take Lingard's approach everytime over the sterile play I saw in the Palace game.

686~~~
It's weird, isn't it? People accuse us of being too safety oriented and passing the ball around pointlessly without taking any risks and then actually one players tries to take risks and loses the ball a couple of times and he's slaughetered for that.

687~~~
Fixed

688~~~
Hahaha standing up against the tossers. I love it. They complain about anything

689~~~
Very good mental strength from Lingard. One of our top 3 performers based on that alone, and the fact he was our most dangerous attacker.

Very direct, lost the ball a bit and was a bit wasteful, but had the composure & belief to keep going. Which is great to see. Great assist too.

Deserves to start and let's hope he kicks on from here.

690~~~
I don't remember him being so good at dribbling.

691~~~
Will Lingard ever be Ronaldo ? No - of course not. But he kept attacking their defense over and over again - and yes he lost the ball quite a bit, but that probably has a lot to do with lack of experience and match fitness.

Lingard did really, really well - and that pass to Rooneys goal was sublime.

692~~~
Yeah, When I've seeb him play, he's been more of a playmaker, than a player who runs at players and tries to force an opening.

Might have more to do with him playing on the left and being able to cut in

693~~~
Very good point. I think his attitude and mental strength are at this stage his biggest strengths

694~~~
He tried to attack and took risks to force something to happen. I don't care if he lost the ball a few times, his sheer determination to force something out of nothing gets plaudits from me and an assist for him. Great game.

695~~~
Thanks I thought I was alone in thinking he has great game (in both half).
Yes he lots the ball so what? Not every attack create goals.
He is perfect player for LVG system, more direct, ready to take risk and force the issue.

696~~~
I think by the age of 23, given he's a talented enough lad, he should have more experience by now. It's going to be a big season for him. Lets hope he stays injury free and can push on from last nights performance.

697~~~
he would actully be much better utilized  bit deeper in midfield s one of the b2b player. for tht position his dribbling would be good enough, while all the movement finding the pockets and clever one twos would mke him  better player there. would actully be great if someone like pereira played next to him on the wing so they could interchange their positions. almost like in reserves a couple of yers ago..

698~~~
I only really saw the second half, but I thought he was brilliant. To have what is essentially a prospect (he's started only a handful of games for us,) take the attack to the opposition like, with such penetration, was wonderful to watch. Of course, his end product is a bit off (I didn't see his misses in the 1st half, but read about them,) but once he improves that, we could have a real player on our hands. How satisfying that it's also a homegrown player.

699~~~
Very nice to see him getting a good run in the team. Showing some quality at times - just lacks composure really. That's his only downfall that may stop him being a permanent fixture in the squad. Had three or four chances yesterday, some clearer than others, in which he should have done much better at finishing or should have played someone through rather than going for a long shot. Less rushing and he'll be very useful for us.

700~~~
Completely agree. Martial is so exciting for the same reason: he constantly takes it to the opposition. Of course, this is going to result in lost possession, but it gives such a cutting edge to an otherwise blunt attack. Lingard last night was what I was expecting to see from Depay.

701~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6ExmE5VU7w?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3:58

SAF predicted he'd be ready for the first team at 22/23.

702~~~
Didn't see the game but a great assist from him in a crucial moment of the game.

703~~~
Even a clueless friend of mine who likes to watch Man Utd has appreciated his performance.

704~~~
Amen. Brightest player on the night. First half he could have been accused of being wasteful when it came to his final ball but he was lively, stretching play and running at players. Constantly taking up dangerous positions with clever movement. I thought he was great.

705~~~
Well, he was too wasteful for my liking. He got into good position and did many things right, but in the end, he didnt do enough with the ball. If he can add some end product and quality delivery, he could be a very interesting option for the future

706~~~
I thought he was fantastic. He excited me and I wanted him on the ball all the time which is something I rarely feel about any of our players nowadays.

Could care less about him losing the ball because at least he offered a spark. Taking risks > keeping it safe.

707~~~
Yeah I rolled my eyes a few times in the first half with some poor crosses and shots. But at the same time I loved his bravery and willingness to force something, his directness was refreshing. I just hope he continues to get opportunities and patience from the fans, because he could be a great and versatile option for us to have for years.

708~~~

709~~~
Really pleased he's getting a chance though I do doubt whether he has the quality on the ball and the strength to make it here. Takes up very clever positions

710~~~
Seems pretty good technically to me. Besides that, he is currently offering a few things that most of our players are not. I can see a long term spot in the squad for him, but I wonder if he'll want to move on to play more

711~~~
Depends on the kind of manager and style of play we have. If we play a possession oriented game with nifty passes and triangles in the final 3rd, he is a quality player. If we go the Fergie way and demand an all action winger who succeeds in taking people on, he might not be the right player.

An article in <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-how-sir-alex-10388013" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MEN</a> quoting Fergie from 3 years ago.

712~~~
Was just about to post this, very interesting read. Looks like he's right.

713~~~
I believed in Lingard's talent the first time we saw him on pre season a couple years ago. I was beginning to think he was going to waste. I'm glad he's getting opportunities now and he's taken them fully so far. I thought his last performance was great. I'd rather see our forwards taking risks even if they loose the ball than being safe most of the time.

714~~~
He is only in the team as we don't have enough pace in that area which Van Gaal 'loves'. I do not see a future Manchester United player out there, just a player with the requisite talents to 'balance' a faulty team. Once the team is fixed he will be at West Brom with the rest of them.

715~~~
Wow! You must be quite a talented scout to know better than Van Gaal, Fergie and the rest of the staff who rate him so highly!

His pace is not even his greatest asset. To say there's nothing more to his game than his speed is wrong. If pace was all that Van Gaal was looking for then he'd have gone with Depay on the wings or kept someone like Nani or Zaha.

716~~~
the widemen taking risks is good when we play attcking football with high pressing line. it was the case last night, so hopefully we try to win the ball asap as if we sit deep it only will look like a waste, taking forever to recover the ball. the biggest issue of ll issues is not the patient build up but the pressing we present with. everytime we bounce back from boring games and loses we are more active without the ball and it¨s overall much better performance. the players like lingard would thrive in the system so hopefully we stick to it..

717~~~
now this is really silly. lingards much more than pace, hes only make-shift winger and did really well despite playing out of position what itself is very promising.. if he ends up one of our str plyers in the future squd player or at some other club it only time will tell. but we witnessed over years that not every tlented player reaches its potential, the sme mout of plyers outgrow their potential due to intelligene nd hardwork that is the case with lingard, harry kane or someone like fletch in the past and jesse certainly has got talent

718~~~
I am not saying that pace is his only asset, nor am I saying that he isn't highly rated. I do believe he is PL standard. I just think his position will be number one priority on the scouting list and he will be sold within two years.

719~~~
My point exactly.
Last year it was the same with Di Maria, who was one of the few players taking pot-shots from all areas of the pitch. LVG didnt like this high risk approach and the rest is history.

With regards to fans:
If a players take risks, they get negative feedback - he wasted possession
If a player plays safe and side/back passes, to maintain possession - he is boring and scared to attack. 

I, for one, like the fact that everytime Lingard got the ball, he looked to either create a chance or score a goal. That's what I like about Memphis, too - he does exactly the same thing.
Rooney, does the opposite - back to goal, stops counter attacks and likes to back pass.

720~~~
Time will tell. Judging by the last three games he has been one of our best players. If he keeps that going, he has every possibility to make it here. Sure, he may face tougher competition and will see himself ending up at the bench more often than not. But to write him off at this point is ludicrous. He could become at least as successful as a player like Antonio Valencia with his hard-working attitude and multifaceted box of tools. We will always need a strong squad, and many of our players during our most successful campaigns have not been made up by "luxury signings."

721~~~
What he actually didn't like was ADM dribbling into a crowd of players, loosing the ball and then not being arsed to win the ball back, a bit like Memphis now.
As we can see with Lingard, and sometimes with Januzaj, taking players on and taking shots is allowed, as long as you do it at the right time. ADM also misplaced his passes far too often, as with Memphis right now too.

722~~~
So happy for Lingard. A home grown lad from Manchester, who it seems has been waiting for his chance forever, and it looks to have finally come. Really hope he can produce more games like the one against Moscow.

723~~~
I think he will be a good squad player going foward. I can't see him being one of the starting 11 mainstays beyond January when I think we will do some business. But it's good for him and the club. 
This is one aspect I appr LVG for. He has not had any qualms about giving youth players games but it seems to have been lost in all the negativity with the press and our ex players. I have not heard any pundit or ex player mention it or seen a single article praising him.

724~~~
Doesn't fit with the agenda that we have lost our identity

725~~~
Don't you know we've lost our identity?

726~~~
What is find most disheartening, is that our ex players are buying and feeding that mantra.

727~~~
LvG appreciates his pace and directness on the flank, I think we'll be seeing quite a bit more of him over the next couple of months.

728~~~
He does seem like the kind of player LVG likes. Young enough to mold into his type of style, good football brain, great movement, 100% effort and a team player.

Jesse never stood out as the top prospect coming through, he was overshadowed by Cleverley, Pogba, Josh King, Will Keane, Larnell Cole even, then Januzaj and Daehli. But Jesse was the glue of those teams, he just never looked like a world beater in any particular area.

729~~~

730~~~
Love that.

731~~~
I think he means Jesé; the Madrid forward.

January bid?

732~~~
Credit where credit is due he's been quite impressive so far, does look like he can create something too which is something we've been sorely lacking. He's taken his chances in the first time and looked quite a talented player, you can see now why LvG has faith in him.

733~~~
His off the ball movement has been really impressive.

734~~~
Classy finish <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

735~~~
Get in!

736~~~
Lovely goal that. Curled beautifully into the far corner. Well done lad.

737~~~
Brilliant finish. I was just admiring Lanzini's goal for WHU v Eve. Very similar goals <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

738~~~

739~~~
Chuffed to bits for the lad. Classy finish that.

740~~~
Good lad.

741~~~
I was at the game towards the start of last season when he was injured. He was doing well before the injury and had a feeling he would come good.

742~~~
Lovely instinctive goal. Knew straight away what he was going to do as soon as Brunt headed the ball into his path. Confident strike.

743~~~
It's a pleasure to be able to see a young talent break into the first team and male the impact he has.

744~~~
Delighted for him. Academy players like Lingard performing for the first team is one of the enjoyable aspects of supporting United. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

745~~~
Not an easy skill at all that. Stephen Irelandesque

746~~~
Glad the club was patient with him and gave him a chance.. He and Pereira have both impressed when given the chance.

Lingard was helped by Depay's poor form and Rooney sucking upfront. Got a chance in the last two games and has really turned up

747~~~
Quality finish, took it to their defense and could have had another, he's played his way into the starting 11.

748~~~
I still remember some posters in an England forum last summer said he's a Championship level player.Have some of it lads <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

749~~~
Leicester fans still call him League 1/2 player. Oh how I fecking hate Leicester.

750~~~
Deserved that goal. Played his way into the team.

751~~~
Great finish, won us the game really.

752~~~
I'm hoping jese's emergence will spur on Depay who has looked a bit disinterested so far.

As it is, very pleased for Lingard. He's been playing very well.

753~~~
Good game again, great goal and he's always positive with the ball. Definitely the no one option on the left wing now.

754~~~
Fantastic goal. Hope he can keep the good performances coming.

755~~~
That was a very natural strike and he made it look easy.

If he'll continue curling ball into the net like Coutinho he should be our 2nd sting after Martial till we boost the attack with some signings but perhaps player is ready for a big challenge. Fingers crossed.

756~~~
They did the same to Harry Kane I believe <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

757~~~
Delighted for him, called him to be a starter ahead of Memphis few weeks back and I am glad van Gaal trusts him. Very likeable player on the pitch, always thinking positively. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Hopefully he builds on this. 

Yep, things that I always liked the most about football.

758~~~
Credit to Van Gaal for actually giving him a chance, especially in front of a big Summer signing. That breeds confidence knowing that if they play well they'll get a chance. Its one thing that helped Young outlast club record signing Di Maria last season, confidence from the manager . I love this sort of competition, it keeps everyone on their toes.

759~~~
Superb goal from him. Really happy to see him gained confidence as the game progress. That cheeky dribble in the box was great to see.

760~~~
This more than anything is the 'United Way' for me

761~~~
TBF they seem to have high standards....<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

762~~~
He's one of our own
He's one of our own
Jesse Lingard
He's one of our own <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>


Great finish today.

763~~~
Fair play to the lad. A few of us have questioned his apparent lack of real game-turning quality, but he brought some of that with him today. The finish was a beauty. 

He'll be keeping his place in the side, certainly.

764~~~
Hope to god that doesn't catch on.

765~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

766~~~
His speed of thought and work rate were most impressive today I thought. My MOTM for the second game running.

767~~~
Forget his goal today, hes been so bright since coming on against City as a sub. But yeah deserved his goal. Doesnt give up even if he makes a mistake, head doesnt drop. Still believe RW is more suited to him given hes right footed (he will get more assist from there). But of course, he can score like he did today playing from the left. (hopefully the future will see a more fluid interchangeable three behind the striker)

768~~~
That goal was coming from him. Hit the bar vs City, hit the post vs Middlesbrough, got close on a few other occasions. Delighted for him. Hopefully in time he gets better with his final ball/wing play. He's a very intelligent player, but often times he overruns the ball at the last bit and doesn't manage to put in the cross. Hopefully it'll come with time

769~~~
Hit the bar two games straight, made an assist in another and now he's scored. He's going to establish himself as a first teamer if he keeps this up

770~~~
Fantastic goal. I think he should get a run of games up until the Christmas period unless his performance level drops significantly.

771~~~
Jan Mølby said during pre-season this summer that Lingard would end up in the championship as he would never be good enough for the Premier League. 

I dislike jan Mølby.

772~~~
Just love his attitude. Keep it up Jesse!!

773~~~
Lingard played well today. Again, didn't let small setbacks deter him, kept having the courage to take the ball on and attack. 

No surprise that he scored the first United Premier League goal from outside the box. He's got the fearlessness youth, which we need given our experienced players seem scared to shoot from further than six yards out!

774~~~
Very impressive performance once again from him topped off with a great goal. His movement is the thing that impresses me the most he made some very smart runs today to open up space for other players and this is a big thing we have been missing this season. He is quickly becoming thr player we thought Memphis would be.

775~~~
For the moment I'm not even bothered whether he's long term United quality or not. He's stood up whenever he's been called on, and is a local youth prospect blooming in the spotlight. Long may it continue, cos it's fantastic!

776~~~
Reminds me of Barca's Pedro in some way. Although I think Lingard has better X factor in the final third (potentially).

777~~~
Well played again, has taken his chance and should have the lw position locked down for the time being.

778~~~
play him as CAM and see him thrive, he is good enough from the flanks too..

779~~~
Why would you rather see him there? I consider his skill set to be perfectly suited for the winger positions. He has pace, moves well off the ball and has great footwork which allows him to take people on and beat them.
By the way, today he was better than in the Moscow game in my opinion and proved himself to capable of even operating in tight spaces.

780~~~
I like how he takes his opportunities when given playing time, not enough players have this mindset.

781~~~
Let's Spanishise his name like Hames.

782~~~
Jéssé Língárd

783~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimage.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s9.postimg.org/kssxi288f/Screen_Shot_2015_11_07_at_20_16_05.png" src="http://s9.postimg.org/kssxi288f/Screen_Shot_2015_11_07_at_20_16_05.png"/></a>

784~~~
Jesé Lingardo

785~~~
or Dane it up.

Lindegaard.

786~~~
IMHO he has the best mindset of any player I've watched in the reserves for United. 

Shows a football brain is better than pace like Zaha.

787~~~
J'seis L'ingarde

788~~~
Jésé Ingara.

789~~~
I've seen his name typed Lindgaard or Lingaard more than Lingard.

Thanks Anders.

790~~~
I think even the commentator called him Lindegaard at one point.

791~~~
Je suis Lingard.

792~~~
Non, tu es ingrat.

793~~~
They did!

Just watched a clip of his goal and the commentator said he signed with United at 16. Yeah, but he joined United at 7!!

794~~~
Yeah I remember that, baffling!

795~~~

He must be fecking over the moon<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> So happy for him.

796~~~
Awesome, thanks for posting that dood!

797~~~
It's just great to see, especially when all you hear from City is about their youth set up flourishing. It can flourish all it want, when you get a player, a fan who has been at the club since they were a kid, playing and scoring in important matches. It's just what this club is about, great to see.

798~~~
Great goal today was delighted for him.

799~~~
that will probably have been Dane's biggest contribution to United's history.. well.. forgot about his unreal wife

800~~~
This lad looks class. Made a huge difference so far. One of those players defences hate and his pace is something we've been missing.

LVG clearly rates him very highly and he has rewarded him with the performances.

Unless LVG drops Mata and switches him to the left he has made it very difficult for Memphis to find a way back in.

801~~~
Even back in summer of 2 to 3 years ago, where youngster like Januzaj has impressed during the preseason tours, I've always felt Jesse is the one who would have to biggest chance to make it here. He look flawless throughout.

802~~~
Hey I think he was probably the sexiest player until Mata arrived...<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

803~~~
We've been screaming out for a wide playmaker, Mata has been good but he's more of a scorer than a creator, and he doesn't have great ability to beat a man. He's a little predictable out there, I feel.

Lingard is an excellent "glue" player, I would say that's his best trait, moving the ball on in a positive way, always moving into space to provide an outlet. 

I personally overlooked Lingard for a few years, and I wasn't alone in thinking Cleverley was better. Few said they thought Lingard was better when Larnell Cole won Reserve player of the year in 2012.

804~~~
How did he play apart from the goal?  Easy to let a goal cloud judgement.

805~~~
Our best player.

Looked like the only player that was going to cause West Brom any problems. Kept running at them and putting them on the back foot.

806~~~
Pedro shares a few characteristics with Lingard.  Both are very spatially aware on and off the ball, calm finishers, a bit lightweight physically, and lack top level dribbling ability to consistently create their own chances.

807~~~
Thanks. Not many would have predicted that Lingard would end up ahead of Memphis in the team, but that's how it seems to be now!

Funny that Pedro is being mentioned, I was thinking the same comparison.

808~~~
Much better today than in his previous appearances.

I'd love it if he makes it but I'm not convinced he will. I hope he proves me wrong.

809~~~
If I came on as a substitute in the last 2 seconds of a league cup game for Man Utd I'd consider myself as having 'made it.'

Lingard has achieved more than the vast majority of our youth players, although I do know what you mean about 'making it.'

810~~~
Tracks back, has a great shot, dribbling improving day in day out. Could be a special player, hopefully gets a good a run

811~~~
Nothing against Memphis, but I absolutely love that Jesse is keeping him out the team.

812~~~
Really really happy for him. Was beaming when he scored. Great to see a youngster come through and play well. He's definitely making that spot on the wing his own too, after Depay's awful form. Looks a constant threat and willing to run at the opposition, just needs to keep working on his final pass. Also, his movement is really good. Think he will score a decent amount of goals.

813~~~
Agreed, I would love Memphis to be great for us but I really like when a youth product shows that a price tag and cool youtube highlights package means absolutely nothing.

814~~~
Not sure if this has been mentioned before, but I have just read that hes the first United player to score from outside of the box in 2015!!

815~~~
First Premier League goal outside the box since December 2014.

816~~~
Shit. And there was me thinking you couldn't drag your trawler net of negative agenda posting into such an eminently positive thread. I owe myself a shot.

817~~~
I don't know how anyone couldn't feel happy after Jesse getting his first goal. Great to see him taking his chance lately, really put me in a good mood tonight!
As someone else said, feeling of pride at seeing him keep Memphis out of the team, strange as that may be

818~~~
Nice goal today but it's depressing how other club's have much better talents in their squads.

819~~~
So Pereira's goal in the Carling Cup this season not taken into account ?

820~~~
Was fantastic today. Much better than vs Moscow (although seems I'm the only one who thought he wasn't good vs them). He's getting confidence. That skill where he got pulled down was mesmerising. 

Excellent he's a local lad too!

821~~~
Agreed wasn't that good against Moscow apart from the assist.

822~~~
Eh ?

He should have had an assist for Rooney, played in Mata who from that set up our best chance other than our goal.

Set up the goal and was unlucky not to have one himself

And looked a threat besides that all game. He was fairly wasteful in the 1st granted.

823~~~
What teams in the league have much better talents than us?

824~~~
Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City, Southampton, West Ham.......etc etc

825~~~
eh? Where?

826~~~
Ok, now list such talents at these clubs.

827~~~
Is this a geography issue? Liverpool is in Liverpool. Southampton is in Southampton.Man City is in Manchester.The others are in London.

828~~~
As in where in these sides - and the etcs - is there more talent? Precious diversion, though.

829~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

830~~~
Leicester, we don't have Vardy <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

831~~~
He's a livewire, I don't get it when people talk about "making it" at United. He might not be a long term first team player, but I'll be happy to have a player like him coming in from the bench, or starting if the main players are not in form, not everyone will be as good as Messi, but Lingard is a very good player.

832~~~
Lingard is an excellent option on the wings and as a striker.

He is young and will improve.

833~~~
100%

And it's players like Lingard who are fans of the club who would be more than happy and keep working hard to maintain that status. Thinking of the likes of Fletcher, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt etc

834~~~
Great goal but more importantly great game for the lad. Looked a constant threat and always was willing to run at defenders like Martial. Could have had 2-3 goals to be honest but great that he took that goal. That will really give his confident a boost and will go gunning against Watford for another goal. He is doing Memphis what Young did to Di Maria last season. <i><span style="color: #808080">Although hope Memphis gets into his 3rd gear and start putting in performances. </span></i>

<span style="color: #000000">Love it when an academy player makes his name. Hope he can cement his place in that starting 18. </span>

835~~~
Jesse LADgard

836~~~
Good on him. Never really rated him but he was excellent today, goal was beautiful and he worked his socks off. Great to see them pics of him as a youngster here as well.

837~~~
He'll get a good run of games now and I hope he takes it. LVG likes him. Very happy for him today.

838~~~
We have the best collection of young talent in the country; Shaw, Depay, Januzaj, Pereira, Lingard, Martial and even Jones. Ridiculous opinion on your part lad.

839~~~
Dint want to get overexcited and certainly not comparing their level but his style is like Muller. He's a very clard hard working player who has a bit of everything, so allround. He can dribble, he's fast, he's smart, turns quick, driven to score, can finish, can link up, can assist and plays at lm, cam, rm and could even do a job as 2nd striker I reckon. Just like Blind could do a job everywhere because he's quite allround (bar his physique), I have that with Jesse, the question is rather, to which level will he develop eventually.

840~~~
Was my favourite youngster when we took three of them on the Asian tour iirc, it was him, Januzaj and Zaha. Jesse was the most clinical one that time, I think he scored the most goals, very happy for him, he's losing the ball a lot sure, but as well working his ass off to get it back, something you don't see from Depay.

Must be a fantastic feeling for him fulfilling his dream of scoring at OT.

841~~~
Fletcher and Butt were really good midfielders. If Lingard is that good he'll play a ton of games there.

842~~~
The Pedro comparison isn't that bad actually. 22 when breaking into the first team, a slick finisher, nice touch, good movement, well timed runs...

Obviously the gulf in class is severe but in terms of archetype he's similar to Pedro.

843~~~
If he can replicate the goals he scored in the Championship into the Premier League on a regular basis then I don't see why he shouldn't get more opportunities. The one he scored yesterday was well taken and his all round contribution was good too.

844~~~
Not true. Wilson scored from outside the box against Cambridge in January.

845~~~
I think he's making the grade. He seems to be growing in stature and confidence with game time and he's already nailing down a starting place.

846~~~
I got done here when I said the same thing on August...

847~~~
Ah Pedro was the next big thing coming from Spain back then on this forum. I got laughed also when i just told opinion of my friend who is Barca fan and he doesn't really rated Pedro.

Back to Lingard, i don't know why so many people are so reserved about his ability and his talent. Everytime i saw him, especially in the pre-season matches since i rarely watch the reserves he looked quite good and i was suprised why he didn't get a chance in the first team and was worried that he will never get it. I was suprised about his dribling ability since i didn't see much of his dribling ability in reserves or in pre-season matches.

I think we should just watch and enjoy how his career will go from here but the early impresion is positive.

848~~~
You are completely talking out of your ass tbh.

849~~~
I get called out on Twitter for saying that Lingard isn't the quality of player that we want to see in the CL for United on the wings. Congrats to the lad for the past one and a half performances. A long way back in this thread I say that I see him as  PL player because he scores goals but I stand by what I say regarding United and the CL.

I get the feeling that a lot of fans seem to accept us as an also ran team now.

850~~~
Don't get your hopes too low. Nothing negative about my post, and not meant in that manner. Just a surprising stat.

851~~~
I'm very happy with him so far. At the very least I think he'll be a good squad player for us - and that's an important point. I would love if as many as possible of our squad players could be made up from the academy.

852~~~
In the Premier league.

853~~~
He's shown, in recent games, he can be more than a squad player. I wouldn't hesitate in saying he's been our best attacking player over the last few weeks. Yes, he's been slightly inconsistent, but he's still learning.

854~~~
He's doing well and its great to see, good competition for Depay who needs a kick up the arse. Nice to see LVG looking to our own squad before looking at the transfer market, let Lingard get some game time and if he keeps it up we could have a new permanent fixture in the squad which I would love.

855~~~
I could cheat and youtube this but Blind v Liverpool? Mata at Anfield maybe?

856~~~
Still working on those lists of talents?

857~~~
I agree. I think people are underrating his potential/ability somewhat because when he was younger he didn't shine in the reserves as much as the likes of Pogba, Morrison, Petrucci, King and a couple others maybe (Ajose always seemed to outscore him, and Daehli got people excited for a little while). However success in the reserves and academy doesn't define a player's future career.

858~~~
I thought Sat showed improved decision-making over his previous very promising performances.

859~~~
Even if he just ends up being Muller Light that would be quite tasty.

860~~~
Both were from inside the box.

861~~~
Prior to Lingard's, the last goal we scored from outside the box in the league was Mata's free kick vs Stoke in December 2014. The one where he crossed it and no one got a touch even though Rojo tried to claim it.

862~~~
Is this a bad time to mention that he side footed it too?

863~~~
Has this been discussed?

Kind of bizzare, you can hardly compare Mata's pace to Lingards.

864~~~
Depay hasn't looked that fast either. Although maybe he just hasn't shown it yet?

865~~~
Yeah I was actually just going to post in here after reading that in the transfer thread that maybe Lingard will get some chances in the second striker role. It seems LvG has looked at best teams in Europe and decided he wants blistering pace not just quick when it comes to the flanks.

866~~~
Think he already knew it to be honest.  I rekon his last move in his 3 year tenure is to replace mata with a pacey left footed winger. 

Whilst we have mata its not much of a prioroty until all the other bits have been sorted.

867~~~
I`m pleased for Lingard and I hope he gets even more playing time. This might be the last season for him to prove himself since in the summer if LVG is not convinced by him we might sign 1-2 wingers.

868~~~
I think LVG wants 2 speedsters and ibthink that will revolutionise our play. 2 robbens or 2 douglas costas or similar players who could cut inside and deliver quality but also can beat a man. I think that is why he loves young.
Jesse can become a good player, its all about how hard he is willing to work. Every aspect of his game can be improved and i am sure playing these minutes will help him alot. He needs to carry on doing the hard work, he seems to have a good attitude so i think if he keeps it up he will always be in the mind of manager. I like what i see of him right now although when i watched reserves he wasnt the one i would say would be here at 22! Not everyone can be developing at 18, i hope he can develope and become a good player.

869~~~
I don't think LVG rates Young as highly as a winger. He is not productive enough and his final delivery is very shabby. He can beat a man but not in the same way as a Robben or a Costa can do.

As for Lingard, I think he is a very intelligent player who can be a very good squad option for us for years to come. I am not sure if he will be a nailed on starter for us next year if we are able to land someone like a Bale.

870~~~
I'm impressed with him.

Seems confident.  Specially the way he didn't rush that shot for his goal.  Very calm.

871~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> I remember that. I thought it was pretty spot on, both might not be so great on ball per se, but it is their movement, eye for goal, and willingness to defend that gives them that edge. Not saying Lingard is at his level yet, but he can get there..

872~~~
Called up to the England squad. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

873~~~
Happy for him but it's too easy getting a call up these days.

874~~~
Over the moon for him but there are more deserving candidates.

875~~~
I like Lingard - but him being called to the national side after 2 good matches shows a bit of the problem in the P.L. I am not even sure there are that many more deserving candidates - but there are certainly too FEW candidates

876~~~
Good for him but it is a bit of a joke. 

So you play 5 good games at the start of your PL career and you get in the England squad....

877~~~
5 is a stretch. I'm glad for him though.

There are not many english wingers in form currently, to be fair. Still, I'd have taken Albrighton, Zaha, Redmond or even Deeney ahead of him.

Edit: Is he too old for the U21? They play tomorrow.

878~~~
He's been good recently and from what I remember he did very well for youth national teams too so no harm calling him up for a friendly. I don't think he's a worse footballer than Andros Townsend for example. You need to mix things up a little in friendlies because this is the only opportunity to try out new things.

879~~~
Redmond is the only one I'd take over Lingard.I don't think the rest has what it takes to play for England in the future.

Totally agree that this is way too early for Jesse.

880~~~
Happy for him but a couple of good games and a few averages ones shouldn't constitute an England call up. Can't see LvG being happy about it either after his comments and the Carrick injury.

881~~~
Was gonna make the joke as soon as he scored that I reckon he will be called up

Goes to show how easy it is to get an England cap these days. Be English, play in the premier league, make one headline....that'll do it

To think Steve Bruce never got one cap

882~~~
Same, Redmond is the only one who really came to mind. But I've felt like he deserved a try for a long time now, whereas Lingard has come into form at the right moment I guess

883~~~
Delighted for him, but he really should be nowhere near the national team.

884~~~
Redmond is with the U21s, I think.

885~~~
Hodgson has probably gone off of Southgate's reports tbf, he has always been glowing about him.

886~~~
Just goes to show that if you play for one of the big teams you have a good chance of being selected. Look at the likes of Cleverley and Zaha too.

887~~~
He's injured.

888~~~
Zaha got his call up when he was at Palace.

889~~~
Please don't injure him England

890~~~
Very well deserved. Hope he gets a run out because he seems to have risen to the occasion every time he's been given an opportunity.

891~~~
Ashley Young and Marc Albrighton are more deserving in my opinion, and I'd say Zaha can probably feel hard done by too.

I really do rate Jesse but can't help but feel this has come far too soon?

892~~~
How has he not been in the squad before hand to be honest?

893~~~
Of course it is far too soon, after 3 games or what. A joke, but helps that he plays for United and looked good for the u21. These days you just need a few games and you are in, not just for England.

894~~~
Lingard no better than fecking Zaha?  Their respective performances when given a chance at United show the difference in quality. I really don't get why Lingard is respected so little on this forum.

895~~~
I feel quite bad for Young, really thought he proved himself last season as at least deserved of being a squad member.

It's clear though, there's a huge youth policy that Hodgson's been given to follow and he seems more like a middleman for future England managers to benefit from. Better for players like Eric Dier, Lingard, Dele Alli etc. to get used to national experiences now than later.

896~~~
Seems way too soon. I wouldn't have called him up, despite being impressed by him. The sample size is too small. It's typical England though. He's great until his form dips and he's severely criticized.

Stupid decision by  Hodgson who is a terrible manager, and who England will do well to get rid of after the Euro2016 failure. 

This is far too soon, and even LVG tried to persuade him not to do it. He's played just two games for United as a regular, let the kid acclimatize to that first before lumping him with the added pressure and media hysteria that is the England NT circus.

898~~~
Ridiculous.

899~~~
Congratulations to him but I think it's a bit too soon. I feel sorry for Young, as long as Hodgson is manager I can't see him getting a call up.

900~~~
Zaha has just got 1 goal and 0 assist for him this season. Why the sudden clamour to call him up? Agree with the Albrighton shout though.

901~~~
Same here, pleased for him but didn't want to be the first to say the second part. Unfortunately it shows how easy it is to get into the England squad and the lack of strength in depth we have.

902~~~
I agree it's too early but he has been a part of the U21 set up for a couple of years and was one of the few to emerge with any credit from their Euro tournament in the summer.

903~~~
calm down haters, he was one of the best and most consistent u21 performers for England. That's where recommendations come from as well. He showed a lot of promise for us lately even though it was only a couple of games but it will be a huge boost for him and he will feature in 20 minutes or so so not sure about the complaints its friendly ffs...

904~~~
He is, but that as I said says a lot about the quality of England player. He wouldn't get near the German, French or Spanish squad.

905~~~
Pass me that crystal ball k2k! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

But in all seriousness, I can't for the life of me understand how Hodgson survived the 2014 WC. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

906~~~
Has someone pulled out? In truth I thought the game vs France would be called off. At any rate the experience will be good for him, there's no guarantee he'll get any minutes but just being part of the senior international set up can't hurt.

907~~~
Carrick and Vardy.

908~~~
What? I didn't say anything about one being better than the other. Lingard has had 2 good games recently and if that's the basis of his call-up, then Zaha deserves it more, currently. The latter's performances for United are completely irrelevant.

909~~~
There again it could be Roy Hodgson trying to see how many United players he can injure in one sesssion.

910~~~
Ah, so he's mainly replacing Vardy I guess, his injury seemed to come from nowhere.

911~~~
This can't be ruled-out.

912~~~
Long overdue this call-up!

Seriously though, haven't they injured enough of our players?

913~~~
Even the Scousers will tell you that no crystal ball is needed with Woy. England under him at major tournaments  havent really been hammered by high scores, but tactically they have been usually comprehensively outclassed.

Even Lancaster (The rugby coach) got canned his first round exit. Hodgson is a yes man and doesnt ruffle the feathers.

914~~~
Doesn't take much to get into the England squad these days, does it?

That's not a pop at Jesse Lingard. Far from it but, 2 decent games for United and he's in the England squad? 

LvG will be pissed! He already warned Roy

915~~~
Watch him play and getting injured...CAF would flip out on Roy.

916~~~
Is Smalling injured?

917~~~
he starts games for the top 4 football club in England now.. he might get a cameo here and there and that's what he's getting, it may be a bit early call but why not in the end, again its just a friendly, he will get few minutes... ppl should see it from the positive perspective in my view

918~~~
Pleased for him. When United came out to Sydney a couple of years ago I was impressed with him even if it was a low key meaningless friendly.

919~~~
Sometimes picking future National team players happens early in friendly games just as part of their development. Sound idea IMO.

920~~~
I suspect that it is because they see Lingard as a likely England player and Zaha not so much.

921~~~
Happy for him. Hopefully he'll get some minutes as a sub, and come back to us buzzing. 

There seems to be no long term planning in terms of the England squad though. Whoever is flavour of the month gets a cap.

922~~~
Well done Jesse but shows you the current plight of the English national team. Jesse should be nowhere near the team after two games and to think of guys you used to have that couldn't get a game or the strikers that were our top strikers and tearing up the league year on year and couldn't get a game for England (how times have changed) Sheringham/Cole/Fowler/Sutton/Phillips would be automatic starters nowadays and the likes of Cascarino and Andy Townsend would have played for England.

923~~~
Another player that is massively overrated by some for some reason. Remember when Moyes didn't play him and sent him out on loan? Christ.

924~~~
Sign of the times, best part of being a United supporter for me is seeing hungry young players. Of course it doesn't help that a lot of people were proved wrong about him either..

925~~~
Injuries play a role as well, to be fair. If Sturridge, Welbeck, Walcott, Ox were fit, that squad would be much different. Actually if Vardy hadn't pulled out Lingard probably wouldn't have gotten the call.

926~~~
I usually am one to give time to youngsters and while I'm not writing him off I just don't see Utd quality in him

927~~~
Agree with you. I don't see this player as a top talent. Another Blackett/Mc Nair for us.

928~~~
Poor old Stevie Bruce!

929~~~
Oh I think he has a proper chance, much more so than the likes of Blackett anyway.

People are saying he doesn't deserve the England call-up, and is being picked because he plays for United, but the alternatives being mentioned (Zaha, Albrighton, Puncheon) are not above his level, and let's not forget he has managed to push Young and Memphis out of our team for now on merit.

930~~~
Pretty unbelievable.  Two games and a call-up.  Happy for him though and hope he does well.

931~~~
Why the surprise? This isnt new. Players get unexpected call ups all the time. 
England took a 16 year old to the WC in 2006... for no reason.

He is clearly rated by someone at the club.. and maybe the English manager wants to have a look at him in training to see how he has progressed...
There were vacancies in the squad after a couple of injuries and some kid got called up. Big deal.

932~~~
Beeb panel ripping him apart. Saying it does not take much to get into the England squad nowadays.

933~~~
What Beeb panel?

934~~~
On BBC Five live .Mark Chapman,Mark Lawrenson, John Cross

935~~~
The match thread might not agree, but I think he has done well.
Missed a sitter.. couldnt get the elevation.. happens.

936~~~
Almost costed us game with that shit chip, but he was excellent all around. After all, we scored the second after his shot.

937~~~
Would that have been Depay he would have been torn to shreds today. Very very wasteful.

938~~~
Never been a 1-on-1 with keeper scorer, he's almost never been in that situation in his career.

939~~~
Should have scored twice, we cant afford these missers.

940~~~
Forgetting the miss, I think he was pretty poor. It is harsh but I think it's pretty clear he's a standard below the general level of our team, and I don't see him improving massively.

941~~~
Great off the ball, decent dribbling but rather shit end product (that's ignoring the two chances)

Seriously could have cost us.

942~~~
Looked poor a lot of the time, offside far too much. Hoddle said he was excellent off the ball though. You don't get to see that too much on TV.

943~~~
He tried very hard and made good runs but  he had brilliant chances and missed them. That to me shows a lack of top class talent, don't get me wrong I think he can do a job for us but I don't see him being a key player for us more of a squad player.

944~~~
Poor finishing, but showed good attacking intent with running with the ball, also trying to break the Watford back line, not always timing his runs correctly

945~~~
Did ok. Should of scored though. Clear that neither him nor Memphis are strikers though.

946~~~
Good positioning. At least he's making the run and got footballing brain. Good progress all things considered.

947~~~
Or maybe it shows he isn't a striker?

His movement and linkup with Memphis was superb, throw in an actual striker like Martial with them and we'd be seeing a very different story.

948~~~
If it was Herrera he'd be dropped regardless. The lob wasn't a difficult shot to execute.

949~~~
Not a great match but played a big role in our winner. People need to consider that he was playing in an unfamiliar position.

950~~~
I thought he was bright today, but it just didn't work for him. It happens with young players.

951~~~
Great movement, poor finishing.

952~~~
I think he was great, to be honest. Never stopped running, good movement, made all the right decisions and was a real threat. He'll learn to put those chances away eventually, so it's amazing how people have been ripping into his performance today.

953~~~
On a plus side....great that he finsd himself in these scoring situations, as.for negatives....he wasted.3 good chances today. Thats about as many chances as Rooney has has all season.

954~~~
He was shite today, and I'm not referring to the missed chances either. He gave it away a fair bit, got caught offside far too often and was weak when up against the centre halves. Throw in the poor finishing and it wasn't a great game. 

That said, he's a nice player to just have on the pitch. Adds an energy and unpredictability to an otherwise stale attack.

955~~~
His finishing was poor today and he needs to improve on that but overall I thought he did well, his work rate is exellent but what has impressed me the most so far is his off the ball movement he makes some very clever runs which opens up space  oth for him and his team mates.

956~~~
1) hes not striker 2) that just happens he scored shitload of goals before he will score for us 3) his movement is incredible, rooney wouldt get nowehere near that second chance, lingard tirelessly stretched the opposition today and put in  good effort, also he has an assist if its BFS goal. 

I am content with him, memphis wasted so many chances t the start as well and nobody wrote him off, its good players re getting to those chances looks like revelation after what rooney showed to us this season...

957~~~
was good at everything apart from finishing, thank God we scored the winner as he would be crucified for that 1v1 miss.....

958~~~
His miss undermined a good peformance and could of been costly. He made up for it however with his part in the winner.

I enjoy watching us play more when he is the side. He brings fluency with his short combination passing and movement.

959~~~
Good movement and tireless running in a position he's not familiar with. The chance was harder than people seem to think, but he definitely should have gotten it past Gomes at least. Still not sure he has enough for United in the long term though.

960~~~
I thought he looked good upfront. Showed us the kind of movement that Rooney has been lacking. However his finishing was shit.

961~~~
It was two chances(not three) in which Rooney would never end up because he is nowhere near quick as him. He would probably feck up first touches too, since Lingard found himself in the first chance mostly because he produced excellent first touch. And the shot wasn't bad at all, Gomes made good save. Second chance was shit chip though.

962~~~
I thought he was really good. Wasn't as good with the ball as he has been, but the way he stretched Watfords backline was excellent, which is what we've been lacking in most games. From start to finish he was a constant menace. Good game.

963~~~
some silly comments here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he wasnt much worse than memphis but missed the chances. His movement was awesome and we benefited from it many times when he made space for Memphis and others stretching the play. We played with three at the back and there was a need for another midfelder so the linkup play wasn't that good and the two roaming players in jesse and depay had it quite tough imo... but at least they got into those chances, its positive from what we've seen before..

certainly kept his place in the team..

964~~~
No excuses for not scoring that chip. Has bags of energy though and has pace to go along with it.

965~~~
Constant threat and it's great to have someone constantly moving and creating space for others but on the ball he's just not good enough to start long-term, IMO.

966~~~
Gave the ball away a fair bit and quite often when not under pressure.

967~~~
Nothing I've yet seen impresses me. 

He works hard, gets in good positions and links with teammates fairly well. Things that every single one of our players should be doing anyway. These are basic requirements.

968~~~
like having the pace over the top. gives a back 4 something to think about.

969~~~
Happy hes in the team, the more he plays, the more consistent he will get. Yes he missed the chip (it actually was quite terrible) and times he was just too casual up top which he needs to cut out, but did well with the winner.

970~~~
It really makes me laugh, as soon as a youth player gets some games people compare them to superstars and say they're not good enough. Like they're trying to impress everyone with how keen their analysis is.

971~~~
Shame he didn't finish one of those 2 excellent chances he had but I though his movement and pressing was good today.

972~~~
why is rooney starting every game then?

973~~~
Needs to work on his finishing, but kept Watford's backline on their toes and worked his socks off. Could have won us the game ages ago, but still a decent performance from Jesse

974~~~
the feck is this about Jesse. Just walks away.

975~~~
Ha, I was going nuts at that. 

Chase the feck back if you get megged.

976~~~
He's paying his repects. Man just got merked.

977~~~
Watched him for years and years in the youth/reserves, always thought he was decent, good intangibles but not quite the grade for Man Utd, but he's done very well, doesn't look out of place at all, proving me wrong.
Was cursing though when he missed the lob, one thing he's always been decent at is taking his chances.

978~~~
Was a decent performance.The finishing will come, it's not like he's bad at finishing either.

979~~~
I liked his movement in behind them. Looks like someone who can make a good squad player. Definitely adds something us given our lack of pace.

980~~~
I'll agree that was weak and thought maybe play had been stopped!

That's not his style, I'm sure LVG will point that out. i

981~~~
Really needs to work on his finishing.

982~~~
I've always felt that we've missed a steady, harrying player up front since Welbeck left.  So if he keeps missing those chances, he'll be a perfect fit.

Seriously though, thought he was great today.

983~~~
Yep. He's in the side because we don't have any better options upfront. That's it. 

I wasn't Welbeck's greatest fan, but he had more to his game than Lingard.

Egypt after the ten plagues had more to offer than our front line.

984~~~
Agreed.

985~~~
Did well I thought and deserves to keep his place in the team, should have scored though.

986~~~
He was good I think. The fact that we had a runner helped. All game I was thinking of how we would have murdered that back 4 if we had Martial up there, they were terrible.

987~~~
Had a good game, lacked a touch of quality in the final 3rd but overall, didn't have a bad game.

988~~~
Too harsh, he could have scored two today, could also have won the Manchester derby, and Middlesborough games with a bit more luck.

i like him and expect him to offer a lot from now on.

989~~~
Orders from Lvg to keep shape/stay in position maybe.

990~~~
Pretty much exactly what happens on MotD.

Anyway, good effort again but I'm still not seeing anything to change my view that he'll fall just short of making it here.

991~~~
You could make a case that those are Thomas Muller's strongest attributes too. He's one of the best around.

992~~~
Watching the game back again think I'm a bit harsh on Lingard he was good today and made things happen, his shot at the end allowed us to get the winner as well.

993~~~
He worked his socks off from the first too last minute, and definitely deserved a goal. Had some great link up play and was unlucky not too score, he deserved a goal. 

He's not a flashy player but he's going to be a great squad player to keep, can play any of the top 4 positions and always gives you 100%. I take that hard working performance over some of rooneys "I can't be assed too play today" turn ups. 

It's a shame that 1 of him or Memphis will probably be dropped when the other 2 return.

994~~~
I didn't think he was anywhere near bad. His movement and pace caused so may problems for the Watford defense. The game should have been over by half time, had it not been for some poor decision making in the final third. However, he and Memphis linked well, used their pace to get in behind Watford's defense, and illustrated movement seen of normal strikers. Lingard has impressed me a lot, this season. He was thrown in with very few chances to get used to the PL or the team, and he has performed valiantly. Well done Jesse.

995~~~
But Welbeck falls over his feet when he gets more than 2 seconds inside the box.

996~~~
I agree. From what I have seen so far, I dont think he has what it takes to become a long term starter. He just doesnt do enough with the ball. He's making decent runs but is just not producing enough. And he missed quite a few chances already where he really should have scored

997~~~
You laugh, but we need these wise heads on the forum, reminding us all that Jesse Lingard is not, in fact, Andres Iniesta. Just look how carried away everyone gets otherwise:

998~~~
Say what you want about Jesse but since he's established himself in the team we've looked <i>considerably</i> more likely to score than we did without him. 

Even if we ignore the possibility that his movement and willingness to take players on (two qualities sorely lacking from the team for most of this season) are helping our creativity, he also seems to be one of very few United players who regularly takes a crack at goal.

One goal aside, he's repeatedly hit the woodwork and works the opposition keeper more regularly than almost any other player in our team. Let's not forget that late winner was a direct result of a really top class save by Gomes. From guess who?

999~~~
I have been surprised by how he hasn't looked out of place at all in any game he has played, his movement is good plus he has some pace and he is technically very sound so I don't see much to complain about till now.

1000~~~
Yet, time and time again these "basic" players are some of our most consistent performers. There are room for players who aren't superstars, beasting opponents week in, week out. He didn't look out of place against City, so I'd say he's good enough for a place in the squad.

1001~~~
I'm happy with how he's playing. I definitely prefer us with him in the side. People also have to take into consideration that he was playing in an unfamiliar role and he did OK. The fact that he is getting into the right positions to get these goalscoring chances is a good sign and the experience he's getting means should he get into similar situations again, he'll probably make better choices. 

I thought he was one of our better players.

1002~~~
I don't get some of the criticism he's getting. He did well and was unlucky not to score (unlucky is maybe too kind, he really should have scored that first chance, the second one was a bit more difficult) and LvG said he did very well and he doesn't like praising players. We need to take into consideration the fact that this is the first time he gets an extended run of games at this level, and he is meant to be a late-developer.

1003~~~
I always find it strange how people view different players performances completely differently. I'm not comparing them as players but if Martial had put in a similar performance people would be saying he looked a constant threat and would look for the positives in his performance but with Lingard it seems like people have their minds made up that he's not good enough and will just look for the negatives so that they can repeat their opinion that he's not good enough at every opportunity. Most people say they want the club to bring through young players but then slate them if they don't instantly play like seasoned professionals. For a bit of perspective this was only Lingard's 3rd start in the Premier League and he was playing in an unfamiliar position yet he provided more of a threat than our actual strikers have in most games in the past year. He should have taken the lobbed chance but he drew 2 very good saves from Gomes, 1 of which led to the winning goal and could have been in for a 1 on 1 at the end of the first half if Memphis had played a better pass. For me it was a very encouraging performance and his positional flexibility adds another dimension to the squad.

1004~~~
Agree with this, I thought he had a good game, for someone who isn't a striker

1005~~~
I agree for the most part. Except he needs to score those one on ones. Can be extremely crucial which might be the difference between further chances with first team vs slowly fading out of the picture. The obvious encouraging thing is he got into quite a few goal scoring situations and worked the GK every time.

1006~~~
Spot on jb

1007~~~
I just so hope we will try him in his natural a bit deeper CAM position, people wouldnt expect him scoring every game but he would finally show his playmaking abilities, fantastic link up play, good eye and weight on pass and the movement off the ball, he is one of the best when it comes finding these little pockets, let lone his workrte defensively, pressing on the ball we have there only when herrera plays there, his dribbling and runs with the ball wouldnt be out of place at all whereas now when he comes from flanks everybody expects him to beat his player constantly and as a striker to score with every oportunity, hes bove average as a dribbler and goalscorer from wing nd striker position respectively but would be very good with this skillset from midfield positions... try him there, he was one of the best players for u21 England there nd mngers keep playing him from wide, its weird.

I think hes done well so far considering hes played out of position and thats a sign of good player. Who cares he will soon be 23, coquelin emerged out of nowhere at 23 yo age and hes tearing league part, playing very important role for gunners. Jesses much more experienced player than coquelin. Look at Vardy at 29. Lingard hs penty of time and great stuff from LVG who doesnt care about age. Players good enough when hes good enough no matter the age.

1008~~~
He makes things happen. His movement is relentless and he's good at timing his runs. Plus he plays on the front foot, too few of our attackers do that.

Yes, he's unpolished, but I like him. He'll turn out to be a very good squad option even if we upgrade our wingers.

1009~~~
I disagree. His output has been rather underwhelming. He does a lot off the ball, but with the ball he's not productive enough. And he loses the ball a lot

1010~~~
His movement makes things happen. The two chances he missed vs Watford were both a result of excellent timing and intelligence to run through.

1011~~~
These are runs I'd expect from an attacking player. As I said before, just making runs is not making things happen. Making things happen is an excellent use of the ball which he's lacking so far

1012~~~
He should have scored twice against Watford. He was making things happen but lacked the end product. I thought it was an encouraging performance from him and I have never rated him.

He can learn to finish if he works hard enough. Same as Chris Smalling, if he wants it bad enough he can cut out his weaknesses.

1013~~~
Huh? He's arguably been the player most likely to score in every game he's started.

1014~~~
They are runs no other attacker at United are making. His finishing was below par, but our other options haven't been much better. He creates chances with his movement, no matter if you expect it or not. Rooney for instance doesn't make those runs.

1015~~~
Yet he scored one goal only (despite several good chances recently). Neither did he create many chances during games

1016~~~
As I said, his off the ball movement is good but he needs to offer much more if he wants to become a starter. And so far, I just havent seen that

1017~~~
I guess what people are saying is that ultimately if he keeps getting into the right positions and is able to open up opposition defenses, overtime he will improve his final product and start racking up more goals and assists. This is typical of young players. However on the other hand, there is Welbeck who never managed to polish that part of his game. So let's see how Lingard progresses. But it is definitely too early to write him off already.

1018~~~
He still has time on his hands and can develop into a good player. I just dont agree with those who say he's been excellent so far

1019~~~
Wholeheartedly agree with this. Looks like he's got a bit of spark in our otherwise rigid and staccato performances. There's obviously room for improvement in certain areas of his game but that can be said of quite a few of our squad.

1020~~~
The fact he's getting in scoring positions regularly is clearly a good thing and instantly sets him apart from most of our attacking players. It's not as though he's messing up simple chances either. Most of his misses have been down to excellent saves (or hitting the woodwork) 

Anyway, considering how few games he's started a goal and an assist is a decent return for a wide midfielder. Especially playing for such a low-scoring team. He also deserves credit for his part in the winner against Watford (which won't go down as an assist)

1021~~~
We really must have low standards if we're happy when someone is in goalscoring positions nowadays. I'd expect that from all our players anyways and Lingard really should have scored against Watford.

1022~~~
Nonsense. The ability to regularly end up in goalscoring positions has always been - and will always be - a useful quality in any player, at any team.

The only reason our form as a team under Van Gaal is relevant to this discussion is because so few other players have been as persistent a goal threat as Jesse this season.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2015/2016/jesse_lingard/165/165/3837/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/anthony_martial/165/165/3926/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/wayne_rooney/165/165/73/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/juan_mata/165/165/313/38/p|premier_league/2015/2016/ander_herrera/165/165/1538/0/p#total_shots#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shots</a>

Not taking enough shots has been a persistent problem this season, specifically mentioned by Van Gaal. Then Lingard comes into the team, takes more shots than anyone else and we look much more likely to score goals than in the run of games beforehand. I suspect this isn't a coincidence.

1023~~~
It's not enough, especially if he cant take these chances then. As I said, your standards must be low since so far he has not shown more. Compare him to the other top wide players

1024~~~
Comparing him to the wide players in the side currently, he has provided what we need since he has come into the side. As for taking chances, that will come, he is actually a good finisher.
He has been a goal threat ever since he came into the side (which we were lacking)

1025~~~
Our standards surely are lower than before. If Lingard wants to become a regular starter, he needs to improve his productivity a lot. As LVG said, we need to compare our team with the other European top clubs and their wide men

1026~~~
Well, he has taken one of these chances, and looks likely to take more. It's not as if he's aimlessly pissing opportunities away - he's hit the bar four times in as many games. He's unlucky not to have scored more goals already. Most importantly, he looks more likely to score goals at the moment than most of our other attacking players.

If you want us to just buy Robben, Reus and Ronaldo, you might be supporting the wrong club. Of course everyone wants us to be up there with the top European teams, but personally I'd like to do it like a football club not a teenager playing football manager.

1027~~~
This. A perfect squad player and, as things stand, perhaps our most positive attacking player bar Martial. He could have been a scapegoat if we hadn't score at the end but it still was a very encouraging performance from him.

1028~~~
It's been a consistent tactic of rubbish posters/fans over the years, but it has become more and more prevalent this season, when everyone seems to have gone a little mad.

How anyone, let alone so many, can be so down on a youth player after 3 games, all of which he's popped up with a crucial contribution in, is beyond me.

1029~~~
Sample size far too small, for me as a new playing who has come into a side which wasn't functioning well in attack, he has done very well.
Not saying he will be a regular next sumnmer, but in terms of productivity we need to wait and see on that front I would say. Can't be judging him on that after a handful of games.

1030~~~
Initial point was that I disagree that he's been very good. He's been decent but needs to improve massively - some parts of his play are rather poor. The only difference is that he just came into the side and is young, so he has time

1031~~~
It is weird because I thought that he wasn't up to standard for Man Utd until the Watford game. Now I think he has a chance.

We don't know what goes on behind the scenes but I think the LVG really likes him. He played him in his first game in charge and is using him again. My guess is that Lingard works very hard and wants to learn.

It is the same with Rooney, LVG sees something in Rooney that he values very highly on and off the pitch that the fans don't see or that we don't understand. It is very far fetched to believe that LVG is scared of big bad Wayne and plays him out of fear.

1032~~~
Well said.

1033~~~
With young players, expecting them to be as good as world class players straight away is a sign of your own weird expecations. Nothing more. And the line of argument "We're United. We have a right to expect our players to be world class" similarly misses the point. There's no point developing young players if the standard you hold them up to within a few games of them being given a chance is impossible to meet. In the early months and years you use those performances as a guide to tell you what you might have in the future. This speaking in absolutes - "is/isn't good enough" is particularly galling with young players or managers, when anyone with an iota of common sense could tell you that progress isn't linear. 'Not being good enough now' doesn't mean you won't be in the future (though that's a general point and doesn't even relate to Lingard). It relies on hard work, relevant experience and some good luck and timing. A couple of years ago would anyone have expected Harry Kane to look like one of the best strikers in the league? Had they not hired Pochettino he probably wouldn't have gotten his chance, yet we now know he's more than capable of being a standout player at this level. Likewise, for all that Lingard isn't the finished product, he's heavily influencing the second best team (at the moment) in one the toughest leagues in the world, in one of the most tactically demanding systems which is particularly unforgiving on attacking players. All after less than a dozen games. Surely that's enough to tell us that what he needs now is time and support to see what he might become?

1034~~~
Hear hear.

1035~~~
One thing for sure, it is exciting to see when he's with the ball. In the few games he's been playing, you can see the improvement from himself, and to the team. That's considered a good performance from a youngster. 

I agreed that he still needs to improve much further to be United future regular. But the sign is very encouraging so far. Also we just try to find some excitement from this team, whereas the team perform as it is.

1036~~~
Here hear

1037~~~
Standards are low I think...

1038~~~
He is doing well, hope it continues. A young player comes into the team when we lack attacking threat and we start winning. Not sure where the critism is coming from. Hope he keeps it up and gets better too

1039~~~
I blame Moyes!

1040~~~
Great post this. Expect nothing less from you, you world class poster Brophs!

1041~~~
What a show of confidence this is for the lad and other academy players. Starting ahead of Mata in a crucial CL tie. LVG has proven he can give youth a chance if they take it.

1042~~~
Agreed, excellent post.

1043~~~
play him every game

1044~~~
by far our best player in the first half. Finally he stopped dribbling on every occasion and started playing his pass and move game, joy to watch.

1045~~~
Decent first half. Been quite sharp at times, made some decent passes, and arguably been the brightest spark in what's been a fairly meh attack so far.

1046~~~
I'm really starting to like him, his movement is tremendous he always seems to find some space in and around the penalty area.

1047~~~
Contributed well defensively as well.Bags of energy similar to Young but more fluid and positionally flexible which means much harder to defend against.

1048~~~
Seriously? He has done well but have we sunk so low!

1049~~~
it was a comment in general tbf......

1050~~~
Does a lot of things very well but misses a lot of chances.

1051~~~
Can't knock his effort, but he just doesn't seem to have the quality.

1052~~~
Welbeck-esq. Lots of good things, some great things - seems to be missing that one final key piece, for the moment at least. Hopefully he's able to develop that soon-ish.

1053~~~
He was very good in the first half, and arguably our best player. He's been terrible in the second though: seemed to disappear for a large portion of it, and then missed a superb chance when he got one. He's clearly got some talent, but he needs to improve his consistency and, obviously, his finishing.

1054~~~
Have nothing against him, but a player of his quality should not be starting games for us.

1055~~~
Everyone has been terrible in the second half.
Martial needs more time. Just becuase he cost 50m doesnt mean he cant miss chances. Yeah, he had 2 good chances to score but comparing him to Welbeck is harsh.

1056~~~
Not good enough for us. Not based on this game. He hasn't the quality or composure.

1057~~~
Was at the centre of everything in the second half. Faded in the second half, in a horrible team performance, and then missed a good chance and will no doubt be the scapegoat.

1058~~~
This might have been it for him. 23 already as well. Not going to make it.

1059~~~
How about the rest of the attacking players tonight then?

1060~~~
Should be fined a weeks' wages for that miss. 

Just unacceptable in that position.

1061~~~
Some weirdly negative comments against him. He was probably our best player and the only one regularly getting himself in good positions in front of goal. Just a shame he couldn't take one of his opportunities.

1062~~~
Won't really do it when it counts. The mark of a pussy.

1063~~~
Ffs

1064~~~
Easily our best player tonight based on the first half, because everyone was terrible in the second half. Needs to improve his finishing though.

1065~~~
He was our best player in the first half, but offered nothing in the second. I quite like him and think he's a decent talent, but he's really got to be stepping up and shining when the team looks quite poor. It's what has already made someone like Martial stand out, for example.

1066~~~
You can't have a go at him, he should not be starting games for us.

1067~~~
His finishing has been really really poor since he got into the first team. That's two really poor ones in two games, we got away with on Saturday but not tonight.

You could see the belief drain from the team when he missed that, which is pathetic I know but it's true.

He was probably our best attacker tonight which isn't saying much I know but still. That miss though, dreadful.

1068~~~
True - any fool could see he'd have been better off scoring with that shot.  I've never played the game at any decent level, and even I knew.  Has nobody told him this in training, or does he just not listen?

1069~~~
He doesn't have it at this level that's for sure. He has pace but feck all composure

1070~~~
Sorry, should have put the sarcasm disclaimer. 

But seriously, that was a pathetic miss.

1071~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yeah, him and our other 10 players.

1072~~~
Wont be playing for us in 2 seasons mentioned in match thread he will be at Norwich or WBA level

1073~~~
He's 22 with little room for improvement. Could well be sold in the summer if not a year later.

1074~~~
Can't believe the slagging he's getting tbh.  Are you all genuinely incapable of remembering more than 45 minutes ago?  Was out best player going forwards in the first half, and given that nobody did anything second half, that makes him our best player going forwards all match.

1075~~~
LVG took the credit when he scored against west brom. I wonder if he'll take the fall for the guy's shit finishing tonight?

1076~~~
Can't finish worth shit apparently. Always seemed a good finisher in the pre season friendlies he played for us and in youth teams, but he just misses chance after chance, and big chances at that.

1077~~~
He puts a mighty shift in and is capable of good play but he misses far too many great chances. That's why I've never believed him to have a long term future here. With that said though he can still hold his head up higher than most tonight, who were casually strolling about.

1078~~~
The others as well. Rooney and Memphis/ Martial was poor but he has been carrying us and is the youngest among the lot.

1079~~~
This. He's championship level at best.

1080~~~
Was great off the ball but cannot score for shit.

1081~~~
He's done this in at least three games now. 

People like Lingard and I understand why, but he isn't really cutting it. For all of the clamour, he's scored one goal. That's the same as Januzaj, a player who has played three or four games and cops a lot of stick.

1082~~~
People are being overly harsh, but the problem is that if he wants to succeed here then he's going to have to start impressing when we're not playing particularly well and he's going to have to stand out. Not too bad overall, but he still needs to be doing more.

1083~~~
Someone like Martial, who was equally quiet in the second half? I think it's harsh to have a go at a player who got himself in the right positions for our best opportunities.

1084~~~
His finishing is simply not good enough at this level.

1085~~~
Martial had a bit of a crap game, but he's consistently put in far better performance for us than Lingard since he's arrived here, and looks like a considerably better prospect. And I say that as someone who thought Lingard was probably our best attacking threat in the first half.

1086~~~
So far he's crumbled under the pressure at times.

1087~~~
Movement superb. Finishing disappointing. 

I would persist with Lingard for a while and hope he can find his scoring touch.

1088~~~
Jesse's a good lad - he has good movement and a decent touch. He's still learning and is only going to improve.

<b>BUT</b>

Until he sorts out his finishing, I cannot consider him a United-standard player.

1089~~~
these people here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> how the view of people is influenced by the end of the game and result, he was our best player today with Blind, still comments like hes not united quality and so on, fecking hell and rooney finishes the game<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> shambles caftards, go to bed, have some sleep

it almost looked like other players didnt want to use lingard in the second half nd once fellaini cme on it was game over to football

1090~~~
So what?Lingard is a late developer,has less top flight experience than Memphis or Martial.People need to stop judging players by age.Players develop at different rate.If Martial put in any sort of performance like Lingard tonight he would be praised.And it comes to someone who believe Martial will be the future world beater.

If the header went in for example this place would be exploded.Knee-jerk reactions as its best.

1091~~~
Yeah, his finishing is disappointing. It's not mark of a pussy, it's mark of a player who isn't good at finishing. 

He is easily our best attacking player since he started playing, so it's unreasonable to call him pussy when he is stepping up at everything apart from finishing even though he just started playing for first team.

1092~~~
Looked good in the first half but faded in the second. Shame about the miss but once again proved to be our most threatening attacker.

The lad is still settling in and it is way too early to be definitive with any judgements. If we are to base things on the last few games, if Lingard isn't "United quality" then no one in our attacking unit is because he has consistently outperformed them all IMO.

1093~~~
I think his performances are the most positive thing in the last few weeks. Okay he missed a chance today but he's developing nicely, he gets himself in some really dangerous positions. Once they start going in he's gonna score a fair few.

1094~~~
Stats:

4 shots.
1 on target.
2 off target.
1 blocked.
34/39 passes.
5 failed passes were mid-long range.
87.2% pass completion.
0/1 crosses.
1/3 take ons.
8 ball recoveries.
1/3 tackles.
1 interception.
1 clearance.

1095~~~
Hang on, Lingard has made 6 starts.  I just checked out MOTM threads, and he's come (in order) 7th, 2nd, 2nd, 1st, 6th, 4th.  I'd say he's been pretty consistently good for somebody so early in his career - and he's done as much as Martial recently.

1096~~~
I agree but then I remember that what we all used to say about Welbeck, it will obviously take time but if he takes too long he will be more Welbeck than Muller.

1097~~~
He's nearly 23! Martial's about three years younger than him. Granted, some players can occasionally be late bloomers, but if he doesn't really start to deliver in the next year or so then I'd be surprised if he does anything significant. Again, I like him, but in a game like tonight it was disappointing to see him start so brightly but soon fade away when the rest of the side was playing poorly.

1098~~~
He'll get slaughtered for that miss but is one of very few players who did himself justice.

1099~~~
Don't know how you can go into the Memphis thread and he's getting torn apart and it's completely different in this one. Thought Lingard was pretty awful tonight and blew the best chance of the game too.

1100~~~
He's always been a good player, and highly regarded but just wasn't up to scratch physically. Now he's still a weak player, no doubt, but he can hold his own and I think if we give him time he'll develop into a squad player.

1101~~~
Age is very much only part of the story though, experience is a big thing.  His career has been held back enough that he's effectively in the position of a 21 year-old at most.  And contrary to what all the impatient folk in here think, plenty of good players don't step up until that age.  But more to the point, he has "really started to deliver" in the few games he's had.  Your desire for him to outshine everybody else in the team in every match is just a bit extreme... I'm not claiming he's Messi.

1102~~~
You must be reading a different thread.  Certainly go back a page or two and you'll find all the Lingard hating you want.

1103~~~
He may be in the position of a 21-year old...but that doesn't prevent from the fact that he's nearly 23. Again, plenty of players do start to develop at that age, but the vast majority of top players are already very good by the age of 23 and look like top class players.

Might have exaggerated a bit with the outshining everyone else part admittedly, but my main point still stands: he was very good in the first half, but sunk into anonymity in the second. Which is disappointing when the second half was when we required him to step up.

1104~~~
One of our better players but he needs to improve his finishing, a bad miss against Watford and yet another one tonight. Martial was also wasteful and Rooney and Depay failed to get into scoring positions.

1105~~~
Yeah fair enough. The Memphis thread is nonsense though. Don't understand singling out the younger players when the experienced ones were among the worst on the pitch.

1106~~~
He got into some good positions but his finishing was poor. I thought he was our best attacker tonight, although admittedly that's not high praise.

1107~~~
Ineffetive ..... again

1108~~~
I like him like most of us, but will never be a leading player for us. Just doesn't have the clinical sharpness required for us.

1109~~~
People will have a moan because he's a academy product, but if he's good enough to start for United then people's expectations of the club have truely dropped.

He's a mid table player at best.

1110~~~
Played alright but should have scored tonight

1111~~~
Really???? so we're playing someone who isn't a squad player yet ..... but who might (despite being 23 in 2 weeks) develop into one?????

1112~~~
Agreed .... I think he'll eventually find a home, and make a reasonable living in the championship.

1113~~~
Standards have been fairly low for a while now. People are too satisfied with 'decent' and 'tried stuff'.

1114~~~
Muelensteen got valuable lesson today on player judgement. Just give him at least full season in United before hailing him English Anders Iniesta and as for Jesse he's doing not so bad under big football pressure.

1115~~~
Him starting for United says more about our quality than his, unfortunately.

1116~~~
His all round play was good tonight but he must improve his finishing. I see a few calling him a mid table player but if he is in fact a mid table player then that doesn't bode well for the rest of the team really does it when he's the only one trying out there.

1117~~~
Hate the fact that he will get slated because of the miss. But I was encouraged by his performance even today. If he manages to keep up with this level, and simultaneously improve on the final product (his luck is bound to turn around sometime), we might have a hell of player on our hands.

1118~~~
Just get used to it.With a very young forward line (plus the effy tactics) it will be frustrating to watch most of the time and people will show their impatience here.

1119~~~
Played well overall, just needs to work on his finishing. Worried we will burn him out like we did with januzaj, memphis and are doing with martial.

1120~~~
Some are just waiting for any opportunity to write him off.

1121~~~
Russell Beardsmore ..... Chris Eagles ...... Jesse Lingard ...... seen it before

1122~~~
His finishing really needs to improve. He should have scored tonight and he should have done much better with that one in the first half. 

His movement is great but he can't continue to waste golden opportunities.

1123~~~
Poor finishing but was good otherwise. He scores that chance and people praise him and he is MoTM. He did fade in the 2nd half but the whole team struggled. I like him, hopefully he can improve his finishing.

1124~~~
And the one against Watford that could've cost us. Can't blame him for the header but he should've buried the other one.

1125~~~
His finishing is crap. He's too snatchy when faced with some really easy finishes. BS dug him out of the sh*t on Saturday and he was very wasteful tonight. This is top level football and you have to take your chances but I'm really doubting his composure.

1126~~~
At best he's not ready.

1127~~~
... neverending shit comments coming, grow up people or just think a little, lets take it from the positive perspective, he ws one of the best players again in hugely undarperforming team, he wasted his chance or two but was the only one creating something, he outplayed rooney, depay and almost everyone else bar blind. Is martial slated for missing the chance as lingard is, ask yourself, let lone hes not striker.. we should have been creating dozen of those chnces dominating the game and he missed his chance and people get on top of him, if he didnt get to tht chance people would proly say he was lively and was good... fecking hell its annoying

1128~~~
It feels like he's had at least one golden chance fall to him in every match he's played. He's doing something right to get in those positions. We're all frustrated that he hasn't put those balls in the back of the net, but I'm more upset about the team. We create so few chances and have to rely on an untested academy player's finishing to advance in Europe. I think Jesse has the ability, he just needs to find the mental focus to make those scoring opportunities count.

1129~~~
I'd like him to do well, I'd like him to succeed. However if he is at the club by the start of the 2017 season I'll be amazed.

1130~~~
Difference between playing poorly and losing or winning is a team's ability to convert chances, our conversion rate last season was extremely good, which is one main reason we even made top 4. For example in the away game against Southampton we were piss poor and still won because the two half chances we had fell to one Robin Van Persie. Same with Chelsea at home when they played us off the park and we could still salvage a draw.

The chances Lingard has had are not particularly hard. He's not out there creating chances for himself or for his teammates, barely beats his man with a dribble so when he makes runs off the ball and gets into good positions, his saving grace would be to put them in the back of the net. Otherwise much better players have received far fewer chances at breaking through at United before being sold and he won't be afforded more time either.

1131~~~
So how he got into these chances were all lucky?Jesus people just don't appreciate the type of player he is.Wait until he's not on the pitch and we create feck all again then blame for "lack of service".Who were the better player that received far fewer chances?

1132~~~
He is far better than Chris Eagles.

He has consistently gotten into scoring positions and usually tested the GK. His key attribute is his intelligence. You can see that in the positions he has gotten himself with good runs. Other than Martial, few others have gotten in like he has, isn't it?

My worry as I said a day ago was that he has to take these chances when he gets them or he might slowly fade out.

Having said that I feel we can trust LVG to develop him. He has after all been getting game time ahead of Memphis and today ahead of Mata.

1133~~~
He's decent but he has to start taking his chances. Top level is cutthroat, you can start as potential but you have to become effective, and fast.

1134~~~
I said in my post that he is making the right runs which is how he's getting on the end of passes but all that would matter none if he can't convert them. Still the point remains that he is severely one dimensional going forward for a winger.

1135~~~
I think he'll take more of his chances as he is generally a strong finisher, technically solid and composed enough. But like Stoke said, I think he's too one dimensional to be more than a very useful backup winger here. 

I think Memphis will do better next season (summer off unlike much of the team, too) and if we sign a star winger, which we obviously have to, (let's call him Bareth Gale) then Gale-Memphis-Lingard-Young-Januzaj looks a solid set of wide options to me with Mata playing centrally as the 10 more (If Rooney goes, as he absolutely must) and Young hopefully getting passed by youngsters improving by the month.

1136~~~
Typical Lingard game for me. Had big discussions yesterday about him but this game was no different. He pops up here and there but doesnt produce much that really counts. Again he bottled two big chances

1137~~~
I thought he (along with Young) were the only players trying to force something to happen.

1138~~~
Yup. Rooney too, for 45 minutes anyway. Martial tried but nothing came off for him. Lingard actually made stuff happen. He usually does.

1139~~~
Very good apart from his finishing.

1140~~~
I like him, hope he gets more opportunities.
IF his finishing was better, he would be a fantastic player.

Those that watched him for the reserves/age group teams: what was his finishing like previously?

1141~~~
Only player out there that gave a shit. . He is so close inches here and there.  He is lively full of passion and has a handfull of games under his belt,  where were the big boys? Rooney,Schweini, Schneiderlin all those captains and internationals yesterday?  Jesse and Martial shouldnt be the once carrying this team.  Should have scored yesterday but so what he is not to be blamed for this. LVG and our big players should. Jesse should be starting all games for us, just start him and Young on the wings with Martial on top with Mata in the hole and we'll be fine.

1142~~~
I can't believe the shite hes getting here. He was the only bright spark in an otherwise dour game and I hope he plays our next game.

1143~~~
One of his best qualities.

1144~~~
Yeah, he's certainly got the attitude of a player you want around the club. He's always looking to do something positive. Get on the ball and run at the defence. It may not always come off, but the fact that he is trying, makes him good enough to start every game in this current state.

1145~~~
Surprised at people calling him one-dimensional. I would consider a player like Valencia one-dimensional as you pretty much know exactly what he is going to try when he gets the ball but Lingard seems to have a fair bit of variation to his game.

1146~~~
Yeah, when he does play well and manages to make thing happen he's usually quite a skilled, dynamic type of player. Not too bad on the ball, capable of some good passes etc. Just got to do that consistently though, of course.

1147~~~
The next Welbeck! (i.e. not good enough)

1148~~~
Having watched the game late last night (I recorded it), I feel like he was the only player who looked like getting us the goal we needed. And why I quite like seeing him play, I feel like Jesse Lingard right now isn't good enough to be the only player looking like he's going to score. That's probably more of an indictment of the team than him, mind.

1149~~~
It's standard Caf after a disappointing result.

1150~~~
hes not getting much of the ball but everytime he got it he was threat and our most creative player, martial should have scored... brign pereira on for fellaini and let them interchange positions and watch the concert..

1151~~~
Yeah, our best player so far. I've been a skeptic but he's been bright today.

1152~~~
Started well but faded badly, not his best game after a good run.

1153~~~
well one doesnt come right after hamstring injury to full throttle, I was actually surprised he wasnt subbed off because of that.. he did well overall 
cant see what mata adds more than him, I am staying positive about lingard, should start every game..

1154~~~
I thought he had a good first half, only Fellaini was better. 2nd half didn't notice him so much, nice pass to Martial in the move that created Fellaini's chance, then a half-chance towards the end that he put a yard wide. If he had scored a couple more goals, I'd be really pleased with his contribution but as it is, I'm not sure. His movement tends to stand out.

1155~~~
I'm really starting to quite like Lingard. While he doesn't seem to stand out in any qualities, he is solid in most of the important areas. And more importantly seems to actually be an intelligent footballer, who makes the right runs and gets in the right places, which makes him a nice pain to the opposition. Would like him to start relaxing when he gets chances though. It feels like he is snatching at them a bit in his eagerness to impress and keep himself in the team. He really just needs to calm down, and lets his abilities take care of the shoot, because from memory of the various preseasons he has been on, his finishing has always been decent before this season.

1156~~~
Someone needs to give him a bollocking on his finishes. No point playing well when you're missing good chances. 

Same goes for the rest to be fair but then again, he has been missing chances before this game.

1157~~~
Crazy thought but with our recent goal scoring record, idiots shouting attack and booing probably doesn't instill the most confidence and composure in a young player in his first year at this level.

1158~~~
He'll be alright, just like the rest of the team right now he's snatching at chances. He was a very solid finisher in the reserves and I remember he scored 4 playing up front for Birmingham a few years back.

1159~~~
Well said my man!

1160~~~
Our second best attacker but he needs to be a little less Hollywood IMO. He tries to be a bit too extravagant sometimes and he's not really gifted enough to pull it off.

1161~~~
He could have a had us top of the league. He needs to work on finishing big time. Even though he is weak he has enough pace and guile to get by. Just find some scoring boots Jesse.

1162~~~
I doubt he will get enough time to make it with us, but I really hope he does!

1163~~~
I don't see any reason why he shouldn't be given time, his finishing and first touch (at times) lets him down but that's something that can easily be worked on I'm sure.

1164~~~
He was completely invisible when shifted to the right wing. When playing on the left wing he is so much better. He's actually a fairly good dribbler, but ultimately lacks that little bit extra of top speed to get away from players - I still go back to the days of Giggs where he would dribble past a defender or two and just race away from them with the ball. We had a couple of counter attacks this match, but they slowed down because nobody carries the ball well at speed. 

It is so blatantly obvious that we need a right wing, but we don't have a single one in the squad. Valencia never plays there; Mata is at best a wide forward coming in from the right, and Lingard is clearly best from the left or centrally. Selling Nani was such a mistake when no other right winger was brought in. Ridiculous how LVG, the genius, did not see that. It's not Lingard's fault - it's not his position, nor is it Young's.

1165~~~
Thought he was poor today.  A bit better in the second half but suprised we didnt keep mata on for him.

1166~~~
Very poor today.  Couldnt keep the ball, couldnt pass it to another player.  Was in a few great positions but messed it up with no thinking.  Maybe he'll come good (like Fletch did), but he really doesn't look like a consistent starter for us.

1167~~~
Is just such a meh player. Works hard, fundamentally sound but there doesn't seem to be anything extra in his game. Still early days but I just can't see it. Him being an automatic starter at United is symbolic to our struggles in attack, not good enough.

1168~~~
I mean he is decent and at best a future squad player, but still don't understand why Januzaj is out on loan and not ahead of him.

1169~~~
Poor game.

1170~~~
Painfully mediocre on the ball.

1171~~~
Meh

1172~~~
Unlucky that his big moment was ruled out for off-side. Keeper might have saved it had Mata not been there. Overall I thought he was ok. On another day he could have scored with one of those deflected/blocked shots.

1173~~~
He could improve. I don't see why anyone thinks his useless. If we play with higher tempo and with more vibrant attacking force I believe he will shine.

1174~~~
Love him for his effort, but he just doesn't seem to have it.  SO many chances over so many games and rarely delivers.

1175~~~
Probably his least effective performance so far, nothing awful but little to do him much credit.

1176~~~
He needs to to make the difference with his eye for goal because his overall game isn't enough to keep him in the team.

1177~~~
His future is a squad player at best really.

1178~~~
What about Memphis then? Because Lingard is comfortably a better player than him currently.

1179~~~
I like him but there is a bit of a Tom Cleverley about him in, thought he was poor tonight.

1180~~~
I don't get the negativity towards him. Sure, he was a little unlucky with the ball on his foot, but he worked like a mad man up front. If anything, I was proud of the lad tonight.

1181~~~
Said it a couple of pages back. Lower prem/high championship level player.

1182~~~
Was much more dangerous on the left but he will stay on the right for now unless LVG use Young there.

1183~~~
Just like Cleverly heh

1184~~~
if we up the tempo and play him from the middle he will thrive here but hes getting stick for some of his performances while being one of our best players, he only just started his senior United career.. we need to start from midfield, what can you expect froma team who palys with basti and fellaini in midfield, thats fecking horrible, no flow and control to the game

1185~~~
Will be playing for norwich or WBA in a couple of years I guarantee it, have our standards dropped so much that we now accept painfully average youth players in the team because they're homegrown.

1186~~~
Are you suggesting the way forward is to start Jesse Lingard as our nr.10?

1187~~~
Poor final ball. I'm struggling to see what real quality he brings.

1188~~~
He just lacks that something to make it really. He's a decent, solid, average player who (like Cleverley) will find a home at a mid-lower Prem team. He just struggles to be effective.

1189~~~
He might still make it, but he's not really good enough yet to justify the amount of minutes he's getting.

1190~~~
He's done ok since he has come in but he was poor tonight. I honestly think we should be aspiring to better players than Lingard, though. He will get a free ride on here compared to others as he's a youth product and will be massively overrated for any half decent performance. He's very very average at the end of the day.

1191~~~
Not at all. And Memphis will go to be a far better player.

Lingard is alright. He's going to be a decent squad player at best. The obvious improvement that I can see that he needs to make presently is that he tends to be too gung-ho and overly direct. I mean, there's times he seems to play as if he's Neymar. Charging at players and into blind alleys.

1192~~~
Sorry but that's bs.He has received more stick than others with worse performances.

1193~~~
Not really. Memphis gets absolutely crucified as do plenty of others. Lingard will get a free ride from plenty due being a youth product.

1194~~~
hes the best as no10 or perhaps even a bit deeper as the tip of midfield three, LW or RW are only his secondary positions which he played quite well so far

1195~~~
No, due to ow expectations.

Lingard isnt wearing the famous number 7 shirt, he didnt score a bucket load of goals last season. We basically have no expectations for him really. So everything good he does is a bonus whilst everything bad is treated as 'ah well he isn't a world beater. 

A lot more is expected of Memphis.

1196~~~
Memphis has much more support on this forum despite doing worse.I think we used both of them wrongly though.It's strange because I've rarely seen Lingard on the right wing at lower levels or on loan but he seems to be used there a lot in the first team.

1197~~~
memphis was absolutely crucified because he had some incredible underwhelming performances coming also as a more acomplished guy to the team so it was deserved, lingard didnt have a bad game for us and was shortlisted as the best player of the month and it was also deserved

1198~~~
I think his lack of end product will be his downfall here.

I like the lad though. His attitude is superb, and really hope he will be a squad player for the foreseeable future.

1199~~~
Ok you have agreed with what I said but worded it your own way. Both are playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world and should be playing to a certain standard. Both were poor tonight but with Lingard it's "ah he was ok nothing special" whereas with Memphis, well, it's a hell of a lot harsher.

1200~~~
Average .... Again

1201~~~
What part of the Memphis thread did you read? Anytime I pop in, he's generally being absolutely slated. Don't get me wrong, he has his defenders too but he gets pretty awful stick. His attitude, the way he dresses etc etc, all get dragged up. I'm not saying that's right or wrong, but that's how it is. Lingard, to me is such a painfully average player. Yes, he works hard and is technically ok, but he's just not good enough. If he wasn't a youth product, you can be guaranteed he would be in for far more flack on here.

1202~~~
No chance. Memphis gets much more criticism because of much higher expectations based on his achievements in the Dutch league.

1203~~~
He's a much more intelligent player than someone like Memphis who is a more naturally gifted footballer on the other hand.Both of them will have roles in the team.I repeat that I don't think we have seen the best of Lingard yet, just like Memphis.

About the Memphis thread, just check after that 20 min encouraging cameo to see the amount of hype he got.I agree that he's been slated unfairly when he did not perform but on rare occasions he did he's been overrated as well.

1204~~~
Well we definitely haven't seen the best of Memphis, despite the fact that many have written him off already, there surely must be more to come. I'm just not convinced by Lingard but only time will tell.

1205~~~
Almost nobody is writing Memphis off. People are loudly voicing their frustrations with him but they're always phrased in a way that suggests it's only a temporary thing and it's just a matter of time before he becomes a world beater. It's exactly the opposite with Lingard. Even when people praise him for a good performance, the wording is overly cautious and there's one inevitable "at the end of the day though... he's a squad player" or something of the sort. I don't prefer one over the other but it's clear that they are treated differently because people want to see them differently. Truth is, they're not far off each other as of right now.

1206~~~
I'm sorry but this is far from the truth. Read through 5/6 pages of his thread and you'll be surprised. I've read on here tonight that he's a "fraud". There is a small minority completely writing him off. 

As for the rest of your post, I don't particularly care that they are treated differently. My point is that Lingard will always get a relatively free ride in comparison to others due to being a youth team product.

1207~~~
Lingard is getting a free ride? He is written off after every match, even the ones where he does good and is one of our best players. Half the posts in this thread are about how he is a Championship or lower PL level player no matter how he actually performs. If totally writing off a players career is giving him a free ride then sure Lingard is getting a free ride.

1208~~~
Better and more consistent at a young age does not mean more potential in any way. Just look at Pereira vs Pearson and the others a few years ago. Pereira only showed his class now and then, but the others were a lot more consistent. They don't have anywhere close to the potential Pereira has. With youngsters, you're looking for those moments of class and what they are capable of doing if they put it all together and did it consistently. Lingard is pretty good with everything, but there's nothing really that jumps out at you and you think that he could be some player. He'll improve of course, and I'm really happy with how he's done since he came in, but I don't think he'll be much more then squad player/upper mid table level if he wants to start and be a key player.

1209~~~
I definitely think he can be a good squad player here, his versatility should see to that.

1210~~~
I won't say that he's the new Cleverley, but I will say that he's the new Tom Cleverley... errrrr

Well, I don't see anything great in this lad to be honest. He's quick ok, so does 80% of footballers. 

He's good in his crossing ? No
He's good in one vs one ? No

Except from running he's not that great, and I'm sorry but he doesn't have half the potential Martial has. Jesse seems to be a nice boy but LVG is only playing him because we've nobody else to play, and that shows how our squad is weak.

Scholesy said yesterday that the squad is average, but this is true. Arsenal has Sanchez on the wing, Chelsea has Hazard, City has De Bruyne, and we do have Lingard.... It just shows how far we are from a top squad. I can't compare with other teams, but even Everton, Leicester or Spurs have better wingers than us, but we still stick with Lingard, thinking that he will be world class just because he's from our so famous Academy. We hope this romance will be good but it won't !!!

Jesse just doesn't produce enough to be a regular in our team, and relying on an average player like him just shows that. We're really tough with Memphis, but he produces more cross, dribbles and he tries to beat mens (he fails a lot too), but Jesse doesn't. 

LVG is just trying to fool us with these kids, playing on our affect (I play the kids from our academy), but he deserves to be criticised because he's rubbish. 

We love and then destroyed Cleverley and Welbeck for the same reason. Only good PL players that's all, and Jesse comes from the same environment, and will be an average player.

LVG this idiot should revert to the 4-1-4-1 he used last year with Young and Mata wide that's all matter, and Lingard should only play bit of games or FA Cup games

1211~~~
Why is he starting ahead of Young? Young was good last season.

1212~~~
Because starting Young who is an obvious choice won't make Louis a great genius. Starting unexpected player could.

1213~~~
Yes last season, but has been incredibly average this season. Lingard has been a breath of fresh air since starting. 

Also, some of the reactions are a bit over the top. First everyone seemed to be pleased we play homegrown players, now, Van Gaal's biggest mistake is playing the likes of Lingard. Fergie played average/squad players too, he even started them in big games. Lingard is not the problem here.

1214~~~
Only in about 2 games. He's been poor after that.

1215~~~
Nah most people just plod along saying Lingard has done ok etc. Memphis gets absolutely torn apart as do the likes of Fellaini. Being called a midtable PL player is hardly the same as the abuse that the likes of Menphis gets. The truth is, Lingard doesn't look a top player. As I already stipulated, there are of course mitigating factors why some players will get more stick than others; how much they cost, what's expected of them etc. I feel the likes of Lingard are free to coast along and not get half as much flack as others get. 

I mean, he looks a relatively decent player but we badly need an upgrade. I would have no issues keeping him as a squad player for a season or so to see how he fares but I can't get giddy like some do about the fact that he's a youth team player. I'm all for playing youth and it's great when genuine talent comes out of our academy, but I feel LvG is playing certain youngsters in the hope they will come good as opposed to them having any outstanding qualities. If you're happy with players like Lingard staring, then fair enough. I think it's just indicative of how piss poor our attack is.

1216~~~
I agree, but he has been arguably better than Young. Not saying he is an ideal player on that right wing, but I don't think the game would have changed much had Young played. Sure, with performances like these Lingard will see the bench again, but I doubt that will really change anything in terms of our results, unfortunately. If a right winger is available in January, we should absolutely go for him, and Lingard will have to prove himself if he ever wants to start for his boyhood club again.

1217~~~
Hope I'm proved wrong but I don't think he is going to make it as a regular starter for us for the next 4-5 seasons at least. I haven't seen anything too great from him as yet that makes you go 'WOW!' like Martial, then again neither has Memphis done much.

I know Fergie said he won't be ready for the first team till he is 22/23 because of his frame but you would think he would at least by the age of 23 be pretty solid in other aspects of this game, like passing or scoring but he isn't. He is quick but not rapidly quick, still too lightweight and makes a lot of wrong decisions.

I will judge him at the end of the season (if he plays regular that is as he needs games to improve) and decide if he is good enough to be a starting player. I hope he makes it because he has United blood running through his veins but if a better player is available in the market then we should go for them as we really are now playing catch up with other major European clubs and we need players who could delivery now. We already have plenty of young players who I believe would provide the backbone for our future but lack quality/world-class players for the present.

1218~~~
I think in a few years we will look back and laugh that this guy was playing for us. Even Luke Chadwick played a Champions League semi final.

1219~~~
It's a very valid question as to why LVG would start Lingard on the right over Young. 
Areas I'd rate Lingard over Young: 
-More likely to get carded at a bar
...

Erm. 

Young is as fast, as enthusiastic, has a year playing defensively under his belt, works as hard and also seems a solid bloke. 
That ignores the fact Young can beat a man, can cross, can score, can provide assists and is actually really useful on set pieces too. 

Thinking about it, other than another card in the 'LVG trusts youth!' hand that is about all Louis has left, I can't think of a single reason.

1220~~~
The only disappointment is that he's not taken the chances that have come his way. He will improve but it's not easy for any kid to come into this team. This is a real transition. Our squad is so young it's almost absurd but in 2-3 years you never know. Jesse is the least of our problems.

1221~~~
We tend to do this with all players, I feel sorry for him. We really should be rotating him, Pereira, Januzaj to keep them all fresh, hungry whilst rewarding goals / assists / performances etc. Hes 22 which is nowhere near prime age (Messi, Ronaldo, Rooney types kinda spoilt that for most). He should not be playing every minute of every game or anywhere close to that esp if this is his breakout season.

BTW, we did the same to Januzaj. He was breath of fresh air, then it seemed we relied on him too much, he got frustrated, which frustrated fans, and then he was out of the team. Its mad management imo.

1222~~~
Lingards movement is much, much better. Young will just hug the touch line for the chance to cross or cut inside to shoot, Lingard often pops up instead between the midfield and defense, you don't get that from Young when he plays wide.

1223~~~
I didn't mention anything about Young but I agree with you that Lingards movement is much better than his, it's no fluke that Lingard pops up in very good goalscoring positions, he just needs to take them chances given to him more often, considering we do not create much in a game <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Maybe I am being harsh, maybe if he was playing in a side which would create a minimum of 8 or 9 chances a game instead of 3 or 4, he would score more and obtain more confidence in front of goal from scoring. ATM I feel since we create so little, the players feel nervous when given a chances because they may feel they won't get another that game, so panic a little in the process.

1224~~~
Sorry chap that was meant for <a class="username" data-user="51769, @Beachryan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51769/">@Beachryan</a> 

For your post though I do agree with you, he's currently a little wasteful which is odd because composure in front of goal has always been one of Lingards biggest strengths. There's so much pressure on everyone at the club at the moment and for Lingard it's no different.

1225~~~
Any word on his injury? I noticed he was in the dugout for the 2nd half.

1226~~~
Looked like a minor hamstring IMO. Probably 2-3 weeks out. Unless it was really minor/precautionary.

1227~~~
I agree, pretty much all our players are not playing with full freedom and it seems fear is creeping into them <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Therefore it is hard to tell if the players are just not good enough to play for United or is it to do with them being restricted with what they can do and the fear factor of making a mistake, incase you are then dropped by LVG. Unless you are Mr Rooney of course <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

1228~~~
I swear he just came back from an hamstring injury as well? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1229~~~
I agree completely.

1230~~~
A decent video of his best moments from recent run in the team. Ignoring his age and accepting these re his first steps in football, for me composure is an issue that will be eroded by experience.

Hopefully he can come back in and get more opportunities now

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MEoTyQdRxbI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1231~~~
Such an intelligent player. Wasnt great when he come on, but he makes such dangerous runs, which really threatens teams. Got in behind Sheff Utds defence a few times when he come on.

1232~~~
Looked lively and as Walters said he made some good runs, he understands the wide forward role movement-wise better than Martial or Memphis IMO.

1233~~~
Memphis made plenty of those runs at the start of the season, in particular against Club Brugge at Old Trafford. You can understand his reluctance to now given that a long pass like the ones made to Lingard tend only to happen when we're really chasing a goal.

1234~~~
As I always say  kids from our academy are so much better than the seniors in terms of off the ball movement

1235~~~
Isn't no where near the standard we require. Would he get near the Arsenal City or Chelsea 11? I'm not sure he'd even get stripped. We need better nice little player though and will have an Eagles, Brady type career.

1236~~~
I don't particularly rate him but he's one of the best options on the wing right now in terms of giving the team movement. Say's a lot about our first team players attacking performances.

1237~~~
The way chelsea are playing at the moment, they'd take anything.

1238~~~
Get him on for the next game.Memphis as well but he's generally terrible whenever he starts a game so might be better to use him as a super sub at the moment.

1239~~~
I'm sure Hazard Pedro and Willian would still play before Jesse.

1240~~~
He is decent and Could be a useful squad player but he at least tries to take people on and be positive and that makes him stand out in this current side, I would pick over mata at the moment.

1241~~~
I've just remembered that when I went to see United reserves play Shrewsbury in a friendly game, someone whacked the ball into the stands during the warm up and almost hit me in the face (it was only my ninja reflexes that saved me). The culprit pointed and laughed. It was Lingard.

Sell him.

1242~~~
Yes he does try to take people on and be positive. But he is limited as of now and a little bit brainless.

1243~~~
But only Willian is playing well out of them.

1244~~~
I wouldn't want Lingard though.

1245~~~
we need dimaria and falcao, maybe buy the best goalscorer from the dutch league, the new ronaldo.. Comparing Brady to Eagles is stupid, Brady's much better footballer and will be if he doesn't suffer from injuries like he did so far.. We gave Lingard chances over last months or so and he tok them and showed he's more capable then Mata/Rooney etc it's fecking annoying and stupid to write him off just yet especially when everybody's struggling, he will be much better in better, more aggressive system and of course if he played at his position, so far he got chances only on the wings, so critisizing a player for coming new into senior team and for being one of the brightest and actually one of the best players is not only harsh but pathetic.

I know I know, you're only judging his potential, but whats potential without reaching it, we bought Verons, Andersons, Klebersons but they for some reason weren't able to transform their ability and potential into MUFC quality performances, lets buy another player like that, so far Lingard hasnt shown he would miss anything on depay in terms of performances..  and he just came back from hamstring injury, unlike Depay who was fit but simply not good enough to start. I aggree we need to reinforce but Lingard is a great little player and if he is nowhere near the standard we require than we should sell another 20 player who were worse despite being much more experienced, overhyped and bigger stars so much "needed"

he's certainly the least of our problems...

1246~~~
The problem with bringing through youngsters, especially attackers, at the moment is that our attack is complete shit. It's possibly the worst environment for grooming a youngster because as things go downhill, impatience and pressure will invariably be directed to the youngsters as well.

Ideally, you'd love to blood a couple of youngsters in a functioning team - with a strong spine and in-form senior players who can be an example to them & make their life on the pitch much easier. Currently, we lack almost all of the above. & it's a nightmare scenario for promising youngsters to step into. 

Personally, I'd love for Lingard to make it at United - but I don't see his standout qualities. He's got good movement and an eye for a goal. At best, I can see him as a great squad option. Though, obviously, I hope I'm wrong!

1247~~~
Yeah you would <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1248~~~
He isn't the most talented, but still he adds movement, desire and hard Work. Alone for those three attributes i would have him in the team at the moment.

1249~~~
He gave more speed on the right than Mata.  He may not be a World beater but at least he gives a performance that is at least worthy to the team.

1250~~~
Firstly not sure Brady is much better than Eagles but that is your opinion but I think your under rating Eagles. Secondly I'll stand by what I say Lindergard is not of the standard we require, there is no way at this stage of his career he should be starting 10-11 games for Manchester United in a row. Not even Ronaldo got that much exposure. We bought Di Maria and loaned Falcao as they were world class players so not sure where you going with that one. Are you suggesting Jesse is better? Nani is a better player than Jesse and we got rid of him. We should have an established player in every position and the players with potential like Depay Martial McNair Adnan Jesse Wison Etc should all be dipped in and out the team. They haven't got the senior pros around them, we are actually not blooding them as they are pulling up trees. We are relying on them to get results and that's not right and in my opinion Jesse is not of the standard we need.

1251~~~
No, he is average.

1252~~~
How did Ronaldo "not get this much exposure"? 

Lingard is 22. At that stage Ronaldo was getting 50 games a season. He's not as good, of course, but he's ready to prove himself. 

I'm pretty sure he hasn't had 10-11 starts in a row either.

1253~~~
Agree with that, but it's not Lingard's fault that he is the only palyer with Martial who can do something and create for the team, My suggestion is that befroe we look elsewhere we should give chance to our players we already have, we bought dimaria and he was total shit, like absolute, with no attitude - ie jesse lingard was better for us so far, people with stats will come crazy now..  hope that Lindergard was just a joke. Lingard should not be no1 option ten games in a row that we agree on but if we judge players according their actual performances we should get rid of Mata, Depay, Rooney and other 10 players before Lingard, he's the least of our problems and can develop in a great palyer and I repeat for like twentieth time, he's not winger but some people will never understand and will judge him by performances there and he's done pretty good despite that it's not his position, ppl are expecting too much and once a player plays a bad game, doesn't do enough than people are all over him. So tell me what the hell is Mata doing here, what did he do to play 10 games actually can be even more in a row with the worst player in our team Rooney. People should shut up about Lingard ability cuz he just come to the team and outperformed players who should be leading us to better play and results. #annoying

1254~~~
In his first season Ronaldo wasn't being as relied on as much as Lingard doesn't matter age this is Jesse break through season.

1255~~~
Stop being so much of a drama queen, I am saying Jesse should not be starting week in week out for United. You agree on this? We need to buy better than Jesse Lingard that's for sure. If he becomes a good squad player then great but week in week out first team player not from what I've seen so far. If that's not his position and he plays elsewhere then he like Mata will still be judged on current performances within the team. And by the way that's no great slight on Jesse there is no way he should be a consistent starter at this stage.

1256~~~
I agree. He lacks end product and intelligence. I doubt he'll make it here

1257~~~
You must be joking.That's his main forte.And most of the young players lack end product in their first breakthrough season.You can argue that he's a limited dribbler and creative passer though.

1258~~~
Of course age matters. There's a difference between a 22-year old breaking through and an 18-year old breaking through.

1259~~~
Yep I agree that's what I was getting at!

1260~~~
Too often he runs into positions where he cant do anything anymore. He's got good off the ball movement but that's not football intelligence

1261~~~
Get in! Nice play.

1262~~~
Solid Dab technique

1263~~~
Great goal.

1264~~~
Good finish.

1265~~~
another good performance by Jesse, lovely player<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1266~~~
Nice finish, but he'd been very quiet until then and was lucky not to have given away a penalty.

1267~~~
Agree but the difference without Mata in the team is night and day.

1268~~~
needs to sort his head out for goal celebrations, he can walk home for that

1269~~~
Great finish. He's not been top class by any means, but the energy and running off the ball is making a difference, in my opinion. We've missed him.

1270~~~
Meh, I wouldn't have said so until his goal. He was utterly anonymous in the early stages; the exact problem we say that Mata has. His goal was well taken though, and we might have not seen that same sort of run in the lead-up to it from Mata.

1271~~~
I'm always sceptical whether a megs finish is intentional.

1272~~~
He offers pace Cheesy as opposed to Mata who is snail like and congests our attacks!

1273~~~
Of course it is

1274~~~
Well, yeah, he offers pace when he's actually involved in the game...which I'll give him credit for with the goal. He'd offered little before that though, apart from nearly giving away a penalty.

1275~~~
Hard to tell, but he did the right thing in opening up his body and hitting it the way he did. Could have been intentional or he might have wanted it to go outside the keeper, doesn't matter as it went in!

1276~~~
Oh. Well that's that then.

1277~~~
It was the opening of his body that made me wonder whether he was going for the far corner. Perhaps that was an intentional dummy to throw the keeper, we'll never know. As you say, as long as it hits the back of the net <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1278~~~
I think it's astonishing the lack of credit this kid gets from the majority of posters here. 

It seems that if your a local lad, you are made to prove a lot more to merit starting for United than big money foreign transfers.

1279~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> don't knock the dab

1280~~~
Yep agreed

1281~~~
Lol I guess so but you did ask

1282~~~
That's why he's the next Welbeck. Wasteful as feck.

1283~~~
Pathetic miss .  A sitter and the potential match winner.  Am livid.

1284~~~
Dreadful miss there, utterly criminal.

1285~~~
i'm sure sssssnake will have something important to say about that lingard miss.

1286~~~
Pure inexperience. Head and knee over the ball man! Infuriating.

1287~~~
Horrible miss. Great build-up play.

1288~~~
Took his goal well, but generally his finishing is terrible, gets in the right positions but that's pointless if you don't finish. Let's hope that awful miss doesn't cost us.

1289~~~
How do professional footballers, who have been training with the best since they were 12 years old mess up such a chance?  I just don't get it.

Hitting the target in such a chance is surely mandatory for even progressing into the U18s!!!!

1290~~~
It's not just one either, he's missed a fair few sitters this season.

1291~~~
Lucky with his first, through the keepers legs(I personally don't think he mean't it) and then that miss. 

In his defence he's still young and we shouldn't be in a position where we're depending upon him.

1292~~~
I know he scored but in general his finishing is fecking terrible. 

He makes Danny Welbeck look clinical

1293~~~
Dont celebrate like youre fecking Messi when youre awful at finishing 100% chances

1294~~~
I can think of another striker who used to play for the club who was shipped out after a horrible miss. He's lighting up the Bundesliga with goals right now.

Lingard's finishing is a weak spot, but I hate to see the manager's reaction and the substitution after this one. He does contribute to the team and I'm not ready to dismiss him because he hasn't put away a few quality chances that would have helped us win.

1295~~~
Twat.

1296~~~
That's just nonsense.

1297~~~
He scores that, we win.

1298~~~
Really, really didn't like that from LVG.

He didn't miss it on purpose, why punish him by subbing him off?

1299~~~
Job on the line most likely.

1300~~~
Van Gaal is going to hang him out for dry if we don't win this. It's quite sad actually.

1301~~~
His miss was just as crucial as Fellaini's, he's been guilty of a fair few glaring misses this season.

1302~~~
Lost count of the amount of sitters he's missed this season.

1303~~~
Really you think a player of his finishing calibre placed it between the keepers legs. Mmmmm....

1304~~~
Awful awful miss.

He also badly needs to add some upper body strength.

1305~~~
Game sums up the best and worst of Lingard.

1306~~~
that's why ive no problem with LVGs reaction

1307~~~
Who has a problem? 

That was my reaction.....That and throwing random insults into the mix

1308~~~
Yes because I have eyes.

1309~~~
Great goal, horrible miss. Interesting to see how his confidence will be after that.

1310~~~
see above

1311~~~
He summed up a young player's performance all in one. 

Lovely touches, energy and finish at times. Poor touches, decisions and finishes at others.

Still prefer him to Januzaj.

1312~~~
OK!!

1313~~~
his first touch is awful, even Macheda had better first touch <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1314~~~
Good movement off the ball and took his goal well, but LvG is gonna roast his nuts for that miss, don't think I've seen him so animated on our bench.

1315~~~
Did that big miss make you question whether he really meant to meg him? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1316~~~
It was a horrible miss. Not the first time either.

1317~~~
Had a good game, shame about the miss but it happens.....he wasnt the only one that missed a good chance. Rooney missed 1v1 in the first half, Fellaini missed a great chance, Rooney cant go past Coloccini in tons of space where he has an open way to the goal(not a dig on Rooney, was a MOTM). 
We didnt win the game because of Jesse, not because he missed a good chance but because we were weaker side after he went out, he shut down Janmaat for 60 or how many minutes he played and after he went out, Janmaat started playing like fecking Maicon and Newcastle looked a much better side going forward.

1318~~~
still better than Mata, should have scored thats for sure, but so should rooney on twice occasions and fellaini which ones was a bigger sitter for me.. in addition to lingard you could see this passage of game when we were combining really well when he got to the middle of the park and close to herrera, thats what is his strength but we are still using him as winger, he's best at looking for those little pockets and havign one twos with palyers and to make eventually a run into box but we are far from synce with how he palys so unfortunately he's only recognized as a youngish winger who likes to run and always scores and always miss, he's much more than that

1319~~~
He's a bit too shit for us.

1320~~~
Lol nope I just now that if you are coming in from angle then through the legs are always an option

1321~~~
The miss was bad but he at least offered pace and a willingness to go forward. Shame he'll likely be benched for the foreseeable future now.

1322~~~
He pops up with a nice goal at times, but really he's just not that good.

1323~~~
Decent squad player at best. Long term, probably has no future here. But hey, he's from the academy so it's a Caf rule that we pretend he's ace. Good finish for the goal, awful miss after that and didn't do much for the rest of the game.

1324~~~
That sounds like you're doing an impression of LVG

1325~~~
I think he puts too much emphasis in placing his shot rather than putting a bit of power behind it, his miss was horrendous

1326~~~
I've I done that I would have just scrolled process in my notes!

1327~~~
Poor again for me

1328~~~
He's frustrating. .

1329~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1330~~~
Terrible performance. He also seems to miss a lot of sitters.

I don't think he's any good.

1331~~~
Rio seems to rate him

1332~~~
We looked better when Memphis came on. I don't think Lingard will make it here and we shouldn't be playing him

1333~~~
I'm still angry at him for that miss.  It's sheer incompetence.

1334~~~
Did well for his goal, obviously an atrocious miss but I felt sorry for him getting hooked straight after. Can't do much for confidence. Memphis replacing him highlighted the job he did defensively which I think is being overlooked by some. Not sure he'll be here for many seasons to come but he's okay back up for now.

1335~~~
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that's saying it bluntly.

1336~~~
I don't think it's a shame at all.  Only thing he has going for him is that he is fast and was born close to Manchester.

He is behind the likes of Welbeck and Nani at this age.  Not good enough.

1337~~~
are you also angry on Rooney and Fellaini?

1338~~~
His great quality is his movement off the ball, which can be key if he can finally improve his finishing.

1339~~~
Said it in the match thread: he tries really hard and gives us some much needed enthusiasm but he's not good enough for the long-term.

1340~~~
Rooney's miss was bad, but not to the same degree of Lingard's and Fellaini's ... they were bonafide sitters.

1341~~~
Some really harsh comments on here, he played well and gave us good width down the left hand side, that totally changed when van Gaal got annoyed about him missing that chance (which to be fair happens to everyone) and decided to replace him with Depay. I just hope this doesn't dent the lads confidence because it was a really unfair substitution.

1342~~~
Great goal. Awful miss.

1343~~~
I don't think he was subbed because of the miss. He's a confident lad and took his goal well. The miss was a player trying to be too precise. Just focus on hitting the target and more often then not it goes in. Maybe he should have killed it before taking the shot on. It's not the worst miss I've ever seen but you have to score these chances and we've been missing them most of the season.

1344~~~
He gets in really good positions... Him and Fellaini seem to miss a sitter every game they play. He does seem talented, but at the same time, I don't think he'll ever be good enough. Just more a neat and tidy player.

1345~~~
His finishing is a weakness, he has missed some really important chances this season and before he game today my brother even said watch Lingard miss a big chance. He actually said the same about Fellaini too.

1346~~~
I think he's just unfortunate that he's in a team, where you've a number of players looking to establish themselves. At the minute we need players, that have been there done it and got the t shirt. His goal should have got us the three points. People will talk about the miss but we defended like wankers and that only highlights the missed chances.

1347~~~
We're much better when he's in the side. Pace and movement. 

Great finish. 

Costly miss yet again.

1348~~~
Nice little player but should be nowhere near Uniteds starting 11. The fact he is tells us exactly where we are at just now! Mane would be such an upgrade, the fact we haven't signed him looks to me like LVG is a dead man walking.

1349~~~
He most likely was subbed off because he hasn't played a full match in over a month, not because LvG wanted to take revenge I assume.

I was surprised with how well he played actually. Of course I understand the negativity because of his miss, but he did a good job tonight. Looked lively, scored a good goal, set up Rooney for that chance with a perfectly weighted pass in the first half too. Would put the miss down to some fatigue and maybe inexperience. If he can maintain this level of play he's definitely an asset.

1350~~~
He's interesting as a player. Really good finish (but not sure if he meant it) for the first goal. The miss was bad and the kind of one you just knew would come back to hurt us. The same with Fellaini's. He was decent though I thought. Gives us something different from Mata. If you could give Mata Jesse's athleticism or give Jesse Mata's technical ability there would be a good player.

1351~~~
Based on the players that we have right now, Lingard is our biggest attacking threat outside of Martial and Rooney (dubious in itself). He may have missed chances but is one of the few consistently getting in a position to score. Some may say that it is pointless to get chances if you are going to miss them but it is a damn sight better to have a player that gets regular chances, but only scores 1 in 5 of them, than it is to have players that simply don't get the chances in the first place. He is in the right too often for it to be considered luck.

Mata hasn't been truly effective in over two months, Memphis is blowing hot and cold and we don't really have too many options beyond that. Maybe what we see is Lingard's top level and he isn't a first team player for the future, maybe he settles and can raise his game. As things stand it doesn't matter, I'd have him in the team, not only for his threat but because I think he has looked better there than any of his potential replacements have recently.

1352~~~
It's his second shocking miss of the season. He should be a squad player at best at this point.

1353~~~
His finishing needs to be improved for sure but he has a lot of time to grow his game being a late bloomer as contrast to what some on here believe.

1354~~~
the funny thing is he is actually a good finisher, its probably mental issue....pressure and nerves.

1355~~~
Awful miss but offer something most of the players don't which is off ball running. Should keep him as options from the bench rather than being automatic first eleven. Still have hope Memphis would improve and make that LW position his. Lingard has the better discipline defensively though.

1356~~~
Bad miss but the finish for his goal was actually brilliant.

1357~~~
Not the first time his finishing's cost us a game. We need someone better. And I say this as someone who likes seeing our youth teamers promoted.

1358~~~
This 'late bloomer' stuff is clutching at straws. Late bloomers who make it at top clubs are generally an anomaly as opposed to the norm. Lingard is now 23 and I just don't see it with him at all. He's so physically weak and is painfully average. I think he could forge a decent career at a lower PL team but he's not and never will be a top player (IMO). We need much better than Lingard and I'll be shocked if he's still with us in 2 years time.

1359~~~
Lingard isn't going to make it here long term but I don't think he was particularly bad yesterday, if you ignore the obvious sitter. Of course he should've scored that, but the goal was well taken and he was reasonably good at tracking back. We were noticeably worse defensively once Memphis came on.

He shouldn't really be a starter here but I think I'd prefer him to Mata, who is nearly always anonymous.

1360~~~
People slating him need to do one, he was quality last night the amount of running he did was immense. He scored a lovely goal and almost assisted Rooney in the first half, OK he fluffed his lines for a second goal but he had a very good game and will only improve.

1361~~~
People are focusing too much on the miss, apart for that he was pretty good, he's direct and likes to run behind defences, something we have been missing, Martial is the only other player we have that does this.

1362~~~
He wasn't 'quality'. He was very average and has been since he came into the first team. He took his goal well but overall he is not good enough for a team 'supposedly' challenging for Top 4.

1363~~~
Good game, looks better and better every time I see him.  Very positive with his movement and passing.  Couldnt ask for more from a young lad really.

1364~~~
He's not as technically talented as someone like Memphis but he does a lot of very good work off the ball and makes our attack a lot more exciting and penetrating. I like him but not sure he will be a starter long term, very happy with him playing games at the moment though.

1365~~~
Should be rotated with Memphis quite a bit imo (or both played). Nothing wrong with that as it keeps them both fresh this season. Took his goal well (his run to get into that position was great)

Shame about the miss, and yeah, hes missed a few chances this season so far, but its also nice to see him getting into those positions. Defo needs to improve on that aspect but his off the ball running is lovely.

1366~~~
Strangely polarising player it seems from the comments on here. I think he's great personally.

1367~~~
I like him, he's direct and seems to link up well with the other attacking players. However, his uncanny ability to fluff excellent goal scoring opportunities shouldn't be ignored. Needs to sharpen up on his composure if he wants to make it here.

1368~~~
I like him and think he's been good when given the chance.
People slating him for that miss must have only just started watching football. There have been plenty of occasions that has happened to players with much more illustrious reputations.  I've seen Rooney, Scholes,  Pirlo,  Shearer and Gibson do the same in that position. I've even seen some miss the ball completely.
Anyone would think he missed with a stationary ball from 12 yards out.

1369~~~
What you mean like half our team have done in penalty shootout the last few years?

1370~~~
I also don't think he was taken off for missing the chance (if that were the case, Fellaini would never play for us..). If anything, LVG probably prefers him to Memphis because of his defensive work, and we all know Darmian needed the help yesterday. It was almost certainly a matter of fatigue, in his first start back from injury.

1371~~~
If the cap fits.....

1372~~~
He'll never be a world beater, but i think he has a role at United somewhere. He's consistently looked one of our more dangerous players. Maybe it's just the fact that we've been bereft of things to get excited about going forward, but he always sticks out for me.

1373~~~
I would say he is easily our second best attacking player this season. He didn't play that much as others though, but his level of performances is clearly second best IMO, only behind Martial(from forwards).

I think he has a good chance of being at least good squad player in years to come.

1374~~~
I don't think he will make it here personally.

1375~~~
Better than what Mata has been serving up for 2 months. Has Mata even got a shot on target since his last goal? 

The miss was bad but he gets into positions to score, works hard and is generally more positive than Mata and Depay lately.

He wont be a star here but a nice squad player he could be and there is nothing wrong with that. 

We must buy a world class forward. Producing them is just too big an ask at this time.

1376~~~
With all his limitations. The lad is way better than what Mata was doing the last few games.

1377~~~
Clutching at straws? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Did I say the same about other former youth players? I think I have a pretty good idea about which stage of development he's at having watched him for about 5-6 years. He's a late bloomer, that's not even an opinion but a fact. Who care if late bloomer at top clubs are anomaly? Obviously him being late bloomer isn't equivalent with "he will be good" but talking about him like a normal 23 years old players is really lacking of context. I don't even predict his future ceiling. He's doing a decent job at the moment and have a lot of rooms for improvement, that's all I know and care about. We might become a super club again after 2-3 years and he might be let go to Stoke by then, if that happens then great for us.

1378~~~
No idea what the green smiley is for. Great, you think he's a "late bloomer" - I personally think he's a limited footballer. He's grand at the moment because we are so poor, but long term, we need so much better. He will be 24 at the midpoint of next season and he has just about managed over 60 professional appearances to-date, with most being in the Championship. I still think it's clutching at straws. 

This "late bloomer" crap gets thrown around far too often and the usual suspects like Costa and Drogba get branded about even though they are clear anomalies. Lingard hasn't shown anything so far to suggest he's good enough for us.

1379~~~
I don't think you really get what "late bloomer" means, it simply means he's has a same stage of development as players who are few years younger than him due to reasons like late physical development or mental age or other reasons.It has nothing to do with whether he will be good enough or not.Lingard has always been a small lad since his young age so the club has had to be more patient with his development than other lads.

1380~~~
No, I fully understand the term "late bloomer". It's really not very complex. I still believe that Lingard is a limited player that is playing because of a dearth of attacking options in our squad and players being massively out of form. He's done an ok job, mind, but nothing more than ok. 

As for 'player development' - yeah naturally enough I wouldn't have a massive insight on how it works; with the coaching side of things etc. I would know as much as you or any other armchair fan.

1381~~~
Nah, I'm sure you don't understand judging from your post.I will stop wasting my time anyway.Carry on with your own idea.

1382~~~
Nope, it's very obvious. You're just being purposely obtuse because I don't agree with your assertion.

1383~~~
What's my assertion?I said he's a late bloomer so still very far from anywhere near his peak.Then you keep going on with how he has made only that much appearances despite being a 23 years old and is a limited player.Clearly you interpreted my post as if I claimed he will be a top player in the future or United first team regular long-term.I did not say anything of sort.I usually don't want to talk about what will happen 3-5 years down the road.We are not even sure if we're still a top club by then.

1384~~~
Well, first of all, I never said you said "anything of a sort". You came at me all guns blazing because of how you interpited my original post. Secondly, that post wasn't actually specifically attributed to you. It was more a general post. The term "late bloomer" is just another football cliche that gets thrown around and the whole Drogba comarison gets brought up. It's been done to death.

I personally think you're being extremely pedantic over the phrase "late bloomer" and you're kind of delving into semantics. The phrase is kind of hard to take out of context. I never gave my direct translation of the phrase. If you had bothered to read and understand my post, you would see that I disagree with Lingard being a "late bloomer". You're the one claiming to have superior knowledge on the player, not me.

I'm of the opinion that this isn't some late bloomer who is starting to flourish in his twenties. I'm of the opinion that he is a limited player that is only playing because of mitigating circumstances - not because it's some divine plan to introduce this "late bloomer" to the world. That's why - again all my opinion - he hasn't exactly set the footballing world alight, or really done much despite being 23. He was unlucky with his injury last season, but that happens. He had one memorable game on loan at Birmingham but at Derby last season, I found him underwhelming when I watched them play and Ince looked miles ahead of Jese (yes I'm aware they have different styles of play).

So you see, I'm not debating the terminology of the late bloomer phrase; I'm disagreeing with the assertion that he is one. That's my opinion and I don't feel Lingard will be here long term.

1385~~~
He looked really good to me behind Rooney.  Squad is way too limited for him to start playing there.  Similar to our problems positioning martial.

1386~~~
Oh right seems I've understood you, apologize for that.I'm fine with your minority opinion.It's so obvious for me that's he's a late bloomer though having seen him grown from looking like a waterboy in the U18s squad to scoring for United first team.Pretty much many other people at the club said the same.

1387~~~
Well that's fair enough. We have contrasting opinions. He's an intelligent player and I would love to see him develop here but I feel he has so many limitations. It would have been nice to see him to come into our squad if we were actually playing some fluid attacking football but this isn't a great time to be integrated into the first team.

1388~~~
He's a good squad player to have. Someone who's quite good and can play all over the attacking positions but not quite good enough to be a regular.

1389~~~
Really weird opinions. Memphis scored 30 odd goals last year and has been absolutely garbage this year, but most would expect him to develop into a world beater. Jesse has been quite impressive this season, showing the desire and skill needed of a competent winger, yet he's only a squad player. Bizarre. I reckon Jesse could go on loan to PSV, score 25 goals over the next few months and change opinions, such is the quality of the piss poor competition.

1390~~~
I like him and tbh he has changed my opinion of him through his displays. He's not Neymar but he's quick, clever, and hard working. His technical skill is clearly not up there with the best but its not shite either. He is the kind of player we need in the squad a reliable player who will run all day, can run at people to cause problems and pops up with the goal or assist. 

If he'd have scored that second chance on Tuesday wed be hailing him as the second coming of Christ. Hes not a great goal scorer bit he does get in the positions which means he will get a few goals for us.

1391~~~
He has pace and is generally positive. Gets into decent positions which is good. But he seems limited and lacks composure which makes me think that he will never make it any more than being a squad player.

1392~~~
I'm a little bit in between. I like his movement and energy, but it can't be denied that his misses have cost us a few games this season.

Still hoping he makes it at the club.

1393~~~
His pace is decent but nowhere near explosive and he's not physically imposing either plus he lacks the trickery and skill to beat defenders. He makes some excellent runs and some clever passes in the final third but case he needs to be clinical with his finishing if he wants to be successful, which he is not at this point in time. I'd give him one more season to see if he improves that aspect before selling him. He's 23 already so he's not get much time left.

1394~~~
Lingard is worth his place in the squad because he can do a job and has different qualities from other players. Pace, direct, surprisingly neat footwork with the ball and can get in behind defenses. He can press as well. He's had glaring misses, but the fact that he's getting into positions where he can have clear opportunities is very good. He'll need more playing time to develop (hopefully) his clinical finishing.

Players with a great attitude, is not a problem and is willing to take his chances and improve the team in any way are players you must keep in the squad. Young and Valencia are prime examples of this.

He's 23, how does he not have much time left? His wages are low and he provides more good on a consistent basis than bad, even though his sample size has been relatively small.

1395~~~
Aye his misses are frustrating but I don't think as bad as people are making out. There have been 3 bad ones I can think of and some more very understandable ones (I.e. Against city)

I was surprised to see that according to squawka his conversion rate is better than matA's

1396~~~
Average at best. Nowhere near good enough for us.

Wouldn't get in most premier league teams yet we starting him because he's a youth product.

1397~~~
He just looks scared today.

1398~~~
Nah.
Wasnt involved much though. All the play was down the left with Fellaini being the target man on that flank.

1399~~~
He's been about as useful as Mata, who has been fecking shit too. Great strength in depth.

1400~~~
Not good enough for the starting 11

1401~~~
Not a good half at all. Anonymous.

1402~~~
Man down

1403~~~
Anonymous performance from a nothing player. Can't really blame him.

1404~~~
Haven't seen him since about the 10th minute

1405~~~
Looked nervous when he had the ball. Showed his usual determination defensively at times though.

1406~~~
Disappointing to see a player letting nerves hold you down for 45 mins. He should be told off at half time just as distraction from the game to straighten his mind.

1407~~~
What happens when you promote someone beyond their stalls. For our sake I hope he improves this half.

1408~~~
He's doing nothing, would be better if he switched with Martial. Seems to be more effective in the left.

1409~~~
Said from the start he isn't ever going to be top class and stick by it. Very average player.

1410~~~
Looks like a boy amongst men out there. Let's hope he pops up with a moment to get us something from the game.

1411~~~
One of the worst players I've seen in a Utd shirt.

1412~~~
He's so highly rated by some on here, I just don't get it. He's painfully average. Guess he gets the whole 'being from the academy special dispensation'.

1413~~~
first really bad game, rooney had 20 out of 25 and is still here so calm down some of you. I guess we should drop Lingard for Andy Pereira for a while

1414~~~
Poor game from him today, I thought he'd excel in a derby tempo but couldn't get off the fringe.

1415~~~
Abysmal today. Constantly bullied off the ball and couldn't even do the basics right

1416~~~
He had a shocker today. Not good enough. It's that simple.

1417~~~
Aye, he was dreadful. Lacked any power when going for challenges, created nothing, and looked out of his depth.

He's shown glimpses here and there, but I think a lot of the hope for him simply comes from the fact that he's a youth prospect. I'd understand if he was 19, but he's now 23 and has still shown little to indicate he's going to be anywhere near good enough.

1418~~~
I always try and support the youth players, but I just don't think he has what it takes to play at the highest level.

1419~~~
He's a nothing player and this game doesn't change that one bit.

1420~~~
Until this match, we've looked better with Lingard on the pitch, even when he hasn't performed that well. Today Lingard was awful and so were we.

1421~~~
Not impressed by him so far sadly. His position is such an important one for United. Can see us signing a top RW in the summer and pushing him down the pecking order.

1422~~~
Ridiculous that people are ruling him out after this game. Very difficult game to get involved in as a forward player in those first 60 odd minutes. Rooney and Martial struggled too, but I'm sure we're not ruling them out. He could potentially do with a rest though. I think I'd start Mata against Southampton and replace him with Lingard after 60mins.

1423~~~
Needs to eradicate the casualness, it creeps into both his shooting and passing. Today he underhit a pass to Young in a promising position going forward and did so again later to one of our defenders, almost putting us in trouble. The rest of his game isn't up to much so he needs to sort it out if he wants to play regularly.

1424~~~
He played like he thought he made it. Why couldn't Andreas get a chance if Lingard got his?

1425~~~
I don't know how to describe it. I just have that feeling pereira can be a top tier player but I'm sorry to say, I don't get that feeling with this guy. He can be a useful player for us though.

1426~~~
He never really got into the game today. Played a couple of bad passes but didn't really do much else.

1427~~~
Would always struggle against Moreno who runs just as much as Lingard does and is much faster. Lingard simply went out of things to try, and when he did try the attempts were poor.

1428~~~
Was rubbish. Thought Memphis was equally bad if not worse when he came on. Can someone please talk me through what they see in him? I genuinely struggle to see a footballer. He's so slow to the release the ball it's agonising to watch. When you compare how he plays compares to Martial you can just see the latter is always alive and switched on. Memphis just gets caught out so often.

1429~~~
He's just not that good.

I don't know what people see in him.

1430~~~
He's from the academy. That's literally it. He has struggled to get into Championship teams or stand out in that league during several loan spells.

1431~~~
Lacks experience, I wouldn't write him off over this game, no one looked good.

1432~~~
Yep, both Lingard and Memphis were poor today. I doubt that they will ever be good enough to start games for us, if we want to compete for titles that is. Our wingers are really really poor.

1433~~~
He was poor against Newcastle and worse today. Seems very weak physically and gets easily shoved off the ball - he's 23 now and don't think he will make the top level

1434~~~
Needs a rest out of the team before maybe a loan in the summer. I find it ridiculous that some people think he is an intelligent player.

1435~~~
Out of his depth today.

1436~~~
Aptly put. He didn't look like he belonged, today, sadly. It's all well and good at home when he's got space to run at defenders, but we should rethink starting in games where the pitch is congested, because he simply couldn't handle the lack of space today.

1437~~~
He's not a youngster who should get game time. He won't make it here

1438~~~
Jesse will be a decent to good squad player for us eventually.

1439~~~
I've been defending him a bit, however, he doesn't really justify much of a defense. Given he's relatively young, I'd be willing to give him a bit more time. But decent squad player is probably the best he'll be.

1440~~~
Januzaj is three years younger than him and has taken far more stick than Lingard. Just goes to show how much time Januzaj has.

1441~~~
Too weak to handle any type of pressing at this level. It really is hindrance for him.

1442~~~
Fixed

1443~~~
He offers some pace on the right wing which is much needed and therefor we sometimes look better with him in the team. But other than that, there isn't much about his game that says he'll make it here. Already at 23 I'm not convinced he has more to offer than he has already shown. I'm hoping Januzaj can bring something more to this position when he's reached full fitness.

1444~~~
Really frustrating two games - Newcastle and Liverpool. I was hoping he would add more directness to our attack. On the contrary, he is not really able to handle pressing and his passing is nothing to write home about. Really don't know what else he offers right now to make him a started for us. If he improves his finishing, then maybe a squad role would suit him more.

1445~~~
I think this 'pace' of his is wildly exaggerated on here just like his intelligence and movement.

1446~~~
shit

1447~~~
he is actually a really cool finisher. You'd expect that to come in to his game eventually. Won't ever be stronger but might be more confident. Wouldn't write him off

1448~~~
Really? His finishing this season has been abject, he's missed a lot of really good chances. Some crucial ones too, that one against PSV at home springs to mind.

I don't think he's ever going to be a natural finisher, he really reminds me of Welbeck.

1449~~~
Honestly, that was his one great quality at youth level. That and his maturity at youth level.

1450~~~
I mean this as a compliment and as a criticism too but in a better Utd team he could be 'our' Pedro. 

He's definitely worth keeping around. He's not going to get into a top 4 team anytime soon and why go middle table if you can hang around Utd and become a good option first team or bench?

1451~~~
He was awful against Liverpool, but I'm really surprised at the criticism form the last 2 pages. Given that it's his first proper chance at the club, I don't think he's done too badly. His finishing has been poor - but his movement is great and works hard attacking wise. (He's usually works hard defensively too, but there has been a few moments). 

One thing I do agree on is that he needs to cut off a bit of arrogance - passing and finishing can be a little sloppy at times.

He's not going to be a star for us, but he could be a good squad player for us in the future.

1452~~~
He kinda reminds me of kieran Richardson,  except he seems less talented.

1453~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That is some criticism.

1454~~~
Ouch.....!!! He is more talented than that although he has looked sloppy the last few games he's played. 

I think he is a good little player but needs to demonstrate that more regularly than he has done. He has to try and do everything he's good but in a higher gear than he's used to. The pace of the PL is brutal and you don't get the sort of time you'd get in the 21's or indeed even the Championship. He's been brought up the right way which means that his technique is solid so he should be able to adapt eventually. He needs patience.....

1455~~~
He's 23 years old though. He'll never become good enough to play for us unless we keep lowering our standards.

1456~~~
Age for him isn't really that important, he was never in the plans until he filled out a bit and Ferguson had ear marked him to be ready around last season, which he missed most of owing to injury.

1457~~~
Don't know how he keeps starting, he's been dog shit in the last games he played.

1458~~~
he's been shit last game, he deserves to show he can be good again. You don't bench player after one bad game, it wouldn't be a good management. You could ask questions about Rooney and Fellaini starting every game but it is Lingard who is critisized the most it seems and he just had one bad game. fecking hell

1459~~~
apart that he's done well in terms of defensive duties, provides movement of the ball all the time and good pressing which Memphis showed maybe in one game, so in that matter I am not surprised he sits on the bench as you never know how he can let you down..let alone his very inconsistent end product

1460~~~
Its obvious why he keeps starting. His change of pace, intelligent movement and good work rate gives all our attacking players more space. We are simply a more threatening team when he is in it. 

I've enjoyed watching him this season even if his finishing has driven me mad. At 23 he's still a long way off his peak.

1461~~~
He was also terrible against Newcastle.

1462~~~
Didn't he score? How was that terrible? Nobody questioned Rooney who was bloody average but scored a brace, one from a spotkick and missed another three sitters which could give us three points as much as Lingard's miss. 

He will be MOTM today.-)

1463~~~
And Memphis and Mata have been even worse on more occasions. Pretty obvious why Lingard remains in the starting XI.

1464~~~
At the moment Lingard is neither the problem nor solution regarding our current woes. What he is, is a versatile player with decent technique, great work-rate/team-work, discipline to play to a specified role and good game intelligence with regards movement and space. These qualities alone make him a fantastic squad option where he could potentially fill in anywhere from #8 (in a different system) and beyond. He may never nail down a starting place but his solid base will allow him to contribute to the team in a variety of positions.

His finishing has been a bit ropey, much to my surprise, but only Martial and Rooney have outscored him since he broke in to the team. That is not justification in itself but maybe goes to show why he is keeping Mata and Depay out of the team some of the time. Both have been shown the same, if not more, patience than Jesse and have failed to capitalise. Jesse has only really played in what has been a severely struggling team and early on was one of the few bright sparks in our performances.

He has not looked quite as sharp since returning from injury but hopefully he can find his rhythm and confidence again. It can't be easy playing your first season in the PL when the team is so brittle and under such scrutiny but he always struck me as someone with the right attitude to push through. I actually think he is good for 8-10 goals this season if he continues to get similar playing time.

1465~~~
I swear a lot of people have actually forgotten that he scored a nice goal against Newcastle because he missed a sitter as well.

1466~~~
Check out Jinxy McJinxerson over here.

1467~~~
Nowhere near good enough for this great club. Should be playing for some championship cannon fodder at best.

1468~~~
feck me he's so poor.

1469~~~
Pointless player.

1470~~~
I thought that he might develop but he basically needs a lazy defender and loads of space to be effective. If the defence and midfield are strong and tight he is just too weak.

1471~~~
He is playing as a wing back.. did that performance really stand out as being poor?

1472~~~
Poor chap. Looks frighten to make any mistake.

1473~~~
To be fair to him, he's not a wingback. Noone in our squad would play his role any better.

It's just a shit system full stop.

Nevertheless, he's been sloppy in possession and not doing himself any favours.

1474~~~
out of all the players out there are people really slating Lingard for this performance!? He is playing out of position and is still one of the better players out there(not that this is achievement as most of them are poor).....

1475~~~
He is just shit, full stop.

1476~~~
that's cruel. What's next? Less talented in football than Mcnair? Jeez

1477~~~
Lingered epitomises everything that is wrong with this team. Just average players.

1478~~~
No idea why he's playing after that performance last week. Mata did more in two minutes than he did in 70.

1479~~~
Far from good enough. He's been absolutely clueless since his goal against Newcastle.

1480~~~
Oh dear. He did the Falcao spin & slip on that shot there.

1481~~~
Get rid. send him to Wolves or something, he's pathetic.

1482~~~
I am not sure how he's playing professional football.

1483~~~
Baffling why he's still on the pitch. Why play him for 80 minutes when it's clear it's not his day and we've got Memphis and Januzaj on the bench?

1484~~~
I get that Depay's been a bit rubbish for us, but what has Lingard done to warrant being ahead of Januzaj in the pecking order?

1485~~~
Championship player at best, shouldn't be anywhere near the first team.

1486~~~
In fairness to LVG, Januzaj is probably not fit enough and can't play wing back. Although why we're playing 3 at the back bemuses me

1487~~~
Aye, Lingard has no merit as a wing-back either.

1488~~~
He's been woeful today, he's creating nothing. Memphis isn't playing great but he'll occasionally creates something.

1489~~~
Jesus....why is he still on?

1490~~~
Memphis is never played out of position though. And literally everyone is terrible today.

1491~~~
He's been poor the last few weeks. He's young so inconsistency can be expected.

1492~~~
Yeah, I don't understand why he started today in the first place.

1493~~~
Not nearly good enough it seems...too bad for him.

1494~~~
Whatever about today, the chap is just shit.

1495~~~
I know Jesse is not a wingback but even Antonio Valencia would laugh at his crossing today. Awful.

1496~~~
A championship attacking mid at best.

1497~~~
And why he wasn't replaced.

1498~~~
Makes Valencia and Navas's crossing look like Beckham.

1499~~~
I think he would be a good impact substitute for Premier League relegation fodder personally.

1500~~~
Bit useless. He's a decent player but nowhere near our level

1501~~~
No where near a United quality player - he simply does a job.

1502~~~
Had a stinker today, he was playing out of position but that doesn't excuse how many simple basics he failed to get right.

1503~~~
Couldn't cross at a set of traffic lights today.

1504~~~
Fantastic performance. A real shame Van Gaal insisted on calling his mother a slapper, over the PA system, everytime he got the ball to put him off. He'd have been all over those highly technical facets of the game like passing the ball to a team mate without his insults.

1505~~~
Fecking dreadful once again. He shouldn't be starting so many games for us.

1506~~~
Well put!

1507~~~
I would like to see what his passing % was today, he gave the ball away nearly every time.

1508~~~
Barca/Bayern/Real are pissing themselves watching Man Utd insisting on Lingard.

1509~~~
Played out of position and had an awful game. Shock!

1510~~~
Incredible how he played the full game today. Abysmal

1511~~~
And I thought his performance against Liverpool was bad...

1512~~~
Yeah let's excuse the fact that he couldn't do basic football things right because he was played out of position. He's also looked rather hopeless and mediocre while playing in his actual position.

1513~~~
Played out of position for 5 minutes?

1514~~~
And what position has he ever excelled in?

He's as average as they come. The only thing he offers is that he can run fast from time to time.

1515~~~
He finished the match.

1516~~~
he played as wingback, which is restricted position, wasnt a good game for him but still level above rooney.. And you people are really shambles some of you, try Blind as left winger and you'l see his limitations, try Martial as leftback and see how he copes with the role... Lingard is CAM but obviously that chimp who supposed to be our manager doesnt know shit about football and tries everything he can to keep that joke captain in the team and we are stacked there. Try him in three man midfield in more fluid system with good pressing and he will thrive, this is just really stupid to keep him wide where he's quite limited

1517~~~
I fail to understand how playing at wing back can make you automatically cross so poorly. I'm sure but I don't see it.

1518~~~
I'll just repeat what I said in the Matchday thread: As harsh it may sound, as long as players like Jesse are starting for Manchester fecking United we're in big trouble. He's nowhere near good enough and should be playing at a Premier League club battling relegation or a very good Championship team. A squad player at the very best, the only thing he has on his side is him coming from our academy.

If Bebe or Obertan had put in such a 'crossing show' we'd never stop laughing and have compilations showing their shitness...

1519~~~
he has a great cross on him, he showed it many times before, he tried to put it in with pace, didnt work out this game, if two crosses means get rid of not good enough for this club etc than a person who thinks this should really get a grip

1520~~~
Lets also excuse the fact that a lot of our players struggle to do 'basic football things' right because they're playing in a team that has next to nothing movement. See Young's performance for Liverpool last week before he got injured and you'll know i'm talking about.

Nope.

Well, he's been a lot more threatening as a winger, no? As soon as he come back from injury, he was brought straight back into the team for a reason.

1521~~~
I thought he looked great in his first pre season but i can't remember the last time he took someone on, which is worrying for a supposedly quick and skilful winger/forward.

1522~~~
It really isn't about two crosses though. You are the one who needs a grip if you think it is about that only.

1523~~~
A bit harsh to blame him for not performing under these conditions.

1524~~~
Since coming back from injury it's like he is avoiding picking up another one. I personally like him but lately he is stopped applying himself like he used to.

1525~~~
Nothing against the kid but he should be nowhere near our starting 11 (Adnan, McNair, Blackett, BJ, Mata, Varela, Fellaini, Wilson also) so that is 9 fecking players that should be nowhere near but are so just shows you how far we have fallen!

1526~~~
He's been awful last 3 games, he's not so young now, he's 23, crossing poor, positioning poor, rarely takes people on down the wing and weak physically- couldn't believe he started today, his future is not at United

1527~~~
Can't wait until we get someone proper in to replace him. As harsh as it sounds. The lad is a good boy and decent squad member. Shouldn't start games for us though.

1528~~~
He played as a wing back for 5 minutes, 5 MINUTES.

1529~~~
I said on the podcast that he's basically our version of Aaron Lennon / Andros Townsend (pace and not much else) ... Felt a bit bad after for saying it, but nothing I'm seeing convices me otherwise.

1530~~~
He isn't even as good as Lennon and Townsend! Lingard would be lucky to be a starter in Championship team.

1531~~~
Dont be silly. We played 532 for the majority of the game and he was played as a right wing back. Watch the game again.

1532~~~
I know. I typed that in the 78th or so minute, expecting he'd stay on for at least 80.

1533~~~
Are you serious? Van Gaal said himself said post match he changed the shape of the team when he bought on Januzaj for CBJ, meaning Lingard and Januzaj as fullbacks and Rooney + Martial upfront. Are you saying LVG's bullshitting?

1534~~~
He probably did change the shape, but before that Lingard was playing as a wing back.

1535~~~
What are you on

1536~~~
I was at the game, it was 3-5-2 and Lingard was definitely playing as a wing back.

1537~~~
Championship level player at best. He was poor even there, when he went on loan. How he plays ahead of the likes of Memphis, Januzaj or Pereira only god and LVG know.

Not to mention that he is 23 and it's not like he's a prospect anymore. He is basically a shit Welbeck, people only rate him because he's a life long United fan that came through the academy.

1538~~~
Lingard was wing back from the start of the second half. We were 3-5-2 after Mata came on.

1539~~~
Yep. He wasn't getting in the Derby team. Birmingham etc is his level.

1540~~~
Were we not 3-5-2 in the first half too?

1541~~~
What the hell are peoples eyes doing

Just because a Winger defends deep that doesn't make him a wing back. For him to play as a wingback that would mean CBJ was also playing wing back which he wasn't.

The reason Lingard is in the team is because he does the defensive work, like young has done over the years, they will put 110% into the match running up and down the wing from start to stop but that doesn't mean they are playing as a wing back or for that matter that are any good as a player. I'm done with this now, believe what the feck you want

1542~~~
Nah, first half it was definitely a back four with Martial and Lingard out wide. They were often coming quite deep to get the ball though, which was really stupid because it did nothing to negate the Southampton press.

He changed it a half time to make Rooney and Martial more central with Mata in behind... which meant switching to a 3-5-2...  him and CBJ were wing-backs in the second half.

EDIT - Although the Guardian reckon it was 3-5-2 from the start, so what do I know. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/23/manchester-united-southampton-premier-league-match-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...nited-southampton-premier-league-match-report</a>

Thing is, we were so shit in the first half, and barely able to get out of our half, that it's hard to tell!

1543~~~
Aye, must have been. 

The lad has a few goals in him as he has shown on loan previously and does some good defensive work sometimes. On the negative side he is possibly the weakest player in the league, his control is sketchy and he can't cross for toffee. I think LVG probably likes him because he is a good quiet kid and he does pay attention to his defensive duties. That said, I just don't think he is good enough for Manchester United, well, a Manchester United that will win the league anyway.

1544~~~
It was 352/532 all game until Januzaj came on. You could tell that by how central and together Rooney and Martial were, and every time the team got back into position. Lingard was wingback for roughly 85 minutes.

1545~~~
His crossing was similar to Bebe's today. He's never going to be a top player, he'll make a decent squad player if we ever actually have a good team again.

1546~~~
<a class="username" data-user="84431, @wiz4231" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84431/">@wiz4231</a>

Martial was on the right, so was Lingard. How could they both be on the right wing?

1547~~~
The crux of it is that Lingard isn't very good. People can make all the excuses they want, but he's far far from the required standard.

1548~~~
None of the players are playing at the required standard, hence why we're 5th. Simple as!

1549~~~
He's a decent player, never going to be good enough to be a starter. Can be a fairly useful role player in a functioning attacking unit, should end up having a premier league career.

1550~~~
Well that's simply not true. DDG, Smalling, Martial, Shaw etc aren't good enough? Righteo. Lingard isn't good enough, full stop. He's 23 and had an extremely underwhelming career to-date; there's a reason for that. There are plenty of passengers in the team alright but the manager is making several players look far worse than they are. Lingard isn't one. He simply is very average.

1551~~~
Agreed. He's not even good for teams like Palace or Watford. Yet we starting him.

1552~~~
That's the sad part; I genuinely believe he would even struggle to start for the top 2 championship sides. That's a pathetic indictment for a current starter for our team.

1553~~~
Here's a question: who would you rather have? Lingard or Zaha?

1554~~~
Preferably neither as it shows how shit our standards are these days.

1555~~~
When did I say they weren't good enough? Fact is, it's a team effort, and at the moment, we're in 5th, which has feck all to do with just Lingard. 

Bold statement doesn't really make sense to me. How you think you seem to know that any other manager wouldn't step up Lingard's performances (despite him having more good than bad performances) I don't know. Ashley Young was bang average under Sir Alex. Been one of our better players under Van Gaal.

1556~~~
We bought Depay......

1557~~~
Either he was instructed to play deep or hasn't any positional awareness 

About as much threat at a water pistol today and it baffles me that he's selected ahead of Mata,  Memphis, Pereira or Januzaj after a shocking game at Anfield 

A very very average player

1558~~~
This is a Lingard thread, hence why Lingard is being discussed. He isn't good enough. You can spin it whatever way you like but it's straw clutching at it's finest. Has anyone directly blamed Lingard for the reason we are 5th? I doubt that. I can't pretend I've seen anything to suggest that he will make it here.

1559~~~
His crossing was really poor.

1560~~~
He reminds me of how Memphis and Martial have both done this season. Got brought on, showed energy and enthusiasm and willingness to try things, got over played and now seems restricted to one area in the attacking third.

Not really his fault, but what is his position?

I really blame this on management anyway.

1561~~~
If I had never watched United before, I'd have said that about most of our players. Fact is, I personally think it's harsh to judge him when playing under such poor management.

1562~~~
He's being judged in a thread that is solely about him, I think that's pretty fair. If people were creating threads solely to slate him, that wouldn't be fair, no. Yes, LvG isn't managing the team very well (understatement of the century). But fact is, Lingard has made it to 23 years of age and done wank all so far with his career; there's a reason for that. I watched him at Derby last season and he looked bang average in the Championship with Ince looking the far superior player. He's an average player at best. Nowhere near the level required.

1563~~~
He could be a decent squad player for us under a new manager. It'll be interesting to see what becomes of him at United once we do appoint someone else for the managers job.

1564~~~
He'll be shipped out with the rest of the shite, Lingard, McNair, Powell, Keane, Valencia, Romero, Young, Fellaini etc

1565~~~
Agreed 100%.
Our attack is unable to lock the defenses of teams such as Norwich and Bournemouth. That's just embarrassing.
IMO Lingard is a Championship standard player. Our problem is that we don't have anybody else available to take his place.

1566~~~
True, I want to see Januzaj there in his place for now and recall Wilson, he's worth a shot there too.

1567~~~
Harsh on Valencia and Young!

1568~~~
He is Van Gaal's Darren Gibson. Lets hope he doesn't join Twitter.

1569~~~
It really isn't. Valencia has been OK for the last three years. In that same time, Young has been quite crap, himself.

Honestly, we don't need players who "try" and "give it their all" and have "a great attitude" yet are painfully average. I won't fault some of the performances from the likes of Young, Valencia, Fellaini et al. but we need better players to compete.

1570~~~
I simply do not understand how someone could possibly compare Lingard to Memphis, Adnan, Pereira, or even Young. All of these players actually showed flashes of brilliance before they were mired in Van Gal's swamp of non-existent movement and overpassing.

Lingard has only shown no identifiable skill, no ability to cross, no dribbling skills, tremendously poor finishing and almost zero potential. Not even Pep or Mourinho could possibly save him. same goes for McNair, Blackett, BJ, Phil Jones, Rojo, Fellaini, Romero...

1571~~~
He is used for his pace, but he isn't that fast. Put him up against Moreno because of his pace, and all you get is a player who is outpaced every single time. He is a clever player, but he needs to play to those strengths, not having to resort to trying to run past players, because he won't. 

I think he is a decent enough player, but at this stage I would say he should be no more than a mere squad player, but we have Mata who should be ahead of him, as should Memphis, and none of them are setting the world alight.

1572~~~
The funny thing is that I don't even think he would be playing if it wasn't for Van Gaal.

1573~~~
Defensive winger.

1574~~~
I was just about to post "Has he even touched the ball" and then he had that "shot".

1575~~~
I love nothing more than a player graduating from the academy, but with Lingard it's very difficult to pin point exactly what it is he excels at to say he'll make it with us. 

Sure, he'll score the odd goal because he gets into good positions, but to make this setup really work, you need a winger who can beat a man or create space for others by getting double marked.

1576~~~
I don't care if he's local, not good enough. We need much much better.

1577~~~
Should be playing for Derby.

1578~~~
I'm inclined to agree with this. I don't even think he's much of a squad player. Need more impact from someone who plays his position. Hopefully I'll be proven wrong.

1579~~~
From Ronaldo in 2008 to Lingard in 2016. Wow! No wonder we are so shite when players as useless as him keep getting picked over more talented players like Periera.

1580~~~
He's awful. I'd rather play Memphis and hope maybe he gets going rather than Lingard who clearly isn't good enough.

1581~~~
I think that was the worst shot that I recall ever seeing in all my years watching football.

1582~~~
Rubbish so far.

1583~~~
He is the next Danny Welbeck for us, but not as good a player as Danny was.

1584~~~
He has been rubbish for a lot of games now.

1585~~~
When you compare him to Martial on the other side, the difference in quality is obvious. I would rather we kept Welbeck and played him there and I wasn't even a Welbeck fan.

1586~~~
Not even close to being as good as Welbeck and I am not a great fan of Welbz.

1587~~~
No where near Danny in terms of pure ability. Welbeck could run with the ball and beat his man. Lingard keeps passing it back to his FB and then passes the buck to someone else when he gets the ball back. He reminds me more of Cleverley in that both are not good enough in terms of talent and both play like cowards and without any interest in making things happen on their own.

1588~~~
My point is he'll be the local lad who gets binned eventually and a section of fans will be up in arms about it, despite the obvious fact he isn't good enough at the top level.

1589~~~
He has the worst shooting ability I've ever seen from a Manchester United midfielder

1590~~~
Tells a lot that a player like him is starting for us in a position we once fielded the best players in the world

1591~~~
Not even the next DWelbz19, let alone the actual Danny Welbeck

1592~~~
Bang average.

1593~~~
Same age as Neymar. Makes me want to cry.

1594~~~
Wow!  I actually forgot he was playing!

1595~~~
Obviously my point, which I made quite clearly, was missed by all.

1596~~~
I'd rather re-sign David Bellion than see Lingard play for a minute longer.

1597~~~
He just bottled out of a 50-50 there. 

He's not good enough

1598~~~
Embarrassing that he's a starter for United

1599~~~
Limited player, don't blame him. He's a defensive winger.

1600~~~
I don't particularly rate Danny but Danyy is twice the player this guy is.

1601~~~
Then he's not really the next Danny Welbeck

1602~~~

1603~~~
2 assists

1604~~~
Very average player. Not good enough for United.

1605~~~
He is lucky that papered over yet another poor performance. Nowhere near the standard needed for us to push back into the Top.

1606~~~
He's not a starter long term, but as a squad player I think he's fine. If only Lingard was the biggest problem with this team.

1607~~~
Haven't you heard he's shite?

If you don't come into his thread every time he plays and ask why he's not playing for a Belorussian 7th division team you're not a proper United fan.

1608~~~
Got an assist but he did absolutely nothing for almost the entire game. That too against derby. I get that we have no one as talented as martial but we have to look to get some similar threat from the right even if it's not yo that level. I'd rather give Januzaj more chances.

1609~~~
We mostly went down the other wing so he spent large portions of the game not involved, got a nice assist though.

1610~~~
He's not bad.  A hard worker playing in a poaition that requires flair. 

I think he could be a fantastic squad player able to play in midfield (centrally &  wide)  as well at fullback.  A natural successor to ashlwy young & valencia maybe.

1611~~~
Bit dramatic that to be honest.

1612~~~
Hard worker certainly sums him up. Hopefully he's like a young Willian and the rest of his game will progress accordingly.

1613~~~
The question is whether we should have a threat from only one side. Having mata and lingard do nothing for most of the game but cycle possession back, to me, doesn't make sense. I'd much rather give Januzaj a run of games and hope we can have a dual threat.

1614~~~
Nah its not.

There's a subset of posters on here who feel the need in virtually every single player thread to criticise players for absolutely everything.

I'm not certain Lingard's going to make it, but the reaction to a performance that was at worst ok was another page of abuse.

And this from a fan base that likes to see youth given a chance apparently.

1615~~~
He is closer to his mid 20s than youth to be fair!

1616~~~
Like Mata he was a lot better in the second half when the game opened up a bit. Wasteful for most of the game

1617~~~
He does a job, but he's not a long term solution.

1618~~~
2 assists, I thought Martial got 2 assists?

1619~~~
Why do people care so much about his age? So what if he's 23, when did players stop developing at 23? Not every player is going to fullfil his potential at 23, not everyone is Messi.

It's completely fine if people think he won't develop that much and don't think he has some great potential, but to mention his age every single week is really stupid, especially because he is fecking 23, not 33. 

Whether he develops to good level enough or not is one problem, but he is at least 2 or 3 years still from his best, and he definitely looks like pretty much every young player breaking in the first team, raw and inconsistent, and he is long way to go before being finished product.

1620~~~
I think most would agree with all that. Certainly I would.

... It's that playing him 90 minutes regularly makes no sense.

1621~~~
Consistent...but when everyone else up's their game (like tonight), he can't raise his own game and he looks out his depth. 

I suppose it's a clear indication of his ceiling. Still a useful player to keep around the squad.

What does annoy me though...when he closes down the ball or tries to pressure a player, it's always half hearted, as if he doesn't really want or expect to win the ball - he is just doing what he is told by the coaches

1622~~~
For all his limitations, it seems like we are playing a bit better and getting better results with him in the side. I think he helps to open things up a bit in the attack - if he could shoot we would have a decent player on our hands. Sadly he shoots like he was born to take penalties for England.

1623~~~
I like that he can do a job, I like that he works hard defensively and loves the club, but he really shouldn't be starting. He doesn't have a good enough all-round game nor does he have one absolute standout quality. He'll probably be moved on eventually.

1624~~~
Squad player at best. He really isn't offering a whole lot.

1625~~~
That's being very optimistic. Apart from being a tremendous worker, Willian is also quite gifted technically. 

As for his performance tonight, I thought he was dreadful in the first half. But he redeemed himself in the second somewhat; set up that goal and worked hard. Still struggle to see how he will make it here though.

1626~~~
No argument there, I certainly don't think he's a long term solution and in truth think we need more pace and directness than Januzaj out there, the way forward is definitely getting a Martial level threat for the RW.

1627~~~
Some players don't age on Caf. Evans was still considered young, and some call Jones still a young player.

Lingard is the same age as Neymar, older than Messi when he won the first Ballon D'Or. Not exactly young, and not exactly good.

1628~~~
Can't believe some of the dross I'm hearing. He's a local lad and showing lots of promise. Give him half a chance at least for crying out loud.

1629~~~
That statement is at least open to debate. He's 24 this year and I really can't see any stand out qualities. I don't want to be laying into Lingard but the we need much better than him on the right wing to be a contender. I see more potential in both Januzaj and Memphis for that position, who are 2 and 3 years younger. I feel that it's a little bit of a waste starting him, as I really can't see him making it here. We could be giving game time to players with more potential or actually buy right winger who is up to our standard.

1630~~~
Not great, but he adds pace to the RW which I think is required. Doubt he will feature much next season (if he is even here)

1631~~~
I'm worried he's going to continue playing despite the poor form just because he's "LVG's guy".

There is really no reason not to give Januzaj, Memphis, or Pereira a shot, when Lingard is in this kind of form.

1632~~~
Well I guess thats told everyone in this thread who compared him to those two then hasn't it?

Except no ones come even close to making any sort of claim like that, and comparing Jesse Lingard to two exceptional players like that is grossly unfair. If thats the bar we're holding youth talent to then we may as well close down the academy. In fact, its a wonder we even persisted with Scholes, Giggs, or Neville. Those useless cnuts went their whole career without winning a Ballon D'Or let alone winning one at 23.

And lets cut out the bullshit that <a class="username" data-user="64360, @drdoityourself" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64360/">@drdoityourself</a> is talking about. Yes he turns 24 this year, but he's been 23 for just over a month. Stop trying to make out he's older than he is.

The simple fact is that Lingard was 22 at the start of the season, his first season as a regular first team player, and has played a grand total of 15 games for the first team and by all accounts is a late bloomer. If you can't understand why people might refer to that as 'young' player then jesus christ.

1633~~~
He's a decent player but he will be screwed on the bench or gone once we sign another winger.

1634~~~
At least where I come from you're classed in your age group. Those who are born in the same calendar year are judged on the same level, whether you are born in January or December, you grow up playing at the same level. He will be 24 this year. You can call it a late bloomer, but I can't see him improving to the required standard of a Manchester United player.

1635~~~
Don't really want to get involved in this whole debate but you are contradicting yourself! You are saying he is young but then you are stating he is 23 but he is young because it's his first season? Do you mean an inexperienced player as the other posters are correct by saying he's not exactly young? Because as the rightly state he is 23! Confused!

1636~~~
Yeah, I'm not sure myself, I've said as much in the thread. 

But it just seems a little unfair on the kid to dismiss him for being 24 when he's literally just turned 23.

1637~~~
That is the problem. A lot of people aren't seeing lots of promise there, or any promise at all.

He is a local lad but so are a hundred other players in the academy, so who cares.
Every average to shit player who has come from the academy (or signed as a young player) has been called a late bloomer in this forum. The only one who was shown to be so - to the best of my knowledge - is Darren Fletcher. So either the late bloomers don't exist, or more likely, they are very rare. Not every average player is a late bloomer.

Now, can Lingard be so? Probably yes, because unlike the other late bloomer of recent years (Welbeck, Cleverley and Jones) he really didn't get as many chances as them to show his best for United. But, I think it is quite unlikely cause he really doesn't show anything above average in any aspect of the game. We'll see, I guess, but so far he hasn't been better than two other late bloomers we had, Bebe and Obertan.

1638~~~
I'd argue the opposite to be true, this forum -despite most posters stated desire to give youth a chance- is incredibly harsh on any youth player who isn't already close to the finished article.

But either way, I'm not talking about randoms on this forum. If you can find quotes from Ferguson saying 'this player won't be ready for first team action until they're 22' then fine, but I really don't recall any of them - even Darren Fletcher - being spoke about as being players that would need longer to develop.

1639~~~
The infallible Fergie who thought that Welbeck and Cleverley are in the same level as Thiago? A lot of things Fergie was, but being a Nostradamus wasn't his strongest point.

1640~~~
Not sure about showing lots of promise. I'd personally want more from our right winger than one or two decent moments in a game of 90 against Derby county. Both him, and Mata spend all game doing bugger all, and just cycling possession back, which is no more than I expect from a Derby County player funnily enough. From a Manchester United player you want to see some consistent skill, and threat.

1641~~~
Ok, Ferguson doesn't know what he was talking about, but you do. 

The simple facts are that 4 years ago Ferguson said that Lingard would make it into the first team at around about 22. 

Under a completely different manager, one who also has a very good record with youth talent for all his other failings, he started getting regular games at that age. 

Hey, maybe, its luck? Or maybe, just maybe, Ferguson knew what he was talking about?

Regardless, its a stupid debate, regardless of the intricacies of whether Lingard's body type meant he was a late bloomer or not, judging Lingard as anything other than a player that has played a grand total of 15 games for Manchester United, one that clearly is not the finished article, is dumb.

1642~~~
Well UEFA and FIFA rules state that your age group is classified at the start of the calendar year a tournament commenced, so by that definition Lingard is a 22 year old player this season.  It's the reason you can have 23 year olds playing in the U21 finals, or 22, as Jesse was when he scored England's winner against Sweden in last years UEFA U21s.

Lingard's shown a few signs of promise at times this season for me: He never hides from responsibility, unlike Januzaj.  He's not been afraid to break in and take a shot, unlike most of our team under van Gaal which has seen him bag a couple and he can at least deliver a cross around 70% of the time unlike any of our other genuine wingers.  With Januzaj back he'll see more competition for limited opportunities and I don't personally think he'll make it, but he's still worth a shot and it would please me no end to see a young local lad break through.

1643~~~
He's let me down a bit lately, because he's shown that he can perform better. Been a bit sloppy on the ball of late, but provided a great assist for Blind yesterday. I do think he's better on the left, though, but then so is Martial.

1644~~~
You can accuse Januzaj of a lot of things but hiding isn't one of them he always tries to get on the ball and take players on.

1645~~~
Championship level player, but he got a nice assist last night.

1646~~~
Don't understand the hate towards this kid at all - he is at least as good as most of the rest of the team right now... Like a lot of others i'm a little saddened to see the lack of progress from Januzaj over the past two seasons but it certainly isn't Lindgards fault. Januzaj continues to be over-hyped and for some on here he can do no wrong - but basically he's been crap recently.

1647~~~
Two years ago maybe, but under van Gaal he's gone backwards and seems to shirk responsibility much of the time for fear of his move not coming off.

1648~~~
The answer is they're both overhyped to hell. Januzaj might be better suited to play in Spain or Germany for a midtable class team.

Lingaard is just a championship standard player, hes 23 now so hes not a high potential youngster like martial or Shaw. He's basically another version of Nick powell.

Fact is, Neither are good enough or at the standard required for United and never will be its that simple.

1649~~~
I'll not argue with the overhype but it's difficult to write either player off when they're playing in such an uninspired team where any risky forward play is being drummed out of them.  Depay is supposed to be one of the best up and coming wingers in the world, Di Maria was already proven as one of the best yet van Gaal has managed to make them both look mediocre.  What chance did Januzaj or Lingard ever have under him?

Both are still young enough to make it and hopefully Depay will turn it around as well but it's not going to happen as long as LVG and his philosophy stick around.

1650~~~
Hard to disagree when put like this.

1651~~~
Really ? 
You sound like Rafa : Fact 
& you should perhaps learn to differentiate between fact and opinion <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1652~~~
Fact is no PL wanted him on loan last season and he did not manage to make anything out of his loan in the Championship. When it comes to my opinion, he is one of the weakest attacking players I have seen at United, at least considering his age.

1653~~~
He's not terrible, puts in the effort and does a job. He should be nowhere near Manchester United's first choice XI. 

His 'resurgence' speaks more about Memphis than Jesse in my opinion. You can't tell me that if Memphis pushed himself to defend better and learn more of the tactical side, that he couldn't be a much better option out there.

1654~~~
I think it strange when people or fans get mad at a player for putting a better shift than their preferred player. Saw the same with Young being called names because he was doing better than ADM, is it not the responsibility of Memphis and Januzaj to show more than Lingard. If memory serves me right Memphis started the season as a starter, Lingard should be given credit and not castigated for stepping up.
Any I like Lingard for the type of player he is, not every first team player in a top should be a superstar or else you'll never get the proper balance. The work he does for team is being overlooked, if the same responsibilty is added unto Martial we'll be discussing him differently.

1655~~~
I think he's a talented lad and has got a chance of making it with us. He will only improve by play time, which is what he is getting atm. All young lads stepping up have dips in form and Jesse is going through that presently. He'll need to work out how to better impose himself on games but even in a below average performance, he produces a lovely assist. 

Not everyone can burst onto the scene at 17 looking like a World beater. If Jesse is to make it, he'll be one of those slow burn type players who'll hopefully improve year on year.

1656~~~

1657~~~
Very good shout! He's stepped up and the responsibility of the players in that position is to fight harder and demonstrate more than Jesse in training or if they get a chance as a sub to take their place back. Friendly rivalry and competition for places has to exist or they'll never improve as a team or individually.

1658~~~
<img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/> So what.....Di Maria did that at the weekend as he is apparently World class.....it happens. I suppose you never make mistakes.....

1659~~~
He's not good enough. Shows how messed up our squad is that hes a starter

1660~~~
He struggled to make any impact when he was on loan at the championship teams now all of a sudden he's good enough to be playing for Manchester united....erm ok then.

It is a <b>fact</b> he's not good enough for us yet muppets like you can't see that, meanwhile you'll most likely be raging on match days because we're so mediocre yet can't understand why. It's because players like him are regulars. 

Average players = Average performances.

1661~~~
Maybe some prefer players to coast on reputation.

1662~~~
Every season is a new beginning both for the body and mind. For young players it means physical growth and experience. I doubt Kane would have been the opportunity at Spurs if this was overlooked.

1663~~~
Totally agree. He's in because he does his defensive duties quite well but he's shit at the business end when it counts!

How that makes him a Utd player beats me

1664~~~
Indeed. Against a Championship team.
We will be playing an EPL team in a few days; lets see how he does against them.

1665~~~
To most fans, the attacking duties are the most important qualities in an attacker.
However, to LVG, defensive duties are what count the most.

1666~~~
No. He's in the team because his competition has been even worse which is not his fault.

1667~~~
Ah good lets go and buy someone - I would say muppet is a more apt description of those who want to take the Galactico route to success rather than bringing through local talent from the academy. You forget that Utd's achievements over the last 50 yrs were based on our own kids who were given a chance to shine over several seasons. Today's supporters want it all now, right now and if it doesn't click in half a dozen matches get rid immediately... Championship material hmm.. where does that put the likes of Jamie Vardy ? Oh yes the last rumour I heard was Real wanting to buy this northern conference player.. You should probably go and watch City or Chelsea, you'd feel more at home. Lindgard is far from perfect but he's also far from the carcrash that many on here see. I for one am glad he's getting the chance to prove you wrong. Or perhaps we should move Schweinsteiger out to the wing again ??

1668~~~
Oh dear, You're beyond saving. I'm going to save my fingers from typing but all that ^^^ is complete nonsense <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1669~~~
This is quite ridiculous.

1670~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I wonder if people read before they post. Can't even spell his name!

1671~~~
Most seem to be split between him being a squad player and not being good enough, I'm curious if thee is anyone that thinks he can be a regular starter once the wins get additions?

1672~~~
My point wasn't about his quality. My point, for the third time, was that he is a local lad and people will support him despite not being good for us, just as Welbeck wasn't.

1673~~~
Not his fault Memphis is heavily underperforming though. He puts in a shift but ultimately he's just not good enough.

1674~~~
He's done alright....Has a knack of getting in the right positions to score, and has done on a few occasions. What do people expect?

1675~~~
It's ridiculous that fans can expect a young player who developed late physically, in his first full season to put in performances that we expect from senior players like Rooney. Like all young players, they really should be given the allowances for inconsistency to grow. Too many FM fans on here.

1676~~~
Irrespective of whether he's a supposed late bloomer, he's still 23, and doesn't look anywhere near good enough considering that. The fact that he's perhaps developed late physically doesn't excuse for his poor general play, nor for the fact that he doesn't look good enough. I mean, he <i>might </i>significantly improve as a player, but there's probably a much stronger chance he'll get sold to Burnley or Sunderland in a year or two and fade into relative obscurity. It'd be nice if that wasn't the case, of course, but I don't see what's wrong in fans expecting regular players to put in good performances.

1677~~~
I've not said his performances have been great but the expectations on the young players at United can be pretty unreasonable at times. These young players dont have the experience required to perform at high levels week in and week out in the toughest leagues. They are always going to be many inconsistent performances. It's not like Januzaj, McNair, Lingard et al were this poor when they came onto the scene. As a matter of facts their arrivals into the first XI was actually the only shining light at those points of the season. They have a string of poor performances as expected of young players and they be slated here as though they are expected to perform on the same level as Rooney.

Regarding Lingard being 23, as a coach myself I know that age doenst matter when there is no experience. His slow physical development has set him back a year or two, then you consider the season he was out for, you will see that as far as 23 year old players go, Lingard is miles behind in terms of experience.

That said, I want his performances to be better and it should be but we can't judge this players with the same ruler we use for the more experienced players.

1678~~~
Between this and the Fellaini dribble out of play, I thought we were in for a long night.

1679~~~
He just isn't very good.

1680~~~
I like him but RW is really not his position.

1681~~~
You're not Man Utd supporters, you're pompom girls <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Content just to say "he's crap" - fair weather fans ??

1682~~~
I find his performances consistently underwhelming.

1683~~~
Got me! Im a fair weather, pompom girl.

1684~~~
He's shite but will play tomorrow along with Fellaini who I forgot to mention is also shite.

1685~~~
He just doesnt bring anything to the team really. Here and there a good run or pass but other than that, he's just not good enough. There is no way he would start for any other top club

1686~~~
The only guarantee is that he'll miss a gilt edge chance that will end up costing us. Happens in every game he plays.

1687~~~
Have to agree with this, he possibly could improve and become a top player but at 23 he's probably shown all he's going to and will only improve slightly. But even then would he be good enough for a top 4 team?

1688~~~
No he isn't. He epitomizes everything that is wrong with the team at the moment. Average, but no where top level quality to push us back into the mix as one of the top EPL teams.

1689~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1690~~~
I like him and I think he's been pretty decent. I imagine we will sign someone a bit better as a regular starter but Lingard should be a decent squad player for the next few years.

1691~~~
I dunno why you'd pick a young player on his first season who hasn't even been starting every game to epitomise everything that is wrong with the team but I guess it is silly season at the moment so hey ho.

1692~~~
This.

Some seriously embarrassing comments in here.

1693~~~
I'd pick him because he is now a regular starter and isn't good enough regardless of his age (he is 23 by the way, not 18-19).

He is average (Championship level) and we have far too much average in the squad at the moment, hence my comment and why we are regularly being beaten by so called 'inferior' teams.

1694~~~
How can it be embarrassing when it's true though? or would you rather people bury their head on the sand a bit longer?

1695~~~
He's not young and he has never even stood out and looked like one of the best players in the Championship while on loan there. Cleverley looked brilliant on loan at Watford when he actually was young and he couldn't even make it at us. Lingard is actually a below average PL player.

1696~~~
A decent player but not good enough for United. Then again we are probably at that level or reaching it soon anyway

1697~~~
He's only a regular starter at the moment because some of our very expensive buys aren't doing good enough.

1698~~~
It's really odd. He started off so well, missed some piss easy chances but was very bright. Woudln't be too far-fetched to assume van Gaal may have had a word with him.

1699~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I don't mind us giving him chances, but I don't see why Januzaj has to keep playing for the u21s and be behind Lingard in the pecking order. Nor do I think one decent pass is enough against lower league Derby.

1700~~~
You are right, up until the injury lay-off he was at least looking threatening (even if he missed) and brought an energy and enthusiasm to the final third. Since he returned he hasn't looked up to speed or confident in the slightest. You can look past his shortcomings at WB but even in his regular position he has been incredibly subdued.

LVG has done his magic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Its likely just lack of confidence after missing some pretty important chances, and also struggling a little after an injury

1702~~~
It's implicit that when you say Fellaini the following adjective is shit. Writing it is thus redundant.

1703~~~
He kinda reminds me of a few players under LVG. They come in, look bright, have great movement in the final third and get into great positions. Then slowly and surely it seems they are restricted to one area of the pitch, are told to dribble less and pass more (and end up looking "safe"). I swear weve seen this with Memphis and to a lesser extent Martial.

Or maybe not, just how it seems.

1704~~~
I hate to think like that but the gradual diminishing returns from nearly every player that steps in to the team does pose a few questions.

I don't think missing the chances has knocked him because he missed them from the outset and yet continued to play in a similar vein. Maybe he has been on the internet and read what some of the people have to say about him?

1705~~~
or maybe he just isn't very good and defenders have done research \ scouting on him pre-game and figured him out.

1706~~~
Alot of Lingard's problems are that he doesn't get involved enough and doesn't actively seem to want the ball, whereas a Januzaj for example or Memphis will always want the ball, regardless of how they are playing. Like I said to facund above, maybe it's just a simple case of defenders have done research \ scouting on him pre-game and figured him out.

1707~~~
Your're wasting you're breath, some of our fans are so oblivious to the fact he is a championship quality player just move on that's what I did <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

He's terrible and its embarrassing he's even in our squad in the first place. We can see it but others won't be told.

1708~~~
Well I guess we managed half a page of reasonable discussion at least.

1709~~~
No doubt the opposition making a plan for him will have played a part in his ability to perform but I can't see how it would stifle his ability to offer the movement in behind and limit the energy/enthusiasm in which he seems (IMO) to be lacking recently.

Whilst this definitely reflects the last few games I wouldn't say it is typically indicative of Lingard's game. Against CSKA he was one of the few to lead the charge and he always seemed to be eager to drift towards the ball and create interplay/triangles when playing at reserve level (a different kettle of fish I know). Maybe he needs more time to be comfortable being proactive in a team filled with more experienced players who should really be taking the lead themselves.


<i>More generally:</i>
I've not seen many trying to defend his recent form but some do try to look for positives in a player that is playing his first season in the PL. I don't believe we have seen the best of what he can offer or that he is necessarily being used to best effect (He has and will never be the type to consistently take his man on IMO). I'm not saying that he can be a footballing God but that there is a chance that he could become a useful squad player. 

Some people have formed a definitive view which is fine and may well be perfectly justified but for the sake of argument I would contend that had Lingard scored 2-3 of the chances that he spurned (he has hit the woodwork at least twice and missed by inches on a few other occasions) then we would be faced, in general, with an entirely different tide of opinion on this thread. Such are the margins.

He is not currently doing enough to justify a starting spot but I feel there have been games when having him in the team has added something to our performance and he needs to get back to producing that kind of display if he wants to stick around.

1710~~~
See, I don't think the margins are that narrow. Him scoring a couple more goals would just paper over the cracks in which his performances tend to be full of. I must admit I don't like this new trend of players being solely judged on the amount of goals they score, I seem to be seeing this pattern more and more in recent years.

I'm all for the youngsters getting in the team and impressing, I like that as much as anybody, But sometimes you have to call a spade a spade and with Lingard he just isn't of the quality that we need, and with being 23 years old you would have to guess that his progression as a player probably won't increase too much more in the future, definitely not to the degree needed at this club anyways.

In the past when players like Darron Gibson or Kieran Richardson would start, you could get away with alot more when you are surrounding them with title winners like Paul Scholes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs etc. But with the squad as it is at the moment we cannot afford such luxuries, unfortunately.

1711~~~
Memphis, Martial, Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Rooney, RvP, Falcao, di Maria, Schneiderlin, Darmian... The list goes on. At some stage, most of these players have declined to an extent where they're completely useless on a football field, and it all occurred with the great brick layer at the helm. I don't think it's a coincidence. Something is wrong at our club, but we refuse to address it.

1712~~~
I enjoy a good discussion on here but being labeled 'embarrassing' when I'm merely telling the truth is a bit daft. It seems alot of people don't want to face reality at the moment. Probably the same people who continue to clap Van Gaal into the tunnel after each defeat.

1713~~~
Plain and simple, he isn't starter quality for a top side - that's not to say he is not a good player to have in the squad. I much prefer him out on the right than Mata. It's a sad state though when he is starting games over people that perhaps can produce moments of a lot higher quality but, because Lingard gives a bit more in terms of middling consistency than say a Memphis or a Januzaj, he gets to start.

He should stay in the team even if at some point we can get a top right side player because he is a useful option to have in case of injuries, to give players a rest or inject a bit of intensity when required in games over say bringing in another defender or a Mata off the bench.

1714~~~
possibly the least talented player in our entire squad, its absolutely disgraceful that he is starting games for manchester united. 

he wouldnt make it into a match day 18 in any other top side and would struggle to make the starting 11 of many teams towards the bottom. yet another really bizzare feature of LVG reign, how he keeps playing him and leaving memphis out of the team, because Lingard works harder, yet has absolutely zero end product 90% of the time.

1715~~~
Ive seen this line posted by other posters in other threads for numerous players <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
I see no problem with him being in our squad but I dont like the way we use him and rely on him so much when hes not a Ronaldo type of player. Hes clearly more suited to a team game type (if that makes sense).

1716~~~
If Lingard got 0 end product 90% of the time, then Memephis got 0 end product 100% of the time.

1717~~~
How has he kept his place tonight while Varela & Morgan have been dropped/rotated ?

1718~~~
Morgan was dismal against Derby. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of his, and think he's a far better player than Lingard. But he was brutal. Lingard at least created an assist - even if he wasn't exactly fantastic himself. Basically, I don't think it's that strange he kept his place over him. I also think having 2 completely inexperienced full backs against Prem opposition  is dangerous, so Varela missing out makes some sense also.

1719~~~
It's a process...or something.

1720~~~
He got an assist which LvG wrote down on his clipboard.

1721~~~
One of the first names on the team sheet these days. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1722~~~
I've said for a long, long time that he's nowhere good enough. For me he's a) not got the ability at present, and b) broken into the first team too late.

1723~~~
What a shitty header from a shitty player.

1724~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1725~~~
So F****** glad he scored, how much I've defended this guy, the amount of hate he gets on here and then reading the pre match thread after the line ups were announced, so many couldn't understand why he started along with Fellaini.

Like Louis van Gaal said, hate the manager if you want to hate him but support the players.

This guy may not be Depay or Martial potential but he could do a pedro if he works hard, against all odds make it into our squad and prove to be a good player.

And if he doesn't then he doesn't, at least support him while he gets his chance, Louis van Gaal has a strong youth record and if he sees something then we've got to give Lingard his chance.

1726~~~
My feelings exactly.  His work rate alone should give him a starting place.  He's scoring and providing assists and he works his socks off.  So sad to see all the comments about him. No one wants to give him a chance.

1727~~~
An average championship player? Well judged on his first break through season. Oh is that him on the score sheet again?

1728~~~
Didn't you learn your lesson after mouthing off last time? Then you suddenly went quiet when it turned out he was pretty crap after all. He has scored a nice goal, hasn't set the game on fire, hold your horses.

1729~~~
Crap after all? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You make it sound like he's playing his 160th game for us not his 16th.

1730~~~
Well out of the 16 games he has played he has had what say 2-3 good games? Hardly groundbreaking stuff. Hopefully I've reverse psychologied him and he will turn into this world class player that the poster above is convinced he is.

1731~~~
lovely player, haters can feck off<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1732~~~
Even this won't shut the muppets up !
Kid has been at Utd since the age of 9 - thoroughly deserves his chance - and I for one am so happy he's taking it ... 
Pep signing for City might have an upside in taking a few of the pompom girls off here and over to the neighbours <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1733~~~
Good post

This thread and some comments on Lingard these pass few weeks are fecking awful

3 goals and 2 assists in this team in poor form takes some doing

1734~~~
Muppets because they have a different opinion to yourself? Isn't that the point of a forum. 

Still alot to be proven yet, whether thats Lingard being a success that you believe or him not being good enough in the long run which I do. Doesn't mean anyone is a 'muppet' for having a different opinion.

1735~~~
Feck off, yeah?

Shades of Darron Gibson, this. Decent young player who might not be good enough to secure himself a future, but still gives his all every time he's on the pitch. Proceeds to get abused and hated on by "supporters" for the crime of being given games by the manager.

I don't think he's referring to people who are content with stating that he's not good enough, I think he's more referring to the people who go on about him being a "shitty" or "awful" player, and/or ridiculing him for his lack of ability.

1736~~~
Pretty sure the first guy was being sarcastic given he posted it just after Lingard scored.

1737~~~
Oh, right, should have checked the time on the post. Apologies to <a class="username" data-user="65267, @RedMachine03" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65267/">@RedMachine03</a> in that case, then.

Back to watching the game.

1738~~~
Yeah people in this thread are so hilarious at best, he's young player who against all odds got into first team and did well despite didnt given chance in his best position yet.

Won like 5 freekicks and worked hard all game to, he's one touch player  who needs players around him and so he can combine and create, he's completely different to Martial and ppl try to compare him with the frenchman, incredibly stupid...

1739~~~
Finally he's there at the back post. We've had so many crosses go there game after game and no one is there to meet it. Delighted for him.

1740~~~
Goal like this one injects massive dose of confidence and he really needed that after his previous performances.

1741~~~
Beginning to think your related to him! Your love for him is way ott

1742~~~
Good movement and finish for his goal, he's clearly a limited attacker and not a long term solution on the RW, but you need reliable squad players and I still think he can be that, kind of a new Park.

1743~~~
Brilliant to see him quiet down some of the absolute tarts in this thread. Good performance again.

1744~~~
Nice goal. Had a decent game, didn't stand out etc, but his goal was key to this performance. Many games we've started well this season for 15/20 minutes, but once the goal hasn't come, performance has faltered. As <a class="username" data-user="59195, @Hed Zitin" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/59195/">@Hed Zitin</a> says above, plenty of crosses to these areas this season without players attacking them. Nice work from Jesse to do so. I said previously that I don't imagine him making it as a squad player, but hope to be proven wrong. Well, that's a nice start, good lad.

1745~~~
It just pleases me everytime he's getting on the score sheet sticking it to all you haters. Learn to support your team and players.

1746~~~
I don't know if he's best on the wing or centrally? I think the same about Adnan mind you. Took his goal really well and pleased for him. There is end product in him and we need to keep at him to keep improving. An assist and a goal in the last two games! Hope he maintains that form.

1747~~~
So glad he scored, hes had some weird criticism towards him.

1748~~~
He is a fantastic naturally confident player, he makes things happen all the time in the final 3rd, he is going to be a great player for us.

1749~~~
Think he's the sort of player who'll probably always get half decent numbers but doesn't have any outstanding qualities bar perhaps his work rate. A grafter.

He played well tonight though. I hope he proves me wrong.

1750~~~
Good post, I'm really glad he got on the score sheet today too.

1751~~~
Needs to stop that stupid fecking celebration. He looks a right knob.

1752~~~
He has best off the ball movement in the club. If he keeps working hard and doesnt became overconfident he will always have a place in our squad. Lovely player to watch when on form - eat, sleep, pass and move <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1753~~~
Really good goal actually, have seen many non strikers feck up chances like that. Gave an assist the other day while playing poorly. Good weight on some simple passes that many bad players always mess up, perhaps not everyone has noticed that. Works very hard on top of that, what's not to like?

He really is a pretty good player and my guess is we'll be very happy to have him in our squad over the next couple of years. Who cares about his age anyway - look at Vardy. Besides, he has a fragile built which has obviously hindered him, with some injuries thrown in the mix, was on loan. And he has only just turned 23 last month.

Didn't Van Gaal play him against Swansea in his first PL match as United coach by the way? Which means he clearly rated him, Jesse was only 21 years of age back then if I'm not mistaken.

1754~~~
feck it. I'd love to see it several more times this season, starting on Sunday.

1755~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1756~~~
He often gets into goalscoring positions, doesn't he? Hasn't scored a lot of goals, but he took his goal really well tonight, after a super cross from Borthwick Jackson. Good game from Jesse.

1757~~~
Always happy to see a youth player in our starting XI. Don't understand how our own fans can be so critical of a local lad who is giving 100% every single time he puts on the shirt.

I'd much rather United have Lingard than someone like Di Maria, irrespective of their talent.

1758~~~
His off the ball movement is excellent. He gets into great positions but if I'm being very honest, he is limited. 

I don't think he will be a long term regular in the team because I just don't think he has the ability to do so. However, he works hard and it looks like he follows Van Gaal's instructions directly. 

I would still prefer Memphis or Januzaj getting a chance on the right though. As I feel if we can get them playing well we would be a much better attacking team.

1759~~~
Not a bad performance from the worst player to have played for United. Ever.

1760~~~
His intelligence, movement combined with a good work ethic and disciplined defensive work should give him a place in our squad. Would definitely have been in Fergie's squads.

1761~~~
Wow, that is quite the statement.!

1762~~~
You know that is sarcasm right?

1763~~~
Oh, Sorry. Didn't know. Haven't come to this thread in a long time or the Match day threads.

1764~~~
I can finally see why he is selected over the likes of Memphis and Januzaj. On days like this, where everything goes well, he is perfect. Martial obviously got a the attention but he made himself a nuisance by working hard - getting himself a goal in result. Dragged players away for Martials goal and picked Martial out for the third.

He is not flashy at all not outstanding physically or technically but he shows more effort and desire compared to the more talented Memphis or Januzaj. I wouldn't want him to be a long term starter, but he's good enough as a squad player.

1765~~~
So let me get this straight, you don't contribute any meaningful contribution to the thread, just pop in to gloat to me everytime he scores only to go missing afterwards when he plays rubbish. Isn't the Caf lucky to have posters like you.

Of course I support the team and players, why wouldn't I? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> At the same time I can freely admit when someone isn't good enough, maybe if you took you're tinted glasses off you could see that to. But anyways, the good news is you have earned yourself a golden ticket to my block list, congratulations!

1766~~~
I thought he was average. He's on the wing, has pace, yet never troubles his full back. He attempted zero take ons today. He has no particularly special qualities. Good work rate and that's about it. He's an average player really.

Good he scored, although his marker just stood still.

I'll probably get tons of negative comments for what I've said, but be honest with yourselves... if he was playing for Arsenal or City would any of you rate him?

Not that we have much better options on the wing, but if we finally do get our act together he should be sold really. At best he's a squad player.

1767~~~
Sshhh. Perspective is not allowed in this thread because he is local and young apparently.

1768~~~
Yeah, looking back at the thread I see if you don't rate him you're deemed a hater. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> As if all us who don't rate him won't support him and wouldn't love to be proven wrong and Lingard become a top player.

Sticking my neck out... Lingard is Cleverley Mark II. Over hyped because of coming through the youth team, then eventually will be seen as average.

1769~~~
Bye bye

1770~~~
Exactly, We would all love Lingard to become a top player, don't think anyone on this forum dislikes him personally, to be called a 'hater' is just daft and childish.

Yeah I agree, he has got Cleverly / Kieran Richardson written all over him. If I was the gloating type like some in here I'd save some of the quotes in this thread for the day he gets sold by a competent manager (especially from that absolute idiot poster above), but hey I've got better things to do.

1771~~~
He was actually very meh apart from his goal. We need so much better, we really do.

1772~~~
You are right. One goal doesnt change the fact that he's average at best. Just look how brilliant our attacking players did yesterday and what his impact was. He just does not offer enough or is involved enough to be a starter for United, and getting carried away by a goal doesnt help. Just keep in mind all the chances he blew this season (and which cost us)

1773~~~
There is no way he would start for another top team. He will become a squad player at best

1774~~~
He would be an ok squad player at the very best if we sort ourselves out. I just don't rate the lad and don't get why people on here get so carried away when he gets a goal.

1775~~~
Yeah I'm an idiot for reserving judgement  and having a little dig everytime he scores or does something meaningful.  Wish I could have seen your face when he scored

My argument is that he's only just broken into the team and is doing fantastic.  Let's give him half a chance yeah instead of writing him of like 80% of fans on here.  He gives our team balance.

1776~~~
If he is doing fantastic then God help us.

1777~~~
They dont see beyond that. They think if someone scored a goal he's brilliant. As others pointed out, zero take ons, hardly any good passes or chances created by him - he just doesnt bring enough to the team

1778~~~
That makes you the gloating type.

1779~~~
Stoke let him find space and that is when he is effective but it also seemed like LVG gave him license to roam.

1780~~~
His celebration is shite.

1781~~~
Well he is doing a really solid job.  And scoring 3 plus 2 assists for a team that has scored 31 goal in 24 matches in the league is a good record for is full debut season..

1782~~~
He's just the sort of player we need, just a shame he's not of the required quality for a Man Utd first teamer. At least he shouldn't be.

Still, lively player, good squad player. I like him.

1783~~~
Sort of this.

1784~~~
So often his ability is called out as not as good as Januzaj's or Memphis's (which it isn't) and people will take it like a personal insult. That said, thought he had a good game last night and he's a very nice squad player to have, I like him being at the club as he seems to love United and having people round the area and from the academy is always something United have done. Very glad he's with us and I hope his contributions continue until Januzaj and Memphis regain their spots!

1785~~~
Just saw he got MOTM at the end of the game... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1786~~~
Aren't his personal scoring and assists stats one of the reasons why we have such a terrible goal scoring return?

1787~~~
He takes up decent positions but his overall contribution is pretty poor. If all we needed was a player with good movement, Hernandez should never have been let go.

1788~~~
No one calls anyone out for that. 

People call posters out for saying stuff like 'he's shit and wouldn't get a game for an Azerbaijanian amateur side' or words to that effect.

1789~~~
Wow, a lot of people are really down on him. He's agile, with quick feet, can link up well and is starting to have more confidence. His decision making, as with most young players, can improve a lot. But he's been more impressive than Memphis...

1790~~~
His movement is good alright but people are clinging to that. It's not as if it's absolutely brilliant. He doesn't have enough to be a starter here.

1791~~~
I would agree but I don't get why people are hard on him or LVG for starting him.

He's not starting games because he works hard. He's starting games because everyone else has been crap. Mata hasn't scored or assisted for fecking ages now, Herrera has been poor, Depay has been dogshite, Young is injured and Januzaj is not fit enough.

Loads of "ffs Lingard starts" posts in the match day. Complete and utter loons, the lot of them.

1792~~~
Redcafe posters can be unbelievably ridiculous. Since when have we now started to try and discredit the goals of our own players??  He may not have world class potential, but lets be happy that he got us the goal for us to go 1 up when we desperately needed it.

1793~~~
Mata's goal against Derby doesn't count for some reason? Not saying I don't agree with the reasoning for playing Fellaini etc ..

1794~~~
Has been pretty average since he switched over to the right.

1795~~~
He is an intelligent player but he's just not that good. He played ok today, and his goal was well taken, but in the long run he isn't going to be a player you'd fit into a champions league contending starting xi. He isn't good enough to start for England either, really.

1796~~~
At the moment we have maybe 2-3 players of such quality so he fits perfectly in thus far.

1797~~~
Really? De Gea, Smalling, Schweinsteiger, Martial, Mata, Herrera, Rooney (as of 2016)? Not all players who could start in a strong champions league squad?

1798~~~
did he take on his man last night at all?

he seemed to take the safe option all too often, playing square balls inside and I think Darmian was actually more productive going forward...tidy enough player and took his goal well but he is a squad player at best and someone I'd like to have as 3rd or 4th choice at RW

I think his best game for us was vrs CSKA where he was fearless and what he lacked in quality he made up in desire and bravery......maybe he just knows his limitations though

1799~~~
Contending for it? No.

Smalling, de Gea, Martial probably yes, rest, given form this season, not a chance.

1800~~~
Because they're all spoilt brats and rather see a Di Maria type player in the squad....

1801~~~
i think lingard is getting slighted by fans who are wanting/hoping to see memphis or januzaj given a shot. if neither of those were available, i'd suspect people would be a bit more forgiving of him.

then again, what do i know...

1802~~~
He had a good showing last night, one thing that was telling was his defensive contribution in the second half, him and Darmian hardly gave Arnautovic a moments peace and on a left side of Stoke's containing him and Pieters, neither were found wanting physically. I would like to see how much running he got through because it seemed like he was always closing down.

1803~~~
exactly this....imagine if we got a fantastic RW in the squad.

1804~~~
I love seeing him succeed. He will be an excellent member of our first team squad for years to come.

1805~~~
Yes, on my part I admit I rate their potential higher and would like them to get more game time than Lingard. That's probably why I haven't taken to him.

He had a good game yesterday, everybody did. He has good movement and good workrate. But still I felt the other three attacking players were better. Maybe he can push on and build on this performance, I just can't see him being a starter here for years to come.
He could be a squad player here but we need a player a tier above him to be a regular in that RW role. Look at the left wing, the directness and quality that can unsettle a defence any time the ball is there. I feel the RW position is the most important one to fill going forward, a threat on both wings stretches defences and opens up spaces.

1806~~~
i agree, but then again i'm admittedly biased in favour of adnan. i see far more potential for him when he isn't limited to five minute cameos playing left back.

1807~~~
He might be in the squad but no way should be starting for us next season. Our RW options are limited at the moment so it's fair enough but he's nowhere near the required standard to regularly start for us.

1808~~~
He is better on the left than he is on the right. He hadn't even played much on the right in his youth days. He predominantly played no.10 or on the left. 

I don't know what it is but when he plays on the right he doesn't seem to take anyone on at all. His movement is still good from that side and he works hard and tracks back well but I don't think he does enough going forward when playing on the right. 

I personally would like to see Memphis or Januzaj given a go on the right but LVG seems to like him there it seems.

1809~~~
Teachers pet,  f ur 'dab' celebration, CBJ deserves all the credit.

1810~~~
I think it's through more of a need at the moment. If we had a Mane or a Moura imoJesse would be out.

1811~~~
Think that's the difference between Lingaard and Memphis/Januzaj and probably the reason Nani was let go. Lingaard actually tracks back and works for the team and LVG likes that in his players. 

That's why he's getting the nod. Attacking ability, he certainly not the best in the bunch, but his overall contribution is far better.

1812~~~
Every good team needs a Lingard. He reminds me of your Pedro type player. As far as I'm concerned the  Memphis and Adnan have a better chance of replacing Martial if they want minutes. We all know that ain't going to happen. 

Proud of Lingard though. Hope he keeps it up and stays in the team until the end of the season.

1813~~~
I think you should watch some sport which is not that hard to understand, like darts.. it's really appalling how some people can't see what he brings into the mix, he's not a world class player but very good player indeed, also very consistent performer and with hardwork avoiding injuries he can have career with us like Fletcher had who at his peak was fantastic player to have and everybody thought he was not good enough.

Not everyone is strong dribbler like Martial who is currently one of the best young players in the world hitting wonderful form.. players have different qualities than dribbling which is obviously flashy skill which catches the eye, last time Mata took on a player? Never

1814~~~
I said first team squad. I never said starter

1815~~~
He's our Pedro <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1816~~~
If his finishing was even a little bit better then he'd scored atleast three four goals more. He gets into very good goal scoring positions, just need to improve finishing.

He thinks United have won 12 league titles. How can he spend most of his life playing at a club and not know the basics?

1819~~~
First off, don't act you're an expert in the sporting field by telling me to watch a sport that's easier to 'understand'. Like myself, you're a nobody, not some former player with medals to his name. I'm not the only one who doesn't rate Lingard. I guess we should all watch Darts as we can't see whatever it is he supposedly brings?

Second of all I feel he brings very little, end of. That's my opinion. He does nothing out of the ordinary. Yeah, it's so appalling that people can't see this 'very good player' who brings so much... yet does so little. He didn't even attempt to take a man on against Stoke. He's average to decent, imo. We need far better than him on the wing to get anywhere.

If we ask the supporters of other teams on this forum do you really many of them would take him at their respective teams?

1820~~~
This is my main problem with him. He's a tidy enough player but doesnt seem to have the beating of a man at all, and we can't rely solely on Martial to be the man to run at and commit players. When Martial has an off day as we have seen we really struggle to break down defences.

1821~~~
this
He offers so much to the team and we play much better football when he is in the side, but hey....he isnt a dribbler nor a great goalscorer so he must be average. If he doesnt became overconfident and he keeps playing same as he is playing now he will always have a spot in our squad. 
Best movement in the squad(of course half the fans dont see it, probably the same people that slated Carrick back in the day when his passing wasnt on a high level(he still contributed so much to the team because he is much more then a quality passer)), works hard, good technique, good decision making and pretty composed in possession. He is probably the ideal team player, pretty sure everyone enjoys playing with him.

1822~~~
you're just stupid little asshole who never kicked a football, it would be even more stupid to try to lead an argument with you, I tried to explain, give you a hint how to evaluate a player yet you just do the same mistake again... Smalling is fecking cnut as he cant take on a player, sell him to China, defo not good enough.. this is not Fifa mate, you jsut dont hold sprint and go past players, its a team game and every player is a part of it.

And by the fecking way, why in the hell would I need to win medals and have a name to understand game of football.. there are some terrible pundits out there as well who won almost everything

1823~~~
His first breakthrough season. His current performance elevates him into a good squad member. Injury permitted, it is next season where he should be able to fully release his potential, and spectators to make proper judgement.

1824~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Getting all wound up over a footballer. Take a chill pill, you dingbat. 'A hint how to evaluate a player' as if you're an expert. Lingard is a winger and fails to beat men, the comparison to Smalling is just stupid. Of course, I'm not surprised you'd come out with it.

There is more than me who doesn't rate Lingard. I guess you better tell them how to evaluate a player as we all clearly don't analyse expertly.

Stop acting like an expert. You're just a no mark forum poster like us all, not some expert analyser.

1825~~~
Thankfully there is a lot more to football than taking on a man. He drew 4 fouls against Stoke from his dribbling anyway.

1826~~~
Couple of very arrogant posts in a row from you. What is that saying... Attack the post, not the poster.

1827~~~
Good luck Lingard, 'break a leg' <span style="color: #ffffff">literally</span>

1828~~~
Wow okay...

1829~~~
Da feck is this shit?

1830~~~
I'd rather have Cleverley than this guy!

1831~~~
Who exactly is doing well out of the forward line? Mata, non existent. Rooney? Given the ball away every time he's had it. Martial has tried running at them alright, but has then given the ball away quite often. Why single Lingard out?

1832~~~
Mata has played well as has Martial. Rooney has not got the legs to run the channels but is linking up ok. Every time Lingard gets the ball it backwards and side wards. He's kidding himself on out there. His best chance is getting on the end of a cross as everywhere else he's stone average. Never United standard CBJ is looking like how a youngster should coming through the ranks (desire and hunger and plenty ability) Lingard looks afraid to do anything either that he hasn't got it in his locker.

1833~~~
He's not at the races today and up against a solid Azpilicueta

1834~~~
What's today's excuse for him then?

1835~~~
I think he's been decent tbh, linking up well with Darmian.

1836~~~
Nothing player. He'd get a few goals here and there. But he is literally no threat.

1837~~~
Mata has been an absolute passenger. Done nothing. Martial has run at them a bit but given the ball away very badly a few times, so I don't think you can say he's played well. Rooney has given the ball away nearly every time he's had it! Lingard has at least kept the ball, and most of our decent play came down the right side between he and Darmian.

1838~~~
Too timid at times. Need to show more intent and use the ball better when he gets it.

1839~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Lowering the standard effectively.

1840~~~
Doesn't offer nearly enough for me.  I am all for our youth players getting their chance, but Lingard is not that young.  I can't see him becoming a better player than what he is offering now which is one dimensional.  It's a shame but we have to get our attack sorted.

1841~~~
My thoughts exactly. Along with a nice flick on every now and then. He's basically no threat whatsoever. He epitomises average.

1842~~~
Very poor. Really disappointed with him. The last few performances haven't even been squad player standard which is what I hoped for him. If only we had someone like Januzaj to bring on

1843~~~
We've got Memphis.

1844~~~
Jesse is a limited player trying his best. The real question should be why we don't have a much better option in the squad.

1845~~~
He does some tidy things but it's not enough really. I don't mind him getting chances but he's now starting every game, and his performances don't deserve that at all. No idea why we refuse to use a talent like Januzaj.

1846~~~
Memphis should have been that better option but that hasn't worked out well so far.

1847~~~
He's either being to cautious, is too afraid to really run at players or just isn't capable. Think it's wrong to write him off too early, but he's got a lot of developing to do.

1848~~~
Not sure that's a god thing. Lingard is only fecking up the attack as it stands. Memohis is usually shit at everything.

1849~~~
He does nothing. Absolutely nothing. Does not run with the ball, cannot beat his man with pace or trickery, cannot play penetrative passes. Really don't understand why he starts over Januzaj or Periera or Memphis.

1850~~~
True. He's not been given enough chances lately IMO. I thought there were signs he was turning it around against Shef Utd and Newcastle

1851~~~
Hard for a player of his age to maintain composure. Hope he settles down and can have more influence moving forward. If not, I expect him to get substituted.

1852~~~
Not sure what his age got to do with it. He's 23, not a young teenager.

1853~~~
He's not good enough for us. There I said it.

1854~~~
Better start to the second half

1855~~~
Providing a threat now. Much better Jesse!

1856~~~
Looks painful for Zouma

1857~~~
How many times did you play against Chelsea before you turned 23?

1858~~~
What are you jabbering on about now? 

He's not a young kid.

1859~~~
Get out of here LLMU you are drunk.

Well bloody done!!

1862~~~
GET IN JESSE!

1863~~~
He is ffs. It's his first season with a prominent role in the main squad.

1864~~~
A goal out of nowhere.

1865~~~
So here I am again!!! Yes Jesse!!!

1866~~~
yeah he does absolutely nothing

1867~~~
fecking average, shit fecking cnut.

1868~~~
I'll be damned. What a goal

1874~~~
Mic drop

1875~~~
Berbatov-esque that.

1876~~~
People keep doubting him, if he had Lingardinho on the back of his shirt we'd be talking about him like he was Adnan Januzaj, Memphis Depay or Anthony Martial. 

Louis van Gaal knows about youth, he's seen something he likes, he has given him a lot of chances and he does that only when you show it in training.

1877~~~
Wow, what a goal.  I guess I don't know what I am talking about.  (Still isn't doing enough in open play to develop our attacks...)

1878~~~
Limited. Championship level. 
Lets play Memphis instead. He is so much better.. He cost us monies.

1879~~~
Very limited? Yeah mate sureeee

1880~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1881~~~
I'm one of his critics but credit where it's due 

Fantastic goal, fair play to the lad

1882~~~
That's him dropped for the next game then.

1883~~~
Wow, that's a genuinely great goal.

1884~~~
<a class="username" data-user="51833, @Bojan11" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51833/">@Bojan11</a> yes yes yes!!!

Get in Jesse. I like him.. works hard and capable of scoring goals.

1887~~~
Superb goal. He's looked a bit better in the second half after being a bit shit in the first.

1888~~~
Weird celebration haha

What a goal! 

Good performance!

1889~~~
So rare to see a comment like this...well done

1890~~~
I didn't say very limited I said limited and I stand by that. Doesn't stop me supporting him and recognising what he brings to the team. Park was limited too.

What a goal! Weird player to figure out for me.

1893~~~
Isn't it that "dabbing" dance?

1894~~~
Nothing championship level about that finish.

1895~~~
Super goal. A shame it didnt win the game.

1896~~~
Great turn and fantastic finish for the goal.

1897~~~
Can't work out if he's a great finisher or not.

1898~~~
Took his goal very well, credit to him he seems to know where the goal is. Still don't think he is good enough overall though.

1899~~~
great goal , needs to stop pulling out of challenges.

1900~~~
Mixed performance. Great goal and better second half but a lot of the time he's pointless out there. Should be a squad player if we actually any quality in the squad.

1901~~~
Nice goal.

1902~~~
Played well and scored a great goal today. Getting better all the time, still not technically the best but he gets the job done.

1903~~~
great goal, but right wing is somewhere we ideally need to improve over the summer.

There is no creativity from the right side, we're completely reliant on the left to make our goals

1904~~~
Great goal, so-so performance, I still feel he's on course be a useful squad player for us which is important as depth is vital in the PL.

1905~~~
Well put

1906~~~
I don't rate him, but his goal was fantastic!

1907~~~
What game did you watch? He scored a great goal but was a passenger all match!

1908~~~
Great goal lad, well done.

Are you watching Memphis?

1909~~~
Lovely goal but another meh performance.

1910~~~
Jesse>Pedro

1911~~~
Great goal but still not good enough to be playing for United if we want to be back to our best.

1912~~~
Has one or two good moments, today was a fantastic one.
His overall game is average at best sadly.

1913~~~
Funny how constantly average his performances are but we question the manager for taking him off. 
People tend to ignore the fact that LVG rated him from day one. To those of us that are yet to be convinced, we SHALL be better served letting him continue and accept there is more to him than we are seeing.

1914~~~
Very nice goal and well taken too, I like him he's a decent player.

1915~~~
Martial didnt have the best of games either and didnt score a goal like Jesse. Enough said

1916~~~
So glad he scored, he get some weird odd criticism at times. Its like this forum must have somebody to blame.

1917~~~
Van Gaal even said after the game that Lingard was poor today, so it's hardly out of nowhere.

1918~~~
Good goal, he's a trier, always space for a trier in our squad but he shouldn't be starting every game and the fact he is, is part of the massive problem at our club atm. The alternative is basically Memphis, which again, speaks a lot about our club atm.

1919~~~
I don't think much of this guy but that goal was fantastic.
Dare I say it, it is one of the best goals we have scored this season...if not the best.

1920~~~
Well taken goal and had another good shot but other than that disappeared for the remainder of the match.
We need a top quality player to fill his position.

Been watching him closely last few matches and the same applies in virtually every match, seems weak physically, doesn't want to run much at players and quite often defensively you see him going in the opposite direction to where he should, shirking responsibility?

1921~~~

1922~~~
Would have been better in the Rooney thread!

1923~~~
Beginning to think you only post when you're drunk!

1924~~~
Think he's in the Welbeck mold. Probably not quite good enough but offers something different to the team that we don't have at the moment making him very useful. His movement and quick passing is exactly what we need.

1925~~~
It was a moment of brilliance, but he was anonymous for the rest of the game.

1926~~~
A shame I have to resort to this but his replacement didn't light the pitch up either. If United had played poorly credit would have been given to Chelsea, wonder why we are all choosing to ignore he and Cesar(name a better FB in the league) nullified eachother. Even with that he managed to free himself up and bag a goal.

1927~~~
Great goal, happy for Jesse.

Saying that, I can't ever see him being more than a decent squad player for us in the future, but it's nice to have him in the team.

1928~~~
You're obsessed to respond to my comments or what?

Martial certainly didnt have have the best of games. Ivanovic was on top of him, but yeah everybody loves Anthony Martial so ppl forgive him easily. And Lingard scored despite being quite poor, how hard is it to understand that?

1929~~~
he has what we are desperate for at the moment which is a bit of pace, and legs to stretch the opposition. Clearly doing more than Memphis so credit to him for keeping a summer signing out

1930~~~
Earlier, I thought he was really good, against City, Watford etc. He's now been quite anonymous, for a while, but popping up with some very important goals.

I want to say he's average, but there's something I like about the guy. I'd say he's a better version of Ashley Young.

1931~~~
He's not better than Ashley Young in my opinion, not yet anyway.

Young has proven to be a very useful player for us over the last couple of years.

1932~~~
Coming into this thread is always so disappointing. Somebody has decided early doors that Lingard is "limited"....whatever that is supposed to mean and now that has to be either the stick to beat him with or the caveat when he does well. 

He is still relatively young and in the middle of his first season. He has good movement, a bit of pace, really solid technique as you'd expect from one of our youth products and he is chipping in with goals and assists. Wtf do some of you want? Why can't we enjoy watching one of our own grow and develop? Not one of us can say he's limited because we can't see in to the future and how he'll progress. Let's not compare him to any of the greats because then he will look limited. He's only at the start of his journey. Let's see at the end of it....

1933~~~
I think he's pretty average, but I don't think he's a wide player. He's a finisher not a creator. 

He's a poor mans Thomas Muller.

1934~~~
Fantastic goal, he is a great player, very smart and very confident, he will only get better.

1935~~~
I think we need to be patient regarding performances. He's never struck me as a typical winger because basically he isn't. He's better centrally I think. He's a good runner with the ball and has pretty good end product. People need to stop judging so quickly. What is positive is the end product - we just need to get him more involved. Having said that much of our play goes through Martial on the other side so he won't be dominating on the wing anyway as we'll always favor Martials side.

1936~~~
There are quite a few posts mentioning that he has pace. Don't see it myself. For a winger/wide player he is not quick. Maybe he just seems quick after watching Mata on the right for most of the season.

1937~~~
Credit where it's due, I gave him shit before for missing some chances in earlier matches. His nerves have settled and he's showcasing some excellent finishing.

Certainly deserves a place in the squad but we need to invest in that right wing position.

1938~~~
He's quick across the floor, has decent feet, good movement and good technique but he doesn't possess great dribbling/isolation ability nor is he in a team that can afford those situations (i.e you'll have to be immensely gifted like Martial because we get shut down too easily due our slow ball movement). Basically if he was running onto a ball off a defender's shoulder he would absolutely be favourite in the majority of situations and if it was shoulder to shoulder he would do alright but probably not get past that defender if they have a bit of pace too i.e he would be able to recycle possession (but at least be further up the field).

1939~~~
In fairness if we get our business done right in the summer neither would be starting for us next season.

1940~~~
Fantastic finish.

1941~~~
Great player, really though?

1942~~~
Yeah I agree with the Ashley Young comparison, I said it at the start of the season that Young is his ceiling and that isn't a bad level to aspire to. The people saying he is 'our Pedro' is stretching things mind..

1943~~~
The Pedro comparison is just really lazy to be honest. This is a guy who has won it all with Barca and scored a ridiculous amount of goals for them, especially given that he was never really a starter. Pedro has flopped badly at Chelsea but he was an extremely effective player for Barcelona. I get what people are trying to say, but I just don't agree with the comparison. Lingard to us, is what Joel Campell currently is to Arsenal.

Lingrad, before his goal yesterday, was once again extremely average and pretty much a passenger in the game. He's done well for himself, all things considered, but he's just such a painfully average player.

1944~~~
I hate to have to agree with that, given his great goal bit it's true!

When he can score bread and butter goals instead of missing sitters, take players on regularly and beat them then I might see him as a Utd player but sadly he falls short. Hope I'm proved wrong though

1945~~~
He doesn't have enough pace or strength to beat a man on the wing which is the crucial point. He is one of those players that doesn't really have a position nailed down. I suppose he is only effective a wide forward in a front three which is quite specific. 

I think we would get a decent fee for him and think selling him would be the best idea.

1946~~~
Bad first half, excellent second half.

1947~~~
People always have this idea that everything will be sorted "next summer", which has never been the case.There are always signings that not turn out to be that good, and there are always players at the club that suddenly raise their games to the next level.

1948~~~
Said it in the match day thread, but it reminded me a lot of this for some reason :

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1JB6WJ5eFU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1949~~~
Nani <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

As for Lingard, fantastic goal and he's a consistent goal threat but his overall play during the game simply is non existent. He's just not a very good winger tbh. Would be interesting to see him being played upfront though.

1950~~~
You would hand on heart say he had an excellent second half? Bar his goal, he was once again pretty anonymous. If you would honestly call that second half an "excellent" performance, then feck me. Each to their own, though.

1951~~~
Well, it was an improvement. The goal was excellent.

1952~~~
I would say he could be a decent squad player for us. Our attack is what it is though, thus he starts. I mean, he's been better than Memphis.

1953~~~
This, essentially.

1954~~~
First thing I thought as well.

As for Lingard: He isn't and will never be an archetypal winger, he is more of a link man for creating triangles and moving off the ball.
Our right side is better with him in the team than with Mata playing the role, whilst Mata may be a technically better player, and we see a lot more play down that flank than we do when he isn't present (our right has been a weakness all season). He currently makes for a better team and offers a genuine goal threat largely lacking outside of Martial and Rooney.

1955~~~
An improvement aye, notwithstanding the fact that he was awful in the first half. The goal was fantastic but his overall play was still poor, imo.

1956~~~
I'd play anyone on the right ahead of Mata. For me Mata on the right is utterly wasted, never liked him in that position.

1957~~~
Can't agree. Young has been completely average since the first half of 11/12.

1958~~~
Brilliantly taken goal yesterday, really happy for him.

LVG is managing to make the most of his attributes. He's turning out to be a Darren Fletcher type player - a solid but unspectacular (though his goal yesterday certainly was!) squad player that can turn out to be very important for us in big games.

1959~~~
If you keep stating things I disagree with I shall respond. Martial was our biggest attacking outlet yesterday. Lingard was poor apart from the goal.

1960~~~
Couldn't agree more although there are many players around that are better than Lingard for that position so we need to buy one!

1961~~~
As I've said before, he is better on the left than on the right. He's a decent player. 

He can get into great positions and is a goal threat.

1962~~~
He created very good chance for himself in the opening minutes, but everyone was really good in the first 20 minutes, apart that he lost quite a few balls as he was trying to go past Ivanovic, didnt happen a single time for the rest of the game, he was also absolutely invisible second half, not sure what you're talking about.. he might rip another defender next game but they prepared for him and deleted him from the game, they were not able to mark Lingard when he scored and almost won us game though..

1963~~~
I just love his goal celebration. What is that he's doing btw?

Goal reminded me a lot of Macheda vs Villa a couple of years ago.

1964~~~
We wouldn't be doing due diligence if we didn't look to get in a better #9 and better RWF than the two currently playing there, I like Lingard but I think squad player is the role he'll have here.

1965~~~
Without a doubt we'll get a new winger in unless Memphis/Januzaj somehow up their games at some point.However I don't think it's that obvious that the new signing will automatically set the league alight so it's too early to dismiss the players we have.

1966~~~
Obviously there is no guarantees of anything much in sport, but there are players clearly a lot more talented than Lingard out there, if he can somehow outperform them then great, but I haven't seen anything to suggest he's a player who can start week after week if we intend for this to become a PL challenging side.

1967~~~
Jesse's goal was superb.  When it comes to forwards, I'm not looking for consistently great play over 90+ minutes as much as I am the ability to strike the dagger in the heart at any moment in time.  The other 8-9 outfield players have to be consistently good throughout a match to keep the team in a position to allow your forwards to take well the one or two chances they're going to get.

The goal celebration, though, should be ditched.

1968~~~
Reminds me a lot of our own, "3 Lungs Park"? 
Good defensively... Physically not a monster.. Follows Tactics.. nothing special.. Has a knack of scoring the important goals...

1969~~~
Really! like those important goals against PSV and Newcastle?<img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1970~~~
It's Cam Newton's not his, not as bad as Sturridge's

1971~~~
What you're implying there is really harsh on any player let alone an inexperienced player, besides which he <i>did</i> score an important goal against Newcastle.

1972~~~
But missed an easier chance that would have sealed 3 points.

It's hardly harsh mate. he's well paid to hit the back of a net from less than 10 yards out; he doesn't often enough.How's that harsh? Bottom line. He's mowhere near enough good for Utd

1973~~~
How many of our attacking players can you not attribute at least 1 or 2 bad misses against this season? It's a harsh thing to hold against him, especially in a game where he also scored a nice goal.

Bottom line <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1974~~~
Only Memphis scored against PSV. 

Of Lingard's four goals, three have been the opening goals of the game (West Brom, Stoke and Chelsea). The goal against Newcastle put us 2-0 up.
Considering the difficulty we have with scoring goals, opening the scoring can be considered pretty important.

1975~~~
He could become 'our Pedro' though and it's lazy but not neccesarily an inaccurate comparison. His ceiling might be a 'Young' but he doesn't play like Young, his movement is more an inside forward. The potential for Lingard is if he plays in a fully firing Utd team (i.e a much better one than now) fitting in where neccessary but obviously he's probably not going to be good enough to absolute first team choice. I guess the difference is that apart from your generic 'good' utlity man, he's one of our own, thus 'belongs' more and I'd like to see him grow with the team. People like Campell are equally/more talented but his mindset might be elsewhere if he's not getting the games. I don't think that's the case with Lingard and in the long term a Pedro comparison can be apt. 

Pedro's talent shouldn't be overshadowed by his Chelsea outings but likewise it shouldn't cloud his failings/also not playing in the same system or with the same calibre of Barca players. Obvious to say but Lingard's game will evolve playing with better players I believe and he'll fit in more due to his style (running between the lines, offering different option than a like-for-like).

1976~~~
He's doing a thing called "the dab" or dabbing or whatever. It's kinda stupid. Not sure where it came from and what it means.

1977~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTlYxakXYxc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1978~~~
There are much bigger faults in our team the Jesse but give the lad his due because he's come in for some heavy stick.  For me Rooney isn't scoring enough so we certainly need a striker come the summer.  If we can pull off a miracle and get Kane in Rooney can drop back to his number 10.  Then that leaves Martial on the left and possible another winger to complete with Jesse. 

If we get Jose in charge then that's bye bye for Mata sadly.

1979~~~
OK! Thanks for that information. I thought it was his own signature celebration. I miss an original celebration, kind of like Ravanelli with the shirt over his head.

1980~~~
Really don't understand why people aren't being so negative about that performance.

1981~~~

1982~~~
The feck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1983~~~
wow. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1984~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1985~~~
That pancake's tiny

1986~~~
Yet another lazy pass from him that results in Darmian getting injured. This sloppiness in his play is not good enough.

1987~~~
General play is just awful. 

Scoring the odd good goal is fine but his role is more than that.

1988~~~
Has been good in this recent run but after Sunderland scored, the game dynamic changed. We're chasing goals against a deep and dual layered defensive block. Lingard is good at building play and keeping it safe but he's not the best option we have at forcing a position through runs beyond the defensive line, stretching play, shooting or dribbling past a man. He can do them all but simply put, Memphis offers more than he does in those aspects.

For that reason, I'd sub him at HT for Memphis. Though that does leave Love in a very insecure position defensively. Would need the Carrick-Schneiderlin double pivot to really work hard and close the spaces necessary to cover as much as possible.

Might be better to have Rooney from the right, Martial probing centrally and Memphis wide left considering our attacks have been predominantly down the left anyway.

1989~~~
Messing up a good counter attack scenario there. Just has no brain.

1990~~~
If he had a brain he'd be dangerous.

1991~~~
Sorry lad...just not good enough.

1992~~~
Needs to be subbed off at half-time.

1993~~~
Indeed. He is awful when the opposition play a pressing game.

1994~~~
Is there a reason Marrinor is ignoring every foul on him today?

1995~~~
Because he hasn't been fouled?

1996~~~
I am quite surprised he made it that far in United.

1997~~~
Have to agree with your assessment! Maybe a semi decent squad player but he'd be nowhere near a starter in any the top 6 in the league!

1998~~~
Are you serious? 

The Sunderland full back flung him to the ground and then Rodwell took him out in the centre of the field.

1999~~~
Bringing this backup. Still think it's valid, I just think he's bang average on his all round play. His only genuine contribution that first half was nicking the ball off the Sunderland player midway through the half that set us off on a break. Obviously the boy has talent, you don't score the goals he has without it, but i'm struggling to see how he fits as a starter for us.

2000~~~
Mysterious, isn't it? He's scored and created in patches, but he's really average.

2001~~~
Sick of seeing average shits like Lingard getting regular games for the club. Not good enough.

2002~~~
Maybe it's just me having a bad memory but there seems to be an issue with the right wing in general.

2003~~~
You know what pisses me off Shammers?

It's been fecking awful for years. We've not had a good right wing since Valencias form tailed off. Rubbish RB's and terrible wingers.

2004~~~
There's that but also whoever we put on the right wing just seems to have very little impact on the game while the left winger gets a lot of the ball. As I write this Martial nearly gets an assist <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

2005~~~
The amount of time we've had to try and sort it out though. We've had 3 managers and none of them have fixed it (it was shite under Sir Alex in his final years too).

Every transfer window I write "Right Winger needed". Never happens <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2006~~~
He's just decent. Works hard, is fairly tidy, can pop up with a goal. We need a much bigger threat from our RW.

2007~~~
Didn't really do anything today, couldn't believe we put our best player on the right where he was totally out of the game.

2008~~~
Poor today but as noted above, there seems to be an issue with the right regardless of who plays there. Martial went from dangerous to virtually anonymous in an instant when shifted across.

2009~~~
Because Martial isn't a RW. Lingard is the only RW we have at the club and he's not good enough to be in the IX.

2010~~~
His movement off the ball is good but when asked to run with it and be a creative foil he struggles, case in point today.

2011~~~
Pretty much. Decent squad player at best.

2012~~~
Is Lingard a RW? I've seen him play across the pitch for the reserves (LW, RW, #10, AM) and he always appeared more comfortable on the left or more central.

My point was that irrespective of who has played the RW position they have tended to underwhelm aside from the odd game here and there. Mata, Martial and Lingard have struggled to get a consistent foothold in games and offer much of a threat. How much of the blame is down to those individuals (none of which have looked good enough for the IX while playing that particular role IMO) and how much may be a result of more fundamental issues in our play is an interesting point of discussion.

2013~~~
Mane and Moura should have both been signed and weren't!

2014~~~
Yes, he is a fantastic player with a great football brain and very confident, he was always going to make it here not matter who the manager was.

2015~~~
I'd like to keep Jesse around, seems a good lad, versatile, and has an eye for goal.

But is he a player that should be starting week in, week out for United? No.

2016~~~
Good job you're not a football scout isn't it.

2017~~~
The Cleverly of the RW. I'm not sure if it's harsh on Cleverly. Meh player that is all.

2018~~~
I forgot he was on the pitch until he was substituted.

2019~~~
I was going to say the same thing. He is, he's another Cleverly, fine for Everton although not a top five player. Lingard will go eventually...we all know that.

2020~~~
He wouldn't get in Everton's team, I don't think he'd get in many teams in the league to be honest. It's actually mental that he's regularly starting for us. Not his fault that he's painfully average and it says more about the club as a whole that we don't actually have a recognised right winger in the whole first team squad.

2021~~~
Nor you... opinions opinions, I have been following the youth academy players extensively for the past 20 years and he is a nailed on Manchester United player, as a courtesy I would suggest some opinions are a bit muddied during this shit tenure of the current manager, time will tell obviously, but given his progress to date I am very much looking at a future United team with him involved in it, regardless of the manager because of his confidence, composure and football intelligence.  If you cannot see that, honestly in footballing terms you are blind.

2022~~~
As a starter or a squad player?

2023~~~
West Ham or Newcastle?

2024~~~
Good question, that would depend on just how much he develops and evolves and who we might sign, but at a minimum he will be a squad player even in a PL or CL winning team, local players with that ability like the class of '92 are gold given their commitment to the club, but honestly he has that confidence in him, nothing phases him, he is a twig but he is brave, his composure is immense, he can become a leading player given the right circumstances andn the trajectory he is on.  Very surprised to see any criticism of him, he has been one of the bright sparks along with Martial in this shit pile of a season.

2025~~~
Don't rate him as good enough or potentially good enough for here?

2026~~~
Just doesn't do enough, and he's not 19 or 20 - he's 23, just has no strength and disappears for long periods in matches. Having about a 30 second impact on every match is not good enough

2027~~~
How the hell is he starting I have no idea. This lad will be in the championship very shortly.

2028~~~
I honestly thought this was the Depay thread... My comment was tongue in cheek, regardless.

As for Lingard, I'm going to hold back on my judgement just yet. I think he's got something about him... don't know what.

2029~~~
Fair enough, Depay came to mind also, he cost £25m and has been nowhere near as productive as Jesse but yet Jesse gets criticism, I think Depay will work out btw, these are very young players and they have massive futures here, why I speak up for Jesse so much is that when Depay and Martial run amok, there is the threat of them leaving like ronaldo, Jesse is unlikely to, he grew up here as a kid, like Giggs, Butt, the Nevilles etc, he is very like a class of '92 graduate in a very different era and it is a breath of fresh air.

2030~~~
Its his fault Darmian is out. That was literally the definition of a hospital pass.

I've always liked Jesse and his style of play but you worry for him considering we know there will be wholesale changes in attacking positions this summer.

2031~~~
is he playing?

2032~~~
Yep, set up the goal. Sit back down.

2033~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2035~~~
that is NOT how friends talk to friends, sister!

2036~~~
He also played a lovely pass for Memphis' first chance.

2037~~~
Oh dear. There's been a trend this season of Jesse missing guilt edged chances for us at important moments, only to see us regret it shortly afterwards.

2038~~~
yeah. Best pass of the game to Memphis and a good cross to set up the goal.

2039~~~
I have said it before. Homegrown or not this is not good enough.

2040~~~
In the spirit of insulting the post and not the poster.

Your post is a fecking idiot.

2041~~~
Of course he isn't good enough, most people can see that. Some people are giving him a pass because he is local, which is ridiculous really.

2042~~~
...Yeah, he's balls.

2043~~~
You're not insulting me at all :-) I like some passion and your spirit is excellent. IMHO we need better to compete against the best teams. If you think otherwise that's fine for me. Probably we have different ambitions.

2044~~~
Another one taking the piss

2045~~~
The Jesse miss-curse strikes again. 

If we get a new manager in, he'll never manage 10 starts next season. Seems nice enough, but football is not a world where niceness gets you very far.

2046~~~
He's a Norwich player.

Not an insult. Norwich are better than us. 

But still, a Norwich player - that has Liverpool score 5 against them.

2047~~~
Won't get into half of he league teams.

2048~~~
The defeat obviously wasn't his fault or anything but he really is average. If he's first choice here next season we're going nowhere.

2049~~~
The only way he'll be anywhere near first choice is if LvG stays on. What a grim prospect.

2050~~~
Not good enough.

2051~~~
I cant help feel that he's crap, maybe because he is. he gets into good positions but wastes any chances he gets or usually gives the ball away when he has it, unless he passes it backwards to the fullback. That's not good enough really.

2052~~~
Looked sharp in the first half but disappeared in the second, hard to blame the younger, inexperienced players when our senior outfield players were so poor.

2053~~~
Similar to Depay. Has a goal and an assist in him but the all round game just isn't up to the level that we are used to.

2054~~~
The thing is, if he wasn't playing for us right now I honestly think he is a low Prem/Championship player at the moment. It's laughable how bad our squad is, I think if Mourinho could have his way and be able to sign as many players as he wants he would get rid of 7-10 of our first team without giving it a thought.

2055~~~
He's 23

2056~~~
He's average at best, I have no idea what people on here see in him.

2057~~~
That's around the age Scholes and Becks were when they started playing for the senior team, a senior team that was the best in the country at the time, not the shit show we currently have going on. I've not once said he'll ever be more than a squad player, but I don't get the hurry to bin him to the Championship either.

2058~~~
Both Scholesy and Becks were 3 years younger when they started playing for the first team regularly but I get your point. I actually don't mind Lingard being in our squad, it's when we depend on him actually delivering on a weekly basis that tells us that we're heading for rock bottom. He's actually starting games because he's actually one that deserves it, but that tells you more about the other players in contention and the state of the club.

2059~~~
That's fair, Lingard starting regularly is a snapshot of the lack of top quality in this squad, because as you say you can't really say anyone in it deserves to start ahead of him. Hopefully after the summer he can settle into more of a squad player role.

2060~~~
Obviously needs to work on his finishing, but I see him more as a right midfielder than a front three right sided player.

2061~~~
Our current situation is doing everyone a huge disservice, especially the young players. Instead of being eased into the first team, like they should, they are getting thrown in the deep end and are asked to perform. There is a lack of leadership from the management and there are absolutely no leaders on the pitch to guide these guys through. Then in case of Jesse, he is being asked to perform in his least favorite position. It's not easy.

Jesse is a good player; may not have the potential to be a regular starter at United but does have enough to be a good squad player.

2062~~~
One thing I often notice in this thread is that when Lingard has his 1 good moment per game you get certain posters race in here and criticise any other poster who says anything negative about the guy, only to go missing again when the game is over when Lingard has been anonymous. Very strange, but then again the club at the moment is bringing strange reactions out of people.

2063~~~
I like him but think he was our worst player tonight.

2064~~~
Behave.

2065~~~
How? He was involved in our goal, played a great ball into Memphis, and hit the bar himself. Involved in our 3 best chances while our defense were a shambles and our midfield pairing was absolutely destroyed. Yet you somehow think Lingard was the worst of the lot? He wasn't even close.

2066~~~
Sergio Romero 6.36   
Donald Love 6.38   
Chris Smalling  6.90

2067~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

EDIT: Not a Memphis hater but considering the highest rating a Midtjylland player got was a 7.83.

2068~~~
Depay wasn't our best player. According to that Romero was third worst which shows it is total bollocks.

2069~~~
His end product has been very good of late, so he deserves to stay in the side.

I don't think he'll be a regular starter under the new regime, but he could do a job as a squad player and chip in with 5 goals a season.

2 goals and 2 assists from his last 5 appearances.

2070~~~
He just frustrated me all night, him and Herrera.

2071~~~
Not even close. Herrera was absolute dogshit. And Mata. And Carrick. And Memphis. In fact he was probably our best midfielder, not that that's saying much.

2072~~~
He was poor tonight but so were many others. But he doesn't show me much that he can be of United class.
Lingard is like a really, really poor Thomas Muller. I mean no disrespect to Lingard but that is how it is.

Lingard has good movement and gets into good positions but his finishing more often than not, is poor. He doesn't even get it on target. I can't remember the games this year but there's been a few that have cost us/could have cost us. 

On the other hand, he seems to do better with the harder chances. It really irks me. Overall though he definitely isn't good enough to start for us as much as I want him to be.

2073~~~
With this small a sample size we have no real idea whether this season's finishing is an outlier or the norm. Every attacker goes through phases of being shit at finishing.

2074~~~
Go on Jesse keep on scoring!!

2075~~~
Another goal for Lingard, he makes a lot of good runs and I thought he was good overall today.

2076~~~
Limited player but I reckon he could be a decent squad player.

2077~~~
Nice to see him amongst the scorers, we've been moaning about the lack of midfielders who can score goals for us and now we've got one everyone criticises him.

2078~~~
Is he our most efficient player recently in terms of goals and assists?Anyone has the stats?

Considering we seem to be lacking in that department it's not a surprise to see him starting every game.

2079~~~
Certainly seems so right now.  i honestly think if he had a full season under his belt he could get 15 goals which would be a fantastic return.

2080~~~
He could score 50 goals and you'd all still moan.  He deserves his place in the team right now.  Yes maybe in the new era he'll turn into a squad player but right now his place is justified.

2081~~~
Hats off to him, he keeps chipping in with the odd goal and always makes good runs. For all the hype someone like the Ox gets at Arsenal, Jesse has now scored more goals than he's managed in any season.

2082~~~
Weirdly, does a quite a few simple things, quite badly wrong, then goes and gets goals and assists. If he can iron out the inconsistencies for the next season, he could be a really useful player for us.

2083~~~
Yeah there's only about 9 months between them. I suppose AOC can say that he's never really found his best position but most of the hype was generated when he was a youngster at Southampton. I'm sure most Arsenal fans are disappointed how he's turned out, thus far.

As for Lingard, I don't really rate him and think he lacks several attributes to be a top level player. In fact, sometimes when I watch him, I think he would struggle to get into Championship teams. But he does have a knack of nicking a goal, as-well as missing some absolute sitters. If LvG goes this summer and we assemble a more functional team, a player like Lingard could thrive as a squad player or a starter in the lesser games. It's hard to know what his future holds. Very overrated by some on here, though but I guess that goes with the territory.

2084~~~
I wouldn't, but there is more to the game then just scoring goals. One thing I have gave him credit for is that he does certainly seem to know where the goal is and fair play to the guy he is chipping in with a fair share of goals in a team that struggles to get many. Is he a good enough all around player? No he isn't but I feel like I have beat that drum to death talking about it, So as long as he keeps scoring, I'll leave him alone. A competent manager will probably move him on but i'll talk about that if we get a competent manager in first.

2085~~~
I also think he'll end up as a squad player. A very handy one though and it's great to still see local lads making it here. He's not as flashy or eye catching as some young players but as long as he keeps chipping in with goals, who can fault him.

2086~~~
Yes and completely agree there's more to scoring goals.  But to be fair to Jesse he does work hard for the team and will track back.  Where I feel he needs to improve is by being braver and taking his man on as he seems to take the easy option.  His finishing can be hit or miss too.   The likes of Depay deserves more stick then Jesse...he was horrible yesterday.

2087~~~
No he was one of our better players. He had some horrible shots, that will probably be the only thing you'll choose to remember about his game, but he created two or three fantastic opportunities, was always positive and making an effort to do something with our possession. Lingard passed it on to the next player every time he got the ball. Buthe does have the ability to pop up in goalscoring positions, I'll give him that.

2088~~~
I think it's great to see that in this day and age we can still see young lads come through the academy and get a shot at the first team.
If people think he's not good enough to get the playing time he wants, well, that's not entirely his fault. He's not picking himself, and it's not like any more established first team player is being unfairly kept out of the team.
 Now, the fact that he's a regular feature is quite an indictment of our current situation, as there's no one performing well enough to take his place.

Positives in addition to seeing a youth team player come through are his ability to chip in with a few goals, he has a bit of pace and he's quite a hard worker. I'd like to see him take his man on a bit more but that's an issue with the whole team for a while now. It is frustrating when he misses chances he should really score. However, they always say it's better to be getting into those positions and missing than not getting those chances at all. And it's not like any player who replaces him is getting those opportunities, let alone scoring them.

So while some off his misses are really poor, like PSG at home, I'd ask why the only one chances keep falling to is a young lad with questionable shooting

2089~~~
He should be on about 9 goals for the season by now, given some of the chances he's missed. But every single one of the 5 goals he has scored have been classy finishes. The curler against West Brom, the overlap and nutmeg goal away to Newcastle, a diving header versus Stoke, one of the goals of the season away to Chelsea, and a nicely taken side foot volley on Monday night from a peach of a by Herrera. Easy to miss.

He should have scored from Memphis' through ball though. 

A very useful squad player to have around. He makes runs that can be found by good passers.

2090~~~
He wont be at United in 2 years. Well, in case we do not improve under a new manager, he might still be a starter

2091~~~
Some are much too hard on Jesse. I don't think he's a winger and that's the problem. Anyone remember fletcher on the wing? Lingard is better centrally but the problem that we have is that we have a lot of players who play a nice five yard pass and who can move. We don't mix it well enough. Linqard is not a typical winger so that means that we rely on the full back more on his side. He's missed a few chances but I think he can have more influence centrally running through midfield. If we improve the balance of players/play then we have a useful player here. It's unreasonable to ask Jesse to do something more expansive - when he's not a winger. So people need to shift focus and look at the elements in the squad that we lack. Jesse is not a problem. It's a good sign when, even if you are on the outskirts, you can score goals. He's missed a few but come back. I think the problems lie elsewhere.

We do need a winger - similar to martial or someone who get's it in early but people should know Lingards game. He isn't a traditional winger and peoples expectations are unreasonable and probably most never saw him in the youth teams. Anyone that saw him in the youth teams, knows why it's not an ideal position for him. I don't remember any account of anyone claiming Jesse, was a winger. That's because he isn't a winger.

2092~~~
Tbf, he has been shunted out on the right side when it's clear he is better on the left wing, but we have Martial there.
You can't fault his attitude on the pitch, he gives his all both with and without the ball - something Memphis could learn from. Also scored some brilliant goals.

I'm still far from giving up on him, i think he contributes more than alot of the other players in our team.

2093~~~
3 goals and 2 assists in his last 6 games, some have been against poor clubs but that's a decent return for a winger and he proves to be quite an important player for us. Cant understand the amount of stick he gets, he's no Reus no but he's doing a decent job for us.

2094~~~
His overall play is no better than Rooneys yet he gets away with it for being "young" and homegrown. Hes had a decent little run of form but hes nowhere near good enough to be a starter for us if we want to get back to europes top table.

He was also involved in some show boating v shrewsbury which was pretty classless...

2095~~~
I missed that - what happened?

2096~~~
Just a couple a flicks when we were 2 or 3 0 up. Pretty sure he got nailed after one of them but i genuinely can't remember specifics. Nothing huge but it wasn't normal play for him. He does seem a bit like that, he even has a fancy little goal celebration, which makes me think he thinks hes big time and annoys me...

you must be really grumpy person arent you? Rooney's annoying, he's shit for more than three years now... vs the academy player who stepped up this season even though playd out of position and showed he can be more useful than flop depay and people hate him, there must be something wrong<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> annoying is when 60milion player like dimaria flops, when we pay such money 13 million for "best rightback" in seria A and he flops, not when a player from our academy with potentially squad player quality gets a chance and provides decent services, when rooney scored even though was still shit everybody shut up..

2098~~~
Another fan who seems to pick and choose what the " United Ethos" is. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

I don't like his celebration but he IS big time. He has the ability to EASILY be a premiere league footballer for the rest of his life.

2099~~~
Quite a bit of hate for a player who has easily outperformed most of our big names this season (see Schneiderlin, Mata, Herrera, Schweinsteiger, Fellaini). He's come into a badly misfiring squad and scored goals, gotten into good positions with regularity (albeit, admittedly, he's been a bit wasteful at times) and generally given us another dimension that we didn't have. And, most importantly, he's one of our own. 

Yeah, he's not perfect and he's probably not likely to end up as a really top player, but for a first full season in the league he's shown loads of promise and is comfortably suggesting he can be a useful player at this level. He needs to be given a chance to see what he might become. This weird idea that floats around football where you're either good enough to be world class immediately or you're shit is pretty tiresome. And as we're so shit at the moment people use players like Lingard as an emblem for everything they see as being wrong at the club. How many young players come into a really poor, stodgy team and set the world alight? That's he's properly contributing at this stage has to be seen as a positive, IMO.

2100~~~
Couldn't put it better myself. I really don't get the disregard for Lingard. Comfortably one of our more committed performers this year.. is tactically sound, great enthusiasm, chips in with key goals. He's a lad I would love to keep around the squad for years to come if he can maintain and improve this level.

In a team that is completely devoid of pace, energy and workrate in certain areas, we should be grateful to have someone like him around. He's not a first teamer of the future, but he's a versatile player who thanks to his athleticism can be quite similar to a Park with goals for us.. no reason why he can't be moulded into that sort of player with the energy and personality he has.

2101~~~
exactly. for every game that Ronaldo or Rooney won for us, it was players like Park or O'shea that made us win the Must win games.

2102~~~
Lingard won't ever be as good as Park.

2103~~~
If he can be as good as O'shea then he has a place in this squad. Your taking out our lack of success this season out on him. He is there simply because Mata, Januzaj and co do not have a single bit of pace about them in the wider positions. Without him, we would be worse off this season.

2104~~~
Bottom line is that in big games, big attacking players are usually a) heavily marked b) under intense pressure to perform c) usually lack the work ethic to fight in really tight encounters where nothing is going their way.. and therefore it is these lesser players like Lingard who usually find themselves in space and put themselves about having a big say in the final outcome in these tight encounters.

Having strong squad players is essential but they're hard to find because if they're too good.. they basically become star players in their own right and develop an ego/or become tightly marked themselves. Someone like Willian for example is the best 'secondary' attacking player in the world in my opinion i.e. he accepts being the lesser talent in his team and yet is that influential he's overtaken Hazard et al in how important he is to the side. Now question is, now he knows he is so damn important.. will he continue showing that work rate or will be lessen his defensive output and demand to be given more freedom to focus on his attacking duties. Does he want to be the main man? or on the flip side, does every team now see him as a huge threat and wants to limit his influence on the game?

Its about finding the player with the right level of ability/mentality.. Lingard for me has that perfect blend of decent ability, workrate and lack of ego to be a good squad player for us. He'd be more than happy to stay on the bench and get the odd game here and there.. as long as he felt useful. He's not the type to come off the bench and let you down. That should be valued. Compare that to Memphis who.. if he doesn't break through and become a first teamer, you might as well get rid. He'd be a shitty squad player but a potentially brilliant first team player.

2105~~~
Yes very good post. Considering Memphis does reach a desired potential; we still have to go out of our way to get a RW who fits the system. Though that might push Lingard back initially, I believe he is the only player that could come off the bench and play any of the front 3 roles (LW,CAM,RW) to a similar degree (not standard) almost like a plug-in for any injury/form issues.

Januzaj, pereita, mata, valencia, young have no ability to be a Winger in this system because simply they dont have the ability to be a forward.

Lingard's work ethic will shine whenever  he gets to play in the centre as it would be important to have a CAM who can overlap the Left or Right wings; especially the big games when a bit of respect of the opposition is needed.

2106~~~
Excellent post. Especially the middle paragraph. 

Brilliant way to look at an overall squad.

2107~~~
Do i? Pretty sure its just my opinion on what i would like from players. Nothing to do with the united ethos, whatever that is.

2108~~~
I can't understand why people don't like him. He's a player who has been with us essentially his entire life, he works hard and runs constantly. Although I do think we should be looking to get someone better than him I still think he would be a great squad player to have. I also think in this current team he offers us something that we don't really have with his constant movement and quick passing, he opens things up. I certainly like him on the right more than I like Mata out there.

2109~~~
Nice to see some sensible discussion, occupying the middle ground, about Jesse. Great post <a class="username" data-user="43572, @Raees" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/43572/">@Raees</a> 

The lads doing pretty well when you consider how disjointed the team has been all season and he definitely brings qualities to the mix that would otherwise be missing. I think he is clearly our best option on the right for now and could blossom in to a really handy squad player. Taking in to account that it is his first full season at this level and he has been played largely on the right, not his optimum position IMO, he is one of the few that can hold their head up high. He'll never get near a ballon d'or or be the main-man but he can definitely play a part in a team/squad competing at the highest level.

2110~~~
This. People not seeing his importance because we have a hard working player whilst our ' Flair players ' are either off form, not good enough or yet to be bought. The squad is far from complete enough to see the importance of a hard worker amongst them.

2111~~~
I said I wouldn't criticise him again but he really is a poor player. Seemingly cannot beat a man or cross a ball, even against these minnows.

2112~~~
Has the energy and that's commendable but the quality just isn't there. Not a bad squad player but even that's debatable.

2113~~~
As I said in a post yesterday, he can look good sometimes and other times he looks like he would struggle in the Championship. He's been very wasteful tonight and he's making poor decisions.

2114~~~
... yet he keeps showing up on the scoresheet. he is very, very fortunate to be as involved as he has.

2115~~~
He really offers nothing whatsoever, except the odd goal. When he doesn't get a goal he does nothing else. Memphis really showed him up tonight.

2116~~~
Shite, but should've won a pen.

You could tell by the defender's reaction he knew he clipped him.

2117~~~
I can't stand his decisions. He's such a clown at times.

2118~~~
One of his worst performances for us so far.

2119~~~
People keep talking about his supposed pace and intelligence but I'm yet to really see either. His decision making was shocking tonight.

2120~~~
Put in the yards but doesn't run with the ball well enough for a player occupying the role he plays.

2121~~~
Was fecking shit. If we hadn't won so convincingly his average rating would be 2 full points lower.

2122~~~
As I said in the Memphis thread I have all the time in the world with positive players. That's why I just don't like watching Lingard play. His first instinct is always the safe backpass. He had a few opportunities to play a fast forward through pass but he had absolutely no interest in playing them. He puts in a shift, pops up in some good positions, but you could say that about almost any professional player.
Pereira came on, had the ball once, and beat more men (1) than Lingard did the whole game.

2123~~~
He looked really tired in the second half and his decision making suffered because of that. I was wondering why he couldn't come off earlier for Pereira.

2124~~~
I don't like criticising our players but Lingard drives me nuts, he gets in good positions but never takes a chance, rarely runs past players, rarely crosses well, occasionally pops up in scoring positions. Just seems so weak and dare I say it a coward.
The right side attacking position is the most important to sort out this summer. Lingard is not good enough to be a starter

2125~~~
He seem lightweight both physically and mentally. I just feel like Pereira would add way more to the team.

2126~~~
Piss poor. Can't beat a man to save his life and his decision making is questionable at best. Thankfully it didn't cost us tonight.

2127~~~
He has more pace and is more dynamic at both ends than Pereira can be out wide tbf.

2128~~~
Then why haven't i seen it so far? He reminds of a weaker, slower Valencia. Yes, he does pop the odd goal here and there but his overall contribution is really not impressive. The few times he tries to run past a defender he complains for a foul or just loses it altogether. I don't know but he just doesn't seem dangerous to me.

2129~~~
I agree somewhat with what you are saying but he keeps width and carries ball forward stretching play. Pereira will have to come in centrally to be effective or just cross.

2130~~~
Just don't see it with this guy. Think I said it before but at best all I can see him be is a squad player. Really can't wait to get a proper right winger there, it'll be so much help.

Varela was doing more work as a forward than Lingard was today!

2131~~~
He does keep width but to what end? I would really try Pereira for a few games as coming centrally might result in one-twos or switching of play to the left. With Varela showing some good sign, an overlap with a more central Pereira could also unlock defenses, not to mention the possible passes between the oppo RB and the central defender.

2132~~~
was my thoughts on this, this happened to Memphis earlier in the season. Where he looked knackered but was just kept on bizarrely despite having a replacement on the bench (and not using that sub until there was like 2 minutes left of the game).

Today wasnt a good game from him but saying that, he should have had a penalty. Just think at times, he needs to stop trying to do stuff thats not his game. I think hes more suited to the pass and move rather than trying to beat a man like Memphis.

2133~~~
He is a squad player.  Right now we don't have any players in our squad!  

It's just that onight Lingard was about the 5th or 6th most experienced player for us!

2134~~~
I still don't see it with Lingard. The best I can say about him is that he will nick the ball off the opponent at times during the game and has shown he can score goals. But his all round 90 minute performances are imo poor. He's at best an impact sub when we need some energy and a bit of goal threat. Tries hard though which is why I hate being so negative about the fella.

2135~~~
Really hope he's dropped for Sunday. Easily the least effective player on the pitch today, and appears to have taken diving lessons from Adnan.

2136~~~
A nothing player.

2137~~~
Just playing out of position. Not a great game but did take a knock last game. Hopefully his performances will pick up but we might need to be patient with him. A spell on the bench might do him some good

2138~~~
Agree with the majority of posters albeit a bit harsh from some. He is a good player who reads the game well but his presence is rather weak and he occasionally is sounded out by defenders.

I'm glad he's getting games for us because I wish him all the best but I can't see him staying at United for the forsee able future.

2139~~~
was awful in the second half....i blame the fans, morons are in half boo mode the minute he gets the ball because he is keeping it simple and its only normal that young player reacts on it and tries more. He then starts running at people and he is a very poor dribbler, normally he lost almost every ball. Someone should talk to him and ensure he stays loyal to his game no matter what.

2140~~~
The good parts of his game are very underappreciated. Sure he was trying a bit hard in the second half and lost the ball more than necessary. But if you watch the game back it's hard to find a passing move he wasn't involved in - if you want high-tempo passing, you need players like him who have that knack of getting available for a pass and always knowing who they're going to move it on to so it only takes one touch. And he must have won the ball back more than anyone, it was Welbeck-level harrying from the front.

I'm not claiming he's some superstar or anything, but his performance today is getting harsh reviews. You don't get performances like Memphis's today without performances like Lingard's alongside him.

2141~~~
im a big fan of Jesse, in fact he is one of my favorite players and i agree with you in general but in the second half he was pretty bad. Decent first half, awful in the second until the dive and then again decent for a short spell before the sub. Missed the game live so i watch it after, and was focused mainly on Depay, Rash and Jesse as i heard Depay was amazing, Jesse was poor and was curios how did Rash do.

2142~~~
I agree he was worse in the second half, but awful is very harsh.

2143~~~
maybe, lets say then that he was poor....its pretty much irrelevant what we call it, it wasnt good unfortunately <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2144~~~
Saw a couple of replays and I don't think it was a dive. From some angles it looks like a dive, but there are other angles that show it's a penalty. Hansen caught the tip of Lingard's foot with his tackle.

2145~~~
Yep, I was surprised that the commentators agreed with the ref, looked like a small but clear contact to me. You can see Hansen's foot juddering from the contact between his boot and Jesse's.

2146~~~
He can have an off day. Been one of our consistent performers. Hope he nicks his customary goal when we need it against Arse this weekend.

2147~~~
Pretty gash today, probably his worst performance us.

He's been decent for us this season, but I don't think he's even close to being good enough. Would do well at a mid/lower level Prem side.

2148~~~
He's played on the right nearly the whole time that he's been in the first team though<b>.</b>

2149~~~
Disappointed showing last night. I really thought he would use the game as a platform for regaining a bit of form. Instead he made even worse decisions than usual, kept running into blind alleys and generally impeded our attacks whenever he got on the ball. For someone with a higher than average strike rate for a wide player, he really is frustratingly lacking in basic attack attributes. His dribbling is poor, crossing non existent and decision making inconsistent. The fact that he's made the right wing his own really speaks volumes of our troubles at the moment.

2150~~~
He has a good head and I think he's a better finisher than he's shown, but he'll never make it here as a winger. No explosiveness or threat either going up the line or cutting in. Memphis or even Martial will be the answer at LW.

We need a genuine threat at RW. Someone who can torture a fullback and score goals. Memphis-Martial-RW has incredible potential if we can sign a current or future star there.

2151~~~
Really think that Jesse's contribution to our defensive solidity on the right is overlooked and none more so than last night.

He put a good shift in, nicked possession from them on more than one occasion and had our highest pass completion (95%) according to the UEFA stats. He still seems to get muscled off the ball too easily at times and ends up being unfairly on the wrong end of free kick decisions, perhaps due to a slight lack of strength/size.

He is a great squad option though and I hope he is at United for a while, even if his best position may be as back up to a Robben or some other top player Ed has on his shopping list!

2152~~~
I agree. There is nothing that he does that stands out and as a winger, he does a bad job as he's not creating, nor dribbling, nor opening up space or anything else. Whenever he has the ball, he rather runs inside and get's in other people's way. Yesterday was his chance to torment the right flank but he did nothing - like in most cases. You really do wonder how poor we've become if players like Lingard are starting.

2153~~~
You blame the fans for the fact he cannot beat a man, Cross a ball or do much else?

2154~~~
I think this is clutching at straws, personally. Yes, him and Varela marked Sisto well and Lingard put in his usual energetic shift. But let’s be honest, we completely and utterly dominated the game against very weak opposition. It's not as if he done a marking job on Neymar. Lingard is in the team to be utilised as an attacking outlet and against weak opposition like we faced last night, he should really have shown far more in an attacking sense. He was absolutely woeful in the final third and failed to take people on, as-well as constantly picking the wrong option. He was by far our worst attacking player on the pitch. Look at Depay, he took full advantage of how weak the opposition were and tore them to shreds. Lingard, who is a year older, failed to show any attacking endeavour whatsoever.

I'm all for praising attacking players who put in a good defensive shift against top teams, ala the job Park done on Pirlo, for example. But praising Lingard last night for his defensive contribution is really clutching at straws. I was extremely disappointed at how poor Lingard was in the final third last night and he didn't even manage to nick a goal to mask another inept attacking display. Look, I don't really rate this lad at all. At best, I think he could be a decent squad option for us. With a new manager and a more functional team, he could be a useful squad player but I think we should be aiming so much higher than Lingard. He has looked ok recently and last night was a chance for him to really shine and put their fullback to the sword and he failed badly.

2155~~~
Had a crap game even i admit and i'm his number one fan.  Still happy with his work ethic last night.

2156~~~
Not sure if its been mentioned but he reminds me of Ji-Sung Park. Doesn't quite have the good short passing and dribbling (and of course the stamina) as Park but I mean in the sense he finds himself in great positions through clever movement and has an eye for goal. I echo what most are saying though, can only see him making it as a squad player.

2157~~~
He's not really an out and out winger. The way he was asked to play yesterday (i.e trying to repeatedly beat his man) doesn't suit him one so I'm not surprised he looked a bit shit.

2158~~~
Don't really get it. Half the people laying into him keep saying he can be a good squad player. Why are you laying into him then? Not his fault he's starting every game and he's still very inexperienced. He'll get more confident going forward the older he gets if the dickheads (Nani's boo boys) don't get on his back.

2159~~~
I think he has to realize his limitations and make the most keeping that in mind. 

People often say he's a nothing player, but for me, he's at his worst when he overrates his ability and starts playing as if he's Arjen Robben taking on his fullback with ambition but without the ability. He seems to be a hard working, good-at-tracking back, intelligent and tidy footballer, with a knack of popping up with goals. He should stick to those aspects of his repertoire rather than constantly trying to be our "wing wizard".

I personally think Januzaj (and maybe Periera) should be prioritized over him, and comfortably at that, but if he's getting chances I hope he does well and importantly, works out the player he is and the best he can be at being that sort of player.

2160~~~
I think the main problem is that he simply isn't a winger. I don't follow our youth teams so I have no idea where he played at that level. But I feel that he would maybe be more suited to a number 10 role as opposed to a role out on the wings. I think he's a limited player, as you have pointed out and maybe a number 10 role would suit his attributes better. He looked a complete mess out on the wing against second rate opposition last night, he consistently failed to beat his man and his decision making was shocking. People keep saying he's quick but I'm yet to see it; maybe being 'quick' these days equates to not being as slow as Mata, I dunno.

2161~~~
He's basically Park Ji-sung with two lungs instead of three. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

2162~~~
Thing is, the line has blurred now between wingers and AMs. Most attacking midfielders these days are number 10s of sorts. And most teams play with them out wide. Mata, Silva, De Bruyne and Ozil all play out wide a lot of the time. So him playing out wide fits in well with the times, and the systems these days, for me. But when a 10 does play that he needs to then play like a 10 should rather than emulate Ronaldo, Bale or Robben. If Ozil or Silva suddenly start trying to beat a man for pace consistently like Valencia (earlier) or Bale would, it would make absolutely no sense. Same with Lingard, he's better off playing like Park would, rather than try to hard to be a game changer.

2163~~~
Oh I agree with that, wingers (in the truest sense of the word) are nearly a thing of the past and it's more wide forwards and advanced playmakers these days. As a personal preference, I like our wide players to have power and pace, like Bale or Martial (although I would prefer if he played up top in the long run). Depay last night (that type of performance) is the exact type of winger that I would love at our club and I'm hoping that he is going to build on that performance. The likes of KDB etc are all better suited to number 10 roles but I feel players like him, are far more adaptable at playing out wide than Lingard. Lingard just offers so little out there and when we picked up the tempo last night, he constantly slowed things down when he got the ball and picked the wrong option. I would like to see him get a chance as a number 10 to see how he would fare.

2164~~~
3 lung park wasn't used game in game out either. Lingard has been tbf.

2165~~~
Lingard has played due to injuries and players being woefully out of form.

2166~~~
That's an incredible disservice to Park who was actually a very good and consistent player for us.

Actually, to be fair, Lingard's consistent too, he's just consistently shite.

What's worse is he's unfathomably playing game after game after game whereas the far, far more talented (and younger) Pereira is only allowed on when we're a few goals up. 

LvG logic, innit.

2167~~~
Pereira is not a winger and when he does play wide, it's from the left.

I'm not sure why people are mentioning him when it's obvious that Mata is his competition.

Lingard is much better suited to the left or through the middle between the lines. Unfortunately for him, both Martial and Memphis are better from the left too.

2168~~~
The problem is, LVG has him playing on the right wing because of his pace, but he is far from a fast player. His pace is very average, and he cannot beat his man. If we want pace on the wing, I would welcome Valencia back. He provides width, and will get us more corners than Lingard, which seems to be his greatest contribution except for goals. Lingard' short range passing is good, but as is Valencia's.

2169~~~
It's not a disservice to Park in the least. It was a compliment to him and an optimistic outlook on what Lingard can offer. They play the game in a similar fashion and have similar shortcomings (pace, skill, passing range) but find a way to be somewhat effective offensively.

2170~~~
Comparing someone as crap as Lingard to someone who was as good as Park is a massive disservice to Park. There's no other way about it.

Park was also a much better footballer than Lingard. You can't pick three shortcomings that they both share and then say they're basically the same. Park was a better passer, dribbler, defender, and much, much harder to dispossess. Although to be fair I reckon a dog would be more difficult to dispossess than Lingard.

The only thing Lingard seems to have in his locker that Park doesn't is the rare really good goal, but most of his performances aside from those goals are absolute dogshit. I genuinely can't think of a single game where he's managed to beat his man? Or not being easily out-muscled and dispossessed.

Park offered one thing above all else, consistently good, reliable performances. Usually at least a 7/10 with the odd gem here and there too. Lingard for the most part has been absolutely shite for the majority of games, there's nothing consistent about him.

It's a terrible comparison.

2171~~~
This post is way OTT and you're overrating Lingard something terrible here.

2172~~~
I see what you did there.

2173~~~
<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2174~~~
No he is the best available RW. Mata,Memphis,martial cannot play there even to the standard of lingard.

Valencia and young cannot play there because they are not forwards.

Lingard for all his weaknesses can put the ball in the net and spread the back line - something with mata we could not do.

LVG knows lingard isn't a long term RW as he is always adamant on a left footed forward cutting in. Him playing there is already helping our forwards find spaces inbetween a spreaded back line & should benefit him experience wise as a back up winger/forward for LW/RW/CAM.

Just maybe when the flair player position are filled - his role as a hard worker might be more apparent & maybe he might start the big games when we need a bit more work ethic down the middle.

2175~~~
What? Yes, they can. In fact, for all of Mata's fault and the criticism he's come in for, I'd say he's delivered just as much, if not more than Lingard has from the right-wing position this season when he's been playing there.

2176~~~
You do realise that Valencia and Young were bought to play in that position, right? Bizarre thing to say. Also Martial and Depay can easily play there too. He is playing because of our injury list and LvG seems to like him. He isn't a winger, just as much as Mata isn't a winger. I see his best position as a number 10 or if he is going to play on the wing, he should stick to being an advanced playmaker (of sorts) that gets into good positions in the box. He was absolutely terrible last night and despite some nice goals, he's been very underwhelming. I don't mind him but we need far better. His inability to beat a man along with his ability to completely slow down any tempo, mean he isn't really a feasible option as a right winger, going forward for the club.

2177~~~
Some will bash other players just to stick up for academy products, I have touched on it in the Depay thread today. It really grinds my gears.

2178~~~
True to an extent. I mean, I don't think Lingard is <i>completely </i>awful, but I do think that if he was a random youngish signing we'd made a season or two that there'd probably be a lot more people writing him off as being average. He's been okay out on the wing occasionally this season, but he's not skillful/talented enough to play there, and his finishing is worryingly suspect at times and can be far from dependable. He's hardly been our best right-winger this season, unless we're judging it on the barometer of him being the only one to not really play anywhere else regularly.

2179~~~
Yup, he isn't awful by any means, I would say underwhelming and limited would be far more apt words to describe him. He's popped up with some decent goals but his all-round play is often quite poor and he simply doesn't do enough. He has been no better than Mata anyway, not that Mata has even been good himself.

I do find there is a tendency on here from <i>some </i>posters to exonerate a-lot of academy players of any wrongdoing whilst they then absolutely berate the likes of Depay, who has been no worse, in truth. Look through this thread for example; I mean how many times has Depay been slagged off in here, all to defend Lingard. It's kind of strange, as bar a-few posters, there isn't anyone in here saying he's the worst player on the planet, just that we need better, which is pretty fair really.

2180~~~
Not only is mata better in the centre, mata on the right cannot stay wide . He always has to cut in & him having less pace makes him more predictable than lingard on the right.

How am I bashing mata if he is better in the centre than the right <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Some people will bash youth players because they are thirsty glory hunters.

Have a look at giggs last day speech after Moyes left to hear what United is really about.

Wow. You genuinely think Valencia & Young  are the same type of wingers as Martial, Memphis & lingard.

Valencia & young would struggle to put the ball in to an empty net & they have looked more important to the team than ever before by playing in defence AKA our crosses.

Our wingers are forwards, our fullbacks are crosses. Every game has been the same. CBJ,Shaw,Riley,Damian, Varela, Valencia & Young cross 3 X more than Memphis & martial.

Look at the game yesterday and see that for yourself.

What Valencia & Young were bought to do is different to what they are good at now.

2181~~~
Thats all well and good saying 'if' but the fact is that he isn't, he's a kid that we've paid no money for and thats on a relative pittance and has spent most of the season, last night aside, outperforming the big money signings up front, Martial aside. I think its obvious why people are showing him a bit more patience, not only because he's not someone we have any real high expectations for, but because, unlike players like Memphis we're watching his early formative years here, rather than him having them at another club and then being signed by us.

I've got a lot of time for Lingard, had he been in the team since the start of the season he'd be on course for a 10 goal season, all of this in a team where people are far more willing to make excuses for others piss poor performance. He's probably been our best attacking player over the course of the last few months, and has got virtually no credit.

Is he the finished article? No. Has he got time on his side? No. Does he look good enough to be a first teamer? Probably not. But I think he's more than capable of being useful here, and I think its a much better policy supplementing our first team squad with handy, hard working, technical players like Lingard than buying them in. To put it in perspective, he's now scored more goals this season than Ashley Young managed in anything other than his first season here, and at his current rate will be within 0-1 goals of Ashley Young's best ever tally in a United shirt after his 33rd game this season, the same number of games Young played that season. All of those in an attack thats utter shite.

2182~~~
Never said that.

2183~~~
Good on you. Perspective is a hard thing to understand.

2184~~~
he cant beat a man so he must be shit.

2185~~~
Then the fact they were bought for wingers for another manager does not mean they are wingers for van gaal.

Valencia & young would be used as fullbacks for both Bayer n & Barca because their wingers are forwards..just like ours. 

Lingard has been more of a forward than anyone apart from mata who cannot stretch the back line.

2186~~~
So Young didn't play out on the wing for us last season? Even during our good run of form? I'm merely saying that you're talking shite saying that the players you mentioned can't play there but Lingard somehow can. As I stated, Lingard looks no more a winger than Mata does. But as you were.....

2187~~~
He sums up this current team I think. Mostly average, flashes of excitement but not really good enough. A right winger should be one of the first things on our check list this summer.

2188~~~
Huh? A primary job as a winger is to be able to beat your opposing full back and be able to get a cross or creative pass in. So the fact he cannot actually do this makes him pretty shit yeah, when you put it like that.

2189~~~
How does Mahrez sound to you?

2190~~~
Maa Rez

2191~~~
everything is black and white i see.....lets just buy Downing and put Valencia back on the wing. They will beat a man all day long and put up cross after cross and we would have our wings sorted.
Jesse cant dribble so lets just ignore that he has the best off the ball movement in the club, lets ignore the fact that he works his ass of every time he is on the pitch(unlike some), lets ignore that he is a great team player who combines well with others and is always available for the pass, lets ignore that he offers a good end product in a team that creates the same amount of chances as fecking Sunderland. But hey, he isnt dribbling so he must be shit, as you know dribbling is what gets fans of their sit.

2192~~~
You can't ignore things that aren't true, though.

You can fool yourself into thinking things are true that are not, however.

2193~~~
People who are arguing that he's a poor winger are basically missing the point, and seemingly followers of the Moyesian school of football. He isn't a winger, he's a forward, which is illustrated by the amount of goals he scores per 90 minutes played in the league (Squwaka).

0.43  - Lingard 
0.35  - Martial
0.33  - Rooney
0.18  - Mata
0.17  - Fellaini - Depay - Herrera

Lingard is in the team because he's more direct than someone like Valencia, who like a robot tries to get to the byline and put in aimless crosses over and over. He's also more direct than a player like Mata who is far too static when he plays on the wing and offers very little goal threat, illustrated by his last PL goal being scored 3 and a half months ago.

I'm not saying he's a regular starter for the club, but the criticism he gets from some is silly considering how much worse some players are performing relative to their standing in the game. It's almost as if people think that dropping Lingard would magically improve Rooney and Mata's form. 

The two worst attacking displays I have seen in the league this season were away to Crystal Palace and home to Norwich, <b>Lingard played in neither game, Rooney and Mata played in both</b>.

Maybe we should have chucked on another winger!

2194~~~
Evidently ...

2195~~~
Feck off Sherlock.

2196~~~
Reported. Welcome to the mains.

2197~~~
I've been in the mains well over a year and I don't think calling someone Sherlock is insulting, unless you have an immense dislike of Benedict Cumberbatch? T'was obviously a jest anyway, dear boy.

2198~~~
Silly of me to have missed that given the obvious quality of your posts.

2199~~~
Your words cut deep.

2200~~~
Good post

2201~~~
He'll cost a ton and for all we know this is a career season, but he certainly can dribble. 25 years old and 12G+8A in 21 starts is pretty damn special for a Prem winger. I'd be delighted if we signed him. 

Memphis-Martial-Mahrez certainly is an impressive amount of dribbling ability in a front 3. We could really get at teams if we move the ball well enough to give them chances to run at their markers. 

Lingard, Januzaj, Pereira competing to be backup wingers and Wilson, Keane and Rashford competing to be the backup strikers and you have a nice setup. Maybe Rooney stays for another year or an experienced striker who can score off the bench can be signed. Why did we sell Chicharito again?

2202~~~
He is not good enough to be a regular starter long-term but IMO certainly good enough to be a squad player or starter in FA Cup/League Cup/games against poor PL teams.  I think Mata and Valencia are both awful as wingers.  Mata simply cannot cover ground fast enough while Valencia is fast but his final product is nonexistent.  Lingard is far from great or even very good but I think his combined abilities offer more than either of them have in that position.  We should also keep in mind that Lingard saw very little of the first team before this season and he was pretty much throw in at the deep end, so allowances should be made for that.  Hopefully, though, we do get an established, top-level winger in the summer.

2203~~~
Good post.

Lingard gets a bit of leeway for me for how he played when he first started getting regular games this season. Back in November or whenever it was, when we were at our absolute worst in terms of playing boring turgid crap. He came in and was the only player who actually tried to play positively and trying to force things to happen. There were two or three games where he came off the bench and we instantly starting looking a little more likely to create something because he was running at people and creating space.

Now don't get me wrong, he still wasn't playing amazingly well during that period. But he was the only one in the team who showed the balls to try to make something happen.

Should he be our first choice? No he shouldn't. But at this moment in time I'm happy with him as a squad player

2204~~~
Good cross for the goal

2205~~~
Problem is his all round play is still pretty wank. Assist was good though. 

Needs to do more than just have good moments.

2206~~~
Nice assist.

2207~~~
Another nice moment for him today, looks unlucky with that offside at the end of the half as well.

2208~~~
Great leap to get out of the way of the first goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2209~~~
He has had a good half I think

2210~~~
Good half from him.

2211~~~
Big improvement from that horror show from him on Thursday.

2212~~~
Been very good. I really like this guy. Great to watch.

2213~~~
You are drunk yes he did well today but he is the definition of average!

2214~~~
Good to get an assist, but thought he was very quiet mostly apart from that.

2215~~~
Did well today. Quiet but efficient!

2216~~~
The haters will hate.  The guy is doing the best he can in a position that is not his own. 

Without him we wouldn't have half the spaces to attack to and thats just by his positioning

2217~~~
Come on. 5 goals and 4 assists in his debut (sort of) season. He works really hard and has shown himself to be very efficient going forward.

2218~~~
Really good performance today. Didn't look at all out of place.

2219~~~
Quietly performing throughout, came alive when it was needed the most.

2220~~~
Put lots of work in and got an assist, he's a good steady Eddie.

2221~~~
He's not as talented as some of the others but a decent season so far considering he's playing out of position. Good squad player for me

2222~~~
Him and Varela kept Sanchez absolutely quiet. And an Assist to boot as well. He's fulfilling SAF prophecy quietly and efficiently.

2223~~~
He's not playing out of position. Played on the RW most of the times for U21 and U18 as well (Although, at that level they get shunted about quite a bit).

2224~~~
Can't disagree with what you are saying but he is not good enough to be a starter nowhere near

2225~~~
Performed his defensive duties...Him and Varela kept Sanchez quiet..Had an assist. . What more do peeps here want?

2226~~~
I'm happy enough with that performance.

2227~~~
Agree. I think he's an excellent prospect especially his knack of getting into goal scoring positions.

2228~~~
He was good today. Done his job, and contributed another assist.

2229~~~
This post is all you need to know about Lingard's game really, especially the bolded part. 

It's a VERY underrated quality.

2230~~~
Gets a lot of stick, and I've slated him in the past, but credit where it's due, a good performance today.

2231~~~
He was very good today.

2232~~~
He's our Pedro (in his Barca days). Not as gifted as those around him but making a useful contribution to the side whilst we wait for something better. He's a good squad player.

2233~~~
He almost always played on the left for the u21s. Adnan and Larnell Cole usually played on the right.

2234~~~
Think he'd be better through the middle.

2235~~~
He's a LW. 

Not only is he out of position but this role requires him to beat his full back on the outside which again has never been his main strength.

2236~~~
Yes. Transfermarkt also has him largely playing on the left and he always wore the 11 for left wing.

2237~~~
He's the new Ji Sung Park.

2238~~~
Thought he played with real maturity today and showed good decision making for a relatively young player.

I think he has that streak about him of doing what is needed to get a result in big games e.g buying free kicks to relieve pressure, stopping the opposition from breaking quickly

2239~~~
I think today was one of his best games for us, and I'm not even one of his biggest fans. Very good today.

2240~~~
From what ive seen, the best thing about him is the simple things. Give and go, good cross on him, movement to get into great positions. 

When he tries to take on people like Memphis, more often than not it doesnt work. 

Thought he had a good game today.

2241~~~
This pretty much sums him up, yep. His technical basics are all top notch, and he's got the brain and vision to make attacking moves happen. He won't often be the player to beat a man. But you need someone like Lingard on the pitch to work the likes of Martial and Memphis into the positions where they can do the damage, to keep the attack fluid and the tempo high.

2242~~~
Would like to see him link up more often with our RBs. He can't do much by himself but with the likes of Darmian or Varela supporting him can lead to a better end product. Both Darmian and Varela are great crossers too.

2243~~~
Great energy today - worked his ass off defensively. Did very well with Varela in keeping Arsenals left side quiet

2244~~~
We need players like Jesse.  He worked tirelessly for the full 90 mins and he linked up well with Varela.  People on here think we need more players like Depay or some flashy players who's going to beat his man.  I totally disagree.  We already have those players in Martial and Depay and maybe even Rashford now.  Jesse will compliment these players by doing the doggy work.  I agree with some on here that he's our new Ji Sung Three Lungs.

2245~~~
He's defensive ability is rather overrated. Did he not let Monreal go through completely unmarked early on in the game? That's quite basic stuff. Not the first time either.

2246~~~
He was nowhere to be seen in the beginning of the first half when Varela was struggling.

2247~~~
No Varela and Carrick watched Monreal run through and neither followed the run as he ran inbetween both players.

2248~~~
Monreal is Lingard's man to mark, not Varela's and certainly not Carrick's. He should have been tracking his run but was nowhere to be seen

2249~~~
Watch the play again fella.  Jesse ran to close down the throw from Wellbeck.  Which yes you'll say is Jesse fault for leaving space for Monreal. However as Monreal ran through neither Carrick or Varela bother to pick him up and instead Varela is waving his hands in the air trying to claim offside.

In football if a players goes past the midfield you can't claim the defence has no bloody responsibility.  I don't blame Jesse on this occasion as he was closing down the short throw but got beat to the ball.  Varela or Carrick should have watched the run as they had a perfect view but neither claimed responsibility.

2250~~~
I swear down people are just clutching at straws trying to pick any flaw in his game.  I don't mind criticism especially when it's warranted.  Jesse played a shit game in the Europa for instances so the criticism is fair but the shit spouted on here is laughable especially when Jesse played well yesterday.

2251~~~
I'm not his biggest fan but he played really well yesterday, his best performance this season.

2252~~~
Monreal should be tracked by Lingard. No if's and buts there.

Tuck your toys back in. I'm a fan of Jesse and I think he played very well yesterday.

2253~~~
So by that logic the defence don't have to track any runners getting through? lol!! and we can blame the midfield? I can tell you are a real footballer mate. Bet you've never kicked a ball in your life.

2254~~~
Not a fan, but I thought it was his best game of the season.

2255~~~
Yeah mate the defense should be tasked with tracking the runs of the opposing full back. That sounds like a brilliant plan

2256~~~
Lingard should have gone with Monreal there, but when he doesn't, someone else must step up. Varela and Carrick just watched as he walked through, although both did have concerns of their own. 

All three deserve equal criticism.

2257~~~
You really don't understand this team sport we watch do you?  Midfielders have a defensive duty as well as an attacking duty.  On the odd occasion when the opposition break through the defence the back four needs to take some responsibility in snuffing out the danger.  You think it's cool for them to just stand there and watch Monreal run through?

The defence aren't "tasked" to track a runner that is the assumed responsibility when someone runs through on goal.  It wasn't like Jesse was caught napping he went to close the ball down but got beat to the ball.  This happens in football and is a risk.  You need to take off your Lingard hating goggles and have some common sense.

2258~~~
You need to stop throwing your toys out and getting defensive each time someone says anything remotely negative about Lingard. Quit with the "You don't play sport, haven't kicked a ball" juvenile nonsense.

A quick look through this thread should tell you I don't 'hate' Lingard. Quite the opposite in fact.

All I've said is Lingard made a mistake. And he did. He didn't do a good enough job of tracking his man. Completely true. Should someone else have covered in for him? Probably but it started with him losing his man.

2259~~~
I cant remember it but would be great if somebody posted a clip. Im pretty sure it came from when our players thought it went out for a throw-in and a few stopped. But it also depends on who had Monreal initially as there are times that players are passed along to the closer man to mark depending on the circumstance.

Anyway, I like the little things he did like drawing them to win free kicks at a time we needed to keep the ball. Little simple things he does so well. Think he links up well with Varela too.

2260~~~
No I'm just calling bullshit on your view about who's to blame.  Should someone cover for Monreal? Probably?

You're having a bubble bath right?

So if my midfielder lost a marker I'm going to let them run through on goal? Ummm no Mr Akash you damn sure I'll be all over that.  If it started off with Lingard like you say then Varela and Carrick can share equal blame as they did sod all.  If anything the defence have more of a responsibility.

2261~~~
Skip to 2.14.  Lingard closes the ball down but gets done with a 1-2 with Welbeck. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_lE2nYnLRo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2262~~~
What a weird argument, all 3 fecked up on that goal, overall Lingard had a good game and will maintain a squad spot next season even when we strengthen the RW as he can then compete with Memphis for the LW.

2263~~~
Thanks <a class="username" data-user="38555, @SSSSnake" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38555/">@SSSSnake</a> 

From watching that clip, mostly Varelas fault given he has to see that run inside of him, basic defending responsibility but regardless, DDG bailed us out.

2264~~~
arguing about a goal when we've just won 3-2 with a depleted squad against one of the best teams, and with Rashford emerging like a beacon is the weirdness here.

I can only imagine the people are joyless bastards.

2265~~~
In such a bleak season as well, yesterday was a joy, I haven't given their goals another thought and it's just nice to be looking at the next game with some optimism for a change.

2266~~~
Exactly that pal.

Yesterday was "hugged to death by the chav i don't even know from behind" territory. The last time I got a hug at a game was the 4-2 v City.

2267~~~
To be fair I came on here to congratulate Lingard but then got distracted by this miserable sod who likes to point the finger, and his only argument was its Lingard's fault.

2268~~~
You really are utterly tiresome with your childish insults and shite posts.

Lingard shouldn't have allowed to Monreal to run off him unmarked. That was my point and guess what I don't even blame him because he's not a defender and I don't expect him to get everything right.

I made a single point and you've gone off like I've just accused him of murder. What a fecking weirdo.

2269~~~
you two, stop it now.

and get over to the Rashford thread, and whoop it up, while he's still so fresh!

2270~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It really was a great buzz, I was pretty much half asleep the rest of the afternoon and night I used up that much adrenaline on an already sleepy Sunday. I think the circumstances and the performances of our young players just elevated things to a level of excitement we've not had this season.

2271~~~
Changing your story now you realise your making yourself look a fool?

Earlier you said Varela didn't need to pick him up when he clearly did.  Anyway I'm done wih you.  Clearly there is no common sense here and I'll be accused of being a weirdo by calling you on your bullshit argument.  Here's hoping you never become a defender because I'd really feel sorry for that team with you shifting the blame on the midfield and forwards.  "Nah mate he's your man to mark!" **face palm**

2272~~~
Lingard has looked nice.

2273~~~
He's looked threatening.

2274~~~
He has looked much better playing in his more natural position.

2275~~~
Same shit, different day.

2276~~~
He had a decent few minutes at the start of the second half but apart from that, he's been poor. He consistently fails to beat his man and wastes possession far too often.

2277~~~
Looked decent when he got to move to the left, he looks more comfortable running with the ball from there as several of the academy watchers have said.

2278~~~
He makes so many stupid decisions per game... it's infuriating.

I don't know why he thinks he won't smash the ball at defenders when they're two yards away from him and he's made no effort to shift the ball or do anything to gain a yard.

2279~~~
Guaranteed to start the rest of the season.

It doesn't help him and it certainly doesn't help us. No matter how in ineffective he is, he'll play.

2280~~~
Looks that way. Such a shame to see the likes of Pereira and Januzaj get limited chances while Lingard plays every game. (I'll patiently wait for the 'but he is local and only 23 years old' brigade to slate me).

2281~~~
Funny how the posters that shoot people down when he gets a goal etc, completely disappear when he has yet another average (meh) performance.

2282~~~
One of our better players and has been for a while , don't know why he gets so much stick.

2283~~~
Yup, been like that all season mate.

2284~~~
I know we only had ten players today, but he did nothing today. He wasnt poor... But its not like he added anything either.

He's a better version of Young/Valencia, really.

2285~~~
Yeah we all know the ones. Anyhow, he had a good 5 minutes or so after the break but overall he wasn't up to much at all.

2286~~~
He's not better than peak Valencia. Even current Valencia would at least run at defenders and then smash the ball at their shins repeatedly.

2287~~~
Was one of our okayish players...had a very good effort at one point. Still quite ineffectual for most of the game though.

2288~~~
That shot from outside the box shortly after the break was very nice indeed.

2289~~~
Yep, was excellent. Capable of producing those occasional moments, but not usually often enough.

2290~~~
No and his overall play is nowhere near good enough. He loses the ball far too regularly.

2291~~~
Thought he did a few nice things once he moved out to the left, not a great game (or even good) but one of the few players that come out of it with any credit at all.

2292~~~
Just screams average.

2293~~~
He was one of our better players today.

2294~~~
If we were Swansea or West Brom or Palace or whatever and we'd produced him he'd be a useful but not that notable, versatile midfielder on decent wages who is homegrown and who is a decent finisher and can be plugged in when someone is hurt or when he's in form, like a James Morrison or Wayne Routledge or whatever. 

Perfectly decent, mid-table pro. I have no idea what else there is to see with him, though. He can't take players on and his vision/creativity and technique aren't special, and you basically need to have one of those qualities, right? And don't start talking about Thomas Muller. Does anyone think he'll be better in his prime than say, Steven Davis is? Would signing Steven Davis help us? 

I'm losing my mind with this team.

2295~~~
That means absolutely nothing.

2296~~~
A better version of which version of Valencia? Also, Young's been pretty alright and threatening through patches of his United career.

2297~~~
he had really bad start to the game but tried hard and almost scored, you could tell he was decent when played from left, his position is from the center, from there he won't get the chance though..

2298~~~
Routledge was a fairly promising youngster who's development plateaued when he moved to Spurs. Things don't always go to plan and I think it is somewhat rash of so many to assume we are seeing the end product/finished article in a player (Lingard) less than 30 games in to his debut season at the top level. It's apparent he won't ever be challenging for the ballon d'or but he has shown glimpses of genuine quality and a fantastic attitude despite the relative cesspit he has been dropped in to. Your opinion may prove to be perfectly accurate but for some, myself included, he has done enough for me to hold out on making a definitive judgement for another year or so and already gone a long way to proving that he could be somewhat useful, even if that is only as a back-up.

For the record, he successfully took on players against West Brom although I'll agree it isn't really his strength.

Previous players such as Butt, Brown and O'Shea left the club after making considerable contributions to our success, only to become "perfectly decent, mid table pro's" when they left. This is not to say Jesse will have the careers that they did but maybe it is often underestimated how valuable a "useful but not that notable" player can prove to be. Someone has to make up the numbers and it is unlikely that an exceptional talent would be willing to play such a role for any great length of time. A dependable and committed player who adores the club seems like a much better fit for the part IMO.

2299~~~
He's just plain average all around, but no one better to replace him. Sums us up at the moment imo.

2300~~~
While I was throwing out comparisons he also reminds me a bit of a less creative Susaeta.

2301~~~
AKA a Valencia special. The training sessions must be "interesting".

2302~~~
I actually thought today was one of his better games considering we were down to ten men. For once he seemed like he could actually dribble forward and went past his man a couple of times. You have to wonder why when we have 11 men, that he simply knocks it back every single time, yet if we are down to ten he can keep the ball close and take it forward.

2303~~~
For 5 minutes after the restart, yes, yes he was.

2304~~~
He created two chances all by himself which were probably our best and only chances in the game anyway. In general it isn't much but in a game like this he doesn't deserve much criticism considering he was pretty much our third best player, hardly anyone would do any better(see Memphis who was far worse).

2305~~~
Yup, and have a gander back through the thread, after the restart I posted and said he looked threatening. About five or so minutes into the second half, he disappeared. The whole team was utter shit, mind.

2306~~~
Get the trumpets out, Lingard was our THIRD best player today. Sorry but he does deserve criticism when he is very average and has shown that in pretty much every game he has played. He seems like a nice guy but if he merits a place in the first 11 based on that then we might aswell have 'the good guy' David Moyes as manager while we are at it. He is 23 years old, Not like he is 18-19 so the chances are that this is pretty much the final version of him, And this version isn't good enough for this club no matter how much you sugar coat it.

2307~~~
Never watched the Brom game due to work, but seeing Lingard described as ineffective seems agenda driven.
He has not got a perfect skill set and some may validly think he should be replaced with someone more suitable, but recently, we have been reliant on his goals and assists.
Inconsistent?  Frustrating? Underwhelming?  Maybe, but ineffective?
No.

2308~~~
I can't see one post with the word ineffective?

2309~~~
Look again.

2310~~~
Wowzers, one post. I don't see what's wrong with the word ineffective? He certainly was yesterday.

2311~~~
Well good for you.

2312~~~
You left out the fact that he has virtually none of the attributes needed to be a top wide player. Cannot beat a man, Cannot cross a ball and very limited passing ability (unless you count passing backwards or sideways, but if that's the case then Cleverly is the new Xavi).

2313~~~
The entire team played shit yesterday but Lingard will take the flack.  The norm for this thread.

2314~~~
Check the player threads for pretty much everyone who played yesterday, Everyone bar Smalling is getting slated.

2315~~~
Well, yeah. He has been ineffective in plenty of games this season. I think you're being rather pedantic pulling up a poster for using that particular word. He has had some good games, but far too often, he has failed to stamp his authority on a game and has been either anonymous or wildly inconsistent. For me, an attacking player that fails to perform his duties, can certainly be deemed ineffective. I mean, feck me, Rooney has been beyond ineffective in a hell of a lot of games over the past 2 years. Lingard certainly isn't the only one, but I don't see why you would take umbrage with the word ineffective when it's actually quite accurate.

2316~~~
And you ignore the fact that we would be a damned sight worse off without his goals and assists, an area we were really struggling with before he came into the team.
I thought we missed him versus Watford.

edit: Sorry I forgot to mention your opinion that he can't cross. Apart from his cross for Rashford, the volleyed one for Rooney sprung to mind.

Like I say, effective.

2317~~~
I know, right. Crazy that people comment on players in their respective threads. Absolutely ludicrous. Poor ouel Jesse.

2318~~~
He's starting games on merit. It's not his fault he's better than some of the others in the squad.

And players at 23 are the final version? Wut?

2319~~~
Ok, so tell me out the of the 25 games he has played this season, How many can you honestly say he has played well in? And just popping up with a goal and doing chuff all else doesn't count. 

What players do you know have came into an 'elite' team at 23 and gone on to be a top class player? There isn't too many.

2320~~~
As I said in my original post, he has a great goals/assist  ratio. That is the definition of effective. He as also done a sterling job defensively, in front of one our most makeshift defenses ever.
That you now choose to use the same word shows that you are ignoring these positives. Why?
Can we not have a balanced  view on things these days?
I acknowledged that what Jesse lacks may be enough for some to want a different player there, but let's take him on his merits. Good or bad.

Funny you mention Rooney, as Jesse is the antithesis of him.
No pomp and reputation. No unnecessary forcing of play, or dereliction of duty to pursue his Gerrard-like moment of glory. Just boring effective goal getting and positional awareness.

2321~~~
He's a had a few good games, a few average ones and some poor ones. Like almost everyone in the squad. Care to tell me who should be starting on merit? I'm waiting.

How is that relevant to whether he improves or not? And, he broke through at 21 and started LVG's first game in charge and would have got more games had he not got injured for months. Two, no one thinks he's going to be a top class player. The general feeling is that he can become a good squad player.

2322~~~
I'm not really ignoring any positives hence why I clearly stated that he has had some good games. I think you may just be ignoring the fact that even in some of the games where he got a goal or an assist, he has actually been quite poor. He has indeed had some effective games, but he has also had ineffective games.

Not funny I mentioned Rooney at all. There was no character traits being compared; merely the fact that Lingard certainly isn't the only one that has had ineffective games. Here's another one that has had plenty, Mata (still has 18 goals and assists combined but I have no problem saying that he has often been ineffective). I don't know, I'm starting to think that we maybe have different definitions of the word. It just seems that some are very touchy when anyone dares to question Lingard.

The lad has done an ok job since coming in and he is probably somewhat playing on merit given the dire form of others in his position. But personally, I think we need a massive upgrade in quality on Lingard. He's 23 now and has yet to really do anything of note. Even in the Championship, during several loan spells, he has failed to really stand-out. Cleverley looked an absolute star on loan at Watford when he was 18/19 and look how that turned out. The fact that Lingard failed to do much apart from his four goal debut for Birmingham leaves a-lot to be desired.

I just think that he fails to beat his man far too often and concedes possession on a very regular basis. Yes, he has come up with some nice goals but those momets have been overshadowed by poor all-round play (especially in an attcking sense). Defensively, he has been decent enough and he works hard. I wouldn't mind him staying as a squad player for another season, anyway. As realistically we won't get much for him, he hasn't got an ego and he will be happy to be a squad player. He doesn't convince me at all as a winger as I feel he has far too many shortcomings for that position, he might be better suited as a number ten.

2323~~~
Thanks for that we'll reasoned response. Doesn't mean I agree with it all though.

I think we do have a different understanding of the term effective, because I see it as positively influencing the scoreline, and in those terms, I think he has satisfied the criteria.
He does have his limitations and it would be fair to say we should have a better option on the right wing.
That said, right wing would not be his preferred position.
Jesse is a left sided or central forward / attacking midfielder. So he is doing OK in an unfavored position.

Mata is in the team for the same reason. No one offers the same output in that role, despite his obvious shortcomings.

Cleverly doesn't need mentioning here, anymore than Pogba, so forget that.

Jesse is likely to be a squad player, but one that can cover any of the front 6 slots with varying success.
SO I'm happy for him now but expect him to be demoted if we ever get our wide positions sorted, and get a mobile replacement for Mata.

2324~~~
Didn't he beat his man yesterday on a few occasions?  And I guess we'll just forget those assist/ crosses his created aginst Arsenal
1- Materazzi - Made his seria A debut at 24 and didn't make his first international debut until 28.  Ended up winning Seria A 5 times and won a world cup.

2- Ole Gunner Solskajaer- Didn't make the top tier in Norway until he was 22 and joined United a year later.  Enough said.

3- Les Ferdinand-  Made his premier league debut at 23 for QPR.  Ended up scoring 149 league goals with his best season tally when he was 30.

4- Drogba- I don't really have to comment on this one.

5- Di Natalie- didn't really blossom until 27, yet he's having the best year scoring 14 goals at the age of 37.

6- Ian Wright- Didn't make his England debut until 28 when he signed for Arsenal

7- Klose- Made it at the age of 23.  Now he's the record goal scorer in the World Cup finals.

8- Luca Toni- Was playing Serie B football at 26. 

I could go on all day

Some list that <a class="username" data-user="38555, @SSSSnake" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38555/">@SSSSnake</a> 
Not forgetting the Prem's record goalscorer  Alan Shearer who scored 23 goals up until he signed for Blackburn aged 22.

2327~~~
How the heck did I forget Alan Shearer? 
I was tempted to add Jamie Vardy (29) but we'll wait to see how the season ends.  Hopefully he'll have a winners medal come May.

2328~~~
Sorry, Who are you?

2329~~~
As you said, it isn't an exhaustive list.
I wonder how many of those lost a season to serious injury to?
indeed. Come on Leicester!

2330~~~
Brilliant list. I'm sick of people thinking that players like Lingard are too old to make it.

2331~~~
1 - The same guy who had a disaster spell at Everton and only ever actually seemed like a good defender for 2-3 years? Ok good start..

2 - Give you that one

3 - Ferdinand was a good player, Not top calibre, But a serviceable striker, OK.

4 - Yes

5 - Big fish in a small pond, Never tested himself outside of Udinese. Credit to him for Benjamin Button transformation though.

6, 7 & 8 - Ok. 

So you named 6 players which I bet you have had to scour Wikipedia for. I'm sure we could debate this all day but we are going to derail the topic so I'll leave it there.

2332~~~
These threads get a bit tiring with the same people posting the same negative stuff every single game no matter how he plays.

2333~~~
Materazzi has 5 league title and a world cup.  If you call that a disaster career then I can now understand your mentality towards Lingard.

But the point being there are several late bloomers so we can't rule out Jese's development completely.

2334~~~
You are putting words in my mouth though, I never said Materazzi had a 'disaster career', I said he had a disaster at Everton and only looked like a truly good defender for a maximum of 3 years which I believe as I watched alot of Inter.

I'm not ruling out Lingard completely, I said that he probably won't develop much more as a player which I stand by. I feel like I'm spending too much time in this thread and don't like to criticize, so I guess time is going to tell with this guy. But when he is playing in the upper realms of the Championship in a few years I won't be surprised at all.

2335~~~
So you think those players aren't good enough for us either? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Only players that have potential like Neymar are good enough apparently.

If half of our players were good as those we would be champions already.

2336~~~
When did I say that?

But if you want to be a smart arse, Then I don't think Prime Materazzi was good enough no, Les Ferdinand wasn't, Di Natale arguably wasn't (isn't), Toni maybe, and would Klose have worked here? That's questionable. So that leaves 3 of them players that were good enough IMO.

2337~~~
You just did.

2338~~~
Prior to me proving a point because you were making things up. Feels like i'm having a discussion with a 12 year old so i'll leave it there with you. At least some of the Jesse fans in here can have a reasonable discussion, For as much as me and <a class="username" data-user="38555, @SSSSnake" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38555/">@SSSSnake</a> disagree for example, at least it's fun.

2339~~~
You have criticised him in at least 10 posts since yesterday, and other players you have criticised since yesterday are just Carrick and Blind, and those two were by far our worst players. Lingard was our third best easily. You have posted in Darmian and Depay's thread too, but you weren't criticising them, you were actually defending Depay despite him costing us 30m or whatever and looking disinterested for majority of the season, including yesterday, but yet Lingard is the one who deserves criticism in your opinion. And let's not forget that he plays out of position most of the time. But yeah let's blame Lingard because he is 23.

Today you are arguing that even if he becomes as good as the likes of di Natale, Klose, that that isn't good enough.

2340~~~
I'd prefer to say our 9th worst....

2341~~~
I really thought Materazzi was a good player mate.  Ever since he joined Inter.  That spell when Inter were dominating from 2006-2010 he was a key player especially in that winning world cup team.  We really have different views on players.

2342~~~
Being 3rd best player on a team that loses to Tony Pulis's West Brom isn't much of an achievement is it? I think in all honesty the only player that could of walked away from that game happy with their performance yesterday was Smalling, and maybe Martial if we are clutching straws. After that I don't think there was a 'third best' because everyone else was crap. I criticise Lingard alot because he is just so average it is frustrating, It has shades of Richardson and Cleverly written all over it yet he seems to be one of the first names on the teamsheet which is absurd.

I wasn't defending Memphis, I criticised Van Gaal's management of him, which I think has been poor on the most part. But hey most of the things he has done since he became manager has been poor and that's why he needs to go at the end of the season.

2343~~~
That's fair enough, Different opinions. I always felt with Materazzi is that he was a mistake waiting to happen whether it was a rash challenge or a red card. He did have some good years though, I felt Mourinho really got the best out of him and I would like to think he could do similar with some players here if he comes in.

2344~~~
It's not his fault that we have no one else. I know that he shouldn't be a first choice but only if we had better players, but if he is playing better than others in his position then he should play. Also, as I said earlier, he is playing out of position most of the time, he isn't right winger at all, out of three he can play I would say that's the one that he hates the most so he deserves more sympathy than someone like Memphis who looks like he couldn't care less about the team more often than not.

As for the Tony Pulis side argument, I don't know why are you ignoring the fact that we were playing with ten men, not even more talented players like Martial could do anything special.

2345~~~
Some people are just angry that they are too old to hack it.

2346~~~
Kills every attack when he gets the ball.

2347~~~
Guy isn't even premier league level let alone Man Utd level.

2348~~~
He reminds me of how Fletcher used to be on the right wing but not as good!

2349~~~
Feck his age (that gives him leaway if your a teenager) but with Lingard its his ability people are questioning!

2350~~~
Garbage

2351~~~
Think people are being far too harsh on Lingard. He has had some very quiet games recently, today was not one of them though. He really ran at the West Ham back line in the second half, during a period when not much was happening down our left. I thought it lifted the team and got Varela and Herrera back into the game. He is not the second coming of David Beckham but he did a really decent job today, and covered back a lot to boot.

2352~~~
I'm one of Lingard's "defenders" but I thought he was very mediocre today.

2353~~~
Someone else described him as passive. That really is the best word for him. He always seem so reluctant to take on his man - the complete opposite of Martial on the other wing. Still, if it's a choice between him and Depay, I'll allow it.

2354~~~
We've been playing without a right hand side all season. It's a very weird handicap to self impose.

2355~~~
Just plain average. 

He's not good enough. But he's not the only one tbf to him.

2356~~~
Rather put Valencia back on the wings alongside Valera.

Lingard is one of the reasons the club is struggling. Putting up mediocre players from the academy because it is the United way.

2357~~~
I agree that he hasn't been good for a couple of games, but I think he was better today. Most of our attacks in the second half came from that side. It helped that Herera made so many overalapping runs.

2358~~~
Average.

2359~~~
I find it very hard to criticize him. He's a player that is playing way above his posts.

2360~~~
Nah, it's LVG's way of picking Lingard's and Weir's over Januzaj, Pereira and Wilson's.

2361~~~
Its a position that clearly needs upgrading. Its like having Tom Cleverley playing right wing or something, what does he offer really apart from the very minimum? He needs to be doing a lot more.

2362~~~
How much of that is Lingard and how much of that is Van Gaal? I would say the fact that Lingard is picked consistently means that he does what the manager asks. So I'm hoping that the limitations are from the manager and not the player. But Jesse has been underwhelming at times.

2363~~~
He gets the ball, waits for the overlap. If the overlap isn't on he'll pass it back again. The opponents know him now and never commit more than one defender to him, so that really stifles our attack. We really don't have anyone else, Martial doesn't work there, Januzaj is out of favour. So it is of paramount importance that we sign a qualified right winger this summer. It could do wonders for our attack to have threat on both flanks.

2364~~~
He is not good enough to be our starting right winger every game. He should be a back up squad member. Definitely good enough for that role. 

That's why I was surprised when we ended up not going for mane or anybody else for that right wing.

2365~~~
Got better in the second half. Martial was also shit in the first half and played in his preferred position..

Dont understand why we dont give a chance to pereira who is certainly better suited to the wing with his skillset even though its not his best position but so isnt Lingard's

2366~~~
Its been clear for weeks on end he's miles from good enough. He offers nothing whatsoever. He's not even an average player. Needs to be sold in the summer.

2367~~~
He doesnt even get subbed off anymore... He's a 90 minute man every match he's eligible, but he does so very little. I just dont get it.

2368~~~
Totally agree. In fact with the inclusion of Williams on the bench yesterday i'm now sure that LVG is trying to give out as many first team debuts as possible to deflect attention from his poor performances as a manager (and that is no reflection on Williams btw, I think he has a big future).

I've said from the start that Lingard is average, yet I got labelled 'a hater'. It's all well and good wanting an academy player coming through and playing in the first team, But he has got to be good enough to continue playing in that position, which Lingard simply isn't. He is this years Tom Cleverly or Kieran Richardson before that. You can accommodate those type of players if we have a great team around them but at this present time we simply do not, and cannot afford to carry passengers which Lingard is, Like it or not.

2369~~~
Lingard is starting on merit and this despite playing in an unfamiliar role.

Ideally, we'd have someone better but that's not Lingard's fault.

2370~~~
Can you still call it an unfamiliar role? He's only played this one position in the senior team.

2371~~~
He gets fouled a lot. Thats something.

2372~~~
You can. Not only is he playing in an unfamiliar position but he's been asked to play the role of a traditional winger which requires him to beat his man which he's not very good at. He's still done a decent job of it.

2373~~~
He'd odd. I like him, and think he could (and does) score his fair share of goals, but he'd also be probably the first name in our present starting XI that I'd want replacing in the summer. Definitely keep him as a squad member though.

2374~~~
Anonymous tonight.

2375~~~
He's substandard

2376~~~
I thought he had a decent game, especially in the second half. Give us drive through the middle that we often lack.

2377~~~
Needs to cut out the diving,other than that thought he was ok tonight.

2378~~~
One of our better players, nowhere near good enough though.

2379~~~
Involved in nearly all our good interplay tonight and carried the ball through the centre reasonably well. Not sure what his actual position was because he seemed to be popping up everywhere and seemed a lot more comfortable than being stuck out on the right.

2380~~~
He can't really shake players off or go past them, so he opts to win a free kick every time. That's pretty intelligent because he knows he can't beat players.
He'll run with the ball in space, but when there's confrontation he just shifts responsability to the next guy. To have someone like that in our front 3, is far from good enough.
He had a fine game by his standards, but for me his standard is well below what I believe makes a Manchester United player.

2381~~~
He was alright, but that is his level.

2382~~~
He tried hard just lacks a bit of final quality.

2383~~~
All of our freekick takers are average so not much point of him winning freekicks these days.

2384~~~
Played well in general, and his superior pace and ability to run at and past people got us on the front foot quite a few times. But just like Fellaini, the final ball never quite worked.

2385~~~
He's a Swansea standard player, lets be honest.

2386~~~
He can't run past people. His pace is also average.

2387~~~
He did well.

2388~~~
Average. Did a couple of nice things but once again average at best.

2389~~~
He's only in the team because of where he was born. He's not good enough, sadly. Not his fault. Won't be in the XI next season (I hope).

2390~~~
Squad player at best

2391~~~
I still don't really rate him.

He's a hard worker, but that's about it...

2392~~~
He wouldn't get anywhere near the Spurs side, the Arsenal side, City, Leicester, Chelsea, Liverpool......the list goes on and on....

2393~~~
I commend him for his effort, he isn't a bad player, it's just that he isn't brilliant, either. 

I do think he'd have thrived under Sir Alex.

2394~~~
I agree, he did ok along with Martial and Rashford. Problem is no midfield players going beyond them then things basically break down.
The midfield is utter shite.

2395~~~
Take out DDG and Martial and your statement could apply to any of the others.

2396~~~
He wouldn't get in most teams in the league. Championship player.

2397~~~
Any idea if he could play full back? He'd be quite good going forward, but perhaps he'd be a huge weak link in defense?

2398~~~
Players like him starting is fine when it's one or two of these. Two or three of these jokers in defence, two in midfield (carrick is done), one in attack is frightening. Mata just barely makes the grade for someone who is supposed to be the technical maestro of a top team.

2399~~~
Any idea if he'd be good in net? Quick off his line, but shit at saving stuff. Jesus Christ.

2400~~~
I thought he was good. Mata was the one with his lack of pace on the right wing trying to cover Varela's man and failing to do so time and again in this match.

2401~~~
I'm not talking about beating people in 1v1's, where he does tend to struggle. But there were a number of times the Liverpool midfield were trying to hold their positions and he'd go between them to put us on the front foot in fairly good position. And pace-wise, while he'll struggle against many fullbacks, he's faster than many (most?) midfielders. And certainly faster than Mata.

2402~~~
Get off your high horse, mate. He's already been tried at wing back, so it's not like this a ridiculous speculation.

2403~~~
Fair enough. My concern with him playing in that nr.10 position is that he doesn't seem to have a creative pass in him when he's facing the goal. He'll run at the defence and pass it square to the next guy. So it makes these runs a little redundant. But we're really blunt as an attacking unit, he would of course look better in a more mobile and quicker tempo team.

2404~~~
He's not really a creator but he has goals in him and very mobile in his link up play.I'll try Januzaj on the right wing and him in the number 10 role in a game along with Martial and Rashford to see how it goes.

2405~~~
He should be a squad player for us. Thats not his fault.

2406~~~
I actually don't think his pace is that average. He's quite quick imo.

I thought he a decent game. He always made runs and was available to receive the ball. He probably abandoned some of his defensive responsibilities today, which is understandable. In the second half, he constantly made runs from the half way line almost into Liverpool's box (Although, Liverpool really didn't close him down much tbf) and he had some really good 1-2's with the likes of Martial and Rashford (That back heel for Martial's blazed over shot was lovely). Covered like 30-40 yards really quickly, but probably began to tire by the 70 min mark. Definitely one of our better players. I think people here expect every academy player to have a ceiling like Borthwick-Jackson, TFM etc which isn't necessary at all. I quite like him even if he is not as skillful enough to be a winger. His crossing is poor I agree, but I believe he can work on that. I hope he has a good career here. He's not going to a regular first teamer, but more than a useful Squad player.

2407~~~
His finishing is below average for a guy who has 'goals in him'. He has missed several great opportunities over the course of the season. A bang average player starting for us regularly as a first team player out of necessity.

2408~~~
He was actually an excellent finisher at the youth level. I don't think one wasted chance can make us judge that he is below average. Look at the number of chances Martial had, not even one of them was even close to troubling the keeper (I agree some were tough, but it isn't too much expectation for him to get a shot on target).

2409~~~
You think I am basing it only on yesterday's game? I don't care for his finishing at youth level as that is where players score 4-5 goals many times.

2410~~~
The guy is a very limited player but, he tries to make things happen and he has no fear. Can't fault the guy for that

2411~~~
He's just excellent at taking runs and challenging players - often with great success. Just look at often he's involved. A very modern pattern on the field. He just need to lift his head a lot more and know when to let the ball go. He's got a lot of talent otherwise.

2412~~~
Lindgard is not limited though. I simply don't get all the negativity in this thread.  Lingard's a good dribbler and his link up play is good. Im afraid he's been stifled by LVG because he looks threatening when he makes runs at defenders. He's one of the most fouled players in our team for a reason
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8KG8vEnw3Y?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2413~~~
His crossing is decent when he first broke through however it has quickly been Valenciaized.Something is very wrong with all the crossing and set pieces training with almost all of our players getting worse on those aspects.

2414~~~
This, he's never a first choice player, week in, week out. 

Unfortunately, we've been forced to make such a limited player important for us. His pace is actually needed, we'd be far worse sticking Mata on the right every game.

2415~~~
Even if you think he is absolutely shit(which is obviously over the top), you still have to respect him because he at least tries positive things all the time even if he fails. I hate criticising players who at least want to show some creativity in their play and give their all in a dull team, it's simply not fair to criticise  those players too much.

 I like him, but I don't think he should be more than a squad player, it's not his fault van Gaal sticks with him ever since he got his debut and because Memphis is shit.

2416~~~
Thought he gave the ball away far too much last night and he was poor in possession. He was positive though; I guess that's a positive, right?

2417~~~
Thought he was superb last night. For me, our best player. Never stopped running, had a real go. Great touch, passing on point, and very creative. Showed he can handle the big occassion. One of the few highlights (certainly after 30mins)

2418~~~
Wtf did I just read? Better than Martial? Come on buddy. Lingard was average, by definition. Better than a lot of others, but that's not saying much. Had a poor first half, and improved during the second.

But our best player on the night? Not a chance. I'd personally have Martial, DDG, Fellaini, Rashford all ahead of him.

2419~~~
You would class <i>that</i> performance as 'superb'. Wow. How we have fallen.

2420~~~
Aye, I'm thinking the same.

2421~~~
He tried last night, but once again, his overall quality/end product lets him down.

He also got caught out of position quite a few times, but then, he was playing in the middle for some bizarre reason.

2422~~~
I remember the days when a superb performance was Scholes at his best, Keane bossing a game or a moment of magic from Ronaldo. Now though, a pretty meh performance from Lingard constitutes as superb. This season can't end soon enough.

2423~~~
Please start giving Januzaj opportunities. He's miles more talented than Lingard and in a season where we look like achieving, I'd rather we prioritize the young players who are genuinely capable of making a big impact at United. Lingard getting a few chances is fine but he's simply not talented enough to be starting every game, while much more talented footballers bide their time in the 21's.

2424~~~
Yep.

I can see people thinking he was one of our better performers I suppose, not that it's any big compliment, but to label him superb last night is just ridiculous and shows how much standards have dropped round here.

Lingard is a local lad and seems a nice enough guy but he just isn't good enough for Man Utd, or rather he isn't good enough for what I want Man Utd to be. This mid table dogshit Utd of the last 3  years? yeah he's probably good enough for that.

2425~~~
100% correct but for many they have decided Lingard is shite.
At least he didn't cost any money unlike a lot of the absolute dross that makes the team up.

2426~~~
ffs most of them should be squad players not just Lingard, and I include Mata and Herera in that. Waste of fecking money.

2427~~~
Erm, you do realise that this is the Lingard thread, right? Those other players that you mentioned are being critisised in their respective threads.

2428~~~
He played well along with Martial and Rashford. Meh performances????????????? that would have been Smalling, Rojo, Varela, Carrick and that useless fecking midget.

2429~~~
Yep. But like Sylar said - it`s not Lingard`s or Fellaini`s fault that we are not able to get top Players.

2430~~~
Aye like Januzaj is the answer. Potential yes, a long long long way from proving he can play consistently at this level.

2431~~~
He was positive, that was about it. He seriously lack quality and gave the ball away far too much. In fairness to him, he did try to be positive but not a-lot was coming off for him. Anyhow, that post was in response to someone that said he was <i>superb</i>. We obviously have very different standards for how United players should perform, because he certainly wasn't superb or anything like it.

Why do you keep banging on about other players? No one is exonerating them. They are being talked about in their own threads. This is the Lingard thread after all. And no one is wildly criticising him from what I can see.

2432~~~
Thought he was ok last night to be fair to him, But he is still nowhere near good enough for this team. A competent manager will probably turf him out and rightfully so as we just cannot afford to keep carrying passengers. Same could be said for a few in this squad mind.

I thought he was decent last night. Not 'superb' obviously, but it was a good showing. 

I like seeing players try to get something fecking done. It's the same reason I have more patience with Memphis than most.

2434~~~
I'd say 23 of the 27 appearances Lingard has made this season have been meh to be honest.

2435~~~
I will bang on about whatever I please, my point is their are plenty players in the team that have been utter shite, players that cost the club a lot of money.
Lingard has performed no worse than any of them over a period of time and I would rather see a player who came through the ranks get a chance rather than watch overated overpayed tossers.

2436~~~
Yep, and again, people are talking about Lingard in here as it is the Lingard thread.

2437~~~
Ah well, my feeling is some make their minds up before the game even starts.

2438~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> your a funny guy. I am sure I have mentioned Lingard in every post. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
Enjoy the rest of your day, if you can.

2439~~~
Erm, ok. Cheers.

2440~~~
I haven't seen the game back but I must admit I thought Jesse had a poor game last night. He was often given the ball with space to run into but didn't use the ball overly well - maybe I need to watch it back to get all the replays and various camera angles that you get on TV but I just didn't feel he was at his best. He was one of very few that never gave up though, fair play to him for that.

2441~~~
That doesn't make sense considering it is in the matches themselves when he has been very average. Has nothing to do with 'my decision prior to the game', Most of the thread agrees he is nowhere near good enough for this team, we don't all have an agenda. Jesus i'd like him to be great, I really would, but you have to call things as you see it and unfortunately he is just bang average.

2442~~~
My sentiments exactly. He tried all game and he tried to be as positive as he could. However, I feel he conceded possession far too much and things just weren't happening for him. Had that good chance early on which resulted in a good save from Mignolet and he tried all night, but ultimately it was an average performance and he faded in the second half.

2443~~~
I get what you are saying, but it's not that bad either. Truth is we hardly get one clear cut opportunity per game all season. We have seen even veterans like Mata, Rooney miss some simple finishes. So to single that aspect out from his footballing side seems a little unfair. 

Hmm, but then you should expect that to happen to Borthwick-Jackson or Young's crosses (Even though Young never ever looks up when he crosses, many of his crosses are decent) as well. Most of the time Lingard is never in a good position to deliver a cross is what I am thinking. He hardly takes the ball to the byline and always prefers being in the box while the likes of the RB and No 10 sort out how to get the ball to the byline.

2444~~~
Doesn't matter given we have nooone with any consistency in that position anyway.

2445~~~
Think he gets far to much undeserved criticism on here.

2446~~~
A very Welbeck-like 2nd half. Great running with the ball, looked the most likely to make things happen but that final decision was nearly always the wrong one.

2447~~~
He is now one of the first names on the team sheet. He plays in one of the forward roles, yet he doesn't create nearly enough chances or have the ability to beat a man and shake things up a bit. When you're an automatic starter at this club you should be judged as such, and what I've seen is simply far from good enough.

2448~~~
He works his hardest and always tries, but everything he does is just plain average IMO. He will be a good squad player for us in the future, when we need to rest people or mix it about he can do the job, but if we want to take over Europe again we need better players. He and Mata should not be in our starting 11.

2449~~~
I think if we want to takeover Europe he's exactly what we need. He will only get better! Offers a lot of work rate and he can play abit in the final third. He just needs a better functioning team around him.

2450~~~
I don't think he will get better to be honest. In my eyes he's at the limit of his potential, that's not to say he is a bad player though. on his day he can be very effective, I just think he will always be an average player rather than the top bracket. He will get plenty of minutes with us in the 3 behind the striker throughout a season.

2451~~~
He just reminds me of a frank lampard. He just needs to work on his attributes. Very limited players have become top tier.

2452~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2453~~~
I don't see what he brings to our attack.

2454~~~
Energy and gets in good positions mainly.

2455~~~
I love how Lingard got over there in the City player's faces when they were pushing Rashford after the blatant penalty which wasn't given. That's what I want in a teammate. Well done Jesse.

2456~~~
Good stuff from him again today. 

Also loved seeing him run over to stick up for Rashford getting pushed around a bit, good lad.

2457~~~
Energy and pace. Not sure why hes in the middle though.

Great at the end too.

2458~~~
Agreed. He gets such a hard time

But although he doesn't always influence a game he rarely is poor

2459~~~
Lovely. I'm sick of tired of our players getting bullied - great to see Jesse sticking up for young Rashford.

2460~~~
Yep, noticed that too. Others acting like bunch of pussies.

2461~~~
he lacks a bit of quality with his final pass but it's actually refreshing to see a player who likes to run around that no10 position, make some runs and picking pockets, also great tracking back down yaya, that is one of the reasons he's there

2462~~~
Aye, the final ball really lets him down when he is moving at pace.

2463~~~
A little bit off topic, but am I the only one confusing Lingard for Rashford?

2464~~~
The quality of his touches and dribbles drops off quite heavily when he's fatigued. I'd argue that it's the most of any of our other players.

2465~~~
Only criticism of him today is his fitness, he falls away late into games. 

That said, he puts some running in early on. Maybe needs to find a happy medium if he can't increase his stamina.

2466~~~
He was everywhere at the end. Popping up at left back, right back and on the wings.

Great defensive performance.

2467~~~
He always seems to panic a bit towards the end of games when we're defending... like he thinks the only thing he can do is hoof it aimlessly. He just needs to be a bit more composed.

2468~~~
He gets about but he's noticeably knackered and it affects his touch etc. 

Not trying to diminish his performance, he had a very good game.

2469~~~
That could be a part of it too, yea.

2470~~~
He was all over the place today it seemed to me atleast defensively in the 2nd half. Tracking runners deep and intercepting even.

Problem is he gets so deep defensively that he doesn't get involved attacking wise then and doesn't have that much ball carrying ability in tight areas.

His stamina and workrate are great but he's average otherwise. Sort of a Poor man's Ji Sung Park at this stage.

2471~~~
I was really pleased with what he offered today. He was solid.

2472~~~
I disagree. Lingard looked really tired out there when we were closing out the game. I was a bit annoyed because it was almost as if we were playing with 10 men. Either way it was a decent outing for him today. Brought enthusiasm and energy to the game that positively contributed to our attack.

2473~~~
Thats fine. Could do with the fact that he played 90 mins, along with the rest, on Thursday.

2474~~~
Dont agree. In what was a terrible second half performance, he was everywhere. Running up and down, tackling, holding up Aguero at the end.

2475~~~
Probably the hardest working player on the pitch

Was delighted with him

2476~~~
This.

Top squad player performance at it's finest

2477~~~
This is what stood out to me, too. He was so obviously tired after an hour, and his [usually very good] touch wasn't there anymore. He became sloppy on the ball. Still deserves a lot of credit for today - endless running and kept it simple. Great game.

2478~~~
Agree.  He played well today.  Still maintain the position that talent wise he may not be United first XI material but work rate, commitment  and passion all there today.  Incredible amount of tracking back.  Well done today.

2479~~~
Yea definitely. 

Anyway I'm looking overly critical here, he had a very good game today, it's a relatively minor critique that's all.

2480~~~
a lot of people forget about this factor, he was quite average today but he worked his socks off, hopefully he will get a couple other runs out in the middle and prove his worth, yaya and silva posses a lot of threat through the middle so he didn't have time to attack, expect him to get much better in other games unlike from the right wing where he plays on the edge of his abilities

2481~~~
Intelligent performance from him today. Doesn't have the raw skill of some other players, but his workrate and positioning were probably more valuable in this game.

2482~~~
Very good performance today.

2483~~~
and thats not his fault.

Was fantastic today, top performance.....so happy for him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2484~~~
I don't dispute the fact that he was definitely working hard to cover ground, I am just saying that  his fatigue clearly disabled him from doing as much as he wanted IMO.

2485~~~
Yep. I'm not criticising him for it. It's what it is. He works his socks off and did well today overall.

2486~~~
Our Park replacement?

2487~~~
He does tend to slip away later on in matches, but definitely a very good squad player.

2488~~~
Wasn't bad at all today but I still think he's average.

2489~~~
I love him.

2490~~~
I like him, think this forum is ridiculously harsh on him, and think he's got a long term future here.

2491~~~
Thought he was excellent today.

2492~~~
I think that was his best game for us, his ability to run the ball out from the center was something we've not had all season, and he was box to box all afternoon.

2493~~~
I thought he had a very good first half, but he really struggled as the game went on.

2494~~~
Definitely has a future here I can see him being a big part of the squad next year as he has the passion and the workrate to be a great player despite not having the technical ability of some others.

2495~~~
Love him down the middle. His ability to drive with the ball allows us to open teams up. We saw glimpses of it against Liverpool, and today, epsecally when Toure was deep, he was constantly able to find pockets of space and was always a threat. Second half, due to tiredness and City dominating, he wasn't able to get on the ball that much, but it was a promising perfomance.

2496~~~
Quality today. Worked his socks off.

Loved his runs through the centre of the pitch whilst linking up with team mates. Adds another dimension to our attack.

2497~~~
I don't the forum is, in fact I think most people do tend to have the right idea about him, in that long term he is not good enough to be a starter for a top team. He played well today though credit to him, his last 2 games have probably been the most consistent he has shown so far. If he can keep this level of showing up then maybe he could become a squad player.

2498~~~
It's interesting that he's suddenly being played in the middle in the last couple of matches. I have to give LVG some credit for it, as it's something I wouldn't have expected him to do. But I think it shows that LVG isn't completely happy with Mata in that role, and that he wants someone with a bit more pace and ability to run past people and force things to happen that way.

Lingard (and to a lesser extent Mata) were causing City all kinds of problems in the first half while they had Toure playing in the deeper role. They were just constantly getting in behind him and getting us on the attack. Very good play from him during that period, and overall I'd say it was a good match from him.

2499~~~
Was really good today.

2500~~~
Great today. Perfect derby attitude from him.

2501~~~
Decent game from him, although he did fade as it went on.

2502~~~
Last couple of games he seems to have added driving forward with the ball to his skill set, puts in a real shift too, up and down the pitch. If he could just improve his finishing he'll be one hell of a player.

2503~~~
Definitely - nothing spectacular, but didn't do anything wrong and passed the ball well. Thought we should've put Memphis or Adnan on for him after an hour or 70 mins, but he defended very well at the end and made up for it.

2504~~~
Love that he stuck up for Rashford against that cnut Demichellis.

2505~~~
His best performance so far.

2506~~~
Much better performance today.

2507~~~
He was shite, constantly gave the ball away, gets the ball in open space and kicks it straight to a defender, fouling for no reason and falling over, good defensively, poor in attack. Needs to be replaced in the squad for a better attacker. He's like park or welbeck as a player who'll work his sock but not good enough to start.

2508~~~
He's much better in the middle IMO.

2509~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://u.goal.com/196500/196512_hp.jpg" src="http://u.goal.com/196500/196512_hp.jpg"/>

yeah, those days when we had Park Ji-Sung starting for us and we won absolutely everything sure were shite, weren't they?

2510~~~
Gave his all and especially in the first part of the game was a real menace but, as he tired, his touch let him down a few times. Still isn't a player that would be a every game starter if we had more quality but, we don't at the moment. Even when we do - he will be a very good squad player to have in the case we need a player that can be counted on for a period of time to be solid.

2511~~~
All hail Lingard, were winning titles now.
Read again, Lingard NOT good enough. He's a player LIKE Park and Welbeck WHO will run their socks off but (I repeat) LINGARD is not good enough (as them).

2512~~~
But its just an entirely ridiculous comparison to make. Comparing him to two players who played an awfully large amount of games in a very successful spell for the club to argue that he's not good enough? Fergie's teams always, always had players who would work their bollocks off supplementing more talented player. In a season where most of our attack has been utter dog shite Lingard's been comfortably one of the least bad performers. 

I can understand not wanting him to be a part of the first team consistently, but this desire from some posters to kick him out of the squad completely? Its damn right bizarre.

2513~~~
If we ever get to a point where Lingard is a squad player for us then I'll be a happy man, cos we must have a brilliant first team line up.

Right now, Lingard is first choice material and I expect that to continue.

2514~~~
He was the worst attacker from the forward 4 player we had on the pitch, that says it all, he need replacing in the squad. He's letting the attack down big time. I couldn't give a shite about his defensive work because I don't want UTD to be all about being a defensive team, I want to see UTD attack fluidly and for that to happen he needs to be replaced

2515~~~
Talking about a different game, but we could have done with him in the first leg against Liverpool in Europa. I do like the elements of link up play were seeing with him and the others up front (Mata of course and then Martial and Rashford).

2516~~~
No it says literally nothing, they all played well and we won the fecking game.

But no, you're right lets get rid of all the academy kids who give a feck about the club and replace them with over-paid mercenaries. Its clearly a winning strategy, which is why replacing Welbeck with Falcao worked so well. Any suggestion we sell Lingard on the back of the season he's had is ridiculous for me, he's clearly showed enough to be given longer.

2517~~~
Huh? The other attackers played well, so if he was the "worst" of the 4, that doesn't say much about him, especially considering his role was different to that of Martial/Rashford and even Mata in that had a more defensive role. You say you don't want United to be defensive but, even in a team like Barca, they've got 3 absolutely phenomenal players who don't have to do do much defending. The rest of the team team have to make up for that. Football requires defending as a team and for that you need players like Lingard who can be good going forward but, require a good work rate on the other side of the ball. 

That said, he was quite fluid in the first part of the game where we were most threatening, made some great runs and in one case was let down by just a slightly misplaced ball and in another, had taken up a good position when Martial chose to shoot instead.

2518~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

A player who puts in a shift is required for a fluid attack or you end up like Arsenal. Do you remember SAF's best teams? Grafters are required sqaud players.

2519~~~

2520~~~
Weird game for Lingard to be criticised for. I'm not a huge fan but I thought today was definitely one of his better games for us. We need better for sure but today isn't a game he deserves criticism for.

2521~~~
He played well today and credit to him for sticking up for Rashford. I still think he lacks that little bit of quality for that final pass or finish but I don't have many complaints about his performance today. 

He's always been better playing from the left or in that advanced midfield role though that is one think I will say in his defence.

2522~~~
<b>Lingard at no.10</b>

“Yes, that is why I have put him there [because he played well], but sometimes also I need a right winger who is fast. It’s also dependable on the opponent and the game plan, but I think Jesse is more of a midfielder than a right-winger. He played there two times very well."

well I've been saying that from the very beginning, IMO it was always clear to see what he could bring as CAM, btw where he always excelled for England U21, he was always going to look a bit limited from the wing and even more from the right.. It's like playing Smalling as RB, could do the job but just has the skill set to play better elsewhere, not really suggesting Lingard can be as good as Chris as CB but at least we can evaluate his potential properly when he plays in his preferred position and then decide whether to move him on or keep him. Better games will come from him I am sure once he recovers from the busy schedule, his touch wasn't generally good due to tireness but showed right intentions which is important for me as he's clearly on a good way to be part of the squad for the future if everything goes well..

2523~~~
What would Rio know? Wiz4321 says he's shite, that's enough for me.

2524~~~
You must be watching a completely different game. Pretty much everyone on the cafe and even the pundits praised him.  Solid performance today.

2525~~~
I haven't been in his corner but that was a good performance. Wasteful as he tired but the whole team dropped off. He probably isn't a right winger, his movement is much more suited to this role. We should be aiming higher than having him as a guaranteed starter like now but he could have a role here.

2526~~~
what a load of bollocks

2527~~~
Did well today looks much more suited to this role than when he's out in the right. Night and day for me, not similar players but like Fletcher out on the right he's limited.

2528~~~
He's far better in the middle, where his work rate and movement benefits him more so.

He's like a much worse version of Thomas Muller.

2529~~~
His movement off and on the ball is his biggest asset. He did very well at his role today. Lingard's movement, work rate and pace + Mata's technique and pass. I think it will be a very good number 10 if we can combine them <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

2530~~~
first one to defend Rashford when City players attacked him, legend! Probably my favorite United player along with Carras.... 

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/idTi0BwhIw2/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2531~~~
As a right winger he don't have all the neccessery tools to succeed but in the middle he's a different animal. 
I'm so happy for him. He proved me and many others wrong. His skills set is much more suited to play as a B2B or CAM. In this position I can see a long term future for him in the United squad, maybe as a permanent starter if he continue to deliver performances like this.

2532~~~
Put in a good shift today.

2533~~~
Love that

2534~~~
I agree, but I'm afraid that is why Lingard is not good enough for us yet despite his work rate and movement, and it also highlights why we desperately need a pacy and tricky right winger. Both Lingard and Mata are better centrally.

2535~~~
Lingard can be our Mane.

2536~~~
Yes

2537~~~
Agreed, looks much better in the middle and ive been highly critical of the lad but cant fault him today. Also played with real fight and passion, we've missed that quality in recent years.

2538~~~
Loved him getting stuck in to look after rashford

2539~~~
Well it's a given that he's better centrally than on the wing given his attributes.I found it hilarious to see some people tried to give LVG stick for playing a player in his best position, regardless how they think it's the end of the world to have Jesse Lingard playing as a number 10 for Manchester United.

2540~~~
Agree. Strangely, he is become a player I know won't be a liability and oddly keeps it ticking with his senseless movements.
The only thing I'd like to see him work on is his composure, to allow for better thru balls because the way he plays his passes are made whilst he on the move.

2541~~~
Very fast and surprisingly good defender. End product is a bit lacking for an attacking player though.

2542~~~
Very nice to see the bond between these two.

2543~~~
I am sorry but attacking wise, he was as poor or as average as he has been. Had a couple of easy/half difficult passes to make to put Martial or Rashford through and completely messed it.

He is good defensively but as an attacker and especially as a #10/right wide player, he just does not have enough guile or ability. Can be a good squad player but I will be dismayed if he is still a starter next season for us in either of those crucial attacking positions considering how shite we have been this season and we need to improve it asap.

2544~~~
Don't be sorry it's just your opinion.  Personally for me I think we'll see the better in him playing central.

2545~~~
I thought Lingard was very good against City. Both he and Rashford were superb.

I liked he coming from central as he will carry the ball and help make space for others out wide and ahead of him. It was also good to see him getting stuck in and he had Rashford's back following that penalty shout.

2546~~~
Looked like a poor man's Thomas Muller. Will be a good player for us and I suspect will have a decent career.

2547~~~
Does anyone think he could perform a similar role for us like Welbeck did on Alonso.. he could be a very useful tactical asset v games against Guardiola who will no doubt use a ball playing DM. We could do with someone like Lingard really pressing hard against the opponents deep lying playmaker who once he wins it can counter at pace.

2548~~~
Very promising performance. I'll be interested to see what Van Gaal does with it. The fluidity, pace, menace we had going forward in the first half was a bit of an eye-opener. I'd love to think it was design rather than pot luck on management's behalf. Time will tell.

2549~~~
The new Park Ji-Sung. Unsung hero, very important to the team, gets stuck in and does the dirty work. Compliments the squad very well.

2550~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4i-Vhdw0ahs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

You lot are raving over this, feck me standard have dropped, where's the intelligent movement, where the vision needed to play at #10, where the quality. Hes at #10 because he's defensively minded. Yes that's right were such a shower of shite even our attacker at #10 is a defensive player.

2551~~~
Thank you for this comment, its not me only who thinks he's not what he's being raved about. Good squad player but nothing more. Shouldn't be starting for us. Get in a competent manager who plays attacking football and he as a player will not be required, sorry to say, as long as we play a defensive game he'll be apart of the team, along with Fellaini, Blind etc Van Gaal players that optimise Van Gaal philosophy on the pitch.

2552~~~
Consistently average.

2553~~~
mourinho is exceptionally defensive so he might like him?

2554~~~
I don't think he's doing too bad considering he's still like within the first 25 premiership games. People go on and on about his age but experience is important too. He can clearly improve just like anyone who is in their debut season

2555~~~
Better as #10 than wide? MOTD focused on it yesterday.

2556~~~
He's growing on me. The more talented Januzaj could do worse than take note of how Lingard got this high in the pecking order.

2557~~~
Well Mou is going to prioritize defensive work rate as that is his style. That's one of the reasons why I don't want Mou, but at this point I feel like he's necessary to start getting us back on track.

2558~~~
I hope Lingard sticks around and forges a decent career with us. I don't expect him to ever be a starter when everyone is fit next season with new additions but to have a lad who has come through the Academy, who works his socks off and knows what it takes to be a United player is vital to have around. People will say he's not good enough but we are not going to spend $30m for players to sit on the bench and become unhappy, I feel Lingard will appreciate that role and with the cups & injuries that we always seem to get he will get his fair share of football. Hopefully we bring in another winger and Memphis features more next season which will push him down the rankings.

He will be like our new Park, great defensively, limited ability going forward but great movement and can pop up with vital goals.

2559~~~
Definitely in the middle. He's a good proper footballer, what I meant by proper footballer means he uses his brain. He knows when to pass the ball, likes to make forward through pass and his movement on and off the ball is very good. On top of that for bonus he has pace, high work rate and from our own academy which is free. I don't think he should be our starter but he's very decent to have in squad. He doesn't beat players often and doesn't do crossing and his crossing is not good anyway so he's not a winger to me.

2560~~~
Mourinho is defensive but he likes his attackers to have pace and be strong and having the ability to produce a piece of magic from time to time.

2561~~~
Jesse has decent pace, can perform his defensive duties & has the ability to produce moments to magic. Jose will like him.

2562~~~
Look, if you're expecting the class of Ozil from him then you're looking for the wrong thing. He's never going to be a 9/10 player. He's one of those who can add balance, work-rate and hopefully intelligence going forward and put on 7/10 performances regularly.

I've been critical of him as I don't think a player who starts week in week out should be so plain vanilla and at times, pointless. But fair play to him, he had a good game against City especially in the context of it being City away from home.

2563~~~
Apart from that wonder striker against Chelsea, I cannot remember one moment of brilliance from him. He has OK pace but Jose likes someone like Williams. Someone who can score brilliant goals, can go on solo runs and can take on defenders and completely run through an entire midfield when the opposition press. None of them are qualities which apply to Jesse.

I like the lad as a squad player but he is not good enough for us as a starter. When we were at our absolute best last, we had the blinding pace of Ronaldo (apart from his obvious other qualities) and Giggs' sublime guile and skills on our wings. Jesse is not even close to either of them. If we want to reach that level, Jesse needs to step aside and play as a squad player like Park while we get in better quality.

2564~~~
He will be a squad player next season. With all due respect to him, if he's going to be a first choice 10/RW next season, we better lower our expectations already.

2565~~~
You are preaching to the choir by quoting me on that. I completely agree. A squad player but nothing more.

2566~~~
I don't think he is a regular starter for us either. There is no disagreement there.

I think he looks worse in the current set-up where our attack is very disjointed and our expectations are of a Ronaldo or a Giggs. He is not a player who is going to take the team to the next level. He is not be the flashiest player in the world, but as a squad player, very very useful. He is selfless and can easily adapt to various positions and tactics. Jesse also has the ability in him to pop-up with important goals and assists. That is why I think any new manager would like him, be it Jose or Giggs.

By the way, how many brilliant goals has Willian scored? How many moments of magic does he produce? Whenever I have seen him play, he seems to run around a lot without producing much. A disruptor, more than a creator.

2567~~~
William is a quality player. Calling him a disruption is very harsh. A hard working Hleb with pace is a better description, as he is genuinely excellent on the ball. He isn't a great goalscorer (think he has improved I think this season) but his overall contribution to the buildup is very good - dribbling in tight spaces, carrying the attack forward, linking up etc. Completely different level to Lingard.

Also, he's better than Messi. Amiright Akash?

2568~~~
Definitely more than Lingard. Also, I used Willian as one example but there are plenty others out there who are also much much better than Lingard. However, I think we are in agreement that Lingard is not a good enough player to be a starter for us. We can let it rest at that.

2569~~~
I think most agree that he is a squad player at best. He is currently starting because of the woeful form of others and the fact that he has done an ok job since he has come in. There's a small minority on here that are completely overrating the chap, but that's par for the course really as he's a home-grown lad.

When he first came into the side, I wasn't one bit impressed with him and he just screamed mediocre. I had also seen a-bit of him during various loan spells to Championship sides (Birmingham and Derby spring to mind) and he never really stood out as an exceptional Championship player; he wasn't even a guaranteed starter on loan at Derby last season. He scored four on his debut for Birmingham but never really set the Championship alight apart from that. Even Cleverley managed to look a star in the making when he was on loan at Watford and he was only 18/19. So to say I had little or no expectations for Lingard would be an understatement. I was actually surprised he wasn't shipped out in the summer just gone.

But I have to say, he has slightly grown on me and he put in his best shift for us yet against City, IMO. Still though, we need far better and some of Lingard's attributes such as his pace are exaggerated wildly on here. I would have him as a squad player next season, no problem at all but we need a far better starter.

2570~~~
I agree that he probably is not anything more than a squad player. That being said, it appears to be that some underestimate him due to being played out of position for most of the season. 

Jessie Lingard is not a winger any more than Scholes was. In my opinion his potential is through the middle, and its been exciting watching him there for the last teo games. He reminds be a bit of Frank Lampard. Less of a goal threath, but with more pace and higher work ratio. I think the goals will come from him too.

2571~~~
He was excellent against City, and from reading this thread, I generally think he's been much better than he's been given credit for, and came into the team and gave us a lift at a point where Memphis was real crap.

2572~~~
Agreed. I was amazed to see him not up with Rashford for MOTM in the derby when I voted.

2573~~~
Exactly, players like him and young are decent squad players, but should not be starting at MUFC

2574~~~
The funny thing is, if Januzaj was performing the way that Lingard has, I would be pretty satisfied <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> He's producing some goals and assists, generally following instructions from the coaching staff, avoiding injury, and showing dedication and composure.

2575~~~
I think he had a very good game against City. To say otherwise speaks of an agenda in my opinion.

I do agree though that long term, he's most likely to be a squad player. However, he's still very young (in terms of experience) and who knows how he might flourish with  more game time? I'd absolutely love for the guy to make it. 

What I really enjoyed from his performance the other day was that when he received the ball his first thought generally, was to play it forward. If he was closed down, he tried to beat the man. Compare that to Mata, who I feel a lot of the time this season has been playing backwards passes from the same position.

2576~~~

2577~~~
I don't see why he couldn't be a park kind of player for us. Park was one of my favourite players of the era and while the stars of the time were Ronnie Rooney and all, park was excellent and a vital cog.

2578~~~
I liked him in the no.10 position. Let's see if he can show more of that

2579~~~
Yep, I can see that. You need players who fit everything together, and Jesse's one of those.

2580~~~
Park had Ronaldo, Rooney, Tevez, Scholes, Giggs around him so we didn't need his creative aspect. In our current team Park would be pretty poor if we are being frank.

In this current team we are devoid of creativity, so we cannot afford to carry 'work horses' in one of our main attacking positions. If we signed Griezmann and James for example then the situation may be different, but right now we don't have them kind of players.

2581~~~
Yaya Toure always struggles against smaller nippy players. It is probably because he has the turning circle of a barge. 

Lingard would face a sterner test through the middle against someone like Schneiderlin who is mobile, strong and likes a tackle.

2582~~~
Agreed.

Against the Southampton team who played Morgan & Wanyama, I think Lingard would be completely ineffective.

Lingard should be taking Youngs place in the squad as back up winger.

2583~~~
I think we should give him some benefit of doubt, its his first season and what he show in this season is excellent.
Are Class 92 are as great when they play their first season? can any older poster conform that?
We should give him more change, he may be improve or at worst he can become squad player which is still very good thing.

2584~~~
Lingard was to a bigger extent up against Fernandinho and Fernando - not Yaya. And he did fine against Can and Henderson/Milner too down the middle. His future is down through the middle.

2585~~~
I don't get what people expect. It seems like some start with the unfair  expectation that every young player coming into the team is to be judged as the next big thing and therefore being a squad player level becomes a criticism. 

He may step up in the future but for now if he continues to prove himself good enough to be of the squad that'd a decent achievement.

2586~~~
Beckham, Giggs and Scholes all had very notable qualities that were apparent from their early appearances. It made their less impressive performances more tolerable as you knew they had the ability to change a game at any moment and it was just a case of giving them time to become more rounded and consistent with the delivery of their qualities. Giggs was electric and exciting from the moment he hit the scene and was already well established by the time the rest started filtering through. Sadly Jesse doesn't quite have any stand out traits in the way they did.

Gary Neville took a little bit longer to convince as he didn't have the raw ability/talent of the others and it was his professionalism, sheer will, determination and drive to improve that turned him in to such a good player. Hopefully Jesse can do something similar, learn his role/s, create good understandings with the players around him and continue to improve on his solid base.

All the above is of course my opinion and people may see things differently as they do now with Jesse. The coverage and access to football back then was nowhere near as comprehensive as now and that has led to increased scrutiny on each and every moment or facet of a players game nowadays.

I think a lot of the stick Lingard gets is due to his age, he isn't a bonafide youngster and so people don't see the scope for improvement they would if he were 19-21. I look at it from the point of view that this is his debut season for the club and at the top level, he will still be learning so much about the game and that gives him a lot of room to develop if he has the right attitude/application, which he seems to have.

2587~~~
i agree completely. to me, lingard is a much better version of young. given the futures the two have in front of them, it should be a no brainer we keep lingard and let/make young move on.

2588~~~
There's no question he's not a Giggs, Scholes or Beckham. But he could definitely be a Gary Neville or Nicky Butt. And he'll probably be more of a player than Phil...

As <a class="username" data-user="82770, @caisenma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82770/">@caisenma</a> says, he's a similar but better option to Ashley Young. I can't see how anyone wouldn't want us to keep him around when players like Young, Valencia and Fellaini are still in the squad.

2589~~~
He's doing well but he is not a starting/high quality winger.

2590~~~
Has anyone mentioned that he's not good enough to start for Manchester United yet? No? Well can I say that I don't think he should be starting for us. Because he's not good enough to be a starting player for us. And the fact we're starting him is an indication of. 1st XI.

2591~~~
I agree entirely with this.

2592~~~
I agree, there are so many average squad players already at the club, Lingard is younger, more versatile in the forward roles and with the potential to improve as this is his first full senior season at this level. He needs to improve his contribution in the final 3rd but even as it stands he's better value to the squad than 2 converted wingers in their 30's.

2593~~~
Oh Jesse...

2594~~~
I've read some people here said Lingard is similar but better option than Ashley. It seems that these people are underestimating what Ashley did last season. Both are different players, playing style and quality. If Lingard can pull out the same performance what Ashley did last season from now then he's currently better option but he's not. Even at his age, Ashley was still much better player than Lingard at Aston Villa. 

Lingard's playing style is much more effective in the middle not winger. The only reason why he can play as a winger because of his pace.

2595~~~
I think most feel he can be a decent squad player. Whether he's as good a squad player as Park remains to be seen. Park was an absolute pain to play against and that in addition to his quality on the ball, made him a unique squad player.

2596~~~
The trouble with the Caf is that they tend to shoehorn players very soon. Ander Herrera will always remain a very good player inspite of him not showing that on a consistent basis for us. Similarly Lingard will always be a squad players inspite of him gradually improving and essentially earning the spot in first XI.

2597~~~
It's because his quality doesn't say "future star." His technique isn't amazing, his dribbling isn't great, he doesn't have amazing vision, etc... Those are qualities that you can see when they're young and be hopeful that they can turn that into consistent weapons to become stars in the future. Players that can have the moments of magic to dominate a game. Lingard's best qualities are his movement and finishing when I saw him for the youth team. His finishing wasn't on the same level as Wilson or anything like that, but that was one of his best qualities.

I think it's understandable that people think he'll be a squad player.

2598~~~
All players improve at different age and level. Lingard has definitely improved since coming into the first team, why are people assuming that he won't improve year after year. He's always been a late bloomer.

2599~~~
I agree with your thinking - he most certainly can become Park like in his importance to our squad - but the problem is that our squad doesn't have a Rooney/Ronaldo atm. Which places a lot of responsibility on players like Lingard to "carry the load" etc. Hence the disappointment.

2600~~~
Not true at all. Herrera gets a lot of stick on here. I didn't rate Lingard at all when he first came into the team and now I feel he's a fine squad option. I'm sure plenty of others have went from not rating Lingard to thinking he's a grand squad player. Not many will want him as a starter which is understandable as we should be looking to improve during the summer.

2601~~~
I've preferred him in number 10, we just really need a decent right winger.

2602~~~
That's true but to critiscize lingard because we have no top players is just unfair on him. To me, he is a slightly better version of welbeck (he is a better finisher), yet people cry about how welbeck would have helped us and at the same time go on about how bang average lingard is when he plays.

2603~~~
This is it:

I think that people largely don't have anything against Lingard, it's just that seeing someone "who can be our Park" starting week in week out without the flair and class required to make up for the lack thereof in that type of player, frustrates people.

2604~~~
Also, I find the claim that he is better than Welbeck very debatable. I'm someone who finds the whole Welbeck drama utterly tedious, but he was definitely a better player IMO than Lingard presently is. He had (and still has) much greater ability on the ball. Lingard is younger so let's see how he develops over the next couple of years.

2605~~~
Lingard has a similar level of versatility and already has a better statistical output in terms of goals and assists than Ashley.

2606~~~
Yeah it is debatable indeed. I'd lean towards Welbeck as well but as you mentioned - he's also had a few more years to develop. 
It's not as simple as that though. People aren't criticizing Lingard because we lack top players. They're criticizing him because he's not a top player. After all, he's playing for Manchester United, it's expected that they're special players. Yet, besides Martial, non of the others have really wowed. 

Compounding matters are that Lingard plays in a position where it's almost a prerequisite to be very creative/attacking. But yeah, I'm hoping he kicks on and makes it at United - but there's going to be a few variables which will need to be in his favor as well.

2607~~~
What kind of level of versatility are you talking about? Ashley is a much better full back than Lingard. Ashley is a much better winger than Lingard. If you are talking about goals and assists Ashley had scored more goals and assists when he was at the same age. In term of recent performance I am sure we are all agree that Ashley last season was way better than Lingard this season. Both players are completely different players and playing style. One who likes to dribble, beat players and launch cross which is more typical of winger. And the other who likes to make through pass and moving around which is typical of central attacking mid. I don't see Lingard as a similar player with him, neither a better option except for his age only.

If we want to use a comparison, it should be Mata not Ashley. Mata and Lingard spent most of the time as a right winger. But their best position is no 10. Both are limit players but Lingard has pace while Mata has technique.

2608~~~
'Much better fullback' - neither should ever be playing there next season. 

As for being a better winger, again that's debatable. Young can beat his man and put endless crosses in but nothing ever amounts. Lingard is far more intelligent in his positioning, and as I said has already surpassed Young (who was apparently one of our best attackers last year) in goals and assists. Who cares about what Young was doing 'at his age'? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm comparing them at this club, I don't care what Young was doing at Villa or wherever he was. And no, I don't agree that Young's performances last season were better than what Lingard has delivered this year. 

Why do you keep referring to him as Ashley? Do you know him personally?

2609~~~
You must know welbeck pretty well yourself so.

2610~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BDVgJBMQcmW/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> https://www.instagram.com/p/BDVgJBMQcmW/</a>

Jessie with Jaap, P.Neville and Barthez when he was young

2611~~~
I wish.

2612~~~
Neither should be playing full back next season but aren't you the one who who were talking about being 'similar level of versatility'.

Hahahha, You made me laugh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm 100% sure I have post this twice that Lingard is a proper footballer because he uses his brain. His movement and positioning are good and that's why his best position is in the middle not as a winger. And Ashley is a winger. So like I already said it's an invalid comparison to see which one is better. Both of them are different players, playing style and even their best position is different.

It's true, I don't wanna talk about 'at his age' either. But if I didn't mention it I know people will make an excuse of 23 or 24 years old Lingard is more favorable. If you don't like it then we can drop it.
However I like how you are mentioning goals and (4?) assists, and being someone who used to like and supported Welbeck myself and you probably as well in my opinion goals and assists aren't the only things you can judge in football. Judging player's performance based on goals and assists is a lame and both of them aren't even striker. And it's shocking as well that the fact if you think Lingard this year is better than Ashley's performance last season. If you only watch the goals instead of watching what they have done in full 90 minutes so far then I'm not surprised. 

Why would you care about this? Is that an issue for you? One of the silliest question I've ever heard <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. I like to call Ashley as an Ashley or Young. I usually call Adnan as Adnan or Januzaj. I even call Bastian as Basti or Schweinsteiger or sometime Schweini. And I am sure so many United fans out there have done the same. You also did refer him as 'Ashley' on your first post <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

2613~~~
It's not debatable, it's just not true. Jesse is still a very average player. Who knows what his ceiling is. Can't see him becoming a regular starter for us in the future.

2614~~~
I'm as far from a Welbeck fan as there is but yes, he's definitely better than Lingard. I wouldn't even say it's 'debatable' in the slightest.

2615~~~
<a class="username" data-user="100978, @Mike09" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/100978/">@Mike09</a> to be fair, you started calling him a 'proper footballer' the same time that Tweet from Rio calling him the exact same thing was posted.

2616~~~
Yea but it's true that he is a proper one.

2617~~~
I don't really know what a 'proper footballer' is so I'm unfortunately not in a position to comment.

2618~~~
I don't see the point you mentioned me and commented about my 'proper footballer' post either.

2619~~~
You have brought it up a few times and I was merely pointing out that you said it after the Rio tweet. So you're just saying what Rio said but trying to make out it's your point, which it isn't.

2620~~~
I'm sure I did say 'twice' not 'a few times'. Which I did. And for someone who doesn't know what a 'proper footballer' is, I can see that you misunderstood my post from the beginning.

2621~~~
I think I may have been taking the piss our of you with the not understanding a 'proper footballer' thing. Like, it's some phrase that Rio used, wow. You have used it a few times now and it looks as though you're attempting to claim that it's your opinion when in fact you said it pretty much straight after the Rio tweet. You could have at least referred to the tweet.

2622~~~
So you know what is a 'proper footballer'? Mind explain to me what is a proper footballer? If you can give me your view of that 'proper footballer'. I'll give you the reason why I called Lingard as a 'proper footballer' which I already did a few times before this post and it's not based on Rio Ferdinand's post. And to be honest I've been posting 'that reason' in Lingard's red cafe forum so many times before Rio's tweet.

2623~~~
Well a quick search of proper footballer in this thread comes up with the Rio tweet and you saying it a day later. It's clearly a phrase that's open to interpitaton to be honest.

2624~~~
Come on man. That's not the answer for my question. Alright let's just make it simple. Do you know what is a 'proper footballer'? All I want is yes or no. If you said yes then please explain it to me (either in one sentence or longer version I don't mind).
If you don't answer it (yes or no) then I can't explain to you the reason why I called Lingard as a 'proper footballer' because you don't read people post properly. And to be honest I might need to make this clear again it's not based on Rio's tweet.

2625~~~
There's no such phrase.

2626~~~
Do you even read? Can you answer it please? Look! I even said 'please'. I don't think it's hard to say yes or no. I've been explain that 'proper footballer' in my definition on Lingard's forum on red cafe many times.

2627~~~
I answered. There's no definition. It's open to interpretation. I could say Bale is a proper player and someone else could say Ozil is a proper player, or Thiago Silva etc. It's a throwaway phrase that I've heard (not frequently) over the years that doesn't relate to any particular genre / style of player. The person that utters the phrase is obviously of the opinion that the player they describe as such, is the correct definition.

Like when you copied Rio, sorry, I mean, like you're of the opinion that Lingard is a 'proper player'. It means feck all but you are trying to state in unequivocal terms, that your definition is correct. You think Lingard is a 'proper footballer' because he's intelligent etc; that's fab and all but means nothing. It's merely your opinion and the phrase holds no weight whatsoever.

2628~~~
Finally!! Thank you! I have been asking this because I also want to hear your opinion.

Alright so now I'll explain mine. You think there is no definition, but IMO there is definition. My definition of proper footballer is a footballer who knows the basic, I am not talking about being able to pass the ball or something because that is obvious stuff that footballer needs to have. That basic means using brain when playing (which is intelligent) and don't stay static and always moving around but not being headless chicken. And my view on Lingard has never change. As a proof:



As the one before Rio's tweet: I can't provide it because they were in newbie forum and full member have no access to it. But you should get what I meant of my definition of 'proper footballer'. I don't copy Rio's tweet without understand the meaning of being 'proper footballer'. Just because I interpreted it in the same word as Rio (proper footballer) because IMO it's a better word to describe player but that doesn't mean I copy him because I have my own definition as a proper footballer and it's different with what Rio tweeted. For example people called Smalling as a beast this season after Rio said it, and not many people mentioned Rio's comment. They have their own definition of beast on Smalling.

2629~~~
Well again, that's just your opinion on the phrase.

2630~~~
But it is true. Rio did say about movement but only Lingard's off movement. I described and defined it differently and much more detail. I can't see that as a copy. That's the point is.

2631~~~
But another persons interpretation of a 'proper footballer' might be pace and muscle like Bale. The phrase hasn't got any clear definition.

Lingard certainly isn't everyone's cup of tea so I can't see too many agreeing with the assertion that he's a 'proper footballer'. I would personally say he's a tidy hardworking player. To some, that might mean a limited player who isn't good enough while to others, it might be the perfect squad player.

2632~~~
My definition of 'proper footballer' would be someone who has a natural understanding of the game, and just 'gets' positioning, timing etc on a field. As opposed to someone who is merely a tremendous athlete but with no footballing brain. Obviously, you need technique too, but I think it's possible yo have all the technique and not be a 'proper footballer', for example those guys who are great at keepy ups but shite in a match. Awareness, timing, positioning are all key components of what I would see as a 'proper footballer', on top of the obvious technique.

Examples I would give are Scholes, Muller, Redondo as a less mainstream pick maybe. Don't think you have to be at that level of course, there are 'proper footballers' at Sunday League level.
Edit: I appreciate no one asked, just thought I'd join in <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2633~~~
I don't see being a proper footballer needs to have pace and muscle, it doesn't make any sense. Being a proper striker isn't just about goals but also intelligent and movement. Being a proper keeper isn't just about great saves or reflex but also need to be smart and good in his positioning, Carrick and Scholes aren't exactly pacey or muscle but they are a proper footballer because they use their brain and knows what they are doing. Park Ji Sung is a proper professional footballer, Rio said being a proper defender needs to defend with his brain instead of body.  

Being limited because of they lack the technical and physical gift but that's not about being a proper footballer. Being top class or world class footballer is different with being just a proper footballer.

2634~~~
Someone who's not a 'proper footballer' would be Theo Walcott.

2635~~~
Exactly. And he has so much pace but not intelligent enough to be a proper footballer.

2636~~~
I believe you're missing the poster's point completely. You're defining what a proper footballer is, by your definition. But, you're also stating that this is in fact a definitive definition of the term, proper footballer. But there simply isn't one. He used pacy and muscular to illustrate his point that other people could use that definition to define proper footballer. 

Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean it's incorrect. Just like if someone doesn't agree with your definition of a proper footballer doesn't mean it's incorrect. As he stated, correctly in my opinion, it's basically a throwaway phrase that can mean anything.

2637~~~
Not really, you might need to read the point of his and my discussion at first post. That's what I have been saying because he missed my point from the start. Rio has his own define of being a proper footballer on Lingard. And I have my own define of being a proper footballer on Lingard. But he defined it as me copying Rio. I don't see it as a copy if they both have different explanation.

2638~~~
Huh? You're completely missing the point here. I didn't say having pace and power makes a 'proper footballer'. My point is that you've amassed a set of attributes that you associate with Lingard and used those attributes to describe a 'proper footballer'. That's merely your definition and someone else's definition might mean something completely different.

2639~~~
Proper footballer <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2640~~~
Yeah it says a lot when ppl have to get this creative.

2641~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this thread. Can we leave him alone and get on with it? For this season he is fine, Januzaj and Depay dont deserve to start, they got their chances and failed. He isnt the most talented player ever, but he does a job currently and looks like he gives a shit at least.

2642~~~
Bizarre isn't it. Well Rio said it so y'know.....

2643~~~
The guy is the definition of a an excellent squad player/back up. Let him be!

2644~~~
Yeah whatever. It's not like that's the point of your moaning from the beginning. The point now is you can finally agree that people definition might mean something completely different and that's including my definition and Rio's tweet.

2645~~~
Erm ok. Still though, the phrase is null and void and wouldn't hold up in any argument.

2646~~~
Alright then, to make you happy let's call the phrase is null and void. All good.

2647~~~
Ok.

2648~~~
Homos!

2649~~~
I'm warming to him, thought he was useless a few months ago. He's intelligent and tidy and he works hard, doesn't break down attacking moves and can pop up with a goal or assist. He doesn't have a very high ceiling, but you can't ask for much more from a squad player. I hope he don't sell him as I love having academy lads in the squad, helps the mentality.

2650~~~
He's done well, and I like him, but I can't help but wonder how good we can be if we had someone like Willian in there for example. A hard worker who is also a quality player.

2651~~~
He's a possession recycler, playing in our number 10 position. No imagination so obviously we are boring offensively. But he works hard and closes down and some people seem to get enjoyment from watching that. He's become one of the first names on the team sheet, and that worries me.

2652~~~
Feck me, what do you think of Mata then?

At least Lingards positive when he has the ball.

2653~~~
because we turn into Barcelona when he isnt playing in number 10 or just when he isnt playing....

2654~~~
I think he was quite impressive in the first half, linking up everything in speed, found spaces, created chances and close them down really well, best player on the pitch with Carrick, shame Mata offers next to nothing on the right and fullbacks have very little space to attack neither they have the ability, Rojo was really poor and Rashford could have done better with some of the chances.. it's a tense game but we need to do more

2655~~~
The same, I've absolutely given up on Mata. The front four have to be positive, creative and quick. Consistantly 2 players out of our front four are timid and we suffer because of it.

2656~~~
what are you on? Did you see the game? he had a great half and created two chances, needs a bit of quality from other positions..

2657~~~
The new Ji Sung Park.

2658~~~
Can't remember really, because he plays every game, every minute now. Wish we'd see someone with potential to unlock a defense, someone like Januzaj or Pereira.

2659~~~
Yes it's the same excuse with Rooney, just needs a bit of quality from other players...

2660~~~
Think it's more of a case of what are you actually smoking?

2661~~~
its completely different situation, Lingard offers something, doesnt feck every second attempt to attack, clearly one of the best players in the first half and he's criticised :-D

2662~~~
Yes, that is what I'm coming to see him as. Helps that in his short career he seems to handle himself well in the big games.

2663~~~
When mata plays in the middle the space between the CM's and the CAM is too big. Lingard drags back alot and makes us compact.

2664~~~
Class performance today. My MotM. Love his give a feck attitude too like with the yellow card <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2665~~~
I have arguably been his biggest critic on the forum this season but he has been excellent the last 3 games I feel. Playing centrally seems to suit him and his attributes much better then playing out wide. Next season I want a higher quality player in his position, but he has certainly staked a claim for a squad player berth in the last month. Long may it continue.

2666~~~
Yeah, he was class. Sealed that position for our remaining games.

2667~~~
Been a big critic of him recently but he did very well today! Seems a lot better playing centrally.

2668~~~
Works hard which is good but he lacks quality and we need better in the most creative position on the pitch.

2669~~~
few of us were mentioning that he is playing out of position on the right(played good there IMO) and now when he is playing in his best position(LW or AM) he is shining and is one of the better players in the team. Joy to watch, pass and move at his finest.

2670~~~
If you call that performance class you really can't complain about van Gaal. Closing down, minimal risk and very few chances created. The embodiment of a LvG player. 
I missed the first 20 minutes, I'm shocked that he's getting rave reviews here. He must have split the atom in that opening 20 mins.

2671~~~
one of his best games of the season, I actually cant remember him giving the ball away on a single occasion, maybe just once when he overrun the ball after a nice surging run from our half. Think he didnt play easy balls like someone suggested here. He kept it simple when it was needed and took a risk at the right time as well.. very clever player and unlucky not to score as well, we look much more solid with him in the side, he closes the gap between midfield and attack really well both offensively and defensively..

2672~~~
I'm with you on this. I don't see it either. Perfectly embodies LVG.

2673~~~
The thing with Lingard is he plays the way you like to see football played: fast-paced, positive, hard-working, etc. (compare that with the way Cleverly used to play for us.) The problem is that his execution just isn't quite up to standard. I'm more than happy to see him as a squad player though.

2674~~~
He worked hard again and had some decent touches in the final 3rd in the first half, For me he doesn't have enough quality to be a starter in that role regularly but for now he's our best option.

2675~~~
you being the only one who criticise him here, might just be something in it

2676~~~
If he had that quality you are talking about he'd be an elite player.  I used to think the same but now i've come to appreciate his work rate, his determination, it doesn't always come off for him but he's always trying to make something happen.  And defensively he always puts in a shift.

2677~~~
I do appreciate him and his work ethic means that he has grown on me. Someone compared him to Park which I think is apt. Park was a great player for us but you wouldn't want him in the most creative position on the pitch.

2678~~~
I didn't really think he was that great today.  He certainly did a job anchoring the wide-outs but I don't think he has the craft to play centrally.  IMO he is better suited as a winger who uses his quickness to exploit space left him.  I do like him, I think we should hold onto him as a squad player.

2679~~~
I think Lingard has done enough to merit competing for a place in the team next season, so long as we can get rid of the slower players that are killing our creativity (Mata, Rooney, Fellaini). Not at all convinced that Lingard should own a place in the team ahead of Januzaj or Pereira.

Lingard has done ok but it's not that difficult to imagine one of the other youngsters contributing more, even if their work-rate isn't as good.

2680~~~
Excellent game today. The onus was on him and Martial today, as Mata and Rashford weren't at the races.
Sets a great example in his chasing down, and raised our tempo a couple of times. Faded in the last 15 mins.

2681~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Feck, I really need to go rewatch this match. I thought he was "ok". Did very little of note. Other than Martial, they all struggled to create much, if anything. 

But clearly I missed quite a bit because he seems to be getting rave reviews

2682~~~
He's fantastic.

2683~~~
He really wasn't anything special. He was ok.

2684~~~
That's exactly you how I saw it. Yet he's almost getting praised to the high heavens.

2685~~~
A very solid performance. The potential is there for him to develop into a very useful player, albeit with some limitations. Still pleased with what he's shown, and wish he was a half step closer to that chance today. Just imagine what he might offer in the future with continued development and better chance conversion.

2686~~~
Nah you're not alone. He's solid and works his ass off but there isn't much quality on the ball to admire.

2687~~~
Yeah. He could be useful, but atm we should try and aim for higher quality.

2688~~~
lets quote the great Johan Cruyff:
<i>"When you play a match, it is statistically proven that players actually have the ball 3 minutes on average … So, the most important thing is: what do you do during those 87 minutes when you do not have the ball. That is what determines wether you’re a good player or not."</i>

2689~~~
He is playing no. 10 because non of other no. 10 are playing well.
LVG give him chance and he take it well (at-least he is not terrible yet).
Yes he is like Park and you don't want to play him at most creative position but you also include him in 1st team to make a shift and allow other creative player to play their game.

2690~~~
he is one of our best players past three games and still getting stick, incredible, it was even better performance than against city and people call him average, how about first getting rid of players like Rooney and Mata who were underwhelming all season playing at that position? not mentioning that having actual fullbacks who could join attack would massively help our attacking game let alone having an actual right winger. I dont think Rashford was that good either this game and still is 18years of age and Carrick was overrun in the first half so Lingard being the best player on the pitch with Martial and Blind certainly doesn't deserve such stick, pathetic fans

2691~~~
Feel like he's only missing a bit on his execution to become a really good player.Hopefully a better manager will refine this side of him.

2692~~~
I always do the 'what other teams' test with homegrown players. Because obviously we desperately want them to make it, and so they get it a bit easier imo. What teams would Jesse get a match for? Real/Barca/Bayern/PSG/Arsenal/City would not even consider him on the bench for the position he plays, even less so as a 10. Put another way, Ozil, Silva, Bale, Ronaldo, Suarez, Neymar, Messi, Robben, Ribery, Thiago, Muller and so on are playing more or less where he plays for our 'competition'. 

You can get a long way on effort and not all XI need to be superstars...but number 10 is a crucial position and as useful as Jesse might be, come on.

2693~~~
He is a good squad player.
Any higher praise, at least right now, would be setting him up to knock him down.

We need players like him in the squad. They are very important.
We also need players better than him to be first choice... and someone he learn from/work with and improve.

Would obviously love if if he could step up and be first choice going forward... But if he doesnt do that, he could still be someone we need.. and rely on.

2694~~~
Putting fecking Arsenal and City's squads on par with the other 4 is daft.  Lingard would absolutely get a game for either of those teams and even if he didn't who cares?  It's not as if those 2 squads are covering themselves in glory this season.

2695~~~
I like him. Some people still haven't gotten over Danny leaving, but now a homegrown local lad comes in, puts in decent performances, and shows a lot of potential, and a lot of people want him to fail.

2696~~~
That's a fantastic quote and also something so many supporters don't care at all about - it's about those 3 minutes and that's the be all end all. 

In today's game (against Everton), I was keen to provide Lingard as an example to my son about how people don't really think he is United quality but, look at his effort and determination that helps him make up for where he lacks with the ball at his feet.

This is really his first season of first team football at the club and it doesn't matter what his current age is - given a chance, with the desire within him, he could very well go on to become a lot better player than he his now and he isn't too shabby at the moment either.

2697~~~
It's a real dumb argument. 

There are 100s of players in England (if not more) that can run around a lot, put tackles in and show desire. This is about quality. The no.10 slot is usually a source of creativity and he brings little. He's not awful, I don't think anyone is suggesting that. He simply hasn't shown enough going forward. 

The comparison to Welbeck is apt. He was no where near good enough either (despite the silly revisions going on now).

2698~~~
I dunno if you can say that. That first shot we had at goal from the Martial pile driver, was basically a Lingard pass. I think when he receives it, he mistimes the control, but still had the awareness to lay it on for Martial. He's probably not the most technically skilled (alteast compared to Martial, Memphis, Rashford) and can't make all those cute passes the others make, but I think he's quite positionally aware. I still believe he is much better at RW though, just needs to improve his crossing and needs a RB that is willing to overlap constantly.

2699~~~
He's defensive player playing in an attacking position. At least it's not Fellaini, that's the only positive for me.

2700~~~
RW is his least favourite position up front.
It is his first run in the first team, and he has only just started playing in his preferred role. Given time to bed in, I'm sure we will start seeing some of his interplay and snap shots from range, that he has always been capable of.

2701~~~
Not sure if this guy is trolling.

Lingaard seems to be getting some unwarranted criticism. His first breakthrough season in the team and he has performed very well in my opinion after a major injury last year. 

With all the youngsters in the team, he is a valuable asset as he would have been in and around them for a while so knows how to play with them and that will give confidence to the kids breaking through.

2702~~~
He was brilliant. One of our best players this season. He has good football intelligence (which people fail to recognize) and he runs like a machine. He isn't flashy but players like him and Blind are winning us lots of points. They're not quite being what people expect from players on their positions, and thus people fail to see that they run the show by making constant good decisions. Park is not a bad comparison, he has similar impact.

2703~~~
There you go!

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_z-9act9UE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Seems like a Mourinho type of No.10

Seriously though, its hard to put down his attacking contribution in that game considering there was zero movement in front of him and a packed four man defence to get through. His off ball movement was good, his drive from midfield and link up looked decent too. Also, his pressing from the front was very good (Although the lack of pressing from teammates meant it was often in vain).

2704~~~
You are right - absolutely dumb argument - at least based on what I said because I implied he was really lacking with ability to contribute in attacking way and all he brought was the effort and determination. However, that's not really what I meant to say. Just meant that right now he gives very good balance in that position because while he may not be an Ozil, Silva or even Mata type player currently, his other qualities help with that balance.

Given that he is just starting to get a few games in that position in the first team, there remains a good possibility that he can develop into an even better attacking player.

2705~~~
I didn't think much of him initially but the more i see him the more i think i might have underestimated him by a lot.
He seems like a really clever player.
Has a good habit of being in the right place at the right time.
You can say 23 but this is his first season having any serious involvement in the first team, so theres room for improvement.
He looks one of the most experienced and consistent players out there, its kind of impressive imo.
Theres a nous or something about him. 5 goals 4 assists is pretty decent too.

Or im wrong and hes a semi decent park replacement

2706~~~
Simply on pace, movement and running he's a breath of fresh air to our attack.

Remember the days of Falcao, Rooney and VP? In one way, all better players than Rashford and Lingard, but we look a heck of a lot better with these guys alongside Martial.

2707~~~
Makes the sale of Wellbeck even more baffling...

2708~~~
He never kicked on though, will always be a nearly man, and didn't want to be a squad player.

I feel Lingard has a chance to be better, and if not may accept squad status.

2709~~~
I agree in general, I was more thinking about our lack of pace, especially last season.

2710~~~
He'd of made a good wide midfielder in a 442 back in the day.

2711~~~
He's not creative enough or a big enough goal threat to be a regular starter for us once the team gets sorted out, but he's good cover for the LW/RW/AM roles.

2712~~~
In the style of football we've played, I don't think any forward has particularly smashed it though. Martial has probably been the one, who has succeeded through pure brilliance in himself.
Under Mourinho it could be better, but who knows.

It'd be a super interesting summer wondering how he'd reshape things.

2713~~~
I just don't think a change of manager is going to make Lingard any more talented on the ball, he's neat and tidy and works hard which is a useful asset to have in the squad, but the roles he plays in require a lot more creative quality than he has IMO.

2714~~~
Good job of hiding for now.

2715~~~
Looks like one of his usual performances prior to his good spell he has had the last few weeks.

2716~~~
He's playing as probably our most advanced player and we've not had much of the ball for 25 mins, hardly a shock he's not been in it much.

2717~~~
Such a nothing player, runs around without any proper intent, avoids tackles and does nothing of note, great to have him in starting 11.

2718~~~
Yup. Shows how far we've fallen that a player like this plays every game for us.

2719~~~
He doesn't do anything. I don't know why he's first choice, I'd rather have Mata there and Memphis on the right.

2720~~~
Not going to call him out for a poor performance yet but he is the catalyst right now for Spurs' dominance at the end of that half. He's not been able to retain possession or offer support to Martial, Rashford or Mata effectively.

As a 10, he works well hustling and we reaped the rewards of that with his due diligence to pick the balls up that Schneiderlin and Carrick won repeatedly in the first 25. When that hustle stops though, he's not effective and we lose an avenue to retain possession high up the pitch.

2721~~~
He's alright but I can't accept him knowing that we have a world class talent in Januzaj missing games this season because of Lingard.

2722~~~
Honest half, works hard and gives 100%. Can't complain cause that's where we are at mo, and in fairness has contributed this season with goals and assists....

2723~~~
Ultimately, he just isnt good enough. 

For me, hes not intelligent enough to play that role and van Gaal isnt smart enough to figure that out.

2724~~~
Not today.

2725~~~
no worse then any other attacking player on the pitch.

2726~~~
He is simply not good enough to make it at a top club, despite his professionalism, desire and pace. It's an indication of how far our standards have fallen, how thin and weak our squad is and how our manager thinks that he makes it to the lineup so regularly. Squad player, nothing more. 

Today he should've been the one on the right and Mata in the middle, though. Given his pace and defensive contributions (anyone's better than Mata at that, ask Mourinho), he should have kept Rose pegged back, and let Mata do his magic and get Martial and Rashford into the game. We are leaving 1/3rds of the pitch empty on the right fro Rose to attack, and only Mata to cut him down. Is that what Mata is supposed to do? Martial gets outnumbered because Spurs can afford to ignore our non-existent attacks down the right. Rashford's barely seen the ball. 

But the stubborn underperformer we have for a manager will refuse to see this.

2727~~~
The lad is shite. It's insane that he's been one of the first names on the team sheet this season.

2728~~~
Feck me... I like him but that's abysmal.

2729~~~
He's as average as they come. Which is exactly why he's a regular for us at the minute, depressingly. 

If we have any aspirations of getting back to where we were he should be one of the first names out the door in the summer.

2730~~~
Not nearly good enough to be getting starts. Not for Manchester United, not for any Premier League team, I struggle to find a Premier League team I see him getting many appearances in. Puts himself about but that's it. Will take a backpass every time. Not an ounce of creativity and he's starting as our nr.10? That's bad enough and now it seems he won't be taken off either. As I've said earlier he presents the embodiement of LvG, all about closing down space and sideways passing.
His supporters will say as above, not worse than anyone else. But he won't make anyone around him play better either.

2731~~~
he shouldn't be starting. But there's a few of them out there, not just him.

2732~~~
Yup. Yet I've been criticised for saying he isn't good enough for months.

2733~~~
Typical Lingard performance, where's everyone to blow my mind and say he was good today? Or does that only happen if the rest of our attack produce the goods and get us the win?

2734~~~
Being able to perform every now and the for Manchester United, doesn't make you a Manchester United player. Quite the opposite.

2735~~~
Mastered the inverted false #10 role.

2736~~~
He's had a few fairly good games recently, but the game completely passed him by today. Someone playing in that position needs to be able to do...something...to get themselves involved and help turn the tide of the game.

2737~~~
Definition of a pointless player.

2738~~~
All graft. He's had a couple of decent games as a #10, but ultimately it's too important a position IMO to be playing a "tryer" in.

2739~~~
I honestly cant even remember the last time he was subbed. 

An LVG player that will be scrapheaped as soon as a new manager is brought in.

2740~~~
He's absolutely nowhere near good enough to be a starter for us. Some on here seem to really rate him but I just don't see it.

2741~~~
I wouldn't say it's typical today. He was definitely poor. When the game is tight, he doesn't have the intelligence to get into the pockets of space well enough. However, you cannot argue when the game needs to be pushed and stretched, he gives us a much needed central presence. Whether he should be getting chances ahead of Perreira/Januzai and Herrera though, that's another topic. 

He totally should have been swapped with Mata where it would have suited Juan. Where there's pace in the game on and off the ball, Mata's quick thinking and touch would do much better there. 

Crazy LVG tactics.

2742~~~
Even so I don't think he enough quality on the ball when he has time and space. He is far from good enough for the most creative position in a top team IMO

2743~~~
Mata would've been squashed into a little ball of white dog shit by Dier and Dembele and bowled down the tunnel. Lingard did absolutely nothing but it's not like we're blessed with players for this role. Maybe Herrera would've been a happy medium

2744~~~
Lingard is a decent little player and a hard worker. But how the feck is he getting in the side?

Lingard at no.10 when Mata is on the pitch is mental, Lingard on the pitch when we have Depay, Herrera, on the bench and Januzaj not even getting a game is batshit crazy.

He's a young player and could improve in the future but right now the majority of the time especially in the middle he is an absolute passenger.

2745~~~
Thing is I can get him playing 10 in some situations, if you had a Carrick like player in the other team than someone like lingaard who can buzz around them and be useful in attack can be a plus. But it's got to be balanced. Mata is a far superior number 10 and weaker wide player. He doesn't have the same pace/energy as lingard and won't be as effective at winning the ball back but will be more effective at retaining and progressing the ball.

That's another thing that really annoys me about LVG. He gets in to certain mind sets and then is fixed on them until something massively goes wrong. He doesn't adapt his approach to the situation at all.

2746~~~
That'd be a bit more meaningful if anyone else had done anything aside from one shot from Martial. 

Lingard was pretty ineffective today but I really find it hard to be overly critical of any individual player with the state of things at the moment. Apart from Rojo.

2747~~~
The fact that a player as mediocre as him can hold down a regular spot in our team is a damning indictment of our side right now. He doesn't have a single attribute that you could say was above average.

2748~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2749~~~
He is 24 this year. People seem to give him a pass because he is 'young', When you are nearly at mid-twenties I don't think you should class as a young player in football terms anyways.

2750~~~
considering we had 1 shot on goal it is not surprising. I was at the game and we literally had nearly all of our attacking players playing in positions that aren't natural to them. Jesse had a poor game yesterday but so did every other attacking player apart from Martial who we are relying on to make something happen out of nothing

2751~~~
So what's the excuse for the 26 other games he has been average in this season then?

2752~~~
Never seen anything special on him. He is basically William of Chelsea, but without any talent at all.

He will be lucky to spent most of his career in EPL.

2753~~~
He hasn't really been the problem. Our attacking options are limited at best. We rely heavily on our fullbacks being creative and providing quality crosses. Losing Shaw so early was a massive blow for how this team plays. Yesterday Fosu was a breath of fresh air on the right and Rojo got the ball in good areas but he just didnt do anything with it. I would prefer seeing Jesse on the right and Mata in the no.10. The amount of times yesterday Rose was 1v1 vs Mata was terrifying at best. That was a no contest. 

Unfortunately we have a very stubborn manager where 50-60% of the team are not playing in their natural positions and it is showing on the pitch.

2754~~~
Really don't like him playing at 10, IMO he's better on the right wing since he's a decent crosser. But really, should be a squad player and nothing more for us.

2755~~~
He hasn't been average in the 26 other games, he's been average in some and good in others.

2756~~~
I'd disagree. He has made 30 appareances this season and has had 3-4 good games. The rest were average to poor.

2757~~~
I don't know if you read the rest of my post but i wasn't exactly being complimentary to Lingard.  Yes he's 23 but he's missed a year due to injury so i didn't want to be be too harsh on him. Yeah i suppose he's at an age where you can't really describe him as a youngster any more.

Personally i don't think he's good enough or ever will be. Not for where we want to be anyway. As long as players like him are fixtures in the side we will remain an average team.

2758~~~
I wasn't knocking your post at all, I totally agree with it. I was just describing the general consensus amongst our fans.

2759~~~
We'll have to agree to disagree then as I think he's definitely had more good performances than 3-4.

2760~~~
Lingard has had quite a few games where he has played well, or at least as well as he could have. So he can't be faulted most of the time.

But is that level good enough for United, no it isn't no were near in fact. The fact he (and a few others) has been a fixture in the side explains why we are scratching around in 5th outside the CL spots.

2761~~~
I was under the assumption that we're all pretty much in agreement by now that the reason we are in 5th is Van Gaal.

2762~~~
Yeah no doubt it's mostly Van Gaal's fault but you do see that the squad he has assembled is pretty average.

Blind at CB, Rojo, Darmian, Lingard, Mata at RW, Fellaini are all average players at best and yet nearly every line-up contains a combination of 3-4 of them (sometimes more).

We aren't languishing in 5th because LVG is mismanaging a good team, aside from his continual poor/crazy choices we just don't have a very good team/squad right now.

Lingard being a virtual ever present in the team is a shining example of that.

2763~~~
All three were available yesterday, as was Mata and Herrera to play AM. And yet Lingard was still in the side.

Depay deserves to start ahead of Lingard at RW for the sole reason that he's an actual winger and has a future at the club. The kid is never going to adapt if he keeps being frozen out. Even in poor form theres not much difference between him and Lingard. Ditto Januzaj.

2764~~~
Not true, one isn't great (Lingard) and one is a total liability (Memphis) when in poor form.
Despite not being very good he has won us some games this season. I didn't agree with him being play AM and Mata on the right though

EDIT: Its a little like the DiMaria vs Young situation last season

2765~~~
How exactly is Depay a liability?

When he's been poor he just has your average Lingard performance anonymous.

2766~~~
Constantly giving the ball away and doing stupid things in dangerous areas. Not tracking back, do you remember his performance at the Emirates?
I want him in the team (Memphis) but I can understand why Lingard has had a run, given he, whilst not being great, has been a reliable player who works hard and has contributed to wins this season.

2767~~~
Think

2768~~~
Won us games? Think that's a bit of a stretch mate. He has contributed in the last 3 games prior to yesterdays horrendous performance, and he was good in the Newcastle game. Certainly hasn't won us any games on his own whereas even Memphis has done that (even if it was Midgetland and Brugge etc.)

2769~~~
Yeah I was more thinking he scored some important goals in some games we won. Not that he did it on his own.

2770~~~
Yeah thought thats what you were going to say.

So basically playing like most young talented wingers, yeah he'll certainly iron those problems out of his game sitting on the bench watching.

2771~~~
I think he should have played more than he has, but if you read the rest of the post I can understand why Lingard was given a run of games ahead of him. Probably has been long enough now though, I though Memphis should have kept his place after Arsenal but was dropped for some reason.
Although maybe he himself is reluctant to play on the right?

2772~~~
I did read the rest mate and yeah you are probably right that's what LVG's thinking has been but i just don't agree with it.

I would always play the more talented player and give him time to develop over someone who whilst he works hard and takes no risks also doesn't actually contribute much creatively. Plus lets be honest here Lingard isn't going to be here long term he's just not good enough, so i would rather have Depay in there risks and all to quicken his adaptation to the Premier League.

2773~~~
good game so far but he really needs to score that, shame....

2774~~~
He misses way too much sitters and the fact we don't create much in attack, makes it worse.

2775~~~
after a poor game he shows that he can be a creative player, could do better in some situations but so far a solid half from him as a RM, he could do so much more from the left though but it's Martial's spot... or just from the middle. Herrera's been a bit meh there tonight but it's very tight there, let's see if Luis makes some changes..

2776~~~
Great work ethic, but we need a bit more that that as a forward here. We need end product, don't think he is polished enough for that unfortunately.

2777~~~
Maybe I'm imagining this but before he came into the team, everyone one here seemed to be crying out for him to be played. Ever since he's been in the team, they've been crying out for him to be dropped!

2778~~~
He's been better tonight than some of the shit he's served up recently.

2779~~~
He's the latest in a long line of caf scapegoats who get slaughtered for every perceived mistake no matter how trivial or in fact they even did anything wrong, but every good thing is overlooked. 

The match thread is ridiculous.

2780~~~
Nope, that's utter rubbish. Fellaini, Carrick, Mata, Rojo etc get berated just as much.

2781~~~
What does that have to do with what I said? 

Like, at all, in any way?

2782~~~
Eh like he's hardly a scapegoat like. Like, you know, you insinuated. A scapegoat isn't a player that actually deserves criticism for poor performances, which Lingard has had plenty of, like.

2783~~~
He's pilloried and blamed for things even when he's not at fault. What does it happening to other players have to do with it? 

What I'm talking about is summed up by the fact that he just created that second goal and didn't get a single mention in the match thread and yet earlier he almost chased down a loose ball and got criticised for being too far away to start with.

2784~~~
The quality of Martial and Rashford is in some ways making it even harder for him because the gulf is quality between them is enormous.

Still the first player I would pick out as replacing to immediately improve the team, along with Blind.

2785~~~
Great strike here from him:

<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2786~~~
Well he's been praised to the hilt in this thread at times. In fact, he's had plenty of games which I would say were very average, and people run in here calling him 'superb' etc, which I find completely OTT. 

He's actually done well tonight as I previously mentioned. I felt he's been a-bit wank recently and had become fond of giving the ball away or picking the wrong option. I've enjoyed watching him tonight, though. 

Don't see how the word 'scapegoat' can be attributed to him. I mean, a scapegoat is someone who gets blamed no matter what; usually a player who has become a hate figure amongst fans. I wouldn't imagine anyone has an agenda against Lingard. He's been called out on poor performances and rightly so; so have many others. He's also been praised quite a bit at times and rightly so.

2787~~~
Have you been reading the match thread? 

If he misplaces a pass there's a stream of posts going ape shit at him. Then he has a very good effort that goes just wide and it's literally not mentioned once, then he creates the second goal and again it doesn't get a single mention. 

I'm not exaggerating, it's ridiculous and pathetic.

2788~~~
I tend to stay away from the match day threads. They're usually full of reactionary and hyperbolic comments. I usually just pop in now and again like I have tonight and I didn't notice any Lingard comments when I was reading. 

If he's been criticised tonight then that's a bit odd. I'm not his biggest fan in the world but I think he's been good. He did miss a good chance in the first half but to be fair, it was a good save from Randolph.

2789~~~
If he could learn to be a bit more clinical with the chances that come his way he'd be a pretty great player imo.
He can pick a pass and takes up good positions. Hardworking, quick. He has a lot of good qualities.

2790~~~
He's done well lately. Very good game tonight.

2791~~~
He's still got plenty to work on but he gets in very good positions. Hopefully next season, he can make more of his chances.

2792~~~
Love his positivity. Also has very good game management for a relatively young player, aside from that silly free kick at the end.

2793~~~
Made some very good runs tonight.  As usual he seemed limited by his own ability but I think he'll keep improving.

2794~~~
Probably his best game on the right for us. 

I like this Front 3, ffs Rooney.

2795~~~
MOTM for me, it was between him and DDG with an outside chance for Tim but he was flying in the second half and I was entertained by our attacking football so I think it's deserved. Finally he didn't stick to the right flank and dropped deeper and centrally, he acted like a playmaker at times and that's what I always loved about the youth teams, the fluidity, shame that Van Gaal doesn't allow our players to express more, Lingard is the one who would thrive, let's see if he can push himself to the first team next season or stays as a useful squad player..

2796~~~
Here we go with your weird love in of Lingard

2797~~~
End product needs sharpening but he had a good game linking up with Martial and Rashford as well as dropping in to help the midfield out, forming almost a 3 man shield with Fellaini and Herrera in front of Carrick at times.

2798~~~
praises get to the goalscorer and keeper who both did great but Lingard was catalyst and key to our counterattacking game today that is what I appreciate

2799~~~
It's funny because even the people that support him and want him in the squad, a group that I include myself in, would say that we need to replace him the starting XI.  It's the people that slag him off like complete shite and act as if Januzaj or Depay have actually provided more in whatever time they've had this season that are way over the top.  

He's a squad player and a useful one.  Doesn't need to be much of a debate after every match about this and the fact he's starting has more to do with the inadequacies of our other attacking options be that LVG or Woodward's fault.

2800~~~
He was very good today!

2801~~~
Lingard's problem IMO is that he becomes ineffective when we play compact teams that press him. He was decent tonight but not good enough in the long run in that position. He just lacks the finesse and quality for it.

2802~~~
He was super today. Played on the right wing, he and Martial were constantly finding pockets of space, which allowed them to run at the West Ham defence. Really good today.

2803~~~
Squad player who has probably already reached about 95% of his total potential. Depay had been very frustrating but has a much higher ceiling and I would rather take that gamble than get 38 average games a season from Lingard

2804~~~
Fellaini Tim DDG Carrick were all better

2805~~~
in your opinion

2806~~~
He reminds me of a slightly worse version of Welbeck, in that he's a nice enough player, but fails to make the difference often enough for the positions he finds himself in.

2807~~~
I actually think his finishing is better than Welbecks but all round game yeah Welbeck is better

2808~~~
Solid performance from him. A little sloppy at times, but good contribution.

2809~~~
I can't agree with that. Welbeck has some tidy finishes, on occasion. I don't recall Jesse ever finishing like a proper striker.

2810~~~
He works hard and gets into positions well, but there is no end product. A decent squad player, but nowhere near first XI quality.

2811~~~
Lol yep but come on are you related to Lingard?

2812~~~
I really like him. Anyone saying Januzaj and Depay should be in the squad because of potential are deluded. All 3 have had their chances and Jesse has impressed the most therefore he plays.

He's our no-frills Willian.

2813~~~
He hasn't even played an entire season in the first team. he's still improving and understanding what it takes to be successful in a first-team capacity. So quickly to write him off. Depay is only one year younger than Lingard and is more established, but Lingard is miles ahead of Memphis mentally and attitude wise.

2814~~~
good performance

2815~~~
He created our second best chance(Fellaini) in the game and delivered great cross in the build up towards our second goal so even though in the end he finished the game with no assists or goals he was involved in almost every move we had going forward.

2816~~~
Fellaini and DDG definitely were.

2817~~~
Fellaini was ok but nowhere close to being our best player tonight (not that i'd say lingaard was personally)

2818~~~
On par with Lingard. My point was more than Lingard wasn't MOTM.

2819~~~
Needs to play on the right of a front three or right winger cos he puts in some dangerous crosses (like the one that lead to the second goal). One of his best games.

Needs to work on his finishing though. Has missed waaay too many chances this season.

2820~~~
Total Shots - 2
Shots on Target - 1
Key Passes -  2
Average Rating - 7.08

2821~~~
Story of the season. Fellaini, Lingard, Martial and Depay have missed a lot of chances between them. Rooney too.

2822~~~
Some are more guilty than others but we haven't created enough good chances either.
Hard for some of them to be prolific and clinical when its their first season and they're getting one shot every other game (and maybe a couple of 30 yard, hit and hope, type chances here and there).
Fellaini's just been cursed this season, hopefully today's goal will break a poor run for him.

2823~~~
His conversion rate on shots is actually higher than nearly every other player in our team.

2824~~~
The strange thing about Jesse is because he's 23 some people are acting as if he's already playing close to his full potential, yet Memphis who's 22 has tons of rooms to grow, despite Memphis has played first team football since he's 18.

2825~~~
Hes not as flashy as others. And hes probably not going to score the type of solo goals that Martial or Payet for instance will score. So hes obviously crap (jk)
People were saying the same thing back in december and hes improved (gradually but steadily) since.

2826~~~
You can prove anything with facts.

2827~~~
Played well tonight, although he will never be a top top winger i think he's much better working from the right than in the centre where he often looks lost and games pass him by.

2828~~~
Maybe because Jesse hasn't really shown anything more at any other level he's competed in than he is for us right now, he's pretty much performing to the level that most of us would've expected him to. I don't think that at any point in his career Lingard has looked more than a decent talent. In comparison Depay has shown prior to joining that he's capable of performing a lot better than he is currently doing for us. 
I think that the way we currently play is always going to suit Lingard better since he's a nimbler player. I always thought that it was going to be a challenge to fit Depay into Van Gaals slow and methodical style of football, but I was hopeful at the start of the season that Van Gaal had a plan for how to use him. Which in retrospect he obviously didn't.

2829~~~
Very true on Depay, he's used to playing football far more close to for instance Leicester's football, more opportunistic, more fast, more physical, more width and stretched play. He isnt a Ribery or Costa to create from standing position, he doesnt have that kind of dribbling, creativity, and intelligence/vision. He is more a power player, with effective dribbling (normally), good attacking runs, strength, and goalscoring ability. I made this point earlier this season, and it looks like indeed this doesnt work for him. PSV plays a completely different style of play as to what we do, but even besides all of that, he's really underperformed. 

On Lingard, I think the slack he gets is injustified. He isnt really flashy but most of our attacks start with him, he has good basic technique, he's a clever player, he's fast, direct and works incredibly hard, for now he's our best option and there's no reason why he couldnt be a good squad player for us in the long run.

2830~~~
To be fair to Lingard, this is his first ever season at this level and I think he's show a lot of improvement. Not sure if you will recall, but there was a moment later in the game where it got played up to him and Martial, they both had perfect touches to bring it down and hold up the ball. Subsequently, he drew the foul out of kouyate, by having great awareness of who was around him and realising we were outnumbered. That sort of stuff he wasn't doing at the start of the season and if he start's putting more chances away that fall to him, he will be a very, very, useful player to have.

I actually have quite a lot of faith in him for next season. Physically he can develop as well, he could pack on some muscle in pre-season and get even faster/stronger.

2831~~~
Yea, and get 36 shit games from Depay instead.

2832~~~
Agreed. if his finishing was better he'd have twice as many goals for the season and twice as many fans on here

2833~~~
I'd take the 36 shit games from Depay that could lead to him fulfilling his potential vs 36 ok games from a decent and nothing more player who probably won't improve much beyond his current level.

Load of players struggle when they first come to England even the likes of Ronaldo and Henry, sitting on the bench isn't going to further his development. Imagine in 2003 Ronaldo being frozen out of the team because he didn't hit the ground running and us playing Chadwick or somebody instead.

2834~~~
Really annoys me how he jumps for headers and has no intention of actually heading the ball - its like he's just going through the motions. He's the same when tackling - he won't go near a 50/50 challenge and prefers to jump out the way. He's got to man up.

2835~~~
1) You've got absolutely no idea whether Depay will 'fulfill his potential' or not, playing or not. What if his max is what he's showing/what he's shown in the Netherlands? What if he's capable of showing his talent only against likes of Midtjylland?

2) How do you know that Lingard won't develop any further? Depay will but Lingard won't for what reason exactly? He's progressed this season compared to the last one, he's still thrown around positions. 

3) You know that Depay has played roughly 200 minutes less for us overall than Lingard? 

4) I can't remember Ronaldo being as fecking awful in his first season for us as Depay has been thus far, don't know about Henry as I didn't watch Arsenal games obviously. Putting those two names and Depay's is like playing 'spot the odd one out' game anyway.

2836~~~
Was very good last night, i don't understand the heat Lingered gets?

He tries his bollocks off for us., if he cost 20 million you guys would be buzzing but he's 23 and has been on loan @ Birmingham & Derby <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

2837~~~
Well obviously i don't know for sure if he will fulfill his potential playing every week, but i 100% know he will never reach it sitting on the bench.

Yeah good one mate, he played the grand total of 24 minutes for us last year. I would like to think he's progressed this season after 30 games. Jesus.

Also how do i know he won't develop any further? Simple i don't nor have i said that anywhere (read my last post), but based on watching youngsters come and go into the United side over nearly 30 years of watching us he looks to me a decent player who could become a solid squad player for us but nothing more.

No i didn't know, thanks for the stats. Your point being? We are already discussing Lingard getting more games than Depay, so it's a safe fecking assumption Lingard has played more minutes.

Jesus titty fecking christ, i was comparing their situations not the players directly. I emphasized the point by saying ''<b>even</b> the likes of Ronaldo and Henry'', by saying that i mean if two all time greats had problems adjusting in their first year in England then a young player like Depay can be excused for taking time to settle, especially if his manager is barely playing him.

Obviously Ronaldo being possibly one of the top 5-10 players of all time is going to have a higher lower level than Depay, especially as he joined a settled and successful side with a manager in charge that trusted him and knew how to develop him. 

How do you think an 18 year old Ronaldo would do in this current side under LVG. Do you think Van Gaal would be a big fan of Ronaldo trying multiple step overs, tricks and losing the ball a lot? 

Yeah my guess is he would probably be out in the cold and sitting the in the stands alongside Depay, Pereira and Januzaj.

2838~~~
But you do make an assumption that he 'probably won't improve much beyond his current level' and call him a 'Squad player who has probably already reached about 95% of his total potential.' What makes you think that though? How do you assume that Depay has a higher celling and he'll probably blossom under any other manager but Lingard won't?


That he's not really frozen out if he's played just roughly 200 minutes less than Lingard?

And again, Ronaldo wasn't as terrible as Depay is. For Lingard it's pretty much his first year in PL as well and he's doing better than Depay, or is it because Lingard was loaned out to Championship before? Or is that because he's English? Januzaj in his debut season was a lot better than Depay too, being even younger, but I suppose it's down to him being our academy product (if you can call him that), right?

But I'd say that Depay is actually one of those players who had LVG's trust. I mean, he played him in WC before he came to us, he transferred him to us, gave him multiple chances when he was rubbish and even let him play as a striker to absolve him of defensive duties which seems to be his biggest weakness. Also, 18 year old Ronaldo was actually able to beat his man with tricks whatsoever, 22 year old Depay is not.

2839~~~
Same here. I can only think people's sheer lack of understanding of football gets in the way.

My view is exactly the same as Keown's on the co commentary yesterday, that he's developing quickly, having got the chance and kept his shirt, and if he could improve his finishing we'd really have a player and a half.

The sheer movement and running of Lingard, Martial and Rashford makes us a completely different threat up front.
And on the face of it those three are lesser players than say VP/Falcao/Rooney/Mata, any three from that.

But they are much more effective.

I dare say if this was the early 90s, there would be threads saying how "average" Beckham was, and that he wasn't United quality etc

Out of our youngsters, I think Rashford and FM clearly have the most potential, but I think Lingard will make at worst a very effective squad member.

2840~~~
Nah they wouldn't, it's the exact opposite. He'd be getting slated if he cost £20m and rightly so because he isn't worth half that. People like him because he's from the academy. He runs around a lot but I genuinely can't see anything else he's remotely good at. He isn't rapid, his finishing is awful, his short passing isn't good at all. Nowhere near good enough for us.

2841~~~
good post, completely agree, think people would feel different about him if he came from PSV for 20mil or so, would say he had a decent season for a 23 year old in a new league which lingard is, only one year older than depay, age is irrelevant, players reach their potential at different time and very big number of players wont ever reach it and there are some who can if they work hard surpass their potential.. like fletcher or park who were not the most talented footballers but definitely became key players for a certain time and I think it's the Lingard case.. 

in addition to that, some attributes like clever movement, positioning good weight on pass is hard to spot when you dont have the football knowledge, some poster here never kicked the ball outside school obviously.. they will just settle with words like hard work etc. and the same bullshit ending by "limited player" what Lingard might feel like but he's outperforming players like Mata, Memphis, world class Januzaj etc. yeah but he's limited

2842~~~
Um, Ronaldo made 22 sub appearances in his first season with us...

2843~~~
It's really annoying reading those who like him, bang on about those who don't having no understanding of football. 
His comparison for the right wing spot is Juan Mata, the slowest winger known to man, so he obviously seems a breath of fresh air. But really he is an ordinary player, works hard but the other two in the front three always seem more threatening. Yesterday was one of his better games, he's ok when the team as a whole is playing well, struggles heavily when the team is under pressure, then he's no influence on the game. 
There is of course no rule of how a player will turn out, but I will be shocked if is ceiling is higher than what we're seeing now. The technical and physical attributes on show seem extremely ordinary.

2844~~~
I swing between that opinion and the 'hes actually really good' opinion from game to game nearly tbh.
I dont think the people saying hes ordinary just dont understand football (I agree with them quite often) but ...
I dunno, theres the odd flash of a really good player so I wouldn't be too surprised if he turns out to be surprisingly good.

I do kind of feel that if he threw a few stepovers or backheels around the odd time he'd probably be rated higher by <i>some</i>

2845~~~
It's called an opinion, one formed from having watched him play over a number of years. I did say in my last post i don't know for certain how either player will definitely turn out. I am not claiming i can predict the future.

But based on watching both this season, Depay has been largely poor and Lingard has played well enough but Depay clearly has much more potential in my opinion.

Most of Depays minutes came before Xmas, he's been pretty much frozen out since then as he hasn't started many matches or even came on as a sub.

And again what relevance does that have to this conversation? Remember i was not directly comparing Depay with Ronaldo why are you? Also i would like to think one of the best players ever playing in a much better side had a higher bottom level than Depay.

More than likely yes. Some players, especially young ones need a year or more to settle in to a different country/culture/club/league.

And again with the irrelevant comparisons, ok then i'll play 23 year old Lingard isn't as good as Messi was at 18. Explain please?

2846~~~
Thanks for the info. He wasn't frozen out of the team though was he, he got regular starts every few games and came on in many games.

2847~~~
Ronaldo had 18 starts and 22 sub appearances. Depay has 25 and 25 I believe.

2848~~~
Sorry mate Depay having more starts than Ronaldo in their respective first seasons proves what exactly?

Before Xmas Depay had 24 starts and 6 sub appearances. After Xmas 6 starts and 9 sub appearances in all comps. So clearly he is not playing as much as he used to.

For the sake of comparison Ronaldo started 11 games and came on 8 times before Xmas in his first year. And after Xmas he started 13 and came on 8 times. So as i said his appearances were consistent throughout the season in all comps.

Your stats are off by the way mate, Ronaldo did indeed make 40 appearances that year but he started 24 of them and was sub 16. And Depay hasn't came on 25 times as a Sub this season.

2849~~~
His finishing it actually pretty fecking good.  He's got a great strike on him,  feck you been watching?!

2850~~~
I think every Man Utd fan has seen Lingard squander a good handful of golden opportunities with poor finishing.

2851~~~
the problem is that we dont create chances as a team and when somebody at United misses a good chance thats a big deal while Suarez/Aub/Lewa and pretty much every player in good team can miss and misses them regularly but people dont make a big deal out of it as they score eventually because their teams create more chances per player then we create as a team.

2852~~~
As far as I can tell he has the second best strike conversion rate after rashford. Stats don't tell the whole story but he's certainly up there.

2853~~~
Decent finishing is something he's generally been known for, that I'll admit.

2854~~~
I'm not sure what you're basing this on exactly? Depay's one stormer against Midgetland? Over the season Lingard has actually shown improvement and Depay has just shown a sh*t show with the very rare good performance. I don't think that justifies much more potential.

2855~~~
No over 30 odd games, you may see it differently and thats fine but thats my opinion.

I still think with the right manager who develops him right Depay could be a cracking player.

2856~~~
Fair enough.

I still think you're putting a lot of onus on the manager for his development, when ultimately; in life, it's solely you responsible for where you want to go.

2857~~~
Yeah maybe, but i have always thought certain players need certain managers to develop them properly. Creative players who take a few risks don't seem to do well under Van Gaal. I'm disappointed Januzaj (might be still be injured)  or Pereira aren't getting much of a look in either.

2858~~~
I appreciate the point, but I think it's just biased to our players. He's developed plenty of other players in his time. I think the three players mentioned above don't have the best mentality anyway. They don't seem to have that "just get on with it" attitude and seem to think they're already destined for something better, when they've actually achieved and shown very little.

2859~~~
He has of that theres no doubt. But there's certain players who just aren't a good fit with certain managers to be developed.

Maybe but we don't know for sure. Footballers are human beings all with different personalities, some will be sensitive, introverted or maybe too cocky and some need to be more carefully handled to get the best out of them. Rumour has it Van Gaal has a one size fits all approach to man management.

It's an old cliche but some players need a kick up the arse and some need an arm around their shoulder. Ferguson was a genius at that , Van Gaal who knows.

I mean look at say Ronaldo early in his career some accused him of being moody, cocky and perhaps not having the right attitude to become a top player. That's obviously ludicrous now but back then loads of people thought similar. Ferguson handled him properly and became like a father figure to him instead of a school teacher, because thats what he needed.

2860~~~
Exactly this. If he nutmegged a few players and tried a rabona. Ordinary Lingard becomes a guy with a bright future.

2861~~~
Call the trick what you want, but yes if he would actually beat players on the dribble I would rate him differently.

2862~~~
He does beat players, it's Memphis who finds that difficult in league games...

2863~~~
But his game has never been based on dribbling, so that's different all together.. He can beat a man with pace and is tactically a smart player.. and reads the final 3rd well. We are just short sighted to this because he doesn't look entertaining hence my comment.

2864~~~
jesus christ, by that logic Vidic is a shit player

2865~~~
Him miss a shit load of chances. Not tough ones either. What the feck have YOU been watching?

2866~~~
Not saying i agree with the dribbling comment, but i think it's at least fair game to discuss a wingers dribbling ability. A centre backs dribbling ability on the other hand not so much.

2867~~~
may have not been the best example but they are simply different players, Mata from the left wing at Chelsea before Mourinho was one of the best players in the premier league and did he outdribbled players, he's much worse than Lingard in that matter, Lingard is clearly best centrally or as a playmaker cutting inside on the other hand there are other players who just like to beat players form the byline who seek those 1v1 and as we could see there is very few players who can do it consistently so I am not sure who are we comparing to Lingard now but he's definitely a different player who creates chances his own way

2868~~~
Lingard is not good enough as a regular winger but he is a decent enough squad player. He should get nowhere near 30 games a season and not more than 10-15 starts imo.

2869~~~
Fair enough i get what you were saying mate. I don't think you have to be a great dribbler to be an effective wide player either. Look at Beckham, it was just as you say Vidic was a bad example.

You think Lingard's better centrally? I mean i thought the same when i used to watch him in the reserves but in the first team he looks more effective on the wing for me. I don't think he has enough quality to play centrally always looks a bit anonymous in there, not as our first choice anyway as an option sure.

2872~~~
Beckham's also a great example, he also was different with his skillset.. Lingard has all the attributes to play form the middle, since the first game Van Gaal played him there he was getting better until the game before Westham, where he was very disappointing but so was everyone. 

No10 role is really difficult to play, like you say you can look anonymous very easily but he's working hard to make runs, press defenders or track back with players when needed, also he's very good finding the little pockets between the lines, has a quick turn and has a speed of thought to release the ball quickly, one-two's with players around him, he is not a good dribbler from the wide areas but decent enough to quickly turn with the ball after recieving it and make a nice surging run through the middle.. he's a good pochaer as well which makes him very useful player for that role. 

shame he couldnt finish his chances lately, he missed some sitters this season and he desrves some criticism but at least he got to the chances, if he scored half of them he could be valued differently here and with a change of luck and more work on his composure which used to work for him during his youth years I think it's possible bare in mind that the game is much higher tempo so the legs are gone pretty quickly.. people just dislike him like they did with Welbeck who was brilliant for us but after some missed chances he was all of a sudden noone here, all the good work forgotten.

Anyways lingard has a future as a CAM or maybe even attacking b2b where his hardwork could be used even more and when his touch is off.. He had some great games for U21 national team there as well and I am sure he will show it in the first team of MUFC too, but the variant of him starting from wide and picking the same positions in the middle seems also interesting because it is quite hard to mark, that was the case in the last game, he was a bit of everywhere, which is how he should be utilised - with freedom to roam a bit..

On the other hand he didnt show enough penetrating passes and didn't score as often as I thought but as I said that can change, it's his first season, with a bit of confidence and with the fresh start of the next season and preseason as 1st teamer under his belt and perhaps most importantly with a better manager, who can make the best out of him some people may change their mind..

2873~~~
Pipe down big man, half of the replies proved you're talking through your arse.

2874~~~
Yeah fair point lol. 

Funnily enough back in the day Gary Pallister loved the odd run up the left wing, he wasn't bad at it either.

2875~~~
Needs to look more bothered than he did yesterday when he came on. I'd drop him next game. Young or Depay right wing.

2876~~~
My question to the pro-Lingard campaigners.

If Lingard where playing for Newcastle, Everton or Liverpool and his performances this season had been identical to what we have seen at Utd, would you be clamouring to sign him? Course you wouldn't and that is the end of the argument for me.

Good lad, decent player, squad player not a starter

2877~~~
You could count on one hand the number of people in this thread who think he's a true first XI player. 

Most people who like him are merely defending him from the twonks who think he's rubbish because he doesn't do enough stepovers and his name isn't foreign (enough). Literally 90% of posts in this thread must mention the words "squad player" so I don't know why anyone needs to say it again. Problem is, so many of you are saying it in a negative way. Why isn't it nice that we've found a squad player who can contribute in a couple of positions in which we are weak?

2878~~~
M1y2 has a weird love in with Lingard going on!

2879~~~
Give over you condescending bellend.

2880~~~
No one's been saying that. But you do need to have the ability to beat a man when you're playing as a right winger in a front 3. He does try it a few times, kicks it 10 metres past his defender and is let down by his average pace and lack of strength (his pace is exaggerated on here). It's not because he doesn't do fancy tricks or isn't foreign as I couldn't give a feck where he comes from, he's just as average as they come. As I've said earlier he symbolizes LvG's attack. No risks in possession, low creativity and high importance on closing down, which is a fine feature to have but shouldn't be a stand out feature in an attacking player at this club.

Those who like him the most see him as an attacking midfielder, he's far from having the skill set to make it there. For me he doesn't have enough about him to even make it in the long term as a squad player. I respect the opinion of those who don't agree with me, but the line quoted there grinds my gears.

2881~~~
Yeah he's no better than someone like Townsend or Lennon, actually those two are probably better. Place would go into meltdown if we bought one of those.

2882~~~
I actually like Townsend but I don't agree with the Lennon comparison at all. Lennon is a much better dribbler but nowhere near as intelligent and has very poor end product.

2883~~~
Name calling eh <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/> That's grown up.

2884~~~
Lets universalise that logic.

Who from the current squad would we look at in awe and be begging to sign if they played for Newcastle, Everton or Liverpool?

De Gea, Shaw and Martial are definites.

Smalling and Blind* are potentials along with a few of the youngsters like CBJ, Mensah and Rashford.
*Some would probably baulk at the idea of buying Blind as a CB*

The rest have underwhelmed and we wouldn't be clamouring to sign Mata, Rooney, Rojo, Darmian, Schneiderlin, Carrick, Fellaini, Memphis, Herrera or Jones (add nearly every other player we have). All established and more experienced players than Lingard.

Lingard is in his first full season in the PL, he has been a little up and down but hasn't come close to hitting the nadirs of some of the players above. Jesse has endeavoured to do whatever LVG has asked him (he is not and never will be a classical RW) and been one of the more productive players in what is an uninspiring system. Whether he has much more growth/development potential is nigh on impossible to predict but I'd say at the very least he has earned a chance to prove himself under a new manager, as will hopefully be the case next season.

You said it yourself "squad player", who at this moment brings more to the team than his direct competition. If we sign a fantastic right winger and solve the #10 issue then none of the "pro-Lingarders" will bat an eyelid if he becomes a feature on the bench rather than starting. In fact that is how a lot of people see him, an incredibly handy player to have that can fill-in any of the three positions behind the striker.

2885~~~
Another question worth asking - is he worse than Pedro?

The answer is no.

2886~~~
The player who a lot of people said we were mad not to sign in the summer.
Still have the same opinion of both - not good enough

2887~~~
He'll be a fine squad player for us. In a better side playing a finer brand of attacking football he'd fit in quite well.

He's not going to be a first XI player for us if we have any hope of winning titles regularly, but that's not to say he couldn't be important to us.

2888~~~
Great post.

2889~~~
Only nine games since Lingard scored or assisted for us. Hopefully it is tenth game lucky tonight for our number ten!

2890~~~
He can play better. He can be more productive. But he has to show that. So next season is real big season for Jessie. In his position, he has to influence games more. Once he does, then England will come calling. At the minute, what he's producing isn't good enough for our level. To be a first teamer, we're not seeing him make it difficult to rotate him.

2891~~~
90 minute player too. Never gets subbed off.

2892~~~
Needs to learn how to shoot, pronto.

2893~~~
There's a time for being a team player and there's a time for making things happen, going for the shot rather than the cross, taking players on etc. Especially after the early own goal, this was a match to push hard to make sure you got a goal or an assist because whoever is in charge next season is going to look at the team and think we can improve on Lingard, either by using another of the youngsters or buying someone.

2894~~~
I really don't like picking on our players but Lingard is the most pointless player I can remember for many a year.
I have absolutely no idea what he does and he gets picked week in, week out.
He may be a great guy but he should be nowhere near our team.

2895~~~
I am stumped as to what to say about him tonight, I didn't really notice him do anything good or bad, he was just in and around.

2896~~~
Has the tendency to disappear on the pitch and tonight wasn't an exception.

2897~~~
And people criticise Rooney's first touch!

2898~~~
Tonights performance pretty much sums up Lingard for me. Works hard, runs around a lot, decent for the most part but has very little effect on the actual play and doesn't really influence a game.

No idea why he's such a Van Gaal favourite. If Van Gaal is leaving i suspect Lingard might not be as prominent under a different manager if he's still here at all.

2899~~~
Id rather him on the right than anybody else in the squad we have. (cept maybe a fit Young).

2900~~~
Thats hardly saying much though as we don't have any actual right wingers in the squad. Except for Young who to be fair has played most of his career on the left.

2901~~~
Its in response to people wondering why hes playing, or a favourite or whatever. TBH, it showed without him the lack of balance against Liverpool first leg in the Europa League.
I do hope we get somebody to play on the right hand side, but also that Lingard isnt just dropped / sold but gets minutes next year.

2902~~~
To be honest i said similar also and i stand by it. Young's fit the last few games, Depay's been fit longer as has Valencia. Not sure about Januzaj he might be injured. Rashford and Martial can both play on the right. So it's not like we don't have options

I'm not saying i want anyone in the team instead of Lingard hes a decent option for the right side, but i don't think his performances have warranted him being an almost ever present in the side. He should be being rotated with others to give them a chance to find form. 

This is only on the right though, i don't think he should ever deployed in the centre again to be honest. Just not good enough to play in there.

2903~~~
He epitomises MUFC these days, running around like a headless chicken with no end product.

2904~~~
I'm his number one fan but sadly after such a run in the team he hasn't done enough to justify his position long term.  He should have scored on numerous occasions now and doesn't offer enough attacking threat.  His only strength is his work rate and linking up play.

2905~~~
Not sure we even have anyone to compete with him on the RW and I don't want to see Mata anywhere near there.

2906~~~
We have 5-6 players who can play there without even counting Mata. Who i don't ever want to see out there again also.

2907~~~
i might not agree with the exact number you're using, but yes, at this point it would certainly be fair to try just about any else.

that said, lingard deserves to be here next season as a squad player. but an automatic starter, a 90 minute man? only lvg would be so daft.

2908~~~
Rashford was put there against Liverpool and it was a mistake.
Martial has been tried and is just not useful or effective (hes better out left or up front).
Depay is also better on the left than right.
mata is not useful on the right at all (unless Valencia is playing cos Mata tends to go inside and Tony gives us width so were not effected as much).

TBH, Tony V might not be the worst option ahead of TFM. But, again, Tony has just come back from injury so im not too shocked at how much Lingard has played there (I think we are actually weaker without him, and I dont know what that says about him, the people that play there or just the team in general).

2909~~~
Well of all the players we have who can play there i'm not saying they are all definitely better options than Lingard on the right, Rashford and Martial probably aren't. Just that they are options, but personally i think at least one of Januzaj, Young and Valencia have the potential to be more effective at RW and maybe even Depay if given a run might be decent out there seeing as he's an actual winger.

The bolded part i agree with, he's shown enough for me to be a squad option definitely. I actually like Lingard i just don't like that our first team is so poor right now that a player of his ability seems to be one of the first names on the team sheet every week.

2910~~~
people have a really short memory if they forgot how shit Valencia was on the wing.....

2911~~~
Also Young. He's pretty much always been poor on the right because he can't cut out on his left foot, something he loves to do on the other wing. At least Valencia has shown good form at getting past players in the past two games on the wing. Palace had a tough time dealing with him.

2912~~~
Agree but i could see Young putting some average shifts on the right(much worse then Jesse though), same cant say for Valencia as im certain he would be awful. 
Valencia is playing good at right-back and he should stay there, he is involved in part of the game where he is still pretty decent(build-up) and when he finds himself in the final third he is already in motion so its much easier for him to do something + it helped that we played against two awful teams.

2913~~~
Jesse might not be the player many want as first team player. But, his work rate and off ball movements are excellent. One of the main things I noticed with him is that how he moves towards the ball or whoever has the ball to make sure they have an option to pass to when everyone just runs away. Sometimes you need quality like that on the pitch. Great football teams have to have people who work their ass off for more talented players who are usually lazy players imo.

Can't forget how many of them we have had in SAF's great teams while flashy players took all the credits in public.

2914~~~
He does give us balance that's for sure.  He just needs to improve in the final third.

2915~~~
good post

2916~~~
Yup

2917~~~
Its funny because his goalscoring was supposed to be his strong point

2918~~~
fantastic today<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
eat, sleep, pass and move<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

2919~~~
Isn't this what Mata is meant to do? Come off the wing, get into pockets find players in space...

2920~~~
Very good so far.

2921~~~
Very well played so far.

2922~~~
He's a very, very good player no matter how much some people want to argue against that fact.

2923~~~
Very good half from him, I'll have him starting over Mata any day of the week.

2924~~~
It really never was. He scored 4 goals in one game and people who never actually watched him starting saying it was his best attribute when it never was. His link up play has always been what has made him, and it can be seen today. Great play with Rashford and Martial. 

His chance was hard and Joel did really well to get out on him so I cant complain much there.

2925~~~
I think that was the best half he's had for us. Absolutely crucial in the build-up.

2926~~~
Not yet. He seems to have a lot of the components of a very, very good player, but doesn't seem to know how to use them over an extended period of time. 

I think, in one or two more years time, he'll be the player that we need him to be. Lets not forget that this is his first proper year as a PL level footballer.

Again, I really like what I see from this guy. The future looks very bright.

2927~~~
Obviously not the finished article, I mean more his actual talent. 

I just can't understand how people look at him and don't think he has any ability whatsoever.

2928~~~
He's been great

2929~~~
Always making runs for the passer. Great half.

2930~~~
Playing well today.

2931~~~
Still missed two vital chances.

2932~~~
His finishing needs to improve, for sure.

2933~~~
Should get a role as a Stormtrooper in the new Star Wars flick with his shooting ability.

2934~~~
Once his finishing starts to click he's gonna be a great part of our attack.

2935~~~
His finishing is really, really bad.

2936~~~
The shit he's getting in the match thread is so ridiculous. 

He's even getting blamed for not being able to reach that Martial cross ffs

2937~~~
I think he's the sort of player who Brian Clough would have advised, "why don't you just pass it to someone who can actually finish, son?"

2938~~~
The reporter on FM104 (Irish radio station) said Lingard scored the og, but he reiterated it several times. Poor Jesse, taking the blame for Smalling and all now.

2939~~~
Pissed me off today. Way too chuffed to have a go though.

2940~~~
Well they are both beige and there's only the 12" height difference

2941~~~
What was he bad at apart from some scuffed shots? I thought he did well.

2942~~~
Not his biggest fan, but he did have a good game. I just wish his end product was better, but I could say that for our entire team.

2943~~~
He had a good game.

2944~~~
Good game but he needs to work on his finishing big time.

2945~~~
I have no issues with him as a squad player. Every club needs one. He was wasteful today but decent overall

2946~~~
I thought he was excellent i the first half, he picked up some excellent positions and his short passing was sharp and inventive. He didn't get into the second half enough but overall a good game.

2947~~~
Thought he was good in the first half, game passed him by in the second though, was lucky to get the 90.

2948~~~
Overboard post but I'll let it slide because we are all very happy today!

2949~~~
His movement is brilliant. Always adds a bit of pace/momentum to our attack as soon as he gets the ball, i just wish he a bit more end product.

2950~~~
Solid top level, hideous bottom level.

2951~~~
If this player plays for United next season I think I'm going to have a seizure. Hopefully Mourinho will not play him.

He hides the whole time, people calling it good movement, wtf, he places himself the other side of an opponent from the player in possession; is hopeless at shooting, rarely runs at people and can't defend. 

He had a reasonable first half for the first time in over 10 games and was utterly useless and a waste of space as usual in the second half

I've been watching United for so many years and can't remember being so frustrated that a player should be in our team and that includes us signing Fellaini, who had a good game today, but even when he doesn't at least he tries!

2952~~~
His movement and build up play was great, just needs to improve his finishing.

2953~~~
He's certainly a squad player, but he really shows how much we need pacey players on both wings to compensate for a sludge of a midfield. I like the bloke, but I really don't see where Mata fits in this team. The football is much better without him.

2954~~~
The match thread was bizarre.

2955~~~
Mourinho won't pick him. Not sure it will be Mourinho managing though unfortunately.

2956~~~
Truly.

2957~~~
Hope you make a good recovery.

2958~~~
More touches than Rashford or Martial. The 3rd most passes on the team, 2 shots, and 3 key passes. If he is hiding the whole time then wtf do you call what the others are doing?

2959~~~
Great movement and pace but the shooting skills of Welbeck.

2960~~~
Some daft stats that prove nothing, 2 shots he should have scored and missed spectacularly , where were the key passes? Next you'll tell me he should have been MOM ahead of Martial or DDG.
Better to watch the match, I think

2961~~~
What an interesting post.

2962~~~
Better not to make stuff about him hiding me thinks.

2963~~~
very good today, first half was excellent.

2964~~~
His shooting is on the level of Sterling's. Absolutely no purpose in it. Just hits and hopes.

Other than that, his general play in improving.

2965~~~
He had a very good first half aside from the misses. Like Rashford, he wasn't much very relevant n the second but that is partly to do with the midfield collapsing.

2966~~~
Reminds me of Welbeck's general lack of end product.

2967~~~
I have no favourites with any United players and never have - if a player plays well he'll get credit, if a player plays badly he'll get criticised.

Watch the match and recent matches again.

If he plays well he'll get credit from me, it's been a long wait.. and I don't make things up.
Have nothing against the guy personally but am not a fanboy who loves particular players or hates other players.

I have just had enough of Jesse Lingard for the moment - if he suddenly makes a miraculous transformation into a decent enough player for United then I hope he has a long United career ahead of him, but somehow doubt it.

2968~~~
Still frustrating as hell.

2969~~~
It always is.

2970~~~
He did a lot of good things, but his lack of end product is killing his likability factor for the casual fan/ignorant.

It frustrates me too, as I like the guy and can see a lot of positives in his style of play.

The technique for the half volley was actually very good. Robles positions himself well and covers his angles well. A firm connection. Unlucky.

The scuffed shot with his left foot was more disappointing. That was a lovely team move. 

He is still worth a place in the current side and is likely to be a useful squad player moving forward.

2971~~~
Insane

2972~~~
I actually thought he was one of if not our worst player today. Not awful today, but quite frustrating at times.

2973~~~
Probably one of his best games for the club. He's got a lot of great attributes, but the one thing he doesn't seem to have is a killer instinct. 

Until that changes he'll struggle to ever really kick on.

2974~~~
Needs to work on his finishing.  Steady general game but if he doesn't learn to finish he'll be a lesser version of Welbeck.

2975~~~
His understanding of the game and movement is what impresses me the most. Like against West Ham, he was constantly finding pockets of space in behind Everton's midfield and linking up with those around him. Should have probably had a couple of goals, and if he can improve on his finishing, he can be a really good, important player for us, in my opinon. 

<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> Have you got a gif of when he played a backheel through to Rashford, please?

2976~~~
Looks good off the ball (movement wise).  But just a very poor finisher and lacks any sort of killer ball for the position he plays. Shouldn't be in our first 11.

2977~~~
By interesting do you mean shite?

2978~~~
Lingard yes you're right

2979~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-martial-fellaini-rooney-11232362" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...news/man-utd-martial-fellaini-rooney-11232362</a>

Lowest score in the MEN rankings. Not suprised TBH.

2980~~~
Saw someone tweet that he's better off the ball than he is on it and we often look better collectively because of it. Similar to Welbeck really.

2981~~~
Well there's a surprise.
Summary: more threatening off the ball than on it<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> but it's true<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2982~~~
If Lingard can improve his finishing then he could be a good player for us but its not easy to just improve your finishing, Welbeck for example. At the moment Lingard is a forward who doesn't really score or assist so it seems obvious that we should look to bringing in a better player to be starting for us. Its good that a local lad is being given his chance and he has been given every opportunity to impress, Its up to him. he does posses some useful tools and should be a valued squad player still.

2983~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The comparison's to Welbeck's finishing.

2984~~~
Exactly <a class="username" data-user="16294, @afrocentricity" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/16294/">@afrocentricity</a> .
When he is constantly making angles for passes we are fluid in attack.When he doesnt play or gets less involved (like at times in the 2nd half) we grind to a halt.
I bet his teammates love him.

2985~~~
He did waste a couple of good chances, but I thought his all-round performance was very good. As I've said before, I don't know whether he's really got enough, but if he keeps building on his understanding with Martial and Rashford, it certainly won't hurt his chances.

2986~~~
Who's comparison is to Welbeck's finishing?

2987~~~
Many here are comparing Lingard's finishing to Welbeck's.

2988~~~
He'll never be that good

2989~~~
Say he disappears and avoids play

Get shown he had more touches than anyone

"Stats mean nothing"

Mike Summerbee eat your heart out.

2990~~~
Mike Summerbee was a good player and couldn't stand the twat

2991~~~
He was great and at the heart of everything good we did when we got him the ball. Struggled to get into the game when Carrick and Rooney, i.e. the people who's job it is to get him the ball, forgot to come out after half time. 

Needs to be sent on a Rashford like crash course in finishing mind.

2992~~~
Is that what people are trying to say ? I thought people here meant that Welbeck was woeful with his finishing as well.

2993~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Great reference.

2994~~~
I don't know but Welbeck is a far better player than Lingard

2995~~~
No arguments from my end. 

But I do like Lingard and not just coz SAF told me to like him. The reasons have already been pointed out. Reminds me of Park in a way. In big games, I think he could be an asset if used properly.

2996~~~
Really don't get the criticism for the lad. I would if it was constructive but it's always ended in the fact he isn't good enough. First half today we played some of the best football we have done in years, due to Jesse. He popped up all over the place and fed the ball onwards. Yes his finishing is a bit off but if it was anywhere near as accomplished as the rest of his game we'd be looking to spend silly money for a player of his ilk.

2997~~~
He's been used on the right on the left in the middle , lying deeper, earlier in the season . Give me Park any day. 
Lingard was a lot better earlier in the season but he's not strong enough and I know he's a local lad and loves United but something is not right, he's 24 in December - unless he improves drastically in his play very quickly he won't have a future here -  if and when LVG leaves (ie in the summer) it's a certainty we'll buy someone of much better quality to play on the right.

2998~~~
His first half was absolutely magnificent.  Anyone who disagrees doesn't play football. . he completely ran the show. Really impressed today.. poor second half though. . stayed too much on the wing.

2999~~~
Love the difference in opinion, must have watched another match

3000~~~
Misses too many sitters and it pisses me off. Could have cost us today.

3001~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3002~~~
When LVG leaves and Lingard is no longer in the team, will the Lingard Fanclub call for LVG to be reinstated?

3003~~~
I just said he reminds me of Park. Din't say he was as good as him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. And by that comparison, I mean he could be used as that relentless engine that Park was so often reliably good at.

Not everyone develops the same to be honest. So why should that be a surprise. Mahrez is 25 and he was unheard of until this season and now he's being linked to all the big boys. Same for Vardy, Payet just to name a few from a long list of late bloomers.

What improvement are you exactly talking about ? The major weakness right now for the first team is his finishing (I really don't know how to explain this but he was really good in this aspect at the Youth level). I am not saying United won't go and buy a RW (Regardless of who's in charge, but finding a quality RW might be a little harder than you think!), but the criticism on him is very unwarranted. He had an excellent first half. He has a really good understanding with Martial and Rashford which is really amazing since we all kept saying that van persie and Falcao just needed some game time to <i>really</i> click and then you have these young guys showing us just how easily it's done. His movement is fantastic, his work ethic is great. And when needed he brings the ball forward 30-40 yards and helps us advance.

3004~~~
I think there's more in his game and I know he's 23 but that really is not that old. A bit more final product in his game and I think he's an good squad player, he seems much more at home with Martial and Rashford linking up with him. I don't think he's really at the standard we expect of a proper United winger but he is very useful for specific types of games where we have to put a bit more focus on link up play and when we have to deal with good full-backs/wingers. He's always going to get attract a lot of criticism because his game is so simple, but I do think guys like Lingard are very important to building a good team. He was the only one who stuck up for Rashford up at City and he really does love playing for us, other more expensive guys have come in and not show anywhere near the same application as him.

He needs to start producing passes like the one where Martial was offside more often and to be a little more composed in front of goal. I think he can become a squad player who chips in with 10 goals/10 assists over a long season.

3005~~~
Very well said.

3006~~~
Neither of his chances were sitters. He also played through Martial who skied it over the net. Could have cost us today.

3007~~~
Although his finishing is horrendous, that is the least of my concerns.
He had a reasonable first half, which is what I said much earlier but one half in 10 games is not enough , I must have missed the 30 or 40 yard runs (with the ball)he keeps doing or the tracking back he doesn't do, wrong positioning, rarely wins a challenge  etc etc , forget his finishing. I  see a lot of easy touches and short passes - occasionally he might do something of note but it's nowhere near often enough

Vardy & Mahrez suit Leicester's style perfectly this season, next season, who knows, Leicester will probably fade away again. Payet's been around a long time and only Uk fans think he's a new thing but he only came to the UK last summer.

3008~~~
From watching him for a long time, he always stuck me as the type that misses some easy chances and then scores the occasional ridiculous goal. 

If he can start scoring scruffy goals he'll be a good player because he gets into the right positions

3009~~~
The thing is you are expecting him to give you a 8 or 9 star performance each game, which I know he won't be able to do. But I do expect a solid 7 or thereabouts most of the time which is more than enough for certain games.

He does track back quite a bit actually. For example, in today's game, the Cleverley miss was when Lingard made a late lunge to throw him off. Granted it was rash and maybe even a little lucky, but he's usually done a pretty solid job of doubling up on that side with the RB. Regards to positioning, I am not really quite sure what you mean, because Wingers positioning is a lot more lax compared to defenders. Only thing is he shouldn't be found caught up too high up the field with the RB next to him, but even then, most of the blame falls on the RB. In an attacking sense, he's a winger. Unless he has clear tactical instructions, he is free to do what he wants in the final third. Regarding the 30-40 yard bursts, he has done it in previous games more than a couple of times. So you might want to look that up. 
Also basically to you, easy touches = not good enough now ?? Some of the best players in the world are famous for getting the basics right. Then they add more dimensions to their game. I am not suggesting he is going to be world class either, but being able to do the simple things right is Football 101. There are higher rated players with fat wages who don't even get this concept. 

The problem is you expect him to be world class and people have been so spoilt by top class wingers down the years that they expect the next superstar in him. If you keep your expectations to realistic levels and know 100% exactly what you will get from him every game, then you will realize he's not as bad as people think. 

And I wasn't talking about a player's suitability to a system or whatever. I was suggesting that you can not expect every one to develop the same. Plenty of players in history are late bloomers. Some have even gone on to become legends. Maybe Lingard is one of them. Maybe he's not, who knows. But the boy atleast deserves a chance before being branded with one label or another.

3010~~~
Whenever I read this thread I feel like I'm in some sort of messed up twilight zone <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Depending on whose posts you read, his performances veer from "shit/invisible" to "excellent" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> FFS.

3011~~~
It's because in the second half he was invisible, in the first he was very good outside of the box and central to a lot of our positive play but also missed some good chances

In fairness, he was very mixed in the match so depending on what you focus on he could have been good or terrible.

3012~~~
He was wank today.

3013~~~
Tbf, it's not just today's match. It almost happens after every match.

3014~~~
No need to be pedantic about today's chances when he's been missing sitters all season. His finishing is shit, but has some good qualities - good movement off the ball, link up play, defensive work, pace on the wing etc. We just need another right winger of much better quality if we want to progress as a team and be more creative and efficient. For all his strengths, Lingard is a pretty limited player but it's always good to have a player with great attitude like him in the squad.

3015~~~
I don't expect an 8 or 9 performance from him , he's not capable - a 6 or 7 would be nice. His average rating on here is 5.6, my average for him is 5.5. If he'd have played the  2nd half today the same as the first I would have given him a generous 7, he got a 5 because of his second half showing.  I think I gave him a MOM earlier in the season. Trying to pick out an occasional benefit to the team really sums up what the problem is.

We have Martial on the left and Lingard on the right - someone on here seems to suggest  Lingard is better than Martial, heaven help us if Lingard is still playing for us next season as first choice, only under LVG could this happen - we need someone of Martial's quality on the right

3016~~~
If he can work on his finishing, he would move to a 8/10 player. Everything else he does (including the build up and play) is good. As I said earlier in this thread, I can see why he plays on the right for us, because we dont have anybody better than him (maybe if Young was fit or maybe valencia if he could cross, lol).

But hopefully he still sees minutes / games next season cos hes a good squad player to have. I would still like him to have competition however.

3017~~~
Excellent first half (most impressed i've been with him) But a bit meh second half, the game passed him by.

If he can start playing like he did in the first 45 on a regular basis and improve his finishing he could be a really good player for us.

3018~~~
I think he is still coming to terms that he is playing at this a level. He is a far better finisher than he is showing which is annoying. I mean that left foot strike today!!! Horrendous. With time he will settle his shooting nerves. He's not Anderson bad.

3019~~~
Don't know why everyone is ripping him so hard. He is a tidy little player and intelligent off the ball. His game will come together when Van Gaal leaves, he isn't a prototypical player under his leadership and I feel his game is stretching to try and accommodate the discipline rather than the natural growth.

3020~~~
That really was set up niceley for a placed, curling shot into the corner. 10/10 goal on FIFA.

3021~~~
Ashley would have buried it...

3022~~~
You're trying too hard mate, it's like you are reading from the caf attention seekers handbook.... I get your point, you've made it enough times. Time to move on I think...

3023~~~
I still don't know what he does well for an attacking player.

3024~~~
Shown enough intelligence with his link-up, runs, and positioning to make me think he can improve the finishing and decision making with a little more experience. The connection with Rashford and Martial is promising, think it's harsh to say he can't be a decent player eventually. 36 games played for us is too early to write him off

3025~~~
He has had more than a few golden chances in front of goal that didn't go in, hasn't he? We can't really depend on him to finish consistently. The way we play, we badly need those goals.

3026~~~
His finishing is poor, but at least he's actually getting in to those positions.  Our other options on the wing aren't exactly inspiring right now or provide any type of attacking verve, which is why the handwringing over Lingard is ridiculous.

I doubt even his biggest supporters would say they think he is or will be good enough as a nailed on starter for a team pushing for the league, but as a squad option over the course of a season where you'd hope to be pushing on all fronts domestically and in Europe, he is a solid.

3027~~~
So bloody lackadaisical in front of goal. He could easily and should be in double figures this season. Produced a decent save in the one on one from Robles. However the chance when he sliced the ball is unacceptable at this level. Needs to work on it if he's ever going to be good enough.

3028~~~
His finishing is fecking terrible. You could make a decent length YouTube video of all the really good chances he's blown this season.

I still think he's an average player,  I'd be happy to have him as a squad player but after this season he shouldn't be considered a first teamer.

3029~~~
One of the weirdest players I've ever seen in my life.

Sometimes he makes me think, "feck me, you really are shite"
Other times, he makes me think "There's a good little player in there"

3030~~~
Summed up perfectly.

3031~~~
Moves the ball quickly to teammates and is fairly quick. Sometimes finds decent pockets of space a bit tucked in from the right wing. There are a fair amount of similar sort of wingers/wide attacking midfielders at non-CL La Liga sides, if maybe generally a bit less quick and a bit more creative on the ball. Susaeta at Bilbao is one that comes to mind. 

Had a good game today. The fact that he can play as a CM, W or as a 10, seems to have some chemistry with Rashford and to a lesser extent Martial and that he can't be on huge wages should mean he gets another few years here.

3032~~~
We had about 19 shots on goal and it seemed like he had a hand in about 10 of them, as well as a couple of great balls in behind that were fluffed by a poor first touch.

3033~~~
Too wasteful in front of goal and if he doesn't sort that out can't see him lasting very long. At the moment he's all we have in that position so will do but I have a feeling if we do make a marquee signing this summer it'll be a winger/wide player and it'll be him who will be dropped. Rightly so in my opinion.

3034~~~
If Lingard's finishing would be at least average then he would have scored at least 15 goals this season......a shame his finishing is awful and that isn't good enough for a club like ours.

3035~~~
So, more than Martial then?
There is a narrative on here that I don't like. He got hammered for hitting that half volley at the keeper, which was a very difficult chance and a hard skill to pull off. Martial hits the ball further over the goal than he was away from it, under less pressure, but he is flavour of the month, so that's OK. 
If Martial had not scored in the 93rd minute, he would still have been given a pass, while Jesse was torn to shreds.
Let's just see how things play out. I know Jesse is a better scorer than he has shown in the first team. I think it's just a mental problem for the moment.

3036~~~
It's always the final moment that people remember, whether it's missing chances or scoring. Since his arrival and with Rashford on the pitch, I've never seen our front four play such fluid attacking football since post-Ferguson. They change positions so often and it's creating huge problems for the opposition defense. He dribbles the ball as well in the opposition half which not many of our players can do. Yes, his finishing is very poor but he creates so many chances and gets into such good positions. We always struggled to create chances under LvG but there's always Lingard who manages to get into great positions before missing chances. It's only a matter of time before he starts scoring. I said the same about welbeck and I still believe he would have come good if Sir Alex was around for more time. He needs fans to be more patient. He's started most of our previous 10-15 matches including some very big games I think and he's done well enough to receive another start.

I genuinely thought fans give the benefit of doubt to academy players and are always more patient with them, but for some reason this is never extended to Lingard who has done pretty well every time he's on the pitch bar couple of occasions. Is it because of Rashford and Fosu-Mensah's brilliant start to their fledgling careers?

Best part I like about him is he never stops running. And he's not running around like a headless chicken either. Look at his first touch, he always wants to take the ball forward unlike half our senior players. He drops into midfield when it's needed and supports the CMs as well. He doesn't look like he'll be among the future Balon D'or winners but that doesn't mean you give up on him. He's very comfortable with the ball and has enough pace to trouble any defender. He doesn't have excellent dribbling skills like Martial but he's a quality support player. How many times have you seen him lose the ball? I haven't checked the stats but for a young attacking player, I think it should be impressive. And he ALWAYS drops back to help out the fullback. Every time an opposition winger is in a good position, Lingard is there to stop him. 

He deserves more time before us couch-experts dish out the final judgement on him.

3037~~~
He played well in the first half but faded in the second. But he misses too many crucial chances. He needs to take some of these as they've cost us already this season and will continue to cost us.

3038~~~
Not to mention it was Lingard who played Martial through to sky it over but of course he never gets credit for the pass and there is no mention of the miss for Martial. Martial is obviously better but Lingard makes the same miss and it is all about how he misses open net sitters 10 times a game and hides from the ball somehow despite getting these chances and creating chances for others. Then there is the never takes a man on people who seem to think taking a man on is the only possible way to attack.

3039~~~
I'd missed those.
He's one of the few that will actually carry the ball 40 yards down the middle, creating panic in their defence.

And yes it was a good pass with a really neat delay/dummy.

3040~~~
Oh he gets it all the time. It is because most of his runs are bursts into open space between defenders, very effective and very good play but likewise of course it doesn't get noticed because it'll just be played off as running with the ball unopposed which it isn't. If it isn't 1 on 1 dribbling like Martial does then it doesn't count for some. That is the only way to do it. God I hate people who go on like taking a man on is the be all and end all of football.

3041~~~
Love watching his style of play when he's got the bit in between his teeth.

3042~~~
Similar to Mata's improvement when Herrera is buzzing around him, Lingard's game raises dramatically when he's linking up with Martial and Rashford. We need to keep these 3 up front for the remainder of the season as it'll give us the best chance of winning the cup and/or making top 4. If Rooney has to be shoe horned in somewhere, ffs, then keep it as that midfield role he's been playing.

3043~~~
I like Jesse, he was very good yday. He's missed some guilt chances this season though.

Hope he can improve with his end product or he'll end up annoying me much like Welbeck did.

3044~~~
Thought he was excellent first half, was involved in everything good we did.

2nd half sort of passed him by and was letting baines get a bit too much room at times, but on another day if his finishing was there he could have had an assist and 2 goals easily.

3045~~~
... but that's just it. He's had many other days and nobody can remember the last time he scored or had assist because it's been 11 games (or so I believe). The guy is definitely being given a free ride these days.

3046~~~
If only he can work on his finishing, which is a difficult feat.

3047~~~
Unfortunately at present we don't have any alternatives. We have Mata, but the team looks much worse with him playing. Lingard may not be putting up the stats, but he's enabling Rashford and Martial to do the business.

3048~~~
Goals and assists total of 9 in 34 appearances for someone who's one of the main attackers in our starting 11 is poor no matter how you spin it

3049~~~
Mata has 15 from 47
Rooney has 15 from 34
Martial 18 from 48.
Considering the cost of those players,  it's not far away.
Though I expect him to improve on those figures.

3050~~~
Why is 11 games without a goal or assist such a ludicrous stat for an inexperienced player? You'd think Ruud, Rooney or Beckham had never done the same...

3051~~~
Just an inkling of why some of us have more faith in him coming good.

3052~~~
Does Rooney only have one assist and Martial only 3?

3053~~~
Rooney has 19 from 34

3054~~~
Lingard has a 'score' every 290 minutes
Mata every 218
Rooney 167
Martial 178

3055~~~
The Phenomenon <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3056~~~
His finishing is very poor in comparison to the rest of his game at the moment, no question. But he's not really an attacker, he's a midfielder playing high up the pitch. You'd be better off comparing his stats to Mata's and also considering things like passes per game, pass completion, key passes, tackles, distance run etc.

Or, better still, just using your eyes - he's clearly an important part of this trio even if he's not necessarily the one getting the goals and assists. He's the one who starts the little moves, connects Rashford and Martial with little flicks and back-heels, keeps the whole thing flowing. If you watch carefully, he's also often the one who leads the press - he chooses to hound the player with the ball when he sees an opportunity, and Rashford and Martial then tend to respond and close down their own men. You need players like that in any attack.

3057~~~
This vid is more recent and better, and all United

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8KG8vEnw3Y?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3058~~~
I know...<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3059~~~
If he can improve his finishing he would be our most important player. He was a calm finisher at youth level but doens't appear to have a cool head, although he is inside his first 25 starts in the top division. 

A strong runner creates space that we've been crying out for in attack. His defensive work helps us win the ball closer to the goal, and his all round game is quite good, as in he can pass, shoot, dribble, tackle, run, cross. 

Fair chance he never develops a killer instinct and doesn't hit his potential in his next 25 games or the 50 after that and has to leave. Also a fair chance that a manager who doesn't care about home grown players enters the scene and just signs an already established player from spain or argentina. But I hope it works out for him

3060~~~
I don't get the negativity surrounding Lingard on here, Whilst I dont expect him to ever become a world beater id say he's already a great squad option he works his butt off for the team every game unlike some and also looks to be pretty popular amongst the rest of the squad. It's like he needs to be a potential balon D'or winner or else he's a nobody to some.
I Reckon he deserves his place as it stands and he also has plenty time to improve and as long as he stays at the club I would imagine he will have an immense hunger to do so.

3061~~~
Whilst i don't disagree with you, we have 4 front players. Martial and Rashford are much brighter prospects, but are also learning their trade. We haven't got room for a 3rd inexperienced inconsistent performer. Hes already what? 22, 23? Out of our front 4 hes the obvious one to replace. 

Someone needs to be a consistent, world class performer, or we'll not come close in the league for some time. A squad player at best for me.

Plus he has no composure whatsoever.

3062~~~
he's been one of the most consistent players while shifted around from left to right, he's very dependable player and for that reason he starts ahead of so called world class talent from Holland.
Some people are too lazy to give credit to a player who deserves it while being hungry to see a player who just goes past players. Lingard is no Ronaldo, his game is diffrent, but right now deserves to start ahead of Mata or Depay that is good enough for me to keep his starting spot, if a better player comes to the team and performs better than Lingard and make him a more squad player then okay, a least it will make Lingard work even harder, he's still young and has much higher potential than someone like Fletcher had and as we know he was one of our most important players during his peak years with us..

3063~~~
fecking hell who comes up with these names. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3064~~~
I think Lingard is top, does so much off the ball work. The runs he made against Everton is what we severely lack, and in time, he will gain composure and put away those chances. I'd say he's the most under-rated player in our attack. Take him out and we suffer.

3065~~~
i think there's adequate proof to suggest that we suffer just the same with him in.

3066~~~
He does?

3067~~~
Hes been really good in this half. Our best player so far.

3068~~~
im usually the first one to praise his performances so i guess its only right to be the first when he isnt producing....
Leicester did a great job on him and LVG didnt help him much with the team selection. He has 3 players(LAV, Rooney, Fellaini) that are always close to him and only one(LAV) can combine so he is pretty much forced to play on his own and dribble and thats the segment of the game where he isnt good. Both Rashford and Martial are to far from him so something needs to be changed. Hopefully he moves more centrally but somehow i doubt that will happen.....

3069~~~
A really you fecking kidding me? He's been useless, easily the most frustrating attacking player today. How does this guy play every match in an attacking position without scoring or assisting?

3070~~~
That's probably his own Youtube account.

3071~~~
He's so frustrating. The kid has zero end product.

3072~~~
Sorry but <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He has been poor again today, how he gets games ahead of Juan Mata and co is beyond belief.

3073~~~
Commentators keep banging on about him. I don't get it. He is useless.

3074~~~
Mata is worse, that's how.

3075~~~
Has Mata/Memphis been any better?...

3076~~~
Mata yes, without question.

3077~~~
He's off good riddance.

3078~~~
I'm not so sure about that really. He's quite slow and not as good as Lingard in the defensive work, and doesn't exactly score lots of goals either. He probably have more assists then Lingard, but I don't think he's been providing enough of those lately either. There's a reason why both him and Memphis are on the bench.

3079~~~
I rarely say that about our players but he is useless. We are better with playing Mata or Memphis instead of him.

3080~~~
I don't see why we took him off for Mata. Mata was just way worse and we played worse when Lingard off and Mata on. At least Lingard offered something and tried to do something.

3081~~~
On what evidence ?

3082~~~
He's not the best player, but he plays ahead of Memphis and Mata for a reason

3083~~~
We're a better team going forward when he's in the side. He sure doesn't finish attacks but he creates lots by his movement and intelligence.

His change of pace with the ball is also refreshing when most of our team run like fecking slugs.

There's a good 10 or so players in our squad who have been shitter than him this season.

3084~~~
Frustrating player but we do appear a better side when he is playing. Schmeichel pulled off a super save from one of Lingard's shots. Shame he didn't have the strength to hold off Danny Simpson when through.

3085~~~
For me subbing him off killed it for us. We needed tempo and he's one of our few players who actually attacks with the ball.

3086~~~
On evidence that Mata is more expensive than him, doesn't mean a thing that we were even worse once he came off.

3087~~~
Hopefully only reason he's still playing is because of how little Mata offered when he came on. Because neither did a thing of note, playing as an attacking midfielder for United. Not good enough, either of em.

3088~~~
I think so too. For next season I hope he still gets minutes but I also Hope we get true competition for that right side (rather than bandages like just sticking out Rashford or Mata there).

I do feel sorry for him though. It almost always seems like after he misses a chance / has it saved, we end up conceding.

3089~~~
We were doing nothing in the second half when he came off... It was just a crap half from us from start to finish. Lingard was offering nothing.

3090~~~
I thought we were far worse when he came off.

3091~~~
I don't really rate him but Mata shouldn't be playing as a winger. Lingard offers more. I wish we'd try anyone of Pereira/Januzaj/Depay in our current shape on the right but that doesn't seem even remotely likely.
For me the right winger spot is our most urgent transfer of the summer.

3092~~~
He is very frustrating. His movement off the ball is great and we always seem to have more options going forward when he's in the side, but when he actually gets the ball he does nothing with it.

3093~~~
Agreed.

I'm far from his biggest fans but at least he commits players and is positive. Thought he did well today.

3094~~~
He was lively in the first half but couldn't seem to get a foothold in the second before getting hooked.

3095~~~
They have a talent which Lingard doesn't have. They can do something out of nothing and their numbers confirm that even if both are in bad form. We need players with that talent playing week in week out and not players who run a lot and try a lot and always come short at the end because they lack vision, awareness and finishing touch and Lingard is player who lack all this things.

Today we had only two players who could do something out of nothing on the pitch from the start and that were Martial and Rooney. Rasford who I rate highly was surprisingly anonymous.

That was one of the downfall of LVG, playing players who are constantly good over players which have of game here and there but can provide that finishing touch out of nothing.

3096~~~
Despite the fact that we've seen Mata and Memphis play over him plenty of times this season and they've been worse?

3097~~~
Had some good moments in the game today. Often gets into good positions, but sometimes makes bad choices. I said the same thing about Martial too. They will learn with experience.

3098~~~
In all honesty, he's been as bad as Mata - though understandably he's also a little riskier - thus tends to lose the ball more.

But Memphis have been much worse then either imo.

3099~~~
And plenty of times they changed a game in our favour. He is good player but he lack the talent to play in our attack simple as that.

3100~~~
He has great work rate, but he can't weight a pass, is not quick and can't dribble. For me he is more a symbol of where we are atm than LVG.

3101~~~
This constant comparison between Lingard and Mata. 

Mata is not a right winger, he's a number 10 and should be deployed there (even at the expense of Rooney or Rashford).
Lingard is supposed to be a right winger but he's crap in his natural position.

3102~~~
Except Lingard has looked better through the centre than Mata does. Lingard isn't a top player, but Mata is largely useless (despite being a nice bloke) and hasn't done anything for about 3 years.

3103~~~
Mata has seldom been played as a number 10 this season but when he has, he makes Lingard look like a championship player.

3104~~~
On what basis do you make this bold statement?

Just because LVG brought him in to the team at RW?

He played as an AM coming through the ranks, sometimes from the right other times from the left or central. He played from the left for England u21's whenever I saw him play. He clearly isn't a classical winger in any sense but it just so happens that LVG thought he offered more to the role than Mata (who himself has played from either the left or right most of his career rather than being a specialist #10).

You can't make excuses for Mata (the infinitely more experienced player who has had plenty of time operating from the flanks) and then not offer a little leeway to Lingard.

It's fine that you think he is crap but don't invent reasons to justify it.

My selection of him as a right winger is based upon 1) that is where he's had his most consistent performances in the first team and 2) there is little or no competition for the right wing position 3) in the number 10 role we have Mata, Rooney or even Herrera, who are light years ahead of him in that position (if they ever got a run of games there!)

I can make excuses for Mata, play him in the number 10 role on a consistent basis and he WILL deliver, play him on the wing (with little pace) and you'll get the Mata we witnessed (again) today.

3106~~~
According to Transfermarkt, Mata has been used as an attacking midfielder (as opposed to a right winger) in the following matches:

Man City home (we created nothing, then sub Lingard on for Mata hit bar), Leicester away, Bournemouth away, Norwich home (poor team performance), Southampton home (half time sub), Stoke home, Chelsea away (Lingard scored), Sunderland away (team horror show), Arsenal home, Watford home (scored free-kick), Man City away (assist for Rashford's winner), Palace home. Also 4 EL matches (1 assist v Midtylland), 2 CL matches (1 assist v Wolfsburg), 2 FA cup matches (2 goals) and 1 League Cup game.

I'm not convinced by Lingard but Mata has been a near total waste of time this season both out wide and when used as a no 10. For a player who has taken penalties and a few free-kicks, his productivity is underwhelming to say the least. And I'm struggling to recall a long list of chances he created that our strikers have wasted.

As for Lingard, clearly he needs to do a lot more in the final third, show some imagination, better quality when he attempts a cross, more composure when shooting, make sure his first touch is decent, get stronger so he's not knocked off the ball so easily.

3107~~~
Didn't deserve to get subbed today. Would have offered a lot more than Herrera and Mata in those final minutes of the game,

3108~~~
On what fecking planet is Lingard better at No10 than Mata. Pure fecking fantasy. 

Mata played his best football this season in the middle. Lingard while good enough on the right is anonymous in the middle.

Jesus christ the shit you read on here.

3109~~~
No kidding. The amount of game time he has received, he's simply not good enough. Not a chance should he get all these minutes while Peirera and Januzaj rot in the reserves. All should be rotated.

3110~~~
None of that makes it his "natural position" which was a key element of your critique.

Once again, it is fine that you have a negative opinion of Lingard but there is no need to overstate it with misleading nonsense. There are plenty of things to find fault with in his game, as you'll see stated on each and every page of this thread, but to put the boot-in (incorrectly) whilst championing another under-performing player isn't necessary.

3111~~~
The fact he is constantly starting for us shows how far back we are. He wouldn't start for most premier league clubs.

3112~~~
He's the new Welbeck for me in terms of being really average but people overrate his contributions because he's a local lad/academy player.

3113~~~
This. I don't want to keep harping on the same point, but Lingard is nowhere near good enough to be starting consistently.

He's a squad player at best.

3114~~~
But better than Rooney...

3115~~~
He is a good squad player similar to Park was for us infact i would say park was far more instrumental and a true big match player for us, if he couldn't get into those sides and Lingard is still getting games as a starter even though he is a inferior player, its actually down to LVG for letting go players or not buying a Winger. He is all fart and no poo.

 I like him alot but seriously the reason why we fail to score in so many games isn't only down to LVG and his tactics, but a front four of Martial, Rashford, Lingard and Fellani. Three of them are under 23 and then there is Fellani. Its more so to do with LVG letting go important first team players and not signing established players who could provide the telling pass or score or that touch that opens up the play or choosing the correct pass. All of these things are obviously inconsistent in young players which have cost us in majority of the matches. I am not saying we shouldn't give young players a chance etc but this sort of dependence on them could seriously break them.

3116~~~
Maximum 4 games to go... please

3117~~~
Yep, that just underscores how poorly run this club is when we are overly dependent on young players such as Rashford, Martial and to some degree Lingard. And then there is a telling age gap up to Rooney and Mata. Very few of our outfield players are near their respective peak. It is a mix of has beens and young potential.

3118~~~
This is probably true but there's a good reason for it. It's better to have these type of players than some cnut from half way around the world whose only wearing the badge because we pay big wages. If a player is shite he's shite no matter where he is from but Lingard isn't. He's young(at 23 far from his peak), determined, energetic, intelligent, creative and most importantly improving all the time. He will become more effective, he needs too. We may need better as first choice but he can still have an important role to play in a stronger squad imo.

Besides, there's at least 10 players in our squad who he has outperformed this season who I would like to see fecked off before we get to him.

3119~~~
Is this a serious post, name one!!!

3120~~~
I agree. The ideal squad balance should 20% youth, 50% players in their prime, 30% experience.

Ours is currently unbalanced as the prime/experienced players have lets us down by underperforming over the course of the season.

3121~~~
Il name them all; Darmian, Schneiderlein, Rojo, carrick, Fellaini, schweinsteiger, Depay, Herrera, Mata, Jones.

Lingard has had a better season than all of these individuals, all of whom have underperformed. Close to adding Rooney in as well btw but he still been effective at certain times(eg.winner at Anfield).

3122~~~
Lingard is a nearly man at the moment. He nearly scores, he almost makes the vital pass, he comes close to finding a man with a cross.

I'm waiting for his luck to change. He's getting into the right areas and is trying to do the right things, without much luck.

That was a world class reaction save from Schmeichel to deny him.

3123~~~
Of course he has, can't pass , can't shoot, can't score, can't cross, can't take people on, can't tackle, can't head the ball but I understand he's excellent at finding space off the ball, very useful when the opposition don't even need to bother to mark him. I might give you Jones out of those mentioned but he's been injured most of the season.
Roll on next season and Mourinho will never pick him

3124~~~
I think he might be the worst starter I have ever seen for United.

I don't have any idea why he makes the squad, let alone starts every week.

3125~~~
Ignore him when he talks about academy players. He said a couple years back that Cleverley will become a top 3 midfielder (not sure if it was for EPL or for world).

3126~~~
I like him but he's no more then a squad player.

3127~~~
I think he's a bit like Park or Welbeck in that he occupies defenders with his movement and is probably pretty annoying to play against but unfortunately he's nowhere near as good as either (and worth noting that neither ever really nailed down a place in the team anyway).

3128~~~
Yep definitely thats what i've been saying but of lot of people seem to have a hard on for Lingard right now, feck knows why.

Januzaj, Peirera and even Depay should be rotated with Lingard. 

Big time i like him and hope he develops into a decent little squad player for us, but the Lingard a load of people are watching judging by their ratings is not the same one i am seeing every week.

3129~~~
Haha! I fecking love it when people slate Lingard and then say Januzaj or Memphis should be preferred. 
What the Hell have they done to deserve a place?!

3130~~~
Absolutely nothing of late. But then, the former has played 15 minutes since August and the latter is obviously a talent who's trying to find his way in his first season in England. Both are vastly more talented and at the very least deserve to be rotated in along with A.P.

Lingard has been given seemingly limitless opportunities. It's time to share minutes. It was time probably 7 or 8 games ago.

3131~~~
Right wing is one of the most neglected positions in our squad. Lingard is genuinely one of the most limited forward players we've ever had who has started a full season. He wouldn't get in half of the other PL teams.

3132~~~
<a class="username" data-user="82770, @caisenma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82770/">@caisenma</a>
Nothing you have said there is in any way convincing.
Januzaj has done nothing for over 2 years, including failing to impress on loan (so manager bias is unlikely)
Memphis is so talented that he won't show it,  just to prove how talented he is.
If you seriously can't see that Lingard is better than those two, then you have to question your understanding of football, and indeed, logic.
There is no "agenda"  for why Lingard is chosen, as he is better. So the agenda must be your's.
Why do you think he is always chosen in front of them?

3133~~~
Maybe we should be giving Memphis or Januzaj a few more chances to impress, its not like Lingard has set the world on fire. Dare we take a chance in rotating him.

3134~~~
He's so pointless for an attacking player.

3135~~~
For some reason, any time I see him, I keep thinking, "He is without question in a Stone Roses tribute band"

Full time footballer or not, I'm convinced he is for some strange reason

3136~~~
Of course Im biased, who isnt? You certainly are too, we all are.

My point stands, and I dont feel like repeating myself all over again. For an attacking player, to warrant continous selection you need to produce. LVG is a moron, and that's quite literally why think Lingard is undroppable to him.

3137~~~
I can't look at him today and point to much he's improved over the course of the season. His finishing, vision, runs are all about the same IMO, though he has linked up well with Rashford occasionally. With Memphis and Januzaj you can argue they've shown much more in the past or Lingard currently does so we have an idea of how much better it could be. Lingard isn't doing anything to lose his place to them right now but also isn't nailing it down.

3138~~~
With Lingard it feels like I'm controlling a 65 rated player on FIFA; I do the right movement and make the right shots and passes, but they just don't pull off.

3139~~~
Talent means nothing without the work put in, wit or determination. Januzaj and Memphis lack that and Lingard does not. He provides a balance to our team, and as of right now I am content with him in the team. I understand he is limited but he is better than most options right now. Better that than Januzaj/Memphis strolling about acting the big man.

3140~~~
No one here is overrating or overhyping or saying he is a top player. People give credits to him for grabbing chances and doing his best with proper mentality. You can praise a player for putting efforts. They don't have to be super talented to get one.

Most people who said he has been good is just being realistic for this season with options we have. The players some people think should have been giving a chance over him had chances and didn't do well and apparently do not have the right mentality to play for first team at the moment. You can think LVG made it up for whatever reason. But, CAF's favourite youth coach Joyce has confirmed it.

3141~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Apt description. Maybe 70 rated though tbf to him, not more than that.

3142~~~
If only he can shoot little better.

3143~~~
This. He's the best option down the right, anyone saying we should play Memphis or Januzaj obviously hasnt watched Memphis ever play for us or Januzaj for about 2 years. In the summer we need to be upgrading and move him to be a solid squad player.

3144~~~
I think he can grow when Van Gaal leaves. He's a very disciplined player but he isn't the all-round striker-type player that Martial is. Martial is also exceptionally gifted on the ball and that sorcery really sets him apart from the other wide options we have. The biggest problem is that both our wide players get bogged down having to play like extra fullbacks when we don't have the ball. When we do have the ball the transitions are always so slow bloated and most of the forward players end up playing the majority of the build up facing the ball with it going nowhere. They end up playing with their back to goal almost like a hold up striker.

Martial is just set apart in this aspect because his ability on the ball is so incredible he's able to use that ability to make something out of stone cold nothing. (I mean nothing).

I don't really get why Jesse is being torn to shreds on here, he looks a tidy little player. Sure his finishing can be worked on but once LVG leaves and we get a manager who will build a competent system that relies less on possession based build up and more on quick transitions without the wingers having to act like extra fullbacks then I think he will blossom.

He's definitely going to be a valuable rotational player.

3145~~~
Again, the notion that he's better than anything else we have is not provable when Lingard has been given all the opportunities of late. You give Memphis, Adnan or Pereira those sort of minutes, I'd wager they'd be significantly more productive than Lingard.

We are a team that doesn't score goals. We are awful at generating chances and in the premiership we are in the bottom half of goals scored. Bournemouth have as many goals as we do, ffs.

So we're a team that doesn't score goals, and we have a regular starter who to my knowledge has not scored or assisted in his last twelve starts. It is absolutely indefensible to say we have no better options at present, as we haven't given anyone else the sort of leeway we've given Lingard.

3146~~~
You may be right, but the decision on who plays is made by people who see them in training.
I'd hope that if they were pulling up trees in training, they would be rewarded, but nothing is certain these days.
I do feel that we play better with Lingard than without him, but also acknowledge that a better player could improve on this further. I like Perreira. Nothing from the other two makes me long for their inclusion.

3147~~~
I thought he was playing pretty well against Leicester but then LVG took him off after an hour, so maybe not.

3148~~~
He was the reason we dominated that first half. Ran his bloody socks off both in defence and attack. I wasn't surprised to see him go off - everyone else on the pitch looked knackered by the hour mark, and he'd done as much running as any other two players put together.

3149~~~
Don't be silly. It's not "leeway", he's getting the minutes over them because he deserves them.

3150~~~
So another poor performance yet people are praising him. I was watching him while I was at the game yesterday and there was times when he was actually hiding to not get a pass. Nowhere near good enough to be a starter at this club. I think Jose would turf him out if he comes and I certainly wouldn't complain if he did.

3151~~~
He plays as a winger to provide pace, but he is a slow winger. If he had proper pace, he would have gotten away from Simpson. 

He has a nice turn of pace and carries the ball well. More suited centrally I think.

3152~~~
Agree with everything you've written  - the bold I've been saying this for a long time. Yesterday I was looking through a list of all the players who have played for United  and have played more than 25 games - all those I've seen play over the past 53 years of watching United and I am struggling to find half a dozen players who have been worse than him when a regular starter.
The only reason he's even considered to be vaguely good is because "a local lad" - he's just not good enough.
He may be the most likeable wonderful person ever to have existed, but he's nowhere near good enough for United.

3153~~~
Can you explain what this means? It makes no sense to me whatsoever.
Are Herrera, Mata, Januzaj,  Shneiderlin, Darmian and Rojo good enough for United?
Is Mourinho good enough for United?

3154~~~
He's crap

3155~~~
Which one? There are many.

3156~~~
He's good enough for a squad player at best. The first team squad needs looked at- Rojo (horrific player sell who scouted him should get sacked) Fellaini (sell) Mata (sell) Darmain (?) Adnan (sell) Memphis (?) Jones (?) Herrera (?) Varella (?) Blackett (sell) Rooney (?) far to many players here with question marks or just not good enough.

3157~~~
There's a lot to like in Lingard's game, but he lacks speed and power.  Solid squad man, no doubt about it, but he's not what we need in a regular starter.

3158~~~
See the Lingard fan boys are out in force, for pity's sake

3159~~~
all those players you've listed have at least demonstrated their abilities at one time or another. maybe lingard has in spots too, but the point i'm making is that he appears to be nearly the first name on the team sheet. none of those players you mentioned deserve to be automatic starters every week either, but that's my point. lingard has done absolutely nothing to demonstrate he deserves this undroppable/holy status that LVG has bequeathed upon him. 

if we were a team that scored a lot of goals and were playing well, a case could be made that he's providing some sort of gentle nuance that isn't immediately obvious on a stat sheet. but we're not. we're criminally inoffensive in the final third, and lingard as the poorest offensive player, is the chief architect of our dismal offensive game.

3160~~~
Jesse Lingard -      Age : 23 - Goals : 5    - Assists : 4 - Mins : 2675
Memphis Depay -   Age : 22 - Goals : 7   - Assists : 6 - Mins : 2363
Adnan Januzaj -     Age : 21 - Goals : 1   - Assists : 3 - Mins : 776
Anthony Martial -   Age : 20 - Goals : 16 - Assists : 8 - Mins : 4369
Marcus Rashford - Age : 18 - Goals : 7   - Assists : 1 - Mins : 1173
Andreas Pereira -   Age : 20 - Goals : 1   - Assists : 0 - Mins : 371
James Wilson -      Age : 20 - Goals : 5   - Assists : 3 - Mins : 1201

3161~~~
His competition is Juan fecking Mata, how is that his fault?

3162~~~
Pereira and Januzaj could easily have been given chances there. I know Depay has had issues on that side, but I'd sooner try him out there in place of Lingard.

3163~~~
Firstly, Januzaj has been injured a lot and it's well documented that his attitude is shit. He can do one. You have to listen to the coaches or you can be the most talented player in the world and you won't go too far at Man United.

I like Pereira but I don't really think he's a winger and he's not particularly quick, so I can't see why we'd drop a player who is outperforming his other first team counterparts to give him a go there. I must admit, I'd be giving Young and Depay a chance or two on the right myself - Martial has been rubbish there and Mata has been mostly rubbish wherever he's played though.

Having said that, is it really the time to be tinkering again with what is a half-competent looking team in the run in? I can absolutely see the logic in not doing that as every point matters for top 4.

3164~~~
His attitude was "shit" because the documented evidence that we have is:

a) his Belgium U21 coach was pissed that he didn't come back to play for them when Januzaj himself said that he wanted to use that time to get caught up to speed with Dortmund. Big fecking deal.

b) Dortmund's coach said that his head was always in Manchester. Fine, he should have handled it differently but again, so what? He wanted to be here with us. We should be so glad that we have players that would rather be here and nowhere else.

If in fact he does have a shit attitude, it's still not too late to clear that up at 21. But there was little else to suggest he had a bat attitude before he left for Dortmund.

As for Periera, I felt he was one of our best players on the summer tour in the States and he predominantly played on the wing. The guy is a serious talent with a bright future ahead of him, especially considered to Lingard who has probably peaked considering he'll be turning 24 before the end of the year and hasn't exhibited the necessary qualities that suggest he can be an elite player for us.

And yes, I too would rather give Young a look ahead of Lingard as well.

3165~~~
It means that he is nowhere near good enough technically to play for this club. Why you are bringing other players up in relation to Lingard I'm not sure.

3166~~~
Probably peaked? He's fecking 23. It's not impossible but it's fecking unlikely.

And preseason is meaningless. Pereira's a good player but he ain't that good yet and his lack of pace is seemingly not what the manager's after. For me the guy's a CM but one who can happily fill in in the forward line or on the wings. Yet another not-right-winger that people are desperate to crowbar into the team for some reason.

And do you know the best way to clear up a shit attitude? Discipline someone rather than reward them for it...

3167~~~
Yes, I don't disagree with any of that. But I still think Pereira is worth a shot... let him see what he's worth, because my point is that all these guys should be given a chance to make the position theirs.

As for disciplining, no disagreement there. But how long does it take? We're talking about a highly subjective thing that most of us know very little bit about. If we knew as sure as day that he has a bad attitude, that's simply not defensible on his part.

3168~~~
Against teams that park the bus, which many do against United, I fail to see how Lingard is a better option than Januzaj. He doesn't have more pace; Januzaj is a far better dribbler and can go past people, and I also think that Januzaj has that extra bit of creativity that can provide a goal or assist out of very little. Lingard struggles to dribble past a cone.

If there is space to attack into, then Lingard is better, imo, but we don't see a lot of that.

3169~~~
In your opinion, and some others maybe. I guess the problem is United fans have been spoilt for a long time, he might not have been good enough for some past United teams but this side is fairly average.
I mentioned other players because in my opinion they contribute no more and in some cases less than Lingard and some of them cost a lot of money.
Fact is he is good enough to play in this side.
As for the Januzaj love in <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3170~~~
No offence but you sound like Van Gaal here lowering expectations. Our current side is average you are right, and Lingard epitomises everything about this. Someone who has made 35 appearances (most of them as starter) should not be still hiding to not receive a pass. That is similar to what Cleverly was doing towards the end of his time here to. Add to the fact he is so limited in nearly every other aspect means he should not be playing for this club. A competent manager will suss out these shortcomings within a few weeks and then he will be sent to a Championship team where he belongs.

3171~~~
When he isn't invisible, he's too predictable on the ball. Wasn't better than Memphis, who was garbage.

3172~~~
Why didn't he play today?

3173~~~
3 games to go and counting.. let's play hide and seek or hospital ball, your choice

3174~~~
When i seen he was getting substituted i was surprised because i had genuinely forgotten he was actually still on the pitch.

3175~~~
Needs to be dropped, has done nothing for a month.

3176~~~
He'll be gone (or benched) under Mourinho.

3177~~~
Yeah, forget he was playing tbh until he got subbed.

But overall, he really needs to work on his end product / finishing. But mostly, he should be playing Right side of the attack not centrally. I know it worked against City (cos he did a marking job as well). But against lower teams hes not good enough for the central position.

3178~~~
I would hope so because if were still in a position where a player like Lingard is a regular in the side we are in fecking trouble.

3179~~~
Normally I think he gets a bum rap on here, but he was shite today.

3180~~~
He's not a 10, why LVG insists on playing him there is beyond me. When on the wing he is fine.

3181~~~
Very poor today, has zero impact on the game.

3182~~~
Fine? What's "fine"?

Now 13 straight starts without a goal or an assist.

3183~~~
He, at this stage, should be benched. Not been good enough. But it says more about the quality of our other attackers that he still gets in the side.

3184~~~
Terrible performance.

3185~~~
We definitely need a new right winger to start for next season but I think Lingard is good enough to be backup. He offers pace, movement and usually quick passing. He isn't ever going to take us up a level on his own but in a team playing well I think he can do enough to offer positives.

3186~~~
Did he touch the ball in the second hlalf?

3187~~~
When he plays on the right he doesn't cross or dribble or even stay on the right so his fans say he plays better in the middle
When he plays in the middle he does nothing at all other than point occasionally so his fans say he's better on the right

Unless LvG is still our manager next season or our new manager is blind with an elf fetish he's nowhere near the squad let alone the first team

3188~~~
There are some matches in which Lingard doesn't appear to possess either the technique, or the imagination, to play for United. 

Given what we've seen this season, I'd say Lingard should be a sub, rather than a regular starter for us. I'd like to see Januzaj and Pereira get a fair chunk of the playing time Lingard has had.

3189~~~
It's no wonder we struggle to break teams down when Jesse Lingard is our number 10. Arsenal have Ozil, City have De Bruyne/Silva, Liverpool have Coutinho and Spurs have Eriksen/Alli. Lingard is just not good enough. He can't beat a man, he's technically limited, he rarely sees a killer pass or have the ability to execute it and he rarely shoots.

3190~~~
I believe that from the manager's perspective, Lingard has become a "trusted" player. Because we are in such a fragile position in the table, these trusted players become automatic selections and seem to be a protected species despite mistakes or subpar performances. I don't agree with it or pretend to understand it.

Januzaj & Pereira are in the "risky" category, these players are tormented with endless U-21 games, bench time, and clowned by almost substituting them into games before sending them back to the bench. If a risky player makes a mistake, they are then frozen out for the rest of the season.

3191~~~
Yup. The Lingard fanboys are awfully quiet over the last few weeks and rightfully so. Championship level player. I thought at one point he would of made an OK squad player but we need better. 24 this year as well.

3192~~~
I don't know about anyone else but I've been quiet because this thread is quite toxic, and people seem to spend almost as much time talking about Lingard fanboys or (Lingard haters) than his actual performances. Is that what the player performance forum is about? Tit for tat agenda posting where you have to pick a side? Personally I find it hard not to get sucked into it all when posting in the thread so have stayed away.

For what it's worth most of his recent performances have been disappointing but in context of his relative inexperience and the overall team performances I still think he could make a very useful player in our squad.

3193~~~
It's not tit for tat. Most logical people can agree has been terrible in most games he has played this season. Defenders of him keep using the 'whole team was bad' excuse to, that doesn't wash with me unfortunately when you can't even do the basics right. In 3 years when he is in the Championship (unless LVG or Giggs are manager) then it will be interesting to look back at this thread.

3194~~~
To be fair he does shoot and pass but usually because his shot is a pass to the keeper.

3195~~~
And pass sideways or back.

3196~~~
Sadly spot on this.

Imagine we'd gone all out for De Bruyne last summer.

We'd easily be in the title mix.

Hell, even Firmino would have us in there and was very getable.

3197~~~
The sentences following "It's not tit for tat" don't really support that statement.

3198~~~
I see you now have to resort to try and criticise the post rather than defend Lingard's performances, but I can see why. That's cool.

3199~~~
Should have a decent career at Everton.

3200~~~
If Lingard is a regular starter for our team then we are fecked. We need to have higher standards than that. Nothing against Lingard he is just not up to the standard we need.

3201~~~
He's a nothing player and has been all season. He's a Championship player at best. It shows just how pathetic our team is that he starts week in week out.

3202~~~
As I remember him he started pretty well when he finally got his chance, both in terms of overall play but also in terms of goals and assist, nothing extraordinary, but good enough to atleast be a squad player for us. Now he's just become a nothing player doing the simple things all the time, he offers absolutely nothing, and just look like a player who'll do the simple things in order to keep his place in the team.

3203~~~
He was invisible today even by his usual low standards.

He could do a job as a backup squad player maybe, but that is it. If he is regularly starting games, and in the fecking number 10 position, then we won't be winning any major trophies any time soon.

3204~~~
Was poor today but, simply don't understand why LVG didn't swap Mata and him as Mata was also completely ineffectual where he was playing. But, comments about him being a nothing player are a bit much - he is not a top level player that should be starting regularly for us - though that may change but, he is a solid squad player and would be good enough regular starter for any of the mid level clubs based on his current level. It's his first year as a XI player and just has to keep working to step it up.

3205~~~
Lingard playing in the centre should never happen again. Totally anonymous in there, good on the right at times so thats where he should play from.

Mata was good enough today but everything good that he did he could have did in the centre and maybe more. He's wasted out on the right, he provides zero width.

Swapping them would be a no brainer for everyone but Van Gaal it seems, what he sees in having both these players play out of position is beyond me.

3206~~~
Thats fair enough. He has five goals and four assists. And im sure most of that came early part of him playing for us this season as opposed to later (although I could be wrong)
I also think he was unlucky as well near the beginning with some of his shots hitting the post (eg his chance against City)

Recently hes just been poor, eg his shot against Everton in the FA cup. That was a terrible attempt.

3207~~~
That's harsh, he could be a very good player for a bottom-half Prem club imo.

3208~~~
This criticism is all massively overblown. When he has great games he gets, at best, grudging acknowledgements tempered into oblivion with 'but we need a bigger name in the summer' and 'in the future he could be a good squad player'. Then one quiet performance in a much-changed team - and one where he was average, rather than actually bad, and certainly a lot better than Depay, Rooney or Rojo, to name just three - and the knives are out.

I'm not saying he's a superstar who'll deserve to stay in the first team forever. But he's been an under-appreciated part of the Rashford-Martial attack, makes an important contribution that the many, many caf statisticians don't have a column of numbers for, and just as importantly busts a gut game-in game-out unlike a number of flashier names in our squad. It's pathetic that Manchester United fans have got to a place where you're more likely to get a positive reception if you're a big-money signing with a foreign sounding name than a local lad from the academy. These days the academy products seem to have to offer twice as much as the big transfers to get a look-in on the caf.

3209~~~
Agree 100% with your post

3210~~~
13 matches, zero contribution and just because he's an academy player doesn't mean he has to play for United. No comparison to Rashford or Martial and is not part of this "trio" because he gives them nothing and before the end of the year he's 24. Hold hands with Van Gaal as you leave together.

3211~~~
He is just not United quality. Loves the team and is a youth product though which clouds many ppl's judgement on him. I like him as well. Doesn't change the fact he is pretty average.

3212~~~
His stupid video makes me hate him even more.

Not really sure what he was thinking about.

3213~~~
Just saw the images from his video....

From Robson, Keane, Scholes, Butt, Hargreaves, Fletcher to this little idiot

fecking Carrick the first one down on the floor hiding <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3214~~~
Don't think there was anything wrong with the video if I'm honest.

3215~~~
How have we spunked endless money and ended up with this clown playing for us? Yet Leicester and Spurs have spent much less and have Alli and Mahrez. The answer is simple, Spurs have a manager who can develop talent and Leicester's scouting is on point. We have Woodward flinging money around on signings he thinks will keep him in the fans good books, who the next moron Van Gaal fails to do anything with as he slowly destroys their confidence and love of the game. It is really that bad here right now.

3216~~~
If I was the manager, he'd have been fined 2 weeks wages and not played a minute more of this season for the feckwittery in the coach. Tbf, he wouldn't dare do this if our club wasn't full of weak cnuts from manager down.

3217~~~
Imagine him behaving like this if SAF was manager?

3218~~~
Acting like a 13 year old in that video but more importantly has contributed next to nothing in months 

Happy to see him shipped out along with a few others

3219~~~
He should have Gibson's place in our squad i.e 5th or 6th choice.

Also, that frickin video..

3220~~~
Would be funny if he tried. Bunch of clowns we have at the club atm.

3221~~~
What's the video, amol?

3222~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKGrYg_WsPQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3223~~~
The one with the players' (Lingard and others in the background) giggling and being hysterical like 12 year olds when our team bus was being attacked.

Seems to have been taken off twitter.

EDIT: Invictus to the rescue!

3224~~~
Cheers lads.

3225~~~
Lmao at that video.

How far our club has fallen.

Some of these players should be nowhere near the club and yet we rely on them week in and week out.

3226~~~
Apparently our youth products know what this club is about...

I've defended him this season but I wouldn't mind seeing him dumped out of the club for that video alone.
That's because you're 18.

3227~~~
The epitomy of what our club is these days. Spineless mediocre and pissing me off.

3228~~~
Spot on.

3229~~~
He's a fecking idiot for sharing that video and makes a fool of those addressing the serious side of it. It might be different if he made a contribution in a game once in a while but he doesn't. Should be fined and banned.

3230~~~
Embarrassing bunch of hysterical kids.

3231~~~
taken from <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-the-ridiculous-statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.football365.com/news/manchester-united-the-ridiculous-statistics</a>

* Jesse Lingard has created <b>13 chances</b> in 1545 minutes while playing as an attacking midfielder. Other players who have created 13 Premier League chances this season are Bryan Oviedo (998 minutes), Gabriel Agbonlahor (1037 minutes) and Modou Barrow (750 minutes).

there can be no excuses... lingard is the definition lvg's reign. the embodiment of a failed era.

3232~~~
Jesus Christ, the complete overreaction to that video <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Is the Caf filled with joyless 60-year olds who do nothing but complain about todays youths?

3233~~~
How about the reasons I illustrated above? Is that good enough reason to complain?

3234~~~
My favourite is how Fergie would never allow any of this. Do people not remember who Rio Ferdinand was? Players fecking around and making dumb videos is nothing new.

3235~~~
So would he be posting that before a important game under Fergie?

Ferguson also told the players not to tweet about the club.

3236~~~
My employer doesn't allow me to post things while I am at work (and especially things that relate to my job).

3237~~~
cringe video, set of cnuts!

Roy Keane would eaten those daft nuts for breakfast, fcuk even Neville would have.

3238~~~
just curious, was that video put online before kick off? If so that's poor

3239~~~
We might cringe at that video, but that part is just modern day sports/communication. You may not like it, but there are millions that do.

And yes, I think I recall the video being put out before kickoff.

3240~~~
Made a twat of himself and the rest of the players, hysterical is an understatement. I actually love how calm CBJ is sat in his seat whilst the others are lay on the ground like big girls.

3241~~~
Nah, Fergie would have merked all of 'em. <span style="color: #ffffff">Hopefully people get this.</span>

3242~~~
I'd be happy to see him part of the squad next year but we need a signing to make the right side their own.

3243~~~
God, some of you guys are being as hysterical as you're accusing them of being. One they had to get in the middle cus there was a serious chance of a window actually being broken causing injury. Two, Lingard is making light of the situation, obviously exaggerating and finding it actually quite funny. And finally,
quotes such as there show that the caf is filled with people so stuck in the antiquated idea of gendered norms - what it means to be a real man. I guarantee most of you would have been shitting bricks if your bus was surrounded and being attacked, most opposition fans I know who've seen the video find it hilarious and think Lingard is being funny, you are honestly the only set of people who find an issue with it because you think that something so innocuous as this is a disgrace to our club. You think he needs to grow up, naah, you need to grow up and realise that things like this dont really matter. Stop ascribing it some life or death importance acting like jumped up 16 year olds who want to prove that they're real proper fans, real proper men raaah. It's tiring.

3244~~~
Don't care about the video, but it's odd the same people who defend his crap play also defend his video, is it love?

3245~~~
Lingard's stupid face is everywhere. I can't avoid it.

3246~~~
i'm just tired of how much game time he gets for absolutely no return. couldn't give a shit about the video, although it is a bit obnoxious. lingard comes across as though he's 14.

3247~~~
So true.

3248~~~
Made me laugh when I read earlier that he's decided to stop doing the dab next season. Can't even remember the last time the fecker scored.

3249~~~
I dont see whats wrong with the video. The problem is releasing it.

It should have only seen the light of day had we won. And had we won, you can bet it would have  be used as troll video towards West Ham

3250~~~
Rabble rabble rabble. Wouldn't happen in my day. Nobby Stiles would have turned those hysterical kids' skin inside out and used their bones for soup. Keano would have carried on playing cards even if the bus was flipped on its head and set on fire. Not in my day. I remember this when it was all just fields. Get out of my garden.

3251~~~
Yeah, though I agree that there's a bit of OTT reaction (not just in the bus but on here as well), it's understandable for a couple of reasons - like the timing of when it was released and in the context of how big the match was they were heading to. It's not something (reaction and timing of video) you'd have seen under SAF & it certainly contributes to the perceived weak/timid nature or mentality of our current squad. Most players who've won or proven jack all, yet act like they've seen and done it all. "Made it". 

Also, the part about Rio is true but those guys were born winners and they've earned their right to feck about with a camera after a match etc. - & it would usually be at times we've won. There were no question marks having over their character and mentality to lead this club back to the top. They were, for most part, at the top.

In the end, maybe most of us are just grumpy old men <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, craving to get back to "the good old day" and have hard bastards filling our squad instead of this new "social media" generation.

3252~~~
Or you know in reality the two have nothing to with each other. How is posting a video acting like you made it? I haven't done shit in my life shall I delete my facebook and stop posting on the caf? Do I need to win a PL medal before I can post stuff online? No, because they have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Rio didn't earn the right to feck around with a camera because everyone already has that right. You don't need to be a world class footballer to have a life outside football. But no hard bastards aren't allowed to do anything but play football and make love to Clayton Blackmore calendars. Back in my days we made loved to calendars and didn't video it, hard man me like.

3253~~~
its only struck me how its approx. 1 hour before a huge game and they are uploading social media. There is a time and place for it

3254~~~
No need to get that upset buddy, I wasn't having a go at all. But anyway.

Who said anything about anyone not having the right to post stuff on social media? There's also a difference between posting stuff on social media regards to your personal life, and posting stuff on social media with regards to your employers.

There's a massive difference between you and I (ordinary joes) and celebrity footballers. With all that fame also comes a bit of responsibility. So what sort of reaction would you expect from highly charged fans, when the club isn't doing too well and the timing and the content of your video isn't ideal?

3255~~~
He loves Lingard who can do no wrong

3256~~~
Oooh, I didn't know that <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3257~~~
Pity they didn't film what was going on outside, not sure if they would have picked up much and who chucked what. There were terrified kids out there, rather than thinking it was all funny and screaming like hysterical little girls.

3258~~~
Or I judge players on their footballing ability, where Lingard hasn't been good enough but still better than most of the other options, and not on some video that they post.

3259~~~
Anyone who thinks there's nothing wrong with that video is just being contrarian for the hell of it. It's embarrassing. And this is the headspace players are in going into the most important game of the season thus far. Odd.

3260~~~
I'm not upset, I couldn't give a feck about the video or what some idiots getting their knickers in a twist think about it.

You said " those guys were born winners and they've earned their right to feck about with a camera." There is nothing in the video in regards to Manchester United as a club, it is a video of the team sitting in a bus. There is nothing to be taken away from it, players and regular joes post pictures of themselves and colleagues all the time.

I'd expect fans with any bit of sense to criticize the football on the field not some dumb video of the players having a laugh before the game. I'm sorry I forgot everyone on here believe you can't have a laugh when the team is playing bad, must be pissed off and thinking about the game 24/7.

3261~~~
About the video? Not really, no..

3262~~~
Couldn't care less about the video, people react differently when they're scared but his footballing ability is where I have a problem

3263~~~
No its realizing that the video had absolutely no bearing on the shit show that was displayed on the pitch.

3264~~~
So then post about his footballing ability and not some shit post about me loving him.

3265~~~
You didn't answer my question.

You think Fergie would be happy with a vid like this an hour before a game.

Then Rooney and Van Gaal appear before the cameras who address the situation seriously. Whilst Lingard makes a mockery out of it.

3266~~~
You defend him constantly even when it's clear he's been useless for months - what other reason is there

3267~~~
Wtf are you talking about? I don't need him to be a mans mans, I just wanted him to be focused on what was going to be the biggest game of his career.

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Opposition fans also don't give a sh!t if we are in the CL next season. In fact, they'd find it hilarious if we weren't. 

Certainly showed a lack of professionalism. Plenty of other players have done worse but at least they had put in some high level performances before they started shagging granny's.

Actually, the lack of focus and the lack of a result says it does. It also begs the question about their focus ahead of other games where we haven't got results.

OK, because thats whats happening here... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

And for what its worth, my response to Sigma had more to do with the fact that at 18, he wouldn't be familiar with the level of focus/discipline our previous players showed to be competing and winning on all fronts. And Lingard hasn't shown he has the talent to not be totally focused on a game.

3268~~~
Hopefully we can get 7-8m for him.

3269~~~
We got a total of something like £20m for Rafael, Nani, Van Persie, Evans and Hernandez. Not to mention taking a £15m loss on Di Maria less than a year after signing him for £60m. Despite selling him to a club who were desperate to sign him.

So us getting £8m for Lingard would seem a bit optimistic.

3270~~~
Hopefully Berta will change that.

3271~~~
That's quite a conclusion. Is that what they are teaching in schools these days? "Don't worry, it's ok to act like a pussy, if people with jobs laugh at you they are just dinosaurs."

3272~~~
The video annoys me but maybe... they find it to be entertaining? Honestly don't care about the video. I think it has little to do with what happens on the pitch.

3273~~~
Quotes such as there show that the caf is filled with people so stuck in the antiquated idea of gendered norms - what it manes to be a real man.

3274~~~
Frankly, if our team was doing well and if Lingard was playing like a Ronaldo (<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I know) then that video would have been hilarious. As it stands, we are shite on the pitch with a team full of sub-standard players with zero passion and who would not be fit to lace the boots of some of our best teams. 

Lingard, for me, is the epitome of the mediocrity filled in our team at present. This stunt pisses me off even more but the context has to be taken into consideration.

3275~~~
Players clown around all the time for whatever reason (try to be funny, relieve stress, etc). That video isn't particularly funny or entertaining IMO, but nothing to get worked up about.

3276~~~
,Whatever about the video, the fact is that he has been absolutely woeful for months now and we <i>badly</i> need an upgrade. I tried hard this season to see the positives with Lingard but any goodwill that I had for him is well and truly gone at this stage. He was getting away with it for a while when he was popping up with the odd goal or assist despite some pretty inept performances. He played well in the City game, I'll give him that much.

Some on here seem hell-bent on defending him to the point where it's just plain ridiculous. If anyone is satisfied with his performances overall this season - as a starter for our club - then feck me, standards are at an all time low. I've seen him play average - poor, and people on here will describe his performance as brilliant, amazing, etc. There's clearly no objectivity from some when it comes to Lingard. I honestly think the guy would struggle to get into bottom half PL sides, let alone be a starter for Manchester United. For me, he works hard yeah, but he's just<i> far</i> too limited as a footballer.

I also don't get the whole "he's earned his place" line of thought, as if he earned it through his own scintillating displays. The fact is that LvG has started him consistently so what's to say the likes of Memphis couldn't have played to his standard (not a very high standard at all) had they got the same run of games. Earning your place in our first eleven used to mean something but it means feck all now with the piss poor squad that we have along with a terrible manager and our abject, bland style of football that we play. So yeah, I personally don't think he's <i>earned </i>anything.

3277~~~
That would be Fellaini and Rojo. Lingard has done well

3278~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3279~~~
As if we played shit because Lingard decided to record some stupid video.

3280~~~
I seriously doubt<i> anybody</i> said or insinuated that.

3281~~~
The hate for Lingard is so strong that he's being criticised for a video <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

He's an average player, but Jesus give the lad a break. The only reason it 'wouldn't have happened in Keano's day' would be the lack of iPhones and Twitter. Not because he'd be stood on his seat growling at the West Ham fans as the bus went by.

3282~~~
'Done well', He has had 4 good games out of the 37 appearances he has made. If that is the standard we are judging by then it's no wonder we are shite.

3283~~~
He will be in the lower realms of the PL or even Championship in a few years and the defenders of him now will of course distance themselves from ever defending him, when it was clear from November onwards that he doesn't look anywhere near the good enough standard.

3284~~~
I dont know why people still believe he's been doing well. Look at his stats, he's been terrible considering the role he should play. On top, he misses way too many chances. Our standards really are poor if he's the best we can do at RW - in no other top club would he be a starter

3285~~~
Fellaini has not been too bad either while Rojo has been abysmal. Lingard is similar to Fellaini in terms of performances. It's just that Fellaini seems more ungainly.

3286~~~
Whilst this is undoubtedly true you also then have to admit that when Lingard has played "average-poor" or even, dare I say, decent there have been people on here that will describe his performance as awful, sh*te, garbage etc. The lack of objectivity extends to a large swathe of this thread.

A poster described it as tit-for-tat the other day and that is exactly what it is for the most part (it's the Rooney thread lite). Booyah politics at its worst, hyperbole coming from all angles, persistent calling out of "Lingard lovers/haters". All this leaves very little room for actual discussion and exchange for those that sit somewhere in between the two extremes.

3287~~~
True, it works both ways. Unfortunately when we are struggling, players like Lingard will always be singled out and vilified.

But there's definitely some on here who make him out to be a <i>far </i>better player than he actually is. I personally don't rate the chap; I done my best to pick out small positives but I think I'm done with him at this point.

3288~~~
He could maybe pass as a 4th/5th option on the wing when we have to rest somebody or are down with too many injuries. In no way he should be playing 20+ games from the start.

3289~~~
He is a starting winger/number 10 for Manchester United, and doesn't have an assist or goal to his name in months. 

That really is just about it.

3290~~~
He is a decent player and that is all a squad player has to be in my eyes. Capable of stepping in to the team and doing a job in several different roles, he'll never really be a "game changer" but he can be dependable, committed and adaptable. In an ideal world that is how he should have been introduced to the team rather than burdening him with a reasonably important job in his first season at this level. 

I can see why people are so frustrated that he is a regular at the moment but when you look around for alternatives in the RW role we are left with Mata (who has just as often underwhelmed as impressed in that position) and then hypothetical solutions that are largely untested in LVG's system (Perreira, Januzaj or Memphis who has struggled in his favoured position). Why Nani was never seriously considered for the role I don't know but we should have signed a player of a similar ilk, and of equal or better calibre.

Lingard's recent form has been generally poor but I don't think he has particularly stood out as being poorer than the majority of the team around him. That doesn't excuse his form but it does provide a degree of perspective and context, even when he hasn't played the team hasn't looked any better or more creative. He doesn't hold the team back but increasingly appears to have regressed towards the mean.

3291~~~
Yep.

He's an incredibly average player generally anyway but the last few months he's been fecking rubbish.

I don't think I've ever been less enthused at seeing a sub come on when we need a goal than I did on Tuesday when I saw Lingard warming up. Other than Nick Powell in Germany maybe. 

Christ, what a season it's been.

3292~~~
He's got pace, not sure what else are his strong points

3293~~~
Does he?

I don't think he's that fast. Look how Simpson caught him up in that one vs one.

3294~~~
Hes Tom Cleverley mark 2, he just plays further forward. Offers absolutely nothing amd should be nowhere near a United first team.

3295~~~
He's clearly below the level we need, not sure he's even that useful as a sub long-term, and it's pointless him dropping down to the reserves, so with that in mind what sort of price could he fetch, young, English, and a level below the standard required for a club like United, £15 million? or am I been unrealistic?

3296~~~
especially when you consider how poor we are at selling players, there is absolutely no chance we could get 15 million pounds for him.

honestly, i'd peg him around 5-7 million quid.

3297~~~
You're probably right, but we did sell Welbeck for a good fee, and with lower ranking English clubs having lots more money nowadays we could get a similar fee for Lingard, Sunderland, Stoke, Burnley etc might be interested.

3298~~~
I just assumed he has. maybe I'm too used to seeing Mata, Rooney, Carrick, BSF, Fellaini etc

3299~~~
Would you keep him for next season???

3300~~~
Yes.But it's not the point of the my original post.

3301~~~
I suspect he wouldn't be playing much if Januzaj and Pereira were not as hyped up as hot prospects before Van Gaal arrived.

"Oh look at me, I'm Louis Van Gaal and I do things out of the ordinary and promote players you'd least expect. Be impressed by my genius."

Piss off Louis, you mangled nose twat.

3302~~~
If Lingard had have finished the chances then he would have been very productive. I do fret he will go down the cleverly road of thinking he's made it. I'm not impressed seeing that video on the team bus. That annoys me. His long term future is based on taking those chances. He plays in a key position and you have to be reliable. He's got the potential to finish these chances. Needs to work harder.

3303~~~
Agree but I'd keep him as a squaddie until we get the rest sorted. But ultimately he has looked lacking and he will be 24 next year.

3304~~~
No way this guy is anywhere near the starting 11 at this point in 12 months time if we have a different manager. Still afraid to go forward in a dead rubber game.

3305~~~
Agreed, he's not good enough to be starting matches at United. Wouldn't want him as a squad player either tbh

3306~~~
no way is he a starter in week 1 of the new season if we have a new manager. even with no new additions to the squad, any manager can see he's got absolutely nothing to offer.

remember all that talk about him making the england squad for the euro's? me neither. for a regular starting attacking player, at united no less, and to not be within a galaxy of the national team should say all you need to know about his quality.

i believe he'll be 24 before the end of this year.

3307~~~
I'd like I'm to come off now. Bring Memphis on see if he can mix things up a little down the right .

3308~~~
I swear if we moved the goals to the touchlines instead then Lingard would be one of the best players in the world.

3309~~~
how about andreas instead?

3310~~~
Definition of average. Wouldn't even get in the squads for most PL teams yet starting for us.

3311~~~
You should probably get your memory checked out because he has already been called up to the England squad this season.

3312~~~
how long ago? and is his name in the provisional squad for the euro's or am i blind?

3313~~~
Gets the 90 minutes again aswell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3314~~~
Need an upgrade on him and fast. 

Should not be a starter.

3315~~~
Once again he's totally pointless. Laughable how he even gets a game, let alone every bloody game.

3316~~~
so that's... 15 matches in a row where he's not scored or assisted. this was an absolute testimonial of a match too, and he never looked remotely threatening.

3317~~~
Really poor tonight.

3318~~~
Rubbish season. Doubt he'd even get in that Bournemouth side tonight.

3319~~~
Pointless.

3320~~~
Matt Ritchie is better than him anyway!

3321~~~
has never been good enough.  Good lad and cares but...sorry.

3322~~~
He is better coming in from the left. Done a job on the right where we haven't really got anything else.

3323~~~
He's the definition of our decline in recent years, we appreciate mediocrity in Lingard. He's not good enough and never will be good enough for a top level team and the sad thing is I don't think he'd start in any of the other 19 Premier League teams but somehow is for us.

It's depressing and he needs to be shipped out ASAP next season

3324~~~
Thought he was terrible tonight. Didn't see him do much at all, and when we did have periods of good play, he was nowhere to be seen.

3325~~~
So now that's the 3rd position I have heard that 'he is better from'. Started with him being 'best through the middle' in which he was shown to be poor. Then it was 'his best position is on the right' and he has been pointless in that position to. Now it's from the left....

3326~~~
Squad player at best

3327~~~
Tonight was my last straw with him, especially following his pathetic video from the bus at West Ham. He's quick and industrious, but that's not enough by a country mile. His touch is very poor, he can't shoot and his decision-making is shocking. 
If Mourinho comes in, we may well see Jesse shipped out & I for one wouldn't miss him.

3328~~~
He isn't even that quick to be honest. He can barely outpace any fullbacks.

3329~~~
Think his decision is making is N/A as there isn't any. He doesnt run at players, he doesn't try anything creative, he's realised he can't cross, he turns down opportunities to shoot. His decision making is limited to playing the safest pass to a red shirt which Van Gaal would love but doesn't help a team in desperate need of creativity and goals.

3330~~~
He constantly loses the ball and basically, he doesn't look like he has a clue what to do with the ball when he has it.

3331~~~
This.

Defenders seem to catch up very quickly to him.

3332~~~
I think he is very useful squad player, a bit like Park was, but as a starting line-up goes we need someone much more creative on the right.

3333~~~
I don't think he's anywhere near as good as Park was. And my God he looks like a gimp in that video...

3334~~~
I agree with what everyone are saying here.

He's not good enough even for our current state, 5th place

He works hard on the wing, which is basically what our academy produces. (Drinkwater, Simpsons, Brady, M.Keane...) 

He's good attitude and is willing to help, but it's not good enough. He can't cross, can't pass a defender. I just hope that he'll be on the bench (or send in loan) next year

3335~~~
If LvG goes then I think Lingard's days are numbered.

3336~~~
Praise be

3337~~~

Get in Shitty Jesse Lingard!

3340~~~
That is a hell of a goal. Take a bow son.

3341~~~
Great finish.

3342~~~
fecking knew it!

as soon he was sub in, i thought he was gonna give us the winning goal.

get the feck in you little feckerrr!!

3343~~~
Absolute instinct strike. Fantastic. 

Perhaps the goal that wins a lot of folks over (including myself).

3344~~~
The reactions when he came on <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3345~~~
Thats Jesse Lingard for you... he has that in his locker. A scorer of great goals

3346~~~
What a goal.

3347~~~
What a strike, thunderhammer!

3348~~~
Bad, yeah?

3349~~~
Amazing finish

3350~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

He should be used as impact player, not starter, what a goal! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3352~~~
People being people. Hes been very decent this season. Really happy for him.

3353~~~
Strike

3354~~~
Watch the overreactions to Lingard reach an all time high tonight....

3355~~~
Should've dabbed for the goal. Feck the shirt take off, that's so cliche.

3356~~~
Yea watch people enjoy a young local lad score a cup final winner!

3357~~~
Enjoy it. I don't think anyone thinks he'll ever be the next messi but he can still become a good player for us. If he can replace Youngs contribution in the squad id be more than made up

3358~~~
I haven't been in this thread since his poor form...but just coming back to show my face to say Jesse is a world beater and all that

3359~~~
Atta boy.

3360~~~
True supporter, sing when you're winning and all that.

3361~~~
Take as many silly videos as you want you beautiful man

3362~~~
Jesse LEGEND

3363~~~
You're embarrassing.

3364~~~
I'm not saying don't enjoy it, Christ I bloody enjoyed it! I'm saying just wait for the abundance of posts saying he has been excellent all season now etc.

3365~~~
Bloody delighted for him.

3366~~~
Nice contribution to the thread there.

3367~~~
Great finish and delighted for him. However he's a bit mediocre and should continue being used off the bench

3368~~~
Hero.

Get fecked haters

3370~~~
Keep on dabbing!

3371~~~
What a lovely goal and moment for him. He fully deserves to be in the squad and I hope he stays next season.

3372~~~
He's just won us the FA Cup. Can we not leave the moaning about how poor he is for a few minutes at least?

3373~~~
Agreed squad player at best!

3374~~~
I love it when the much maligned players shut up their detractors.

3375~~~
He enjoyed a lot of game time this season because Memphis was poor, he was always meant to be a squad player.  But I love his attitude and determination, he takes every chance he gets and always gives everything.

3376~~~
For all the abuse he gets, what a way to make an impact!

3377~~~
Brilliant goal. Made an impact off the bench. Well played!

3378~~~
A lot better than posting he's shite every other post.

3379~~~
I don't disagree, its not his fault we don't have a player doing a lot more than him to play on the right

3380~~~
BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE

3381~~~
Hero today... great job Jesse.  Need to improve to be a starter next year but don't worry about it.  Get hammered tonight!

3382~~~
Lad! Didn't get the first goalscorer bet off him (hard to turn down at 25/1) but I'm still made up that it was him who scored the winner!

3383~~~
Fantastic goal but didn't deserve motm.

3384~~~
feck all you haterz !)

3385~~~
Great strike, goal of the season for me. Even better than the Chelsea one.

3386~~~
Well deserved. Really like him.

3387~~~
Jesse he scores when it matters!

3388~~~
Can't believe he's not Scholes. Fantastic goal on fantastic occasion.

3389~~~
Not the best player in the world but just achieved a career defining moment.

3390~~~
Him being an ex-Brighton player must have made it hurt that much more for Palace <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3391~~~
Great moment for him. Dreams coming true

3392~~~
Come on bud don't dampen the mood.  Let's be happy he scored the winner.  I think most on here accept he'll be a squad player going forward.  I don't see many people saying "I told you so"

3393~~~
Incredible goal. He had a split second to react to that ball coming to him and to hit the ball like that is unbelieveable. Probably the best goal he'll ever score.

3394~~~
jesse ronaldinho ronaldo lingard van basten

3395~~~
An homegrown player who has been here since the age of 8 scoring a fecking ridiculous goal in a cup final. Incredible, incredible scenes!

3396~~~
Incredible match winning goal but still needs replacing next season.

3397~~~
Tidy player

3398~~~
I'm fecking happy for him. You deserve it Jesse!!

3399~~~
So happy for the lad!

3400~~~
Who'd ever thought he would score the winning goal in such fashion in a cup final. Well done to him and may he continue.

3401~~~
I am not his fan but today I wont say anything. Brilliant strike and won us the cup!

3402~~~
Shades of Cantona in '96! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3403~~~
No, I'll be honest I was happy for him, for all the stick I have given him this season I still like to see players from the youth sides play in the first team and get good moments. Bet you're buzzing mate <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>!

3404~~~
Seemed to shoot much better without any time to think about it. Hope he can build on that and improve his strike rate next year.

3405~~~
Now, he may  not be the first team quality we want. But he certainly justified LVG's faith in him despite all the abuses both got for it.

Couldn't have been better too as he is one of our youth academy players.

3406~~~
I've criticised him plenty this season.

But that was a sensational strike, fair play to him.

3407~~~
Brilliant strike, great squad player, comes on and does that. That's what most sane people have been arguing in this thread is that he's a squad player. 

I feel sorry for people who've gone against him all season, must surely not be able to enjoy that goal like the rest of us have.

3408~~~
Was my MOTM, he's a squad player but definitely has a role to play. Would always rather see him RW than Mata, offers far more in that position in my view.

3409~~~
We talk about the chances he's missed this season but his movement is improving and he took his goal real well. Great moment for the kid

3410~~~
Still am bud! And the news breaking about Jose has just topped me off.

3411~~~
Topped his own beauty against Chelski with that half screamer.

3412~~~
I will say it again, rather have someone from the academy as a squad player, rather than spending 20m odd for the same.

3413~~~
If he hadn't have been so shit from around March onwards, he could have found himself in the England squad.

3414~~~
Jesse Lingard scored the winning goal in an FA cup final. 

The fact that this sentence can now be written makes me very happy indeed. 

Followed him since he was the tiniest player I've seen in the U18's and whatever career he has in the future with us, this is just awesome and he totally deserves it.

3415~~~
Scored an important goal vs Chelsea
Assisted one vs Arsenal
Scored the winner in an FA cup final
Put in a top performance vs city

lingard is a big game player

3416~~~
Great goal, well pleased for him.

3417~~~
Take pride that a local lad scored a winner you utter miserable buggers. 

I'll never forget that goal. Unreal reflexes.

3418~~~
Top top goal. Happy for the lad.

3419~~~
What a beautiful moment. 

FA Cup final, extra time, down to ten men, hanging on, local lad, youth system, outside of the boot, goal.

3420~~~
Nothing but praise in here.

3421~~~
Made up for him. Whatever happens in his career from now on, he's scored the winner for his boyhood club in the FA Cup final.

3422~~~
He really should of started to be honest, but it all worked out in the end so who cares

3423~~~
Typical Lingard. van Persie-esque the way he's missed some better chances this season but come up with great finishes.

3424~~~
Brilliant strike for the goal, just pure instinct but he hit it and played well.

3425~~~
Incredible moment for him. Irrespective of what's to come in future years at the club for Lingard, that'll be a moment he can treasure for the rest of his life. Hard worker, and can rightfully be delighted in getting a big moment like that.

3426~~~
Of course I am delighted for a youth player to come through and strike that goal for the winner.  But let's be honest, he is never going to be a great player.

3427~~~
Well done Jesse, great strike
Given him a lot of stick over the last few months but he finally did something today

Doesn't change my opinion though

3428~~~
What. A. Hit.

3429~~~
Top class finish!

3430~~~
Brilliant strike. That was not an easy ball to hit, but the technique was impeccable.

He may be average, but that's what having a squad is all about. He can be our Darren Fletcher, putting in the performances when it matters.

3431~~~
He was just saving it up for a special occasion!

Great to have him on the pitch when we went down to ten men. His energy, tenacity and ability to float around and do a job in different areas really helped the team when it was most needed.

3432~~~
His cross for Carrick a few minutes before the goal was pretty tasty too.

Great substitute's appearance, delighted for the lad.

3433~~~
Oh yes, <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3434~~~
Look - nobody expected anything from this lad and he has come out and had a good season. Made us 3x more exciting after christmas, and from the local area. 

Mourinho means he has likely played his last significant game, but what a great story

3435~~~
Our Goal of the Season for us

3436~~~
within his first 20 premiersip appearances I think that's normal enough

3437~~~
YESS!! So so happy for him. I thought he was great when he came on today. Great movement and pace. and of course to top it off with scoring the bloody winning goal in the FA Cup.

Hope he continues to get minutes next season. Needs some competition for the right wing position as well. But Fa cup winning goal <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3438~~~
Great goal i burst out laughing when i realized it was Lingard. I've been a critic but fair play he won us the cup.

Yep that should be his role if he stays.

3439~~~
Haha yep I was cursing from the moment I saw him warming up. 

The goal was great though, a bit like Welbeck v City .. he didn't have loads of time to think about it, he just went on instinct

3440~~~
Chuffed for him & me <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3441~~~
Absolutely peach of a shot, the power and accuracy. Happy for him.

3442~~~
The technique in that shot was stunning.

3443~~~
Should have gone regardless, have more to offer than likes of Delph, Townsend etc.

3444~~~
He gets unfair criticism Jesse. Ok his final ball often lets him down. But I'm always impressed by his bravery that is he seems to always want the ball. Always looking to make himself available and generally working hard. Hoping actual goal and assist output will improve with experience. Then he'd be an excellent player for the squad. 

What a strike though.  What a way for him to win the cup.

3445~~~
Why do people feel the need to caveat any praise?

3446~~~
The guy has good instincts. He won't do much better than that for United. Well done.

3447~~~
I love Jesse, think people on here are overly harsh on him. When he came into the team along with rashford their energy transformed us and brought the best out of martial too, they all seem to love playing together.  Would certainly rather see Jesse in an attacking role than Rooney at the moment he's much more penetrative. 

Fantastic goal yesterday too gets better with every watch. Unbelievable tekkers <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3448~~~
Great goal, delighted for the lad. Far from good enough to be a regular starter for us, but good player to have in the squad. Hopefully he'll be happy with such role.

3449~~~
Very happy for him, been criticized harshly (sometimes deservedly) this season, but not many things better for a local lad than scoring an FA cup winning goal for your boyhood club. Hopefully he'll continue to mature and improve.

3450~~~
What are you jabbering on about last game? He's a hard working winger, which Mourinho will love. It's Depay who should be worrying. 

I don't think he should be a starter. But if he could improve his finishing he could be a decent player for us. He scores hard chances, but misses the easier chances.

3451~~~
I like him, he looks like Ping Ping.

3452~~~
Agreed, he's better than half the trash we're taking to France. Although, had he not been so quiet during that period, he would definitely be on the plane.

3453~~~
All he needs to do is start taking his chances. His moments good and he looked sharp when he came on. Took his goal real well but on his performances this season a squad player. He can produce more but that goal might be the making of him

3454~~~
I wanted him to come on before Mata scored, just knew he would score. What a superb goal that was, a homegrown player winning the FA Cup after this season is just perfect. Just makes it sweeter as a fan

3455~~~
Yeah I take your point there. Just think he'll be replaced with someone who has already played games and got the experience at another club. There are plenty of hard working wingers

3456~~~
He should be replaced as a starter though. We need a quality right winger. That doesn't mean Lingard shouldn't be in the squad.

3457~~~
Wonderful goal!

Does he look to have worked a bit on his physical attributes? He looks a fair bit faster than when the season started; he's actually capable of sprinting past players these days, and he also looks quite a bit stronger.

3458~~~
He really does <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3459~~~
I kept going on about that goal to one of my flatmates. What a strike. It's one of those balls you'd fire into the stands 9/10 times. To keep it down like that was incredibly. What a way to win the final for us.

3460~~~
What a strike! He certainly saved this one for the right time, as he's missed easier chances this season. Great finish, and worthy of a winner.

3461~~~
Really glad for him, Smalling got more abuse than he got praise for scoring the winner in the cup final.

Set up a great chance for Carrick too while we were down to 10 men.

3462~~~
We need to replace him as a starter, but I have no issues with him as a squad player. 
Great strike though and what a moment for him and the club, and LvG must feel proud as he kept playing him basically all the time.

3463~~~
Brilliant goal, I doubt he'll score one more important or better than that.

3464~~~
In the short time he was on I thought he was our best player.

It's unfortunate that some moments get lost if they don't lead to a goal. Rooney's run for the first is correctly applauded because it did. Lingards work to fashion the chance for Carrick is forgotten because Carrick didn't get the finishing touch right. That piece of play was very nice indeed.

3465~~~
Now he has had a huge moment he might relax and get a bit less rash in the final third which would be great because his link up play is good, his shooting and final ball is often too rushed. He could come back next season relaxed and more composed, I genuinely believe he will get 30 appearances for us next season.

3466~~~
under Mou, he will be our Ramirez

3467~~~
Moved it as it was a bit off topic there in the Blind/Mata thread (I do think Blind would make sense in Italy, slower, more tactical, he'd blossom). 

Lingard I think has not really shown any reason why he should not keep getting the chances at United. He's done better than pretty much everyone expected and I'm at a loss as to why he's not top 4 material. The kid's got heart and energy too. He's brought up by the club and he's impressed me pretty much most games he's played, making clever runs, linking up nicely and he's got goals. 

If Mata is a player who doesn't have the grit, the energy to press and work for the team, which Jose demands, Jesse is anything but.

3468~~~
You mean he ll make 2 footed challenges many times?

3469~~~
Yeah, I agree that he has heart and grit, and he can often look pretty decent. However, so do many players at lower tier clubs. I'm not saying he's rubbish, just nothing special, and I don't see the talent to be a top player. It's my opinion o course, and I've been wrong in the past, I just can't see it. He has a good shot sometimes, but I can't say much else about his actual talent.

3470~~~
Top 4 material? What is that exactly? Lingard is not world class, but even the best teams in the world have players who aren't in that category, because you can't have 25 world class players. We also won alot of titles with decent/average players under Fergie, players like Phil Neville, Butt, May, O'Shea etc. weren't "top 4 material" either, but they could still do the job.

3471~~~
I agree with this. He won't be at the club at this point in 12 months I don't think.

3472~~~
If he could put away some of the chances that he's missed this season hed actually be sat with really good figues. I think Mounrinho will like him actually because he's very hard working, holds his width and had great movement. His technical game is far from top class and vision is lacking abit but I still think he's young enough to improve in these aspects particularly under a coach like Mourinho. I think he could still be a big player for us next year and I hope he can continue to step up when needed.

3473~~~
no, why?

3474~~~
Frankly he has done for us more than some others like januzaj or Memphis and deserves a place in the team.

3475~~~
Won us a cup <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3476~~~
In the centre he is for the most part anonymous and shouldn't play there again, out wide he has played well at times and impressed but he had his bad games also (as did everyone else).

His role should be what it was in the cup final impact sub and rotation for smaller games. He's not nearly good enough to command a first team spot at United.

Having said that though i wouldn't be surprised to see him leave United in the next year or two. We have younger players with arguably more potential in Januzaj, Pereira and Depay, if one or more of them kick on under Mourinho Jesse could see his chances limited.

3477~~~
Having more potential dosnt make you a better player though, nor does it guarantee that you will become a better player

3478~~~
Scores the club a winner in a cup final and can't even get away for two weeks without people trying to sell him. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3479~~~
Januzaj had a good first year under Moyes. Then he vanished. We should also take into account that he dives when in a difficult situation and the referees didn 't see that in his first year.
Diving when thing are difficult means a lot to me.

Depay is the most stressed winger we 've seen in years. It 's a matter of bad management.
Pereira; I would like to see him as Mourinho 's apocalypse

3480~~~
FWIW I don't think Januzaj will be here this time next year and there is alot of question marks on Memphis at the moment to. If he carries on with the same attitude and work rate levels that he had this past season and even up until last week with the Holland NT then he will be out of the club by the end of this Summer.

3481~~~
Lingard scores one goal and suddenly the tables turn. Read 99 per cent of the comments (including my own, admittedly) from before the fa cup final and you'll arguably get a better impression of how people felt about him this season.

He went 15 games without a goal or an assist prior to the final and people were calling him Championship material. He was a first team, attacking player who contributed next to nothing in the most maligned offensive setup our team has seen for generations. For months on end he provided little but childish bus videos.

Yes he scored a great goal in the final but the amount of minutes he got on the pitch was unwarranted IMO.

I'm sure he'll care a great deal what I think, but Jesse if you're reading this you can get back in my good books if you stop dabbing and acting like a teenage buffoon.

3482~~~
IIRC he played there on about 4 occasions full game, think he was great against Man city there and brilliant the game after and anonymous the last time he played there but all the players were shit and we didnt rotate at all.. think it's his best position still, he had his best games for u21 England there. He's inconsitent dribbler from the wing and perhaps lacks a bit on top speed and that doesn't really matter from the middle. Hope he gets a chance or two there under Mourinho, if he tries Wayne there, Lingard deserves a chance as well as already offer more than rooney and could be a good option there for a more defensive setup

3483~~~
No obviously not thats why it's called potential.

3484~~~
He got a deserved chance in the final after a very promising debut season and scored an amazing goal when we were down to 10 men. 'nuff said!

3485~~~
What do you mean by this? As Mourniho's main man? 

I think Jose will have a lot to do just to play the youth who are already somewhat established in the first team. Pereira will really need to impress him during pre-season to get a sniff in.

3486~~~
In the centre may be his best position but it's not the best position for United to play him in simply because he's not good enough and never will be to focus a side around. The last few times he's played there he was completely ineffectual.

Also we will have to disagree on his performance levels, he's had some good games maybe even some very good ones but he's never been brilliant. 

I agree though he's not a winger which i think will ultimately lead to him moving on.

3487~~~
He was excellent on the left wing under Moyes, i think thats his best position.

But theres a reason he vanished Van Gaal came in and played 252 with wing backs and he barely got a look in his proper position, by the time we switched back to a formation with wingers he only gave him the odd chance on the right. Then he loaned him to Borussia at the start of this season he came back in January and only had like 2-3 5-10 minute sub appearances one of them at LB against Southampton.

Under those circumstances it's no wonder he hasn't kicked on. Van Gaal just didn't fancy him from the get go.

3488~~~
Very generous to Januzaj there.
His performance since Moyes left have not just been poor. They have been detrimental to the team, in how poor he has been.

3489~~~
That doesn't change what I said. Your definition of a very promising debut season is different from mine I suppose... the guy will be 24 later this year.

3490~~~
That is complete nonsense. In the two years under LVG he was largely innefective in his limited opportunities but he never hurt the team to the extent that Memphis did.

3491~~~
You think Lingard has been shit, but you think Januzaj should be cut some slack?
Then you have a pop at Memphis, who has done more in a year than Adnan has in two, arguably three years.

Coming from you, I will accept your criticism with pride.

3492~~~
You define debut season depending on age? That's silly. I define it as his first season in the senior team.

I don't want to get into Januzaj bashing too much because I like him too and hope he can turn it round but he faded before LVG even arrived.

3494~~~
How so?

Which part do you disagree with?

Everyone pretty much agrees he was very good under Moyes, when he played on the left wing.

And almost everyone agrees that he was poor under LVG when played anywhere but the left wing. Left wing back, right wing, no.10, up front even left back.

It's not rocket science, if Van Gaal had given him a run of games on the left wing he likely would have performed well there but he never got that chance. A common theme among creative players who take risks under Van Gaal.

3495~~~
This season isn't really Lingards first in senior football though. He's played the last two seasons in the championship which is obviously considered senior football also.

This is his first season in top flight football granted.

3496~~~
All our reserve players have played senior football in some form. This is his debut season for our senior team though is it not?

3497~~~
I would love Januzaj to succeed here, as I do with all graduates, but when he has been given the opportunity  (post debut season), he has been woeful. Not just failing to make notable contributions, but giving up possession cheaply and not pulling his weight defensively.
Whatever went on at BVB, he obviously didn't do enough to claim a place there either. That can't be laid at Louis' door, can it?

edit: Back to Jesse.
I hope he matures over the summer, and shakes off the 'apprentice' vibe he has been giving off. Provided of course, he gets his chances under Jose.
Reflecting on not making the Euros,  might help in that regard.

3498~~~
I never understood the Januzaj hype. Lingard.has.been better, still not.good.enough

3499~~~
Januzaj was brilliant under Moyes, he carried the team at times. Lingard has had some good games, but he hasn't done that yet.

3500~~~
An FA cup winning performance for a team with 10 men not good enough?
Januzaj must be some player!

3501~~~
He was invisible in the big games that season. He scored vs Sunderland Fulham Newcastle and all which isn't anything. Lingard scored vs Chelsea assisted vs Arsenal and scored a winner in an FA cup final.

3502~~~
Januzaj just has more flair, and his little flicks, and dribbling are fun to watch. Lingard is a 100x more effective player and with his workrate more likely to make it at the top level, fans often struggle to see those things.

3503~~~
holy god... these are two, perhaps three separate issues that you're taking a lot of liberties in your reasoning.

1. i believe, like anyone else who posts here, that i'm somewhat reasonable. while i'd like januzaj to make it, i don't really care if he doesn't. he's not bigger than the team, he's a piece of it and if his attitude/his skillset isn't at a level suitable enough for united, then he needs to go. i trust mourinho to get it right, even if it means januzaj is sold before he even kicks another ball for us. i'm not sure how much clearer i can be on this. however, my point with adnan is that he didn't get anywhere near enough opportunities under LVG to make the claim that he's suddenly rubbish.

2. i never said lingard is shit, i've said that that the amount of minutes/opportunities/starts he's been given is disproportional to the actual quality he's displayed. i've used the part where he had 15 matches before the fa cup final where he was anonymous and provided absolutely nothing in the form of offence (0 goals, 0 assits) as evidence of this. my argument is not that he shouldn't be a united player, it's that he did not deserve the amount of minutes he received. considering the near universal agreement of this statement in this thread prior to his goal in the FA cup final, i don't think my assessment is different than the majority of folks who post here.

3. depay has been given a lot of opportunities to succeed this season, and his abject displays have called into question whether he's even putting in the required effort. that issue has come up time and time again, this is not a new accusation i made. once again, he's played far, far more than januzaj and to somehow adequately compare their most recent season is pointless.

3504~~~
Yeah. Januzaj has the better talent undoubtedly but most managers would prefer a reliable player over a more talented inconsistent player. Which is why they sold mata and kept Oscar even though mata is more talented than him.

3505~~~
100x more effective player, eh?

your criticisms of januzaj could certainly be considered fair, but then it is at least equally so to suggest that lingard is the polar opposite and goes missing in the majority of games he plays. i believe he's been labelled "cowardly" more than a few times here too.

3506~~~
I'm not dismissing Lingard here, or arguing that Januzaj should start in his place. I agree that Lingard's workrate and composure are great assets, and that he probably deserves to start ahead of Adnan. But i don't think it's fair to dismiss Januzaj's role that year either, every United player was looking to pass the ball to him, expecting him to make something happen. He was a technical leader for us. Lingard has never been that, is all i'm saying. But he has other qualities. I don't see the point in bashing either one of them to make the other look good.

3507~~~
Lingard cowardly, he's always attacking driven gives his all for the team, and thinks as a team player, even if he isnt havin his best game he still has his use and is still very much involved in our play. Not that he does good things with the ball at all times.

3508~~~
1 Januzaj has had chances. If a player is that poor that it becomes a risk to play them, you really have to pick a moment to play them that doesn't cost the team.

2. Stats are not the only way to judge a player. We were much more fluid in attack, with Lingard in the team. He gives options and passes and moves well. He was also robbed of some assists by poor finishing. (One assist went to Fellaini when he fecked up and someone else scored)
3. Depay has been really disappointing,  but his impact on matches early in the season, compares equally, if not favourably to the sum total of Januzaj's past three years. If he has still produced nothing more in the next two years, then he will have matched Adnan's contributions. Surely he deserves the opportunity of two more years before we decide that Adnan is better.
Though I doubt he will be afforded that time. (And I doubt he should be.)

3509~~~
This pretty much, although I think Oscar too showed some genuine promise during "MaCaZar".

3510~~~
Yeah he was good, but what did he really produce in the end?

3511~~~
More than any other player in the team, which was still not a lot admittedly. But still.

3512~~~
He didnt do more than Welbeck, or Rooney still. Actually even RvP did more as well. Lingard has produced more in one season than Januzaj has had in his last three.

3513~~~
Fair enough. As i said, i'm not overlooking Lingard's contribution here, just underlying the leading influence Januzaj has had when trusted in his best position, which is not that common for a youngster. Rashford has showed that as well, but Lingard, while good, has never been that kind of focal point. He doesn't need to be though, as long as he contributes.

3514~~~
Well technically mate yes but by the same logic 2012-13 was Van Persie's debut season for our senior team. Extreme example i know but the point stands.

This is not Lingards first season at senior level, it's his third. Many times in this thread people will make a comment saying he's not exactly a youngster at 23/24 or he should be further along in his development at his age yadda yadda or something similar.

And while i'm not saying whether or not i agree with all that, quite often people will counter those posts with well this is only his first season at senior level, when in fact it isn't.

3515~~~
Promising young teenage player in having a poor second season shocker. 

He was played out of position, didn't play well was dropped confidence drops. Doesn't play again for another few games given another chance again out of position, perhaps even in a different position this time. Again doesn't set the world alight, dropped confidence falls further. Do you see where i'm going here mate?

Last season should have been the season where LVG really nurtured Januzaj to see if all that potential could be turned into a top player. But instead he shipped him out on loan and then froze him out of the first team on his return.

3516~~~
Winners grab the bull by the horns, they don't wallow in self-pity and sulk. Not saying he has, but he certainly hasn't done a good job of forcing his way into two different teams.

3517~~~
yeah I wonder what was the last time he got 90 minutes as a winger, probably was never under van Gaal, instead he tried to play him as an striker no10 or even b2b midfielder if he played him but he rather loaned him out anyway or didnt play him at all... very sad about adnan's development he was a bit unlucky with the loan and injuries but he didnt get a proper chance to prove himself, like that fluke boy from PSV who was picked numerous times in a row despite being bloody awful...

3518~~~
To be fair mate thats a one size fits all cliche that has been proven to be bullshit throughout history.

Plenty of great players have had difficult seasons early in their careers and had problems 'forcing' their way into teams. How did Henry do in Italy being played out of position, did he grab the bull by the horns?

Just one example of many over the years. Theres a good player in Januzaj he just needs the right manager to show faith in him and give him a run in his proper position, that man was obviously not Van Gaal who favours hard working risk averse players.

3519~~~
Probably never is right mate, certainly not on the left anyway. Van Gaals treatment of him has been pathetic to be honest, loaned out to sit on Dortmunds bench. Returns is brought on at fecking left back vs Southampton for 5-10 minutes and then isn't seen again until May for another 10 minute run around.

3520~~~
I assure you there are many more examples of bright young things that fade into obscurity.

3521~~~
Obviously but that doesn't mean Januzaj has to be one of them. Lets hope Jose gives the kid a proper run in the team in his proper position to prove himself before writing him off.

3522~~~
A more plausible explanation is that Januzaj may not have the work ethic or football brain required to complement his natural talent. He wouldn't be the first in that category and lets face it, if he can't make it under LvG, who gave about half a dozen other youth players a chance, then he almost certainly won't under Mourinho.

3523~~~
He gives certain youth players a chance yes but not all. Look at andreas pereira  another promising youngster given 1-2 appearances a few 10 minute cameos and then frozen out.

As i said earlier under LVG Januzaj as far as i know didn't get one full match in the position where he played so well for us under Moyes left wing.

And i agree i think he will find it just as difficult if not more so under Mourinho, but lets hope if Jose does play him that he is intelligent enough to recognize that Januzaj isn't a LB, or a right wing back, or a midfielder or a striker and just gives the guy a run on the left wing to see what he can do.

3524~~~
I can't believe I've come on the caf today and the two the goal scorers in an FA Cup final win are getting slated.

I don't know what more could be expected from Jesse in his first full season as a senior player at United. I reckon he's got 10 goals in him next season and he's only 23 as well, his peak as a footballer is still probably 4 or 5 years away.
