Not a thread about him on here, so I decided to make one.

What did you think about his debut? Didn't think he was that bad to be honest.

2~~~
Your username sums it up. Promising mind.

3~~~
He was solid, didn't commit many mistakes and stabilized us more compared to McNair.

4~~~
Didn't do anything wrong, didn't really do anything, not sure why he came on instead of Young in truth.

5~~~
Said in his thread in the main, a couple of mistakes around the 83rd minute but his willingness to take a chance and try to make interceptions was encouraging. most of our play went down the left so we didn't get too see what he is capable of higher up the pitch where he really excels. There was also one very good interception which kept play alive for Schweinsteigers blaze over which he should have done better with.

There was enough in that performence to persist with in my opinion. I am biased because I am a big fan of his but I honestly think there is a special right back in there.

6~~~
100% brilliant to see a right back playing right back.

7~~~
Way better then McNair was. Decent enough overall though. Clearly a youngster playing at the top level though, but I'd much rather see a real right back like him out there then McNair or Young even.

8~~~
Looked scared to go forward at times, but that was to be expected when you're thrown on at half time in such a finely balance game. Apart from one very careless pass, he did okay.

9~~~
I expected a bit more form him going forward as well but it was his first game, think he didnt want to make a mistake to be exposed much.. good debut for him though. Mata ahead of didnt gave him many posibilities to going forward.. let him start next game:-)

10~~~
I agree. We might have seen more from him if he had Lingard ahead of him and Memphis on the other side. We seemed to abandon the right wing for a lot of the game. You could probably give McNair the benefit of the doubt because of that too, as he had little support out wide, but he still made a go of it.

11~~~
Unsurprisingly raw. Also annoyed me the way he half jogged back for the ball in the last minute of injury time rather than running to get it back to the attack.

12~~~
Zarate sold him so easily before shooting straight at De Gea. Don't want him starting games right now, we have enough problems not scoring goals, don't need fullbacks getting so easily skinned by average wingers.

13~~~
Do you think he's one of the best in the world.

14~~~
I would play him next game, he looks like a RB, can't say the same about Paddy.

15~~~
Agreed on his performance. No Young was a bit weird, nice to see though but weird still especially when you're keeping Fellaini on the pitch, you'd fancy Young's crosses to meet that man's head.

16~~~
paddy mc nair is unfortunately not made to be a good right back he lacks any dribbling ability, he miscontrols the ball quite easily in these quick one twos and his finall ball is really inconsistent, its a big step up for Varela from the academy but apart the final balls and specifically crossing, hes much better in everything than McNair.

17~~~
Im glad he finally got his debut! The kid is a real talent

18~~~
That fella' Varela.

19~~~
You mean like Young.

20~~~
Was quite impressed with his debut. Looks like a solid prospect who has the skills to actually make it here.

21~~~
He's 22 and is not an academy product. That said, it was an excellent debut.

22~~~
He's got potential, he's a bit of a late bloomer like Lingard but has much more potential and is only slightly less polished. Could go on to be very good for us if he continues to get chances.

23~~~
Much more potential?Sorry but <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Different position though.

24~~~
Thought it was a good performance. Nothing fancy, but he didn't do much wrong either. And perhaps mostly importantly, Varela wasn't overawed by the occasion. Dunno about his long term prospects at the club, but he can be a good squad reserve for the position IMO. Sometimes the players who aren't expected to do well end up surprising us all, so it wouldn't be fair to discount his chances just yet. Provided he gets more opportunities to impress of course.

25~~~
It was hardly an excellent debut.. but he is a right back. And we need right backs. And he didnt do much wrong.
So I'd like to see him get more minutes. See if he can do the job for us.


Would be wonderful if he could step up.

26~~~
You can still compare potentials though. And yeah, if you'd have watched him for the reserves you'd know why I rate him highly.

27~~~
And if you watched the reserves you'd know why Lingard is rated highly. There is absolutely nothing to support such a claim that Varela has much more potential than Lingard.

You really can't compare potentials either as it is a completely made up unidentifiable attribute.

28~~~
And to accuse <a class="username" data-user="66946, @khoazany" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66946/">@khoazany</a> of all people of not watching the ressies ? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

29~~~
Darmian has hardly been that impressive of late so I am all for giving Varela some minutes to see what he's all about.

Did he put in any good crosses against West Ham? Darmian's crosses have been terrible (and then obviously when one cross came off there was no one in the box).

30~~~
he has surely bigger potential than Darmian, lets see if hes given run of games to prove himself.. will be also interesting who starts on the right against Germans, but I think its gonna be Young, he was decent at both fullback positions its a lesser risk than Varela atm IMO, Van Gaal would show guts if he started him

31~~~
I actually think we need Young more on the wings than in the full back position. Best combo would be to play Mata in the hole, Young on the right to cover for Varela and Memphis/Darmian on the left.

32~~~
Looked very raw for a 22yo, but maybe it was because he was nervous.

33~~~
Actually I tend to be a bit harsh for those who are not academy graduates though.Still Lingard has been too good for the reserves since long before Varela even arrived so I'm not sure how their reserves performances can be used to compare anything (they're about the same age).

34~~~
He had no idea what to do defensively. Not impressed. Better than McNair though. Can at least control a football

35~~~
Rubbish.

36~~~
He did ok but like McNair he is a very ordinary player who is only involved because we are so short defensively, I'm don't think either of them are genuine prospects but sometimes players do surprise you and they are at least going a chance, there will be much better youngsters who won't even get that.

37~~~
I hope to see more of him. I only watched him at the u20 world cup and he was good, very sound defensively.

38~~~
Rubbish 2.0

39~~~
I wonder how you came into that conclusion after his first 45 min ever at this level where he has been okayish.

40~~~
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><i><b>NOT CONVINCED.</b></i></span>

41~~~
There is the evidence of him being sent out on loan to Real Madrid B then them not wanting to buy him, nor did any other club persuade us to sell (or loan) him, despite few signs of United actually wanting to keep him (not on summer tour for instance). Most of the more talented United youngsters have a queue of clubs wanting to take them on loan. Varela signed a 5 year deal when he joined; surely United would expect to loan him out until they feel he is ready for first team action ? The fact that he is a 22 year old that until this week was very much an U21 player is not a good sign, especially given how weak the standard of football is at U21 level.

Personally I thought he looked ok both for the first team and whenever I've seen him play for the U21s but if you put all the evidence together, it does suggest he is a very ordinary player. His height is apparently 5'8 so really you would hope he would offer quite a lot going forwards, otherwise there is a danger the negatives dominate the positives.

Anyway, now he has some first team mins perhaps people (managers and coaches at other clubs) will view him differently.

42~~~
It's based on his career so far and he clearly isn't that highly rated at the club either because they we re prepared to sell him, he has had to wait for an injury crisis to get a chance and he was behind McNair who isn't even a right back. I said he did ok in the game but difference between that and being good enough to play regularly is massive, too many fans over rate players based on their performances in the reserves and the academy.

43~~~
Still they have a better stand to judge the player than someone watched sweet zero of them before his debut (not talking about you or Varela's case particularly since I don't rate him as high as some).Context needs to be taken.Too many fans expect the lads to already showcase all of their abilities in their first few appearances which is unrealistic.The step up is massive, much more than signings from other leagues like Memphis so sometimes we need to lower down expectation for them.For example Varela's strength is his abilities on the ball and offensive play but he show next to zero of them on that 45 min cameo.

44~~~
Starting tonight. Good luck to him.

45~~~
Huge game for his first Utd start. Hope he does well.

46~~~
A lot of managers and fans pay lip service in regards giving youth a chance but feck me LVG walks the walk..

47~~~
True that. Got to hand it to Louis, he's been brilliant with offering kids chances this season. Even if it's simply being on the bench, its a great experience for them.

48~~~
... because there's literally nobody else to choose from, to be fair. look at that bench!

49~~~
So Varela is now LVG's flavour of the month youth player? Talk about throwing him in at the deep end. 

Good luck lad!

50~~~
Just checked his wiki and I can't believe he's 23 in 3 months. I thought he was 17-18 when we signed him.

51~~~
Came to United as an 20 years old.Hardly "youth" in its usual meaning.

Would give credit to LVG for having a small squad though.Occasions like this would be more likely to happen than if you fill the squad with experienced backups, which will motivate the young players at the club a lot.

52~~~
That's partially deliberate though. LVG said he likes having a small squad and giving the youth at the club a chance when the depth gets tested.

53~~~
Wow.

54~~~
He reduced the squd because he wanted to give the young ones games. He still deserves credit.

55~~~
He could easily play Young at fullback as he has done before.

56~~~
I think we need the width.

57~~~
Which side would he be playing on? Can he play on the left? Their two best players are their LB and LW.

58~~~
Bold choice from LvG, I thought Young would start.

59~~~
Young would offer loads of width from fullback. 

He has played on both sides for the u21s but I'd imagine he'll be on the right with Darmian on the left.

60~~~
massive game for him, hope he does well on the right and will bomb forward to support "Hese", hes very capable of that but lets see if he stays back more often or not as it is only his first ever start for our senior team in such important game, I think we will see defensively solid and tidy performance rather than anything ultra special attacking wise, on the other hand we need goals so I think he will be urged to go forward so lets see:-)

61~~~
What a story if he manages to slot that RB position.

62~~~
I think he's had a decent half, pleased with him.

63~~~
Get him a new pair of boots though, falling all over the place. Getting isolated on the whole side of the pitch too, no CBs to be seen behind him.

64~~~
Reminds me of Rafa

65~~~
Really? Positionally he has been awful so far and nearly all their dangerous play has been down the left. On the plus side he seems to have a first touch which can't be said for all in the team at the moment.

66~~~
That was not a good half

Not existent going forward, falling about and bad positioning in defense.

67~~~
Yeah wasn't going to post as I didn't have much positive to say

But I will , thought he looked well out of his depth at times

But it's hardly a surprise

68~~~
I don't think his positioning has been that awful.He has been left alone in many occasions so far.A bit shaky yes but I think it's encouraging performance actually.

69~~~
Can cross, which is an anomaly for a United FB/winger these days. Doesn't look good doing anything else.

70~~~
He looks a pretty good tackler, something of a lost art and these days.

71~~~
Putting the result aside, he made a good showing for himself.

72~~~
Very good second half from him.Show a lot of energy needed and made some good tackles.

73~~~
Great second half, along with CBJ, making it all the more embarrassing for the more senior players.

74~~~
I was impressed. Yes he did fall over far too often but he performed with plenty of energy, especially in the 2nd half. Difficult to tell if his positioning was ok or not.

75~~~
My MOTM. I thought he was very good second half.

76~~~
Owen Hargreaves agreed with me. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Really good outing from him I felt, you could see his confidence on the ball growing as the game went on.

77~~~
He had some shocking positional moments today though.

Bailed out by poor schurrle finish once and 2nd time by a De Gea save of Lingard toe poke.

78~~~
Thought he got better as the game went on, hopefully he can establish himself

79~~~
The one and only positive from tonight. Very impressive performance considering what he had to deal with.

80~~~
Nailed on to start on Sat.

81~~~
Has serious energy. Could be an attacking threat down that side.

82~~~
Had a much better 2nd half

83~~~
Better than the last game and he's getting better with experience.. He and CBJ were our best players tonight

84~~~
Great determination from him and he looks good on the ball for sure.

85~~~
He doesn't look out of place at all, not sure why we've been so reluctant to throw him in there until now.

86~~~
Yes, a rb who can actually play football .

87~~~
hes like young Rafa, tenacious aggressive tackler good with the ball at his feet and prone to be found out out of position at times but if he plays he will iron that out and be a good player IMO, just needs time and trust and of course stay injury free unlike some one..

88~~~
Impressed with him today. Far better then playing McNair/Young at right back. Offers more going forward then Darmian as well.

89~~~
He seems to be a little stronger and have better defensive qualities than Rafa to be honest. Very impressed by him.

90~~~
To echo the sentiments of a fair few of you, I thought he was the best thing about tonight. Nailed on to play at the weekend.

91~~~
He did have a much better second half and I don't remember him being caught out positionally again, so fair play to him for rectifying that. Seems strong in the tackle and to have a good engine. Him and CBJ at least emerge with some credit tonight.

92~~~
Really grew into the game, some very solid tackles, alot of determination, and used right wing pretty well

93~~~
I want to see more of him. Putting in some pretty positive performances.

94~~~
Did pretty well. It is more than a bit odd he has not been involved before.

95~~~
Also looks a bit like Messi. So must be good.

96~~~
Man of the match for me, easily our best player tonight. He didn't put a foot wrong all game.

97~~~
He's that a square peg in a round hole.

That's his position. And with our current crisis, he should play.

Otherwise what's the bloody point? He's 22, not 16.

98~~~
I thought he was probably our best player. He was great in the second half too and seems to currently be ahead of Young.

99~~~
He was fantastic.

100~~~
He's looking solid. Definitely give him more chances in the future, he's earned it. Injuries look like they will force it to happen anyway, but I think he should get chances on merit.

101~~~
He's not physically at the level he should be for the PL and needs to work on his positioning. Great attacking fullback, but not the best defensively. Van Gaal likes his fullbacks to know to defend first and attack second.

Hope he gets to keep his place in the 1st team, like CBJ. Really stood out in the 2nd half

102~~~
Warrants a position ahead of Darmian.

103~~~
Uncanny.

104~~~
That's a good shout, I hadn't noticed before but that photo could easily be messi <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 

I thought he was fantastic tonight, showed real desire and energy, and most of all was brave enough to take the ball and attack, he rarely passed backwards which was great. Defensively got caught out once or twice but he was up against schurrle, definitely a step or two above who he usually plays against in the u21s.

Overall I think now with darmian injured he more than deserves a chance there, just will be interesting to see how he handles a different aerial threat against Bournemouth.

105~~~
His similarities to Rafael explain that imo. If van Gaal didn't like Rafael's style of play then he wouldn't favour Varela either. Injuries have forced his hand though Varela has done well to change his mind. We'll have to see how it goes for him in the future but he really isn't a van Gaal type of player.

106~~~
Jackson did very well too

107~~~
That's true.

108~~~
Tbh I was pleasantly surprised. Our saving grace from that defensive shambles was our GK and our two young FBs.

109~~~
Any idea how long is Smalling out for? To play him on even after his injury was extremely short sighted of VG.

110~~~
Thought he was very good and deserves a start.

111~~~
LVG did not know the length of his injury but said that the one's who got injured today will probably not going to make it for the Saturday's match.

112~~~
If it is only the one match, it is still not the worst situation.

113~~~
Seemed extremely exposed in the air, but that's not to say he didn't have a good game. I was impressed with him in the 2nd half.

114~~~
It was nice to see a fullback carry the ball out of defence with confidence. We've not seen that since Shaw was injured.

I'd have him in at right back for now, he looks eager to prove himself. No doubt that he will make mistakes but we will have to be patient. Darmian actually seems to be better on the left so it could work out quite well.

115~~~
He's fine physically. Stronger than he looks and he doesn't really look that slight to begin with, which, combined with his wonderful natural aggression, means that he's not likely to get bullied anytime soon. His positioning can at times leave a little something to be desired but hopefully that could be sorted through experience.

116~~~
Because if we did and he happened to have a less than stellar first game, the fans will moaning about LVG's tactics or accusing why spend money Darmian if you were going to play Varela.

117~~~
Premier League-based fans pay way too much attention to this 'bulking up' notion. You can appear to be skinny but if you have the low center of gravity and/or wide skeletal structure you will be a tough guy to bully. Then there's always mental side that is equally important to use it. Look at Memphis, looks like a tank and would be bullied by a fecking skeleton.

118~~~
looks good. I'd start him next match too

119~~~
Not bad at all, looked hungry. Hope he starts next match (but with our injuries that would be a pretty obvious thing to happen)

120~~~
he must have something, if Real wanted to sign him permanently. All the Spanish journos say Zidane is a big fan.

121~~~

122~~~
If we're being harsh he looks a calamitous defender. Not bad on the front foot but he makes really poor decisions otherwise.

123~~~
Yep, gets himself caught in some awful tangles and positions.

124~~~
The commentator keeps using a soft J when saying Guillermo and its pissing me off.

125~~~
So now we understand why we haven't seen him in 3 years.

126~~~
Shocking. Poor man's Blackett

127~~~
Really poor.

Looking more and more like a very limited full back.

128~~~
well hes from uruguay.. but hard to say how awkward it sounded, I didnt here it once 

his performance wasnt the best but you learn form mistakes, its only his first start in premier league, he will be much better palyer than blackett will ever be.. we just now have too many players who make mistakes - youngsters so its not an easy time for him to be getting into team..

129~~~
This transfer is looking more and more like Ritchie De Laet. Signed to make up numbers in reserves, injury crisis,  gets called up to first team to make up numbers.

130~~~
I thought he was a bit reckless with his challenges and appeared out of position a few times, though not sure McNair helped much.

Doesn't look like a LVG type player at all.

131~~~
His stats are showing clean sheets.

132~~~
Him and McNair were like a time bomb on the right side of our defense.

133~~~
Hes 22, playing pretty much with no experience next to him or ahead of him. We arent helping him at all, hes been thrown right into the mix and hes going to be erratic. No way he will be the complete article but sadly thats what we need right now.

134~~~
Feel for him, he has really been thrown in the deep end. I think he has performed well considering but from what Inhave seen, I don't see a future United player.

He is young and might develop but just don't get that vibe from what I've seen so far.

135~~~
He'll be fine if we can get a steady CB pair and a solid midfield 2 (not just Carrick with Fellaini given the license to roam)

He isnt ready. He can do his job, he can get forward.. But he has mistakes in him.
Having a better CB and a midfielder to help him out would be great.

136~~~
A lot of harsh criticism here.

137~~~
According to <span style="color: #000000"><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-a/esclusiva-tmw-genoa-si-tratta-varela-del-manchester-united-i-dettagli-785313" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000">Tuttomercatoweb</span></a> a deal as been agreed to loan him out to Genoa. Seems a strange one if true.</span>

138~~~
It's terrible how ready I am to believe this is true.

At any other club, in the midst of a defensive injury crisis, particularly one hitting fullbacks, you would immediately dismiss this rumour as nonsense. At United, you reluctantly shrug and think to yourself that it's probably true.

139~~~
What? He's our only remaining right back.

140~~~
Of course the timing if horrible due to the injuries but Varela really needs a good loan. He isn't going to get the time here and he is way too good for the u21s. He has a lot of potential but he needs the experience to see if he can handle the step up and due to his late start he doesn't have the time to be sitting around for a cup appearance or two.

141~~~

Friday will probably indicate whether that rumour is true and/or who will take his spot.

Edit: link of the rumour

143~~~
It says Van Gaal is blocking the move. If we bring in another fullback it could go through.

144~~~

145~~~
Who exactly agreed to the move in the first place? Woodward?

146~~~
I have doubts about the running of this club right now, but I can't believe this daft story with our injuries in that position.

Fair enough if it was a while ago there were discussions when we had fewer injuries, but they make it sound like it was some last minute dramatic call from LvG as it was going ahead.

147~~~

148~~~
He'll sign for Genoa on loan with an option to buy, apparently.

149~~~
He's soon to be 23 and has hardly played on a level higher than Segunda B.Sensible decision.

150~~~
So we are selling our only fit RB?

151~~~
...if you've got any fit full backs it might be.

152~~~
I'm talking about the decision from his camp.He clearly wanted to leave since the start of this season and we were holding him back because we might need him on some occasions.LVG obviously didn't like to see him leave but sometimes the player can push for the move and the manager has no choice.

153~~~
To the line-up prediction

154~~~
Wouldn't it be better to leave it until the end of the season. We are short of defenders.

155~~~
We (LVG) didn't want him to leave now.His camp pushed for the move.

156~~~
Think the club should have insisted.

157~~~
Sad to see him go, happy his career decisions.  Next up Andreas Pereira?

158~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

159~~~
Wouldn't blame him. Should be getting far more opportunities than he is, imo.

160~~~
And he must be annoyed at watching the far less talented Jesse Lingard getting games ahead of him.

161~~~
I remember saying Lingard was 23 and yet you defended him. 

Giving the excuse that he's a late developer.

162~~~
It's good for him,really, With every fullback at your club out injured and you're still being passed over as a youngster you know it's time to move on ASAP.

163~~~
I do think Varela will come good and he actually has the excuse of coming from a totally different environment and wasted a year trying to adapt to British football but I don't think he's fit with the PL either way.Small,offensive-oriented,technically good but might be positional suspected and weak physically is hardly a description for a PL fullback.

Anyway my point was about "his" decision not whether he's good enough or not if you read the other posts carefully.

164~~~
Was Zidane not saying he was a brilliant player and Real wanted him or something last season?

165~~~
He has every choice if the player is under contract and we are desperately light in the position in which he plays.

166~~~
He looks like a good player from what I have seen, but for him he needs regular first team football and he is not getting it here. Sign of the times at United lately tbh

167~~~
How exactly is Lingard far less talented than Varela? Complete tripe. Lingard has shown far more in his career than Varela has and it's not even close.

Zidane said that when asked questions by the Uruguayan media. He wasn't going to say Varela wasn't good enough was he now...

He's not clearly not good enough. Might go on to become a decent player but not someone we'll regret letting go

168~~~
I meant Lingard is less talented than Pereira, Which he is.

169~~~
Well, that makes more sense. Not sure I agree though but that's for a different thread I guess.

170~~~
Mystic Mike here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

171~~~
I don't mind Lingard as a young player will always need games to get better,  so there should be allowance for poor performances but it's when younger players are sacrificed for older players who do not offer anything good.

172~~~
Starting today <a class="username" data-user="66946, @khoazany" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66946/">@khoazany</a> is he really leaving?

173~~~
Can't be on the verge of a move if he's in the team. I had him in my line up and then removed him cause of the news.<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

174~~~
Same <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

175~~~
Januzaj was in the team then got loaned, Powell also may be going on loan after being in the team. Can't really predict what van Gaal is going to do

176~~~
Started pretty well, must be staying if he's playing.

177~~~
Think he's doing really well so far (36 mins) personally. Clever runs, keeping the width and measured stuff on the ball too. Cracking cross to Martial then.

178~~~
That touch on the ball from Smalling <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Been really good so far.

179~~~
Impressive half. Hopefully keeps it up.

180~~~
you mean that overhit pass, that was some control! shame he hasnt got spring of Rafael, he cant still be a great player in my view as his advantage over Rafa is better dribbling and he seems a better crosser as well, he wasnt tested much defensively so far on the highest level and like every new player to the senior game he will make mistakes, if he can cut it out, might come out as Rafa vol2.

I really liked his run through the middle from our half around 30th minute mark

181~~~
That run reminded me of Rafael and how we miss attacking fullbacks <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

182~~~
It's nice to see a player that hasn't been infected by the slow, zombie, careful football we've played over the last couple of years. 

He's actually positive. It's weird.

183~~~
Fantastic performance.

184~~~
Miles better then anything we've seen from Darmian for months.

185~~~
Did himself proud tonight. Could argue it's against slightly inferior opposition compared to premises teams, but he was good tonight.

186~~~
He was pretty good, should start our next match.

187~~~
Rafael-esque.

188~~~
He's actually pretty great. I don't think we need to be looking at more fullbacks this January, just have Varela and CBJ to fill in until the others get back.

189~~~
Van Gaal played Welbeck, Hernandez and Kagawa all before selling them.

190~~~
Thought he was good, as was CBJ on the other side. Would be a big mistake to sell him now.

191~~~
All we need now is dead ringers for Neymar and Ronaldo and we are all set.

192~~~
It really shows how much better we are as a team when we have a right back who actually makes supporting runs regularly.

Darmian needs to have a good look at himself after watching this, he goes hiding way too often and takes the easy option of staying back. 

I must admit in the reserves I didn't think varela showed that much, but every game his stamina and running has impressed me loads. He's not perfect by any means but right now he's number 1 for me. Arnautovic will be a tough challenge if he starts on Tuesday though

193~~~
Bugger. Hopefully tonight's performance has made him think twice if selling was his intention.

194~~~
We want more.

<span style="color: #ffffff">We won't get more?</span>

195~~~
yeah he's not let anyone down, either time he's been given an opportunity. Tidy player.

196~~~
Its only Derby and I'm not saying he is a better player but that was better than anything I've ever seen from Darmian here.

197~~~
To be fair Darmian looked much more comfortable when he was moved back to right back, he looked all at sea when at left back.

198~~~
Signed by Moyes too. Really weird.

199~~~
Great performance, surely that has earned him the chance to start against Stoke.

200~~~
Excellent today. Has to start every game.

201~~~
good performance today, even if it was against a poor championship side.

with darmian underperfoming and valencia injured it's worth holding onto him at least for now.
in which they took part in THAT game vs MK Dons.

202~~~
Thought he was off to Palermo.

Maybe not now.

203~~~
Excellent performance from the lad. Was presented with another chance to prove himself and did more than enough to keep his place in the team on Tuesday. 

Hopefully it puts any talk of him moving this month to an end.

204~~~
Would be idiotic to sell him now.

205~~~
Youthful exuberance probably helped him... and the fact that he didn't shit himself every time he crossed the halfway line.

206~~~
If he was 3 inches taller would be a really decent full back. No chance he goes on loan now.

207~~~
We were playing Derby don't forget, but yes I agree.

208~~~
now play him more games in a row to let him settle before we just write him off again..

209~~~
He should be taken seriously by the staff before he rightly packs his bags and leaves for lack of game time. Watch McNair start against Stoke next.

210~~~
Genoa wasnt it?

211~~~
Excellent performance. If his final touch was better in there half it would've been a perfect one.

212~~~
Reminds me of Rafael a bit.

213~~~
thats the spirit

214~~~
I won't, but I would be gutted if we sold Varela and had to start McNair at RB

215~~~
Sell him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

216~~~
He is exactly how <a class="username" data-user="66946, @khoazany" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66946/">@khoazany</a> described.

217~~~
Even if he leaves, I reckon he will have a very good career.

218~~~
Maybe I'm wrong but why the heck were the commentators pronouncing his name as Vareya. From my limited Spanish that would only be required if his name was Varella.

On his performance, I though it was very promising and loved his enthusiasm going forward it reminded me of Rafael at times.

219~~~
That's the reality of the club we're supporting now.

220~~~
Yes you are right.

221~~~
I was going to say Rafael 2.0, he's very similar.

222~~~
Absolutely. I was wondering all match how do they decide this pronunciation. It's hilarious.

223~~~
Was really impressed with him. Really positive in getting forward and won the ball back well
Reminds me of Heinze a bit today, but better going forward

Genoa can run along. I want to see him get a little run in the side

224~~~
Although I agree, Varela had an easier time of it tonight than Darmian does in the PL. Derby barely left their half so Varela didn't have an awful lot to worry about defensively.

225~~~
Heinze was excellent in the air. Varela is pretty redundant aerially usually. He doesn't have the natural spring like Heinze, Rafa or Evra. Nice little player though, great worker and decent all round. His vulnerability in the air is a major issue though. If he plays versus Arnoutovich against Stoke I think he'll have trouble. Well done to him tonight though, even if he doesn't make it at United he should have a very good career. He's been consistently excellent for our 21's and seems like a nice guy all round.

226~~~
Probably being harsh, but thought he should have reacted to the danger through the middle for their goal quicker and tried to cover the space Smalling left. Other than that, thought he played well.

227~~~
Hernandez played this season in the league as well before being sold.

228~~~
Maybe that look of thunder from Woody was the realisation of 'what the feck have I done?' when it dawned on him that GV is off for peanuts.

229~~~
Appreciated how involved he was going forward. Seemed to provide more cut & thrust than what Darmian has shown lately, but it was Derby. 

Maybe. Smalling got caught out a bit on that, as did Schneiderlin, while Blind lost that crucial header. Varela did come a bit late, but whole thing started with Smalling wandering out of the center. Not sure whether BoJack should've been there instead of Smalling chasing to the wing.

230~~~
Came in to say exactly that. Very similar style. Would like to see him tested a bit more in defense but he is miles ahead of Darmian in possession.

231~~~
and then he missed a penalty against club brugge and that was his last apperance for us.

232~~~
I haven't watched this game yet but I've been very impressed with what I've seen from Varela so far.

233~~~
Why would we sell him? We'd get peanuts for him and we have literally no other right backs.

Unless it means the return of McNair... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

234~~~
Decent performance, deserves a start next game

235~~~
Hes a right back, yeah? So youre telling me playing a natural RB in RB position works? 

Only took about four injuries for that to happen.

236~~~
Blind won his header.

237~~~
As SAF would say, he's got that South American aggressiveness. I echo the Rafael comparisons, he's very enthusiastic and zippy going forward -- although not as technically capable as Rafael. And yeah, a bit too frail and weak in the air.

238~~~
He was excellent last night, it's baffling that we're playing wingers at full back when we've got talented lads like him who can play there.

239~~~
Does he have the pace of Rafael? Never looked quite that fast to me.

240~~~
He's nothing like Rafael.

Okay, maybe from a football aspect he is, but I just feel no desire to ruffle his hair and give him a big hug

I loved those adorable little blighters. feck you Dave. feck you Louis.

241~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Even with the obvious bias from your username, that still made me laugh. Those 2 had that little scamp-ish quality about them.

242~~~
He had some good defensive moments but needs better quality going forward. Some very good headed clearances

243~~~

244~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He reminds me more of Messi (in the looks department) - Wait, our right back prospect is THE NEW MESSI !!!

245~~~
He looks like a polish version of Messi.

246~~~
I hope he stays and he should start the next game. Could be a great player for us. Exciting to see him.

247~~~
Just fear he's too small for when defending is the focus. Stick a striker on him and ping it to the back post from the right, would have a field day. 

That said, that was better than any other RB performance I can recall in the past 3 months. Maybe that says more about our team than Varela though.

248~~~
He's a dead ringer for Messi.

249~~~
Like him a lot, it would be madness to sell him given our injury crisis.

250~~~
Had a good game. Got forward really well and seemed really confident in possession. Guess he'll get a run of games now that Darmian, Young and Valencia are out. Needs to make it count like he did yesterday.

251~~~
Say goodbye to any future appearances, Guillermo. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

252~~~
He's a bit of an idiot, this was his big chance to make a good impression and he calls his manager difficult (even though it's true but probably a nicer way than saying stubborn cnut).

253~~~
honestly what's wrong with what he said there?

254~~~
Its an Uruguayan newspaper, probably lost in translation.

255~~~
Going forward he has that pass and move aspect to his game reminiscent of Evra. Little pass inside and a positive run forward expecting the return ball. Seems to have a good tenacity about him

256~~~
He reminds me so much of Rafael.

257~~~
His rating for the game is higher than I expected, thought he was a bit too rash at times, needs to calm down a bit.

258~~~
An improvement on Love, glad he's back.

259~~~
He's good enough to be a member of our squad going foward. Would be wrong to sell him IMO.

260~~~
He deserves a place in the squad as a back up RB, he's really impressed me.

261~~~
I like Varela, whether he will improve enough to ever be a first team regular I'm not sure about. He's certainly got a lot of promise.

262~~~
He's fine as a squad member. He's done no worse than sadly Darmian has done in the majority of his appearances.

263~~~
Manchester United defender Guillermo Varela was not allowed to leave the club in January because he was told by Louis van Gaal he was going to play.

The 22-year-old full-back, who has made five starts this season, has revealed that the Dutch boss blocked his exit from the club because he wanted to play Varela in the first team.

Varela was heavily linked with a loan move to Italian side Genoa last month.

And the Uruguayan, who arrived from Penarol in 2013, says he was considering a move in order to play regularly.

<b>“Because I saw I wouldn’t play, I would have few chances,” he told Uruguayan radio station <i>Sport 890</i>. “I spoke to the manager and he told me that no, I couldn’t go, because I was going to play”.

“Everything happened so quickly that you don’t believe that you’re playing in the most important league in the world. I take it calmly, training and looking forward.”</b>

Varela has made one start since the end of the transfer window – the 3-0 win over Shrewsbury in the FA Cup.

264~~~
Let's hope VG actually rates him and hasn't told him to stay purely for filling out the squad. 

Hope he gets more chances, he's shown enough promise to potentially be a good player.

265~~~
His loan to the Real Madrid Castilla last season seems to have been beneficial for him. I think he looks a decent enough player so far.

266~~~
Aside from Rashford's goals this lad has been my MOTM. He's been brilliant, everywhere on the pitch as well.

267~~~
Has been brilliant. Deserves a run of games to see if he could become our first choice RB from a relatively quiet start e.g. Hector Bellerin at Arsenal.

268~~~
Has played very well today.

269~~~
Been very good today, I like him.

270~~~
Been impressed by him again today, has rarely had a bad game since coming into the team.

271~~~
Love the kid, genuinely looks like he can make it here.

It's obvious Memphis is MOTM but he's in second.

272~~~
Brilliant tonight. A very tidy little footballer.

273~~~
He was everywhere tonight! Reminds me of Alves at Barca in how he comes infield to try and get the ball. Obviously not saying he's as good as him.

274~~~
Really growing to like this guy.

275~~~
As someone above said, he's Rafael MK II, hopefully stays away from injuries.

All of sudden, we seem to have incredible depth at the FB position. He and Riley were outstanding tonight.

276~~~
Varela is brilliant, and on both of their seasons, Darmian hasn't done enough to dismiss the threat from him. From his debut against Wolfsburg, he has been largely excellent.

That said, with Valencia back soon, will be interesting to see where he is in the queue.

277~~~
Between him and Darmian we have a couple of specialist right backs since God knows when. Even when we had Neville we did not have a proper back up.

278~~~
I thought the same as well, great going forward, aggressive, and when we were losing kept trying to drive forward

279~~~
He's good going forward but his problem comes defensively usually.

280~~~
Hopefully he will keep his place against Arsenal.

281~~~
This guy deserves some love in this forum!

282~~~
Did an extremely horny job on both of Rashford's goals

283~~~
I've liked him every time he's played, certainly looks like a good player

284~~~
I'm convinced he's never had a bad game and anyone who disagrees is a liar.

285~~~
Give him a new contract

286~~~
I was thinking this. He has looked a-bit average in some games but has he genuinely had a poor game  so far?

287~~~
I am possibly his biggest fan on here and even I will tell you that he was poor against Bournemouth but there were obviously cracks appearing in our defence even at that point in terms of injuries so it was to be expected but Wolfsburg, Derby, Shrews and tonight he has been class.

288~~~
Do we really have to thank Moyes for him? Can we just not.

289~~~
Very good performance, he's got some great footwork to go with his pace, obviously he didn't have a lot to do defensively but in attack he was class, the type of fullback you need when playing with inverted wide forwards.

290~~~
No, he was signed right after Moyesy joined so he must have been in the pipeline already - no credit to the Chosen One at all!

291~~~
Yeah, the two youngsters at FB were definitely bombing forward pell mell, but I was really impressed with Varela's assist on Rashford's 2nd goal. Took out all of the defenders with his pass. 

Darmian is definitely a better defender, but Varela seems to offer more on the other end. If LVG's philosophy is really to control the ball & attack, then Varela should be the one, as we'd be more likely to be on the other end of the pitch and not having to worry so much on defense. But will LVG really gamble that much? Doubt it. Maybe horses for courses and have Varela start for specific teams.

292~~~
Got a little bit of Messi about him looks wise.

293~~~
Has done as well as he could in his first team career so far!  Has earned himself a slot in the first team squad next year as back up to Valencia ans Darmian at right back.

294~~~
LIAR!

295~~~
I've been rumbled. He was world class against Bournemouth and shite for the rest of them. ESPECIALLY tonight. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

296~~~
I just don't understand why we haven't trusted him earlier. Hopefully he continues like that. He looks confident and plays well.

297~~~
We were really close to selling him too weren't we?

298~~~
I think so.

299~~~
Unsung hero for us tonight. Absolutely monster game going forward and not too shabby defensively as well.

300~~~
I prefer him to Darmian

301~~~
Really like him, didnt know he was that good on the ball, just thought he was quick eith a decent engine. Hope he keeps his place for now.

302~~~
Story on here is a page or so back but Genoa wanted him on loan, when Varela's camp approached van Gaal with it he said no as he was going to play. So an offer was there but it wasn't close to getting off the ground.

303~~~
I've always liked his attacking stuff, but it's the defensive side of his game that I'm uncertain on. But considering nobody else has laid a proper claim on it, he's got a good chance to lock down that right back spot if he keeps playing well like that.

304~~~
Excellent performance. Love his attitude.

305~~~
FWIW their best player (one who is being scouted by a few top clubs) was up against him and he only got involved when he moved away from Varela.

306~~~
Great tonight. Zidane has said he's the real deal so must be true.

307~~~
Would like to see Riley getting a go at RB too maybe.

308~~~
From what I recall he was the forgotten man at OT and his departure began to look inevitable. He turns 23 in a month, hopefully he can keep improving.

309~~~
I think there were rumours about selling him, when he returned from Madrid. That's what I was thinking of.

310~~~
Ah, I know there was some paper talk but nothing serious looked on I think.

311~~~
yep, me too

312~~~
Me three.

Looked great again tonight. Loving his intent to get forward. Something Darmian sorely misses.

313~~~
How we've handled him is nonetheless puzzling, hopefully the penny's dropped.

314~~~
Madrid had a buyout on him which they didn't take up IIRC.

315~~~
Thought he was tremendous. Did very well against Sisto and was brilliant in our attacking play.

316~~~
Has been very good everytime I've seem him.

317~~~
Has about of Rafael about him. Love it. Makes me miss Rafa as well, but great to see a right back attacking like he has been.

318~~~
He's so much more composed on the ball than darmian, he keeps the ball close in tight areas which allows him to move much better in small space. Darmian hasn't figured that part of the game out well yet which is important.

I love his enthusiasm to get forward too, it's take a touch, forward pass and then overlap or move higher up the pitch.

Yes individually he's never going to be the best defender in the world, but a good attacking outlet is even more important for us at times, and he's certainly the best, even better than Valencia arguably.

319~~~
Didn't realize he was that old.  Not a proper kid then?!

320~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/ea8n" width="560"></iframe>

Outstanding assist.

321~~~
Which is why most people on here began to write him off. It is really now or never for Varela. If he finds himself in a substitute position next year when he turns 24 it's difficult to see him staying here tbh.

322~~~
Depends on what he wants?  As cover for Valencia ans Darmian at RB, he has a role.  Valencia only has a season or 2 left anyway.  

He could get 10-15 games like that if he can perform

323~~~
I said it like two years ago but he never looked like he was gonna get a chance. He's better runner with the ball though, looks very direct, just need to add a bit of defensive stabilit to his game but Rafael was a bit hit and miss in his early games as well.. Lingard racking back helps him a lot too. Happy for the lad, he has defo better potential than Darmian. We need to play him as much as possible he will iron out some of his positioning mistakes as time goes but never on the bench

324~~~
A great performance from him today. He deserves more game time and I was screaming this earlier i n the season. The bad thing is that I Valencia will probably come back and take his place, annoyingly. 

But he needs to keep this up and I would prefer him playing over Valencia or even Young when he comes back.

325~~~
At that point I'd rather see us invest in a younger player though. Still too early to say, but I really think this season will determine his future here.

326~~~
Thought he was really good tonight. Deserves a run in the side. Don't think I've seen a bad performance from him yet.

327~~~
Nah, I'd rather we got Darmian, Jones, Valencia or even young back asap.  Can't belive we are forced into playing 5th choice right back!!!!

328~~~
I like Darmian a lot, but Varela is a much more dynamic player than him and better suited to a system with inverted wingers. 

Hope he can push on and add some defensive nous to his game  .

329~~~
He was terrific tonight.

330~~~
He's a very entertaining player. Real live wire.

331~~~
You call him a fifth choice right back after listing 3 makeshift right backs? That's not how it works.

He should be behind Darmian really, even vying for his place. He's a ready made replacement, extremely talented and comfortable on the ball, looks defensively sound for the most part and clearly contributes in attack.

332~~~
Sure but as LVG has proven many times already, he does not care about age or reputation... So why has Valera not played before now when Valencia and Young both got game time at right back?

333~~~
I'd say he's now earned the right to be fighting for the spot with Darmian. Which is great. I like them both.

Disappointing season for Manchester United Football Club, great year for Manchester United Fullbacks Ltd.

334~~~
Very good performance. Nice to have fullbacks threatening the opposition so much.

335~~~
Cover for Valencia? He's arguably put in better performances than both him and Darmian. I'd put him ahead of Valencia at this stage.

336~~~
Really liked the look of him. He could be a good back up to Darmian or who knows make the place his. That will help Valencia move up and not play defense. Had some good marauding runs too.

337~~~
Isn't he a Moyes signing?

338~~~
What strikes me more than anything is how confident he while in possession. He doesn't rush & comes across as mature than several other players his age. Really looking forward to him in action more often.

339~~~
The only complaint I have against him is that his first touch can let him down at times - which was less evident of him today. Otherwise, I think he's been good - definitely works hard for the team and I hope he continues to get chances.

340~~~
I believe he was the first Moyesian signing.  He had a rough go on the personal front and then maybe a bad injury slowed him down. But here he is now and he's looked very good on the few chances he's been given.  

We're going to have a Darmian v Varela debate and based on what we've seen so far of both Varela offers more than Darmian.  But let's see how he acquits himself over the next few months while Darmian is out.

341~~~
why would he be backup to Darmian? because he didnt cost 13million? bullshit, its easy to see that he's better talent than him, needs work on his first touch and balance in attacking/defensive positioning, sometimes he's too aggressive but Rafael was also like that and he became a great defender after playing decent amount of games. Darmian is just shocking going forward, lacks any kind of speed, you can say that he is defensively quite sound but he was skinned many times as well like against Arsenal. I dont see any reason why the Italian should start ahead of Varela, modern fullbacks should be able to overlap and have good ability on the ball. Also Varela seemed very good defensively for U21, just needs to adjust his game to higher tempo in intensity in the premier league and he will come good. Darmian is just average player and Tony V is halfway gone bt wouldnt mind him as RB backup for a while, not sure as winger, Pereira coud do well there as false winger, certainly has better mobility than Mata who is a similar player but slower and less mobile than him..

342~~~
he doesnt but he just likes some players more than others ie Fellaini, Rooney, Blackett inclusions, it was also a big risk to put in an unproven player unless everybody is injured. Its not like Rashford got his chance ahead of Martial/Rooney/Keane because Vangle rates him higher... In a sense these injuries helped to open eyes of the manager and to us as well. Nobody really cared about Varela until they got their chance and showed they are more than capable until now they were quite overrated youngsters from our academy who should never be given chance over proven players like Darmian..

343~~~
I did mention that he could make his place his own. On current form and performances, I have no doubt that he should be starting ahead of Darmian. Let Darmian rotate when Varela needs to be rested, provided Varela can continue his good run and become consistent.

344~~~
Aye, he along with Lingard did a great job of closing him down the second he got the ball. They were both up his ass, kicking at his heels and he didn't get an inch. Was fantastic play by the pair of them.

So happy he has finally got a chance and he has brought his u21 performances straight into the first team. He isn't the strongest and struggles in the air but so does the vast majority of fullbacks. He is a great tackler though and has great pace. He can be caught out of position at times but again what fullback isn't? Darmian and Valencia certainly are. There is also the added bonus of him actually offering something going forward. Something actually good too, he is direct and quickens the play making loads of space for himself and the rest of the team. He has show in the u21s and now in the first team to have quite a good delivery on him as well. I just hope he continues to get to play at least against weaker teams once Valencia is back.

345~~~
I hope he stays and is part of the squad from now on, certainly has more potential than Darmian for me.

346~~~
Very good in tight space and mobile. That's a good start for a fullback. Defensively, I think he's a bit lost at times but considering his inexperience, that's certainly not a dealbreaker yet. 

Darmian and Varela competing at RB, Shaw and a variety of backups (Rojo, Blind, CBJ) at LB. Sign players elsewhere.

347~~~
If he continues in the same vein you can see him becoming a real fan favourite.

348~~~
<span style="font-size: 10px">Spot on observation. Can't believe how so many </span>people are panning Lingard's performance, ignoring this aspect of his play. Memphis was MOTM but plenty of threat came from the right whilst we nullified them on that side for most of the game. Guillermo and Jesse deserve credit for that.

349~~~
I've been really keen on finding a negative in his past few performances and I can't pinpoint something massive. He's quick af

350~~~
Going forward he's been excellent but he needs to become more solid at the back defending

351~~~
I've been advocating him getting a chance since his first year with us, and have always found it strange how long it has taken for him to be involved. After a few shaky months, he was excellent for the 21s even in his first season, and with Rafael injured at times, I kept assuming it was only natural for him to play, but he never did. I recall Phil Neville name-checking him once, but nothing came of it - but it was clear he was a first team player to me.

He also cost us nearly £3m, so I always thought that we signed him to play him anyway. His journey to the first-team has been odd. I mean, signed for relatively big money, impresses in reserves, then loaned to fecking Real Madrid (not Scunthorpe!) all before his debut.

And despite him being slight, he's also an excellent defender, and will only get better at it. He's so tenacious, and has been amongst our best defenders in all of his games. Against Wolfsburg particularly, he bailed us out many times, and won many tackles.

352~~~
Didn't realise he was 23 either. Still pretty young for a defender, though.

Our full back options are suddenly looking healthy:

Shaw
Borthwick-Jackson
Rojo
Riley

Darmian
Varela
Riley

There's not much call for playing Young or Valencia there anymore imo.

353~~~
He and Shaw make our flanks for the future look brilliant, what I did like was how he and Lingard were closing down so well. Bodes well for the Arsenal game if they can do that again against Sanchez who tore Darmain a new one last time with no defensive support from Mata.

354~~~
Yeah, it'll be nice to see the right side playing with such a high defensive work rate.

355~~~
Yeah, Lingard helped Varela out a fair bit, but Varela also helped Jesse out going forward as well. A good understanding there already.

I really like Riley as well though and since he's naturally a right sided player then it makes sense to give him a go at RB as well when Darmian & Varela are out. He may even out-do both as he impressed me the most last night & looks to have huge potential.

356~~~
They didn't.

357~~~
His willingness to charge forward, for me, drove us on. Bar Shaw, our full backs have been crap going forward, but he and Riley looked determined to drive forward, and with quality, too.

I do think that the fact that we have so many injuries allows our youngsters to play without the fear of being dropped.

358~~~
He's actually got a touch of Bellerin about him. Not quite <i>that</i> fast, but very quick nonetheless, with the same deft touch and decisive forward forays. Needs to slightly shift the balance back towards defending, but what young fullback doesn't? Well, Shaw, but he's the exception that proves the rule.

And CBJ.

359~~~
I like him, I think he can be a bit suspect defensively but I love his willingness and confidence to get forward. So yeah I like him, a lot actually.

360~~~
I'm really hoping he gets more chances and becomes a part of the team in the long run, even if only as a squad player.

361~~~
Huge game for him, will be up against Sanchez. Let's hope he'll deal with it better than Darmian did.

362~~~
Daft early yellow to get but he's been good since. The cross was fantastic and he did extremely well to keep the ball in for the second.

363~~~
He's dodgy like Rafa was but is the best crosser of the ball we've had at right back since I can recall

364~~~
Worried by the yellow. 2nd half will be seriously under pressure with Arsenal pressing for it.

Superb cross though. Absolute peach.

365~~~
Very typical modern fullback. Good on the ball, good offensive instinct, but shaky in defense.

366~~~
This attacking fullback lark is quite good isn't it.

367~~~
Completely fell asleep for the Monreal chance too. He goes walkabouts quite a bit and really isn't a good enough defender but you've gotta love his confidence in possession. Makes a real difference to our attacking play.

368~~~
Very good going forward. Need to work on his defensive side of the game.

369~~~
Great assist but he gets drawn out to easily for the overlap when they attack.

370~~~
Yeah he's defensively poor but he's good going forward.

The thing is Darmian has hardly been solid defensively either.

371~~~
Very impressed with him going forward but needs to improve defensively. He's still young so plenty of time to improve his defensive game.

372~~~
he's dodgy as Rafa in the beginning, who managed to become one of the most solid defenders in the team so I have hopes in Varela who reminds me of the Brasilian a lot, believe he can iron out his positioning mistakes..

373~~~
His positioning has been awful. He keeps getting exposed by Arsenal.

But on the other hand his cross for the first goal was superb, and he had a hand in the second as well.

374~~~
rafa impoved positionally of course, but always seemed to have a problem giving away fouls and cards etc.

375~~~
Hes still young and is already performing at a good level. 

With a bit more experience, Im sure he will be able to improve his defensive game. 

One defo for the future. Thanks Chosen One.

376~~~
He wasn't a Moyes purchase.

377~~~
his was an aggressive fullback who liked to get the ball before the ball even got to the defender, it always worked against world class players like Bale, Hazard or Ronaldo.. it will always be a problem when you let them space to attack you. Rafael in the end the perfect balance, when to step out and when to stay on the back of his defenders, fouls and cards are part of the game of today's fullback. I hope Varela can find that balance too, he showed he's good enough defensively for U21 so perhaps its the tempo and intensity he struggles with now..

378~~~
He's looked very good.

Really didn't think he had this in him. Delighted to be proven wrong.

379~~~
He's quality. Our best right back.

380~~~
Great to have Messi playing right back.

381~~~
Not impressed with him at all to be honest.

382~~~
Good match today. Was a bit scared with that early yellow though.

383~~~
Promising at times, but very rash as well.

384~~~
War hero

385~~~
I'm pretty sure he was.

386~~~
Did very well considering he got booked early. He reminds me so much of Rafael.

387~~~
That flick and pass to Mata in the corner. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Cheeky fecker you are.

388~~~
I love him. Reminds me of Rafael, with all the good and bad that that entails.

389~~~
He was bought the day after Moyes joined the club, obviously he was someone who United planned on getting beforehand instead of Moyes' decision.

390~~~
Fantastic performance from him, sure, there were some mistakes by him but he's my second MOTM after Rashford today. Early yellow and then played it by the book, bailed out other defenders plenty times today. He's had absulutely <b>zero</b> support in defending in the first half as well, he was left with Monreal + whoever was coming to his side most of the time.

391~~~
Beast of pace and honestly could be even a proper back up player for Mourinho.

392~~~
He was bought in the same few days that Moyes came in. Moyes had absolutely nothing to do with his purchase.

This guy is the real deal. Not the best defensively but he's fast, agile, technically fantastic, reads the game well offensively and crosses a fantastic ball.

393~~~
Was worried after the early yellow but I thought he did very well after that. Involved in a couple goals as well.

394~~~
How can you not love this guy?

395~~~
I thought it was a very mature performance today. Had Sanchez in his pocket.  He supported the attack well and was solid at the back.

396~~~
Good game from him today, needed him to stay on the pitch and he did that, can't really ask for more in this context.

397~~~
I worried for him when he got booked so early on. Very good performance today

398~~~
He is as good as rafael imo.

Very good game apart from the rugby tackle

399~~~
He was fantastic today.

400~~~
Got too tight early on and made a mistake, apart from that he was very good. We hardly saw Sanchez all game and that was because of him. 

He's really grown and shown himself he can handle the big players. This season has been awful for a lot of reasons, but fantastic in the sense we've blooded so many young players. You've got to be really proud.

401~~~
Started shaky, but he really grew into the game.. Very happy with how he's been improving week to week

402~~~
Thought he was very good today.

403~~~
Was very good again. Against fecking Sanchez too.

So composed with his crossing and a great engine.

404~~~
Makes me miss Rafael in all honesty. Thought it was weird how everyone turned on him when he left.

Still, he's look promising. If he can get close to what Rafael gave us but stay injury free that will be fantastic news for us.

405~~~
Idiotic booking in the first 10 mins but superb after that. Beginning to look a real threat going forwards now. Not really a surprise when we score from one of his crosses.

406~~~
Possibly the most bizarre post in the whole match thread. Which is saying something.

407~~~
Reminded me of Rafael against Chelsea last season. Booked early and brilliant for the rest of the game. Second half was a tremendous effort.

408~~~
had a mare for 15 mins, then asserted himself, massive contributor down that right.

409~~~
His defending was okay in the second half, but I still think he has a lot to learn. 

That said, he's a good sight better than when he first came to United. He's developing, and his attacking gifts made him worth a second look after nearly leaving United.

410~~~
Just fantastic today. Really enjoyed watching him.

411~~~
How he survived after that early yellow? Super stuff from the lad today

412~~~
I don't get why people think he's rash. He's just quite aggressive and proactive in his defending. The fact that he survived almost an entire game on a yellow against Alexis Sanchez without too much trouble, shows how disciplined he is.

413~~~
This lads a player. Definitely think he's going to make it.

414~~~
I think he looks pretty excellent. He plays with passion which is great to see. His stupid early booking was the only negative today.

415~~~
He can cross the ball very well. Something we haven't had in ages from the right back position. The cross which lead to the first goal was perfect.

416~~~
Looks brilliant - I'd have him as first choice right back.

417~~~
This guy can play. Has pace, can dribble, and has a wicked cross on him. All the attributes you want in a fullback.

418~~~
He's the real deal.

419~~~
Involved in the first 2 goals and really improved defensively in the second half, pleased with him.

420~~~
After that stupid yellow and playing Moneeal through - I was convinced he was going to get sent off. I could not be more wrong as he turned things around and was excellent. Really takes something to keep Sanchez quiet like that. Brilliant

421~~~
He keeps passing these tests, today was a big one and he did excellent.

422~~~
Aggressive, confident and played with steel nerves. Compare that to Darmain who had a mare against Sanchez.

423~~~
We're set at right back.  Darmian will be excellent cover for Varela.

424~~~
Was worried when he got booked so early, but he was superb. Great delivery on him, too.

425~~~
Was asleep on the Monreal chance early on but after that his concentration was good, he was busy defensively and made good use of the ball in support of the attacks. That first time cross that led to the first goal was lovely.

426~~~
Yet another young player put in at all full back with Duke Nukem-esque balls of steel.

I don't know what we serve with the Weetabix we give them pre-game but I'd like to.

427~~~
Fantastic energy. Great performance considering he was on a booking for almost the whole game.

428~~~
Outstanding so far. I'm really loving him and it's just overall amazing to see him play so well.

429~~~
Has a future here. Really like him but still feel he can sharpen up defensively. Very Rafael-esque.

430~~~
He's been very good, he's so exciting when he goes forward and his cross for the first goal was sublime.

Anyone notice Sanchez played today? Other then his diving and bitching of course.

431~~~
I have a feeling that he's a third Da Silva. Just so lovable and good going forward.

432~~~
Looking a very good player. Was worried after the early booking, as i remember Sanchez tearing Darmian to shreds earlier this year. But he handled himself very well. Good to have a RB who can overlap and cross agian.

433~~~
Incredibly impressive the way he dealt with Sanchez all game after being on a yellow after 8 minutes. Not only that, but bombed forward all game too. Can see why real Madrid liked him last season now, has plenty of talent.

434~~~
What a professional performance from the guy. Seems comfortable going forwards and backwards and seems to have the confidence to take on stronger, bigger guys. Well done.

435~~~
And to think, the only reason he's still here is because Madrid didnt want him.

Thank goodness.

436~~~
Loved his performance today. I know Rashford will grab the headlines but for me this lad had more to do in the game and did most of it to a very high level.. I love his little step overs when he gets put under pressure and he always looks to play his way out instead of going back all the time. His crossing is really good and just has a very natural attacking instinct.

437~~~
Our #2 shirt is still available.

438~~~
Agreed was brilliant today and has played well at times this season but this showed he really can cut it at the top level.

439~~~
Cant believe Madrid sent this player back to us. They really dont have an eye for non established players...

440~~~
Very impressed with him when he has the ball. I just hope that he can develop his defensive game enough to make the spot his own.

441~~~
This kid looks great, he could easily keep his place in the team when Darmian comes back, and if he kicks on until the end of season it's surely the end for Valencia.

442~~~
Got very nervous after that early yellow card but he was a wonderful attacking threat all game. Well in Moyesy!

443~~~
Showed a lot of maturity to manage his flank after a silly early card.

Deserves to keep his place ongoing.

444~~~
Impressed with him. That was a tremendous ball in for Rashfords first. I know it reached Rashford indirectly but it was the sort of whipped in ball just asking for a touch towards goal.

445~~~
He's only the player Rafael <i>could have been</i>

446~~~
Showed Sanchez too much respect with that stupid foul. He's bang out of form, probably could've let him run through and not worry.

447~~~
Fair play to him for keeping it together, early on when he got done a few times I was worried it would keep happening all afternoon and cost us several goals - ended up costing us none. 
Can't say he's been worse than Darmian this season (barring Darmian's first 3-4 appearances which were pretty good) so hopefully he keeps getting chances to improve.

448~~~
Want us to give this lad a new contract. Him fighting with Darmian to be our RB can only be a good thing. 80 mins to keep Alexis quiet on a yellow card and he did it.

449~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

450~~~
Funny face. Can't succeed

451~~~
Had such a good game and was my MOTM. Was composed and looked great going forward.

452~~~
What also made it so great was there actually wasn't that much power on it which makes it harder for the defender to deal with as they have to generate the power themselves rather than just getting a foot on it.

453~~~
Does anyone remember if Moyes ever talked about his signing? As i remember it he was signed in that month before Moyes took over (hence the photo with Bollingbrook) after having been on trial here with Sir Alex a couple of times. If that's right then i doubt Moyes even knows today who he is, never mind before we actually signed him <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

454~~~
Gutsy, committed, adventerous. Himself and Borthwick-Jackson have shown enough to make their survival here look a real possibility. A real bonus from this comedy reel of injuries.

455~~~
Was really worried when he got that early yellow card. Didnt let it affect him, was a great attacking threat and didnt really let Sanchez or anybody who came on his side have much of a sniff.

456~~~
That cross was Beckham-esque. Early, fast, whipped and almost undefendable. As soon as he delivered it you knew someone was going to put the ball in the back of the net somehow.

457~~~
the first 10 minutes aside he was terrific and got sanchez in his pocket. 

good going forward is a nice thing too, he definitely offer  much more than darmian offensively, just like CBJ to our other LB bar maybe shaw. even CBJ final ball are much better than shaw's.

458~~~
Looks like a Russian ice hockey player. Sergej Varelov.

459~~~
He looks alot like Luke Shaw so far. Does those great driving runs from deep where he gets to a certain point and looks around as though hes not quite sure how he got through the whole team or what to do next. And like Luke Shaw, other than his own small mistakes hasnt looked so far like anyone has really troubled him defensively.

460~~~
Really hope he makes it here.

461~~~
I love him, with brain and penus.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Jus t came back to that. was going to correct it but feck it, deserves.

462~~~
Darmian could learn a few things from Varela.

463~~~
A mate told me he was Moyes first signing in Utd.  Well that doesn't matter but i like the way he carries the ball upfield with pace and offering an outlet on the right when he overlaps.

464~~~
He has really been good. Long may this form continues. Right now our first choice RB. Still things that needs ironing out but he is really a traditional fullback. Has a good cross on him too

465~~~
I think we'd scouted him for a while and just happened to pull the trigger when Moyes became the manager, it's not like he was a player that Moyes wanted himself. I really like what he's done so far, he's been good both defensively and offensively and seems to have good technical ability and composure. Looks like a proper modern right back

466~~~
Great performance from the lad. Should be our first choice right back for the rest of the season at least

467~~~
I think he should be first choice, defends well & his attacking game is miles ahead of Darmian. The way he composed himself & played after the early yellow card says alot about his quality. TOP player.

468~~~
Nah too early. Rafael had everything to be one of the best in his position. I'd like to wait and watch a lot more of Varela to see the same potential.

469~~~
I'm surprised people are classing him as a Moyes signing considering he didn't play him once.

470~~~
Think he needs to improve defensively. Lingard is excellent at tracking back and helping his FB, which works to Varela's advantage.

471~~~
Needs a new profile picture, this one is 2 years old and reminds me of Moyes.

472~~~
I really like the combination of Varela and Lingard. I think they work well together. Our first two goals came from the right and between them they kept the Arsenal left quiet. Can you really ask for more?

473~~~
He was a Jim Lawlor signing. He came on trial in May 2013 and United were in negotiations with his club from then

474~~~
Great delivery on him over the past two games. Hope he manages to keep fit and cement his place; deserves a long run in the side now.

475~~~
I'd be interested to see him playing RW

476~~~
Had a massive hand in all three goals yesterday. Should be allowed to play out the season. The spot is his over Darmian.

477~~~
looks like russian Messi

478~~~
Good at the back and offers so much going forward. Let's hope he continues like that

479~~~
He is quite talented on the ball which is a great asset.

480~~~
Alexis did nothing against him really. Brilliant game from him.

481~~~
He's got the build of an attacking FB in my opinion.

Can see him performing much like Evra did when played further forward as the main attacking threat on his side - very ineffective.

I think it's his bursting overlaps and whipping crosses - which when played at full back, you tend to have much more time and space to deliver - are his most effective and useful traits going forward.

482~~~
If he is good enough for Jerry 'The King' Lawler, Then he is good enough for me.

483~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

OT: he's been looking good lately. Exciting prospect!

484~~~
Agreed. Think he's more effective when he has space to run into.

485~~~
Would be madness if he's sold.

486~~~
Much better crossing then Darmian and he seems to have a good engine.  Against Arsenal he was up and down that wing for the full 90 and even in the last few minutes showed no signs of tiring.  Loving the progress with our youngsters.  It's made the second half of the season more bearable.

487~~~
His face reminds me a bit of Brendan Dassey.

On a more serious note, why did it take us so long to give him a chance if he's this bloody good? Even Real didn't find his prospects at all interesting? I wonder what happened.

488~~~
He really looks like a Russian lumpen, the resemblance is uncanny

489~~~
Surely he keeps Darmian out of the team for the foreseeable.

490~~~
Van Gaal said Darmian should be able to play tomorrow. It'd be idiotic to drop Varela.

491~~~
Darmo might well play at LB. Rojo probably out, Darmo could be preferred to CBJ.

Agree Varela should not be dropped, was terrific in last two games.

492~~~
Podcast team discuss Varela: <a class="externalLink" href="https://audioboom.com/boos/4245110-united-hour-e19-guillermo-varela" target="_blank">https://audioboom.com/boos/4245110-united-hour-e19-guillermo-varela</a>

493~~~
Who made that shit joke at the start? Fecking embarassing

494~~~
<a class="username" data-user="63211, @Alock1" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/63211/">@Alock1</a> agreed.

495~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

496~~~
Been very impressed with him, from the fist time I seen him playing, he has that aggressiveness, desire, and will to win, against midgetland, he made runs at times from the middle of the park, and on left, just to bring the ball to the box

497~~~
Yeah, Darmian is a good option for the left back position right now. He also showed more attacking intent before suffering another injury, so I'd be curious to see him link up with Memphis.

498~~~
So he'll be dropped then?

499~~~
I guess Darmian could start on the left (if he starts at all). The Varela being dropped bit was just me being worried, nothing more.

500~~~
Well Darmian can play any position along the back 4 so chances are he's accommodated elsewhere

501~~~
Good to hear, I would like to see him play. I haven't much confidence in the manager's ability to stay with what's working.

502~~~
Darmian has disappointed me. He was underwhelming in attack but he started off as this slick and smooth type of graceful Italian defender who nobody could get past, so nobody cared. After PSV away he's started to make quite a few mistakes and if his defending fails him there's not much left. 

Keep Varela as a starter and see what he's about long term.

503~~~
Darmian could probably start at CB no one knows, but most probably at LB if Varela stays at RB for the next game. Carrick probably couldn't and shouldn't be starting every week, let alone few days in between two games. Not because he is useless but fitness wise.

504~~~
I'll be pissed if he gets dropped for Darmian

505~~~
I too hope he does not get dropped but we also have to think from a point of view that he needs rest too. He has played 90 mins of the last 3 games in 10 days. Plus with 6 games in the next 18 days means we will have to rotate and rest our full backs. Just hope Love is not injured for long and we can use him too.

506~~~
Darmian and Valencia are back so we shouldn't really need Love.

507~~~
Plus McNair can also play RB if necessary. I actually think he should play there before Darmian and Valencia. Match fitness/match rhythm is more important methinks.

508~~~
I think he needs to start against Watford. Both him and Rashford both are high on confidence and it wont be right to bench them. Its a home game and against a lesser opposition. So start them both.

509~~~
Darmian should fight for his place.Performance-wise currently he should be below Varela for RB and below everyone and his dogs for LB position.

510~~~
Hope he isn't dropped for tonight, would be really disappointing and daft.

511~~~
If Martial is back it would be sensible to not play Rashford for a third time in under a week. To call that daft is myopic. He's still a kid and should be protected as such.

512~~~
Everybody needs Love.

513~~~
Varela thread *cough*

514~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Wrong thread?

515~~~
Oops <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

516~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yeah I agree he deserves his place tonight regardless of who else is back fit.

517~~~
This is the sort of game Varela should be getting under his belt, home game against Watford. Bring Darmian back for West Brom away and Liverpool away, but Varela should lets lots of attacking opportunities tonight. Let him run at them.

I'm not sold on him as a pure defender yet, as his positioning is very poor, but when we have the ball, he is awesome to watch. South American attacking fullback still being a distance off mastering the art of defending is par for the course though.

518~~~
...less of that.

519~~~
The whole back 4 was wobbly in the first half but I thought he was really good in the second, made some important tackles and brought the ball out well.

520~~~
I thought he was outstanding second half. His energy levels are insane, imagine him and Shaw rampaging up and down the flanks non-stop for 90 minutes.

521~~~
This!!

522~~~
This is the first time I've seen him and he doesn't look that good defensively. Much better in attack.

523~~~
Was solid, I thought. Although he showed a bit of immaturity in a few situations, he battled hard. A gem. 

Varela on the right, Shaw on the left. Sex.

524~~~
He was decent tonight. Bit dodgy in defense at times but energy was very good and kept going.

fecking Martial refused to link up with him at all.

525~~~
He's a tenacious little cnut, ain't he?

526~~~
Looking for Varela to offer more going forwards to balance out his defensive weaknesses. Not sure he offered quite enough tonight. His back pass to De Gea/Blind wasn't remotely clever.

527~~~
A few rash decisions at times but that's OK, he's 22 and only now getting first team action, he's going to overly eager at times. Matured as the game went on, definitely has potential to be a long term United player.

528~~~
He's growing on me, a lot

529~~~
Let's get facts right. He turns 23 in 22 days.

530~~~
Another excellent performance. Perhaps the most consistent of the back 4 members over the last 4 games, which is really amazing

531~~~
Soooooo how old is he?

532~~~
27?

533~~~
Get your facts right. He's 8378 days old.

534~~~
Our best player today imo. He is doing a great job for us so far, hope it continues.

535~~~
Thats like... a lot of minutes.

536~~~
He will also be 23 in 23 days time

537~~~
Feel just as comfortable with him at right-back as Darmain.

538~~~
Love how much he wants to contribute in attack, that should always be the hallmark of a United fullback.

539~~~
I love his weird positioning. Sometimes he looks caught up too high just to intercept the ball and start an attack up oppo's half.

540~~~
Has done reasonably well. Not confident in his defending.

541~~~
Capoue got the better of him in the first half, but he recovered in the second and the improvement was significant. Shows mental strenght.

542~~~
Much better in second half. First half whole defence was pants tbh. Think we need Smalling back ASAP.

543~~~
Hard to pick a standout player for us tonight but my MOTM went to him

544~~~
Really? He was appalling in the first half. He got better in the second half but could have cost us the game a few times before half time.

Is there a video of that performance?

545~~~
He has such great offensive awareness but defensively he can be a liability.

546~~~
He's still young, if he can improve his defensive game for us then he will be great. Awesome going forward, always looking to attack and has quality on the ball, he's one of the reasons why we are a better attacking team IMO.

547~~~
I thought he was the only defender to have a decent game, the others were rubbish. De Gea would have been my 2nd option

548~~~
I actually prefer him to Darmian, next season he and Shaw are going to be immense for us.

549~~~
Mourinho will probably question his physicality but his pace is easily comparable to most of the PL wingers and strikers and with our luck with injuries he should still get plenty of chances.

550~~~
Received his first Uruguay call-up.

551~~~
becoming a favourite

552~~~
Well done lad..  LVG needs to keep him in the team.

553~~~
Excellent, well done to him.

554~~~
Fantastic!

555~~~
Never has there existed a more Eastern European looking South American.

556~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

557~~~
is he considered home grown?

No, he isn't.

559~~~
Great news. Deserved call-up.

560~~~
cheers

"I think the last four games have really shown the changes that have come about within the team in the last couple of months," Varela told <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MUTV</a></b>. "It’s clear that we’ve got every intention of finishing the season on an upward curve.

“Of course, I’m very happy with a run of four matches in the side and four victories as well. I feel enormous pride in being able to play for a club like Manchester United. I think the important thing is that we keep working, and I want to keep working to keep a regular place in the team so that, in time, I can reach 50, 100 or 200 games in the shirt."

"I can say that it’s only recently I realised how the love you get on social media has such an effect," he said. "I’m so popular with the fans but I also want to talk about the effect it has on me. It’s only when you realise the scale of it [that you can appreciate it], and I want to say thanks to all of those people who are supporting me, it helps to drive me forward and motivates me to produce my best on the pitch."

When asked if he considered himself a regular in the line-up yet, he replied: "I don’t really. I think my main task is to keep working on a day-by-day basis to show the coach that I am a candidate for a regular first-team spot. I wouldn’t say I’m an automatic pick now, that would be a bit premature."

"Over-tired would be the best word [to describe how I’m feeling at the moment]," he added. "It’s been very hard on my legs. Now, we have a recovery and recuperation period, we do very good work in that area, and let’s not forget we have an extra day of recovery ahead of this Sunday. Hopefully that will help us to find full form."

563~~~
LVG said in an interview today that there was interest from Spain in the January window but, they thought he could have a part to play so didn't go for it. Not sure if it was loan or permanent but, whatever the case, a very good decision !

564~~~
“First I wanted to leave, but <a class="externalLink" href="http://thepeoplesperson.com/tag/louis-van-gaal/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louis van Gaal</a> asked me to stay,” <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/guillermo-varela-quit-manchester-united-10987998" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Varela said</a>.

“He gave me the opportunity and luckily I’ve played for many matches in a row.”

Also almost went to Genoa permanently in January.

565~~~
He better have just been being rested for the Liverpool match.

566~~~
Lets not get ahead of ourselves here. He's done very well so far but hes young and its far too soon to be complaining if hes not in the starting lineup. Rest him whilst on a high and let him come back in a few games firing. The worst thing would be to make him play tired, suffer a bad loss and dent his confidence. We are lucky to have four/five solid, young fullbacks at the club who can cover for each other.

567~~~
So maybe Darmian is better in defense, but what we really need is attack, and Varela has had some important involvements and crosses leading directly to chances. Hopefully he'll play the next few games.

568~~~
well done lad.  shows hard work and determination pay off.  Got his first full international call up after his performance lately.  Bit too soon in my eyes considering he's played 4 games, it's a bit like England calling up Rashford after 4 goals in 3 games.  But still, proud moment for him and well done to Giggs/LVG for persuading him to stick it out and work to get into the team.

569~~~
What are we thinking about the lad now, could he be our surprise solution the way Bellerin has been for Arsenal or do we need to invest in the summer?

570~~~
I think Darmian and Varela will get next season to stake their claim to be our long term RB.

571~~~
Darmian is a great defender but seems to limit our right side in attack. Varela looks like if he kicks on he could be the full package. If he and Shaw play like they can we could be lethal.

572~~~
I think we should look to other areas to invest first. There are more pressing concerns than the RB position currently.

573~~~
will be nice for him to watch from the sidelines the rest of the year (not the bench, i mean the press box) as he watches and learns the delicate nuances of the trade that only a skilled master such as valencia can offer.

574~~~
I thought he was our best player outside of De Gea, not that he was great.

575~~~
This, no complains about him tonight.

576~~~
No complaints about him tonight. Thought Blind was better as an outfielder though. 

I like him from what I've seen so far.

577~~~
One of the few players who turned up and showed some fight.

578~~~
Good in the first half. Seemed to get a bit lost in the second half. The change in system was clearly meant to get Blind into the game offensively, but Varela was lost. And yet he was still the best outfielder.

579~~~
He looks far too eager and adventurous for this team of lacklustre sh*te.

580~~~
Anyone else feel he was a bit isolated on the right?

581~~~
He offered very little threat and passed the ball backwards too often bit he didn't embarrass himself like most of the others

582~~~
Some of the players look scared to mix it and express themselves, especially in games like tonight. 

Not Guillermo however. Get the feeling he was born for games like these.

583~~~
Think he's wearing Falcaos boots from last season. Always slipping

584~~~
I like him personally. Got a long way to go defensively, but he does have the makings of a very good defender.

Just hope Jose will entrust him.

585~~~
Did well.

586~~~
Honestly, havent seen him have a bad game yet for us that I can remember.

587~~~
If I remember rightly he wasn't great against Bournemouth but other than that he's been quite good.

588~~~
He'll probably be dropped for West Ham the way Louis goes about things but he deserves to be first choice

589~~~
My man of the match today. Had a dodgy 10 minute spell at the beginning but recovered quite magnificently from that. The way he ran back and stopped Payet from one on one was brilliant to see.

590~~~
Why did we sign Darmian when we have this kid? He's a much better player.

591~~~
Very balanced player, can defend and attack.

592~~~
He's superb. He really is. Yet to have a below average game let alone a bad one.

593~~~
Not only him a number of our reserves have turned out better than some of our big money signings.

594~~~
I like his pace and tenacity, him and Darmian should be our options for next season. Why has it taken so long for him to break through though?

595~~~
Best crosser in the team?

596~~~
Another good outing for him, one of the few nailed on starters for me right now.

597~~~
Blind is better.

598~~~
Was one of the better players today. Have not been overly impressed with his defending till now but today he was very good defensively too.

He has a future here.

599~~~
The chance from the corner? Personally, I think that was all his fault in the first place. If he is meant to be the last man back wtf was he doing 30 yards inside their half? That was absolutely ridiculous and he was very lucky to get away with it.

Good overall though and I hope remains first choice.

600~~~
That's a good point, I didn't notice that but before that it came from a very lazy cross into the box centrally from Depay, who had plenty of time (where most of our players where so he knew the potential/danger) and it didn't even clear the first man. 

I can't criticise players like Varela because whatever quality/ability he lacks or whatever criticism you want to lay onto him, he makes up or at the very least neutralises it with his energy and attacking display. 

I can't say the same for other players like Darmian, Carrick, Fellani and Depay, who are net negatives for me when they play. 

And conversely it's why I'm lenient to Blind (passing and composure from the back), Lingard (movement and energy), Schneiderlin (energy and movement) etc etc.

601~~~
Very close to being my MOTM; hope we don't do anything stupid like let him go anytime soon.

602~~~
He offers so much more going forward than darmian. If we could combine the 2 we might make a great player. 

Fact is though for home games he has to start IMO.

603~~~
There is something Rafael-esque about him. Love the fire in his belly, the way he always wants to contribute offensively, whilst giving everything chasing back, when out of position. That said, I really miss Rafa ...

I also like to see him start in our home games, especially with Lingard in front of him, who needs someone overlapping on the right side.

604~~~
One of the bright sparks of the season. Imagine if we had let him go in January!

605~~~
Agree - he should be our right back for the forseeable future.

606~~~
When your having as disappointing a season as we've had, with the dull goal shy football we've been playing for most of it, it's very easy to support a player who still shows such attacking intent and desire. 

Varela is quick, has decent technical ability and good stamina but most importantly shows some passion and fearlessness on the field, but I still think he is far from being the complete package. 

I personally love watching him play and think he should definitely be first choice, but he is already beginning to get the type of over hype on the caf that will see plenty of posters with the knives out when he has a bad game

607~~~
We maybe would if Debucy had come in, or at the very least it would have consigned him to the U21's for the most part.

As with most of the kids LvG is just stabbing the dark and sometimes it comes good, Varela is one of them.

608~~~
its easily down to near to zero opportunities given by managers. Maybe he was too similar to Rafael but is it a flaw? Valencia was also seen as mr. reliable for too long and it was too risky not to buy a new RB. Now he's no1 RB in the team ahead of Italian flop, he's got much more potential just needs to start every game and we will benefit from it later. Great thing is that he can cover LB position as well just in case

609~~~
Honestly havent seen him have a bad / poor game for the first team. Hopefully starts ahead of Darmian against Liverpool.

610~~~
He was very good when going forward his run, crossing, composure and even his decision making were all very good. And defensively today he read the game well. That one on one situation against Payet will always be tough but he won the free kick anyway. My MOTM since he was very good both offensive and defensive today. He has to start ahead of Darmian against Liverpool, we need goals and Varela offers more when going forward.

611~~~
Can't tell if he's instructed in recent games to man-mark Coutinho/Payet or he's getting drawn in by them. If it was an instruction then feck Van Gaal further, it's pretty much what caused Rashford to be pinned back vs Liverpool.

Nonetheless, I really like what he adds to our team. His deliveries are really improving.

612~~~
He should start every game for us from now on. An on form player is better than chopping and changing the right back position every game.

613~~~
Hidden gem, he's been very impressive lately. Hope he keeps his spot for now, he deserves it.

614~~~
Reminds me of Rafael.

615~~~
Hopefully he's fine for the Liverpool game... dreading the thought of having Darmian starting a game where we need to attack.

616~~~
Thought he was pretty good again, Becoming quite consistent which is good to see. One point I must make is I find it strange that LVG has him man marking opposition's best players rather than stick in position, Against Liverpool it was Coutinho and yesterday it seemed to be Payet.

617~~~
Deserves that RB position over Darmian. Could be the solution, early but ya never know.

618~~~
I'm fairly certain we were talking about him not having a future here and being off in the summer and in January. Weird.

619~~~
he has that natural instinct to play the game at higher tempo and close down the spaces. Loved one moment when he appeared in the middle of pitch and simply won the ball anticipating the play even though it may look to someone as too offensive positioning, Iwsh we went for Poch, he would make him brilliant fullback...

620~~~
I don't want to stereotype but he's Uruguayan and that basically means he's always gonna try to punch above his weight and run himself into the ground. Pretty much the whole national team is like this no?

621~~~
much better than darmian.

622~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

623~~~
Living up to your username.

624~~~
He's fecking brilliant

625~~~
One of my favorite players this season. Really hope he is our preferred RB from now, but knowing LVG he is bound do make some daft decision and keep rotating him with Darmian. If Varela is fit, he should be starting every game.

626~~~
He's like a Rafael light. Been class so far, but if he bulks up some in the summer then he'd be brilliant I think. Just like Rafael was in Fergie's latter years. Just hopefully he doesn't have the same injury problems (we should never have sold Rafa anyways but whatever)

627~~~
Looks like he's dislodged Darmian as the first choice right back. Fair play to him, looked like another one of those Tosic kind of signings for a long while.

628~~~
We'll need those overlapping runs from him for 90 minutes, hopefully he does well once again.

629~~~
Really like him, technically really good and improving defensively each game. Him and Shaw could cover those positions for many years....

630~~~
He's raw but I like him as well. Sorry for him to play behind Mata.

631~~~
He's been out of position a lot today, going forward and back. Maybe a result of having to chase the game a bit.

632~~~
Not sure what he was doing there..

633~~~
Shall we get the screen shots, diagrams and knives out for him?

634~~~
One of the worst fullback performances I have seen in quite a while. No idea what ppl see in him. He can't tackle, isn't very pacey and has no idea what to do with the ball at his feet. Horrible.

635~~~
Meh.

636~~~
He's being terrible all game. Kept losing the ball stupidly for no reason and then that piece of 'defending' to top it off.

637~~~
Poor defending there against Coutinho.

638~~~
Hes been really poor. Poir going forward and letting Coutinho walk past him...

639~~~
I said before we should have had someone like Valencia ahead of him to help with this game.

He's struggled.

640~~~
Awful today, overrunning it, missing the ball, not taking it with him, and then absolutely abused by Coutinho, costing us the game.

Completely written off what was a really promising game there now.
What a downer.

Is only the Europa though.

641~~~
Challenging Blind for winner of the worst performance of the season. He's been shocking.

642~~~
He's poor defensively.

Should have never backed off Coutinho.

643~~~
He's been thrown into the deep end lately, can't be surprised when that happens.

644~~~
So nobody is going to mention how his positional game is non existent and his defense on Coutinho was horrendous??

645~~~
Hadn't had a bad game yet. Till now. Shame.

646~~~
Another Rafael.

People get all starry-eyed at his pace and willingness to overlap, ignoring that he can't defend for shit.

647~~~
Had me worried in the first twenty minutes and hasn't settled at all

648~~~
What do we even teach our guys at the acedemy. That is a textbook mistake, you never stand square against your attacker.

649~~~
That was horrid

650~~~
Would do better if Lingard actually helped him (in attack AND in defense).

651~~~
No need to go over the top with your judgment. You are taking the criticality of the goal into account. He's been decent cover during and injury-riddled period.

652~~~
Midfield was way too high considering it was a pass from Mignolet to Can to Coutinho. United were way too open and Coutinho had options to go either left or right because there was no one close to Varela and Varela expected him to go right and shoot.

653~~~
They have both been terrible all evening. Neither should be playing for us. What a damning indictment on Darmian that Varela is keeping him out of the team.

654~~~
Been saying this for awhile now. I do admire how great he is going forward, he contributed to a couple of goals during his time here due to that but when you partner him with someone other than Lingard, his defensive incapabilities are exposed.

655~~~
Mata has been playing mostly on the right.

Lindgard's been the number 10.

656~~~
He really hasn't had a good game. Seems to be absent when Liverpool go down their left and the one time he is there, he runs away from the ball. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

657~~~
Rafa was much better. At his best Rafa kept the likes of Bale and Hazard quiet. Varela isn't half the defender. Enthusiasm can't cover for his limited defensive ability. 

Gets square in front of Coutino, after that he's got no influence on which way Coutino will go. He's also too flat footed to react when Coutino decides to attack. Horrible positioning.

658~~~
Academy? He signed for us 2 years ago as a 20 year old and spent a year of that time at Real Madrid B.

659~~~
He's been fine apart from the goal. He won't be the first or last fullback to get rinsed by Coutinho.

660~~~
Having a poor game. Guess it happens though, he's generally not been too bad for us so far. Hopefully it's a learning curve for him.

661~~~
It looks more like a lack of experience, and, being completely isolated because of no support from his wide man than anything else.

The kid is young and out of his depth tonight, but with that being the case, why has the manager kept him on the pitch? He looked shaky for a good portion of the half, other managers would've pulled him for that, especially so with how big a game this is.

662~~~
Poor performance but for the goal, as bad as he was he also had zero coverage.

663~~~
True. Although I think people forget with Rafael how long he'd been there, and that he was actually fairly experienced for us. I mean, he'd been playing for us for a number of seasons by the time he left, and would've probably been into 200 games had it not been for injuries.

He <i>did </i>start a lot younger than Varela though, who I think is going to have to learn from the rougher parts of his game quite quickly in order to have a long-term chance here.

664~~~
Very poor half, and quite terrible for the goal. 

Oh well, he'll be better.

665~~~
Oh he's shit now because of that mistake? Gotcha.

666~~~
Indeed. As we were on at least a couple of occasions before, which we weren't punished for - through pure luck more than anything.

The kid should've done better, fair enough, but it's more than him. If he commits himself there and fails to make the challenge count, there's zero cover. Nobody reads it - and then DDG doesn't cover himself in glory either.

667~~~
Rafael is in a different class to Varela. He's better than Valencia, Darmian and anyone else we have as well, yet we sold him.

668~~~
What a stupid nitpicking response. Does that excuse from not knowing the basics of defending?

669~~~
I blame van Gaal. This was a accident waiting to happen and our idiot manager didn't see it. Shameful

670~~~
feck off LvG for subbing him off at halftime after he made a mistake.

I hate the way he deals with some players.

671~~~
He could have done better but so could other people up higher and De Gea in goal. De Gea didn't close the goal well enough, Coutinho could even have put it past him at the near post by the ground. I'm not gonna hold that against Dave though any more than that goal against Varela. Liverpool had plenty of chances before the goal without those two making a mistake.

672~~~
Also true

673~~~
Nobody is saying that, rather that they have finally seen how nonexistent he is defensively. Nice try though.

674~~~
I just think it's daft blaming the academy for a play that has had... nothing to do with the academy.

675~~~
I hope this doesn't mean he spends ages out of the team, but I expect it probably will.

676~~~
As much as I don't like him, I don't see the problem with this. Not even remotely. If he feels like Varela has been exposed (which many will agree with), then it makes perfect sense to take him off, and replace him with someone else. I expect people would've been moaning after long if Varela had been left on. And we'd been praising a better manager for his decisiveness.

677~~~
Darmian should have played today

678~~~
He'll never play for United again.

679~~~
Yeah that's what a bad half of football does, apparently it erases everyone you've done before it.

680~~~
The classic locking the stable door after the horse has bolted!

681~~~
I like Varela this season - one of the bright spots. A full back good on the ball who likes to go forward. A United player. One mistake (ok, one bad game) doesn't write him off for me.

682~~~
Can see why he's never been given a chance till now, positionally shocking. The early confidence has gone, he's all over the place and a complete liability.

683~~~
It's fine to change a player for tactics. But in this situation, where he gets skinned for a decisive goal right before halftime, to pull him off at halftime (even if you had planned to) is bad man management. Young players need to be given chances to make mistakes, they need to be shown that the club and manager are behind them. Defenders give up goals. It's an occupational hazard.

So send him out for the second half and take him off at 60 minutes. Give him a chance to settle back in the game and not feel like he's being punished for making a mistake. But that's how Van Gaal runs his team, he wants players to play with fear of his dictatorship.

Van Gaal's substitution shifted the blame for the goal and the tie on Varela. Varela did not perform at his best, but the real blame lies with the tactics and overall team play. We are unable to score from open play, and when we try to do, we leak goals. That's on the manager.

684~~~
Looked lost tonight, it didn't help that he had no help from Mata and our CM's are so immobile that they couldn't get across to help him, you just cannot push on like he was doing without cover.

685~~~
Awful tonight but in general I've been impressed by him.

686~~~
Exposed badly tonight in the absence of Lingard, who usually does most of Varela's defending. 

Been good but his defending and positioning needs a lot of work before he can be a regular starter for us.

687~~~
That was a big problem, Mata?
Bit like a headless chicken from what I have seen and not great defensively.

688~~~
Harsh. It's been one game. Besides, we weren't winning, regardless.

689~~~
I like Varela a lot... But that was bad... Like, really really bad.

690~~~
He was all over the place and too high up the pitch when they countered. It wasn't great dribbling but simple kick the ball ahead and outpace him. His starting position was all wrong and it happened a couple of times with Coutinho and once with Milner. 

Did any of the coaches think to help him out? Offer some advice. Tell him to not chase or follow the ball so much. 

It was coming down his side and no one thought to prevent it. Rubbish performance and rubbish management.

691~~~
He's been a bit off for a few games now, so it is probably an accumulation of games. Although he was rested a little while back.

Today was just an all round poor game from him.

692~~~
In the middle of a game? Are you insane man!?!

693~~~
Don't know if this is sarcastic but a bit of a word from the touchline could have helped him as he wasn't figuring it out for himself.

694~~~
100% sarcasm

feck knows why we don't communicate anything from the bench during the game... It's maddening. 

I mean, even something simple... Like there's 2 minutes to go in the first half, they're creating loads of chances, let's just everyone sit back and keep it tight... I mean, its not exactly rocket science.

But no LVG can't possibly do anything to effect the game whilst it's happening... The lemon

695~~~
They say sarcasm is hard to read on the internet <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

100% agree. He uses half time as his window for change but negates to impact what happens on the field. 

He says his work is done in training and on matchday it's down to the players. If this is a manifestation of his training then he is a bigger joke than I thought.

696~~~
One bad game. Still first choice RB IMO.

697~~~
His worst game for us. You could see during the half, he was being exposed and was in trouble.

But nothing, no change, nothing to help him out, nothing to offer him protection for a while, nothing to tell him to just stay for a while. And of course he gets done twice for their goal.

I really do hope he doesnt suffer how Blackett/McNair did. Made a big mistake and were pretty much never seen again.

698~~~
He got done by a better player. Happens.

699~~~
I feel sorry for him. Maybe he should have done better with the goal (But frankly I think even DDG was culpable there), but he could have done with some help from Lingard. He struggled to get into the game. I hope his confidence doesn't take a whacking (I am worried it will since Valencia is now back and he may have to play U21 games again).

700~~~
Now that we have Valencia, Darmian and Varela it's going to be interesting which player LVG choose. None of them is world class but they can do a decent job. I guess Darmian will play more as LB. 

Varela has been playing well, unfortunately he had a bad game versus Liverpool, he needs to work in his defensive skills but he is talented at least to be 2nd choice.

701~~~
LvG and the word, "interesting" do not go together

702~~~
He's been refreshing this season, but he does have a lot to learn about defensive positioning. Always leaves too much room, and a player like coutinho knows how to benefit from such space. Still want him to be first choice, hopefully more game time and he will still improve.

703~~~
Ouch that mistake was a pretty poor one and cost us. But he isn't the first player to get skinned off a standing start and he won't be the last. I really like his mobility and his ability to interchange on the right flank. Hopefully if we can steady the core inside with a proper defender beside Smalling and we can have him in the mix going forward. Chin up lad.

704~~~
Good post and agree but at this stage Valencia is far better although what is quite worrying is that Darmain is not.

705~~~
I have liked him since he has come into the team but he was a mess last night.

706~~~
He's shit tbf

Jonathan Spector

707~~~
He cant be awesome match after match. He is just a kid. He should not be first choice anytime now

708~~~
To be fair, we should have a second defender helping out against a player like Coutinho. Apart from Sturridge he was their one player capable of outright leaving a defender for dead. One of our CB's (Blind?) completely dropped off which was a bit excessive.

But it's hard to judge Varela. He's had few impressive performances but I'll have to see a lot more from him to say he's good enough for United.

709~~~
Kieran Lee was properly shit fullback. You're being harsh on Varela here imo.

710~~~
True. He'd actually have to be in position first before I could judge him

711~~~
He was terrible, shouldn't write him off but is also shows why we shouldn't get too carried away with youngsters as often they struggle after first few games.

712~~~
I still believe he can be a very good right back for us based on the quality he has shown.  He will have an off game here and there but who doesn't.

713~~~
Horrible Display last night. Had a bad half, even if you don't count their goal.

Absolutely disgusted with the way he defended against Coutinho; haven't seen such rookie defending in a while - however Smalling, Lingard/Mata really should have been back to help. Felt Smalling being closer would have helped as Coutinho had loads of space as soon as he bet Varela, which you don't let happen inside the box. Just look at how Liverpool defended - how many times did Martial beat  Clyne, only to have Sakho behind him?

714~~~
I like him alot, and attackingly he has been really good, but he is awful defensively, his positioning is all wrong, and he doesn't know the basics of defending properly, his stance was all wrong, you don't stand straight while defending you are actually half down, and showing a side to which you want the attacker to go basically where you know he will run into traffic. I was watching the match and thinking it would be a miracle if he won't concede against Liverpool.

The fact is Blind, Rojo, Varela and Darmian none of them are good defensively. They need a set up like the start of the season with 2 defensive players to cover them so they can shine. Individually all of them are weak defenders, Varela and Blind are poor positioning wise and they are rash into challenges and are prone to being caught high up the pitch and leaving their markers alone, the Henderson chance was the perfect example of Blind doing his thing, while Rojo i find him a dumb and thick footballer who has no attacking contribution, defensively he is fine but he is never reliable and always have a mistake or two in him, and lastly Darmian is poor attackingly and while is somewhere from ok to good defensively, against pacy opposition he shits himself and starts giving needless fouls away. 

We actually need to sign a proper RB and a CB this summer, Shaw and Smalling are only defenders who are i think will be good enough for a team like us.

715~~~
Was bound to have a bad game, doesn't mean hes suddenly turned to sh!t, he has talent and should be kept and persevered with.

716~~~
Hes a kid, its to be expected. Shaw was doing it pre injury and hes much more experienced. Both of them will learn from it.

Just shows what madness it was when everyone was calling for him to be our starting full back.

717~~~
Him playing poorly was partly LVGs fault. Him and Lingard have great chemistry offensively and defensively because Lingard can help make up for his defensive incapabilities while Varela in turn can help make up for Lingards offensive incapabilities. It was the perfect combination and they looked so smooth playing with each other. There was no reason to switch things up.

718~~~
That's a pretty lame excuse for feckin up unless you are a make shift defender. 
He is just a kid who has been thrown into the mix for several reasons. He is allowed to feck up at the big stage sometimes.

719~~~
He has speed (probably our fastest player) and is very energetic, but I am far from convinced on him (both in attacking and especially defending part).

I think that Rafael as an eighteen years old player was significantly a better player than Varela.

720~~~
This is redcafe, that's exactly what it means <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

721~~~
So we reverted back to watch Valencia and Darmian's show again...

722~~~
It was nice knowing you Guillermo.

723~~~
He's not starting tomorrow ? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 

That will rock his confidence massively if he is dropped from the squad altogether.

724~~~
Believes in youth you know does LvG

725~~~
Foundations.

726~~~
Before he made the mistake against Liverpool there wasn't one complaint in this thread about his performance. Once the mistake happened the floodgates opened. Lots of people saying he'd had a terrible half and should have been subbed earlier etc.

Interesting how one moment seems to swing opinion.

727~~~
He must be tired as feck and possibly just rested since Valencia's back.

728~~~
Not true. I have questioned his defensive nous after every game. 

His positioning, one on one defending and general defensive approach needs a lot of improvement. Saying which does not equate to writing him off.

729~~~
Well it is true mate because what I described is what happened. Have a look.

730~~~
Throwing a kid under the bus.

731~~~
Van Gaal is a real piece of work isn't he? Goes on and on about youth, drops young players after their first mistake. Unless you're Memphis Depay, of course.

732~~~
This kid has been one of the few highlights of the season and one poor performance and it's curtains. Shame his name isn't Rooney or Fellaini.

733~~~
Horrible management, as we should expect from this impostor. I guess Flatface wasn't done punishing him by hauling him off at halftime, now he has to keep Varela out of the squad completely.

734~~~
Man management!

735~~~
It was not an excuse. It was an observation as to why he was exposed for things that nobody noticed. The  Varela/Lingard combo was far more effiicient and beneficial for the team.

I don't believe in that ridiculous theory of "youth getting better treatment or breathing space". Although I believe it is essential an individual takes into account the reasons as to why a poor performance may account and whether or not it is fixable or understood, but we must grade and judge our players fairly and hold them accountable to them especially if their performance contributes to a bad result. If not, then that individual is lying to himself

736~~~
He was given a rest. Stop moaning guys. He looked like he needed one.

737~~~
I think he had to be left out of the team after my his performance against Liverpool, dropping him from the squad was maybe a bit harsh though. Be interesting to see how many games he gets now there are other options.

738~~~
I want this guy to start as our first choice RB next season. Give him a chance to prove himself. Let Darmian show what he has to displace him but Varela looks better going forward.

739~~~
Hasn't been in the squad since Liverpool. Think he's a gifted player. Once he's more positionally aware and stronger, he'll be some RB. Would be a mistake to sell because of a 31 year old Valencia IMO.

740~~~
Positionally all over the show, he's useful as a squad player though.

741~~~
This

742~~~
Indeed. Its disgusting

743~~~
He will probably never play under van Gaal again. He does not forgive.

744~~~
I have a feeling (well for as long as LVG stays) he will be frozen out like Blackett and McNair. And pretty much Pereira and Januzaj...

Hopefully that'll get him back in the team <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

748~~~
Will be looking forward to watching the video

749~~~
Anyway, back to Valencia smashing the shins of PL left backs!

750~~~
Was it his cross on our second goal too? Cracking delivery.

751~~~
I mean, I agree with the sentiment, but a bit unfair when he assisted our only goal last weekend!

752~~~
At the moment he's behind TFM, Valencia and Darmain all for good reason.

753~~~
What reason is that? He's been better than Darmian, Valencia has just come back from a 5 month lay off and TFM is just an inexperienced and isn't a natural right back.

754~~~
He'd be a huge asset if he adds more to his game defensively.

755~~~
On current form TFM has saved our ass more than once and it'd be hard to drop him. Darmian had one bad moment but otherwise he's consistent defensively when played in his position at not at left back. Valencia adds to our width when Mata is playing on the wings. Varela got consistent game time until he got out paced and shown up by Coutinho, that is just a bad memory for everyone. He had a piss poor game against Liverpool and he's been demoted as a reason.

756~~~
Here's the goal: 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/6zja" width="560"></iframe>

757~~~
And Darmian has been incredibly inconsistent, more so than Varela, Valencia offers almost nothing going forward and TFM should really be looking for time more centrally, his natural position. At the very least he's good enough to be making the bench.

758~~~
Well, that's him fecked! 

LvG won't like that

759~~~
bollox, Varela certainly deserves another chance, being skinned in one game doesn't mean shit Darmian was suspect in so many other games not just ones, let alone his absolutely catastrophic attacking contribution, for 13million he's one of the worst ever signings for manutd. when FosuMensah and other palyers come to the first team and have better games than this so called star form Italian league there must be something wrong, Fosu Mensah is a midfielder but if he continues to play right back he might have a bad game just like every youngster, as his positioning is really suspect and might cost him in one intense game. Valencia is mr consistent and has no future with us. Id rather give games to Varela to find out if he can take the second chance and if he deserves place in the squad for the next season because you know what you expect from Valencia, he will not get better... Darmian is just a useless player we should never buy...

760~~~
Valencia manages the entire right wing all by himself and thats why him and mata work well in our right side.

761~~~
You're kidding right?

762~~~
For me, Varela has had one bad game (half) and that was against Liverpool when he allowed them to equalise by being turned and tricked twice in one move.
Not sure that warranted him not being seen again.

Its like how Januzaj came back from Dortmund, came on against Southampton as a left wing back, gave away a free kick which lead to their winner, and we never saw him again in the first team.
Or half injured Nick Powell was just thrown on...
Madness.

763~~~
I'm not sure how many Andersons we need to see before learning not to make sweeping judgements based on 6 game sample sizes.

764~~~
He's too good for U21 level. He's now 23. Either give him games or let him move to Italy like originally planned.

I like his attitude and enthusiasm in attack. Positioning would be his weak point. He has the legs and appetite for The Premier League.

765~~~
He's been injured for the past couple of weeks and only made his comeback for the u21s tonight

766~~~
Varela> Darmian, not even close

767~~~
What was the sweeping judgement made in this thread about Varela?

768~~~

769~~~
That's hardly a sweeping judgement. Darmian has been trash.

770~~~
So, it's better to make judgement based on 1 game?

771~~~
Ouch!

772~~~
Januzaj played for us after that vs Arsenal after that and has been injured since.

773~~~
Varela was suspect positionally in portions of every match he played. He just got away with it in some of them. He's brilliant going forward, yes, but let's not delude ourselves about his frailties.

Brilliant again in attack throughout the U-21 match against Tottenham, but I want to see him have a good defensive performance before I'm going to rate him higher than Darmian or Valencia.

Darmian has been poor of late, but earlier in the season we've seen him play well defensively. Defenders need to defend.

774~~~
How many full back do you know are adept at attacking and can actually defend properly. There are only a handful in world football and given Varela's limited opportunities with first team football I think he has done very well but there is room for improvement across the team.

775~~~
We're talking about a young fullback who's had maybe 4 or 5 starts at most for United, right?

Varela > Darmian

776~~~
On his way to Eintracht Frankfurt

777~~~
Good move for him!

778~~~
Good move, hope he does well, any idea how much we're getting for him?

779~~~
I really wanted him to do well. I am not understanding why can't we keep him? He was excellent at RB along with Valencia. Don't understand the logic why he is being shipped off?

780~~~
Kicker says Frankfurt want to loan him (1 year) with an option to buy. Talks just started so it could take a while until the move is completed.
