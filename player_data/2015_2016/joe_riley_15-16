1~~~
Already played once and likely to start tomorrow so deserves his own thread

2~~~
Any good though?

3~~~
Great performance.

4~~~
Thought he looked really good tonight. 

Future looks bright at left back.

5~~~
Funny thing is, he's naturally a right back.

6~~~
Classy and composed on the ball, not sure LB will be his long term position but he did well there tonight.

7~~~
What position did he play before being moved at full back?

8~~~
Very good feet owing to the fact that he's not always been a defender. Composed, quick and committed.

Thought our fullbacks were both exceptional tonight.

9~~~
Even better.

10~~~
Really like him.

11~~~
If he played like that at a team like Southampton or Everton, he'd have added an extra £10m to his price tag given his age and nationality. As he's at United, it's a packet of crisps and an Indonesian shoe lace sponsorship.

12~~~
He is really good in tight spaces. Was Player of the tourney at the mercedez benz 5 a side thing last year IIRC.

Really quick and excellent stamina too. Defending/positioning and crossing needs work especially at LB but i really like him.

Been very good for the U21s this season as well and can play number of positions.

13~~~
Technically very good. Should look to cross more with his left before he's closed down, but he really impressed me.

14~~~
Agreed. Very neat and tidy with the ball. Unsure of his actual position though.

15~~~
It's a strange feeling seeing us having 4-5 solid options behind arguably the most talented left back out there. I really like this kid. His technical and aggression level is way better than I expect from a United youth player these days.

16~~~
Really like him. Looks a class act.

17~~~
Did really really well, he must have been so proud of that standing ovation he got.

18~~~
Love his work rate and speed, two fantastics assets and a class performance. Looks a genuine talent, fair play to van Gaal because Im very gassed up by these performances of the academy players.

19~~~
Who said we were lacking depth at FB? CBJ, Varela and now Riley showing we have some excellent young options if we choose / need to utilise them.

20~~~
Which mourinho won't

21~~~
I agree with the general point but who else would he play if we have this Kind of injury crisis ?

22~~~
Good performance, will miss him on radio 2 though

23~~~
I wasn't that impressed against Shrewsbury, but I thought he looked very good today. Not really keen on having a right footer at left back, particularly if we have one at right wing as well, so I don't think he's a long-term option there, but maybe at right-back?

24~~~
I think he'd be like Fergie and prefer to play people out of position before being forced to dip into the reserves

25~~~
Actually he's not. He's a natural right winger. Been playing RW/RB for U18 last season and only moved to LB in U21 this season.

26~~~
Yeah, but we don't have anyone else to play out of position even right now.

Actually thinking about it even Riley was filling in out of place for the U21s due to lack of LB's and today we could have played Mcnair instead of playing Carrick out of position.

27~~~
I think McNair is really unfit.. Hasn't played in ages, Van Gaal is very particular about match fitness i think

28~~~
The only downside to his performance was that he had such a short walk to the touchline when he got taken off, the standing ovation wasn't that long <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

If I saw my number coming up after a performance like that, I'd sprint as far across the pitch as possible and savour the walk back <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

29~~~
Thought he looked class tbh

30~~~
Right winger

31~~~
Nice and composed performance. But at left back, he's really not going to figure much for the first team. Shaw, Rojo and CBJ are ahead of him

32~~~
Knew he's a FB/WB more than winger.Has always been underrated before this season due to him being played higher up the pitch.

33~~~
he reminds me of Shaw a bit how enthusiastic he looks when speaking and with his haircut and going forward, needs to bulk up and work on his defending - mainly positioning and he will be a great utility player, he's defo much better talent than Donald Love, that I can say for starters

34~~~
Good game for the lad. He and Rushford and Varela combined so efficiently.

35~~~
I've been really impressed with our young fullbacks this season. Shaw early on, and then Varela, Bo-Jack and Riley last night have all been excellent. One of the few real highlights of this year.

36~~~
He rather buy 2 Elobodjies

37~~~
Was excellent today - I love his enthusiasm and you can tell he really wants to impress by giving 200% on the pitch. I can't tell how talented he is, but he certainly looks like a hard working boy.

One thing I did notice was his reluctance put in crosses with his left foot - which makes more sense now since he was previously a rm/rb. Thought he was excellent and hope he can keep improving!

38~~~
Absolutely brilliant and so much confidence in his play. His runs are so great for starting attacks and relieving pressure too. Get working on that left foot and play some RB and he's got a great future. A loan next year to get more experience defensively would be good for him.

I don't get to watch the u18s but even as a winger he always impressed me in match highlights or he'd always be involved in Gribbin's videos but then so did Jordan Thompson who we got rid of.

39~~~
He was the find of last night for me - more so than Rashford. Really promising performance.

40~~~
Do we think he'll end up at Right Back then, long term?

41~~~
Joined the academy when he was 6 years old apparently. There's a great pic of him stopping Cristiano for an autograph in the car park years ago!

There's something very special about watching a youngster like that, with a great attitude, take his chance when presented like he did last night.

42~~~
Good impression this week.  He was quiet for stretches but seems to have a lot of pace.  Not sure of his potential with the club knowing that Shaw will be at LB (we hope, anyway) but someone to watch for.

We seem to have an exciting group of fullbacks developing - Shaw, Borthwick-Jackson, Varela, and Riley.  With some luck, we could be set for the next few years.

43~~~
With the emergence of him, CBJ and Varela, I hope that we don't sign any other right/left back. Those three in addition to Shaw and Darmian (and Rojo/Blind if needed) are more than enough.

44~~~
Just watched the game. Was really impressed by him! Solid performance, wasn't overawed at all.

45~~~
If CBJ comes back this weekend, who will be the right back ? Varela vs Sanchez... I see us cut to shreds..

46~~~
Was watching him at RB in the U21's match vs Liverpool for a spell, he looked fantastic when moved there compared to his usual LB spot where he's a little shy to attack, he also pretty much pocketed Ojo during the game and his delivery looked excellent. He's just so bloody fast! He's in the mould of a Shaw/Bellerin type fullback.

Really think there's a future for him here and I don't think he's that far behind Varela.

Just hope he continues to progress.

47~~~
Always look to make a run whenever he
 touches the ball.Very positive player.

48~~~
he's a bit lightweight though once he bulks up a bit and works a bit more on his positioning he will be great attacking fullback. Not sure how Shaw started but he always seem to be a great defender in the first place. Riley's more or less converted to fullback from the more attacking position which is not a bad thing, he already looks more threatening and positive going forward than the italian fullback we bought for immense money

49~~~
I was impressed with him on his debut, shame he's not had another senior chance since.

50~~~
Missed the second half so didn't get to see him on the right. He's looked great on the left so I'd love to see him on the right more so he could make some more natural runs. He's a breath of fresh air compared to the first team fullbacks which at this point I'm beyond sick of. I firmly believe our fullbacks offering nothing going forward is one of our biggest problems. Sure it was weaker opposition but I don't think it was any coincidence we looked miles better when Riley and for the most part Varela have played.

I disagree that he is like Shaw, Luke is fantastic at defending.

51~~~
Let's hope he's not another Reece James

52~~~
He should be given a chance in the first team. He's looked great when played so far.
