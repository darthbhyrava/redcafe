It will be interesting how he starts the season. It looks like he is going to have the Hazard role for us in that left wing. He will have to fight Young for that spot given the way the former ended the season but it wont take long for Depay to displace Young.

2~~~
He'll be first choice from the off I think... He's built for the premier league, and even though Young did really well for us, Memphis is still on another level technique wise and when it comes to end product. Di Maria being out injured at the start will mean that Memphis will probably be first choice from game 1, so it's up to him to keep his spot. Pretty confident that he will.

3~~~
Damn, Depay looks like he did some serious building up since the end of the season. Don't recall him looking that built up when watching the PSV games last season.

5~~~
He looks like a beast physically from the training photos, which bodes really well for his training ethos. Hopefully he has a good tour, scoring afew goals to put himself into the match day squad for game one. I don't want to put him under to much pressure but I feel that if Depay can replicate his form of last season in the premier league then Utd will have a great shot at the title.

6~~~
Adnan take a look.

7~~~
He's the signing I'm most excited about, but that's possibly because he's an attacking player. He just has extraordinary potential. I'm not expecting the world from him, but it would surprised me, if in a few years he reached Hazard-like levels.

In terms of his immediate impact, I think the tour will determine whether he starts instantly over Young or not. He's certainly a far more naturally talented and productive player, but LVG might want to initially start the tried and trusted Young which paid dividends for him. He will eventually displace Young either way. It's just a matter of time, as he's simply a better player.

8~~~
He doesn't look similar to Hazard at all so I can't him playing the same role. Hazard is a playmaking wide player like Ribery whereas Depay is much more direct and focused on scoring and affecting the scoreline, from what I've seen.

If anything we need someone on the opposite site performing the hazard role compliment Depay on the left.

9~~~
Memphis is actually a very creative passer also. Yes his main aim is to score goals, but when others are in position he is great at clever little passes. He does come inside off the line and stands in the AM position often, so will be interesting. Under LVG he may instruct him to stay wider though.

10~~~
It's very different from Hazard. A lot of Chelsea's play goes through Hazard, much like with Ribery a few years back at Bayern. 

Playmaking, basically. That's different to having a nice pass on you which a lot of attackers tend to.

13~~~
Why did he post a picture of Chris Smalling?

14~~~
Surprised he's allowed to do that! It's clearly not the new kit though.

15~~~
He's gonna be a beast for us. I can sense it.

16~~~
He will definitely not start ahead of Young in the early stages of season. Ashley was very consistent player throughout the season, he won't be dropped that easy. 
He seems to have great mentality though, I like that about him.

17~~~
His new Twitter banner has "m7" in it. I wonder...

20~~~
First page... 

This kid will be a breath of fresh air in our first team imo.

21~~~
Can't wait to watch him play. 

He has the potential to be world class, I like that he's not media driven and likes to keep away from that and just focus on football.

22~~~
I believe he actually prefers to be called 'Memphis', as opposed to 'Depay'. I think it has something to do with his relationship (or lack of) with his father, or so i've heard.

23~~~
Could be a magic player for us. Can't wait to see him play.

Any of you really feel the way I feel?

24~~~
Interesting

25~~~
That would be highly frowned down upon Id think.

26~~~
It's his work ethic, more then anything else, which excites me.

He clearly wants to be the best player in the world and he'll work hard as hell on and off the pitch to try and reach his goals.

He's going to be special.

27~~~
Memphis has 7 written all over him

Yes that's the point, the other guy called him Depay. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

I'm just sticking this here for use later in the season.

31~~~
Ffs we've signed Tom Ince lads

32~~~
he has had it in there since last year when he was 7 at PSV. I do think of Di Maria leaves he will get it though.

33~~~
Ah, my bad. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

On an unrelated note, has anyone seen pictures of this guy without a shirt? He will eat PL full-backs for breakfast.

34~~~
From previous years yes and he was already a beast. He looks like he's made more gains since the end of the season as well.

35~~~
He seems to have fitted into the squad perfectly, always smiling and laughing seems as though he has been here forever! No doubt that if Di Maria leaves, he will be given the number 7.

36~~~
Have a feeling he'll take a season or so settle properly. Not expecting much from him this year tbh.

37~~~
I dunno. I just have a feeling in my bones he will just elevate himself and become pivotal for us. He just looks like he will do whatever it takes to get greatness. You can see he wants to be the best player in the world. Think he will hit the ground running <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

38~~~
I don't think Young and Depay are both vying for the 'Hazard role'. Put simply, Young will never be good enough for the 'Hazard role ' at United. He is vying for the Willian role, or the 'other winger'.  He has a low statistical output, and very tactical responsibilities, as opposed to the freedom afforded to the special player. If anything,  the likes of Mata and Di Maria arguably tried the Hazard role last season, albeit from the opposite wing. It just so happened that our Willian was better than our Hazard, which in itself isn't good enough for us.

39~~~
Not only a great footballer, but also a great artist:

40~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

41~~~
Probably the most excited to see him out of all our signings, or at least a tie with Schweinsteiger. United's new #9? (I know the numbers aren't final, but I can see him getting it regardless).

42~~~
He's drawn James lipton!

43~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

44~~~
Some of his flick ons have been brilliant.

45~~~
You can just tell he's a special talent. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

46~~~
The selfish gimp cost Smashley a sure goal there.

47~~~
He's clearly got the talent, I'm just not seeing him as a #10 though. I want to see him out wide running at defenders.

48~~~
He's so Ronaldo like, Ronaldo too isnt exactly creative but sometimes just those momens of sheer brilliance te set his teammates up. Hope he starts out wide next match tho.

49~~~
Really like what I've seen from him so far.

50~~~
Pretty much.

51~~~
Great movement from him. Always available for a pass. 

A couple of brilliant passes as well. Rooney should really have scored from one of them bar his usual first touch.

52~~~
Going to be a special talent.

53~~~
Think it might just take him a bit to get accustomed to the spacing while playing as a 10, and knowing when to hold off defenders and all that. Was brilliant whenever he got onto the ball... Great to have a player with pace again as well. 

Don't mind at all that he went for the shot on that moment when Young could have been slipped in, we need someone who is a bit more selfish and not afraid to have a go. Wrong decision of course, but I feel like he would have passed if it wasn't his debut.

54~~~
Some lovely flair and vision from him in the #10 role. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

55~~~
Not sure this is his best position but he made some good passes this first half.

56~~~
Thought he was underwhelming.

57~~~
Decent today. I'd like to see what he does on the wing.

58~~~
You could see he was pissed off at Rooney at times. There was this one time were he sort of made a gesture with his head after flicking it to Rooney for a return only for Rooney to get the pass back way off direction.

59~~~
Looks confident and comfortable on the ball, an encouraging sign. I'd be going bonkers if he'd have passed it to Young instead of shooting.

60~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Prepare to be frustrated at some of his decisions this year. Will be a learning process.

61~~~
He had good and bad moments. Looked out of place as a number 10 at times, sloppy other times, but also had some very good moments where he did something creative. It's the kind of which tells you that he's a winger. A winger does all of that and it's the norm. From a number 10 you need more and reliability, though.

62~~~
I want to see him on the left in the next game.

63~~~
Hope this is true.

64~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> laughed so hard at this comment for some reason

65~~~
Underwhelming. He'll get better with time.

66~~~
Hopefully he frustrates in other ways. Van Gaal will tear into him if he ignores setting up a tap in like that in a proper game.

67~~~
Overall performance wasn't amazing but he shows some very good glimpses. Looking forward to seeing him play.

68~~~
he has a strong determination which is the key to become successful here but I don't think he will be that great in his first season..

69~~~
Thought he was pretty average to be honest. Not sure about the praise he is getting. Was surprised to see him so centrally too.

70~~~
Thought he showed as much as he could possibly show after only training for a week and playing on a poor pitch. I agree with the comments that I would prefer to see him on the wing however, he did well to get in dangerous central positions and played some brilliant balls that on another day would have lead to assists. People also need to realise that playing wing is very different to CF because you have to be accomplished at holding the ball with your back to goal and you also have the whole pitch around you rather than being able to hug the touch line. Anyone that has played football will know this is a lot different and I'm sure Memphis will show us more of what he's got in the other tour games. For me he showed just enough to wet the appetite and get even more excited.

71~~~
He was good but not great but showed his class and vision with one or two pasess and on the other hand didn't passed to Young who would probably scored. Suprised that he played central but i think it was an experiment what he can deliver in this position because LVG already know what he can deliver on the wing.

But it is clear that the talent is there.

72~~~
I'm so not calling him Memphis. It just feels stupid. Like calling Hernández "Chicharito". 

I'd like to apologise to him for it even though he clearly doesn't give a feck about me. But the apology should allow me to keep calling him Depay as I surely will.

73~~~
Sounds like what people were saying about Zaha a long time ago <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

74~~~
True but at least Memphis is build like a tank so if the worst comes to the worst we can tell him to bulldoze his way through.

75~~~
Pretty much something opposite of what I've expected to see from him, might've been forced by playing the #10/second striker role. Not much tricks and dribbling but he's impressed me with his great vision and passing ability.

76~~~
Ooh, check you out.

77~~~
Zaha is built pretty well too..

78~~~
I'm edgy as feck.

79~~~
To be fair, Memphis is a little different to Chicharito. One is a nickname, the other is his actual given name.

80~~~
Yeah saw that. Threw his hands up in the air Ronaldo style and turned his back on the play when Young didn't pass the ball to him too. Don't mind seeing that in pre-season as he obviously wanted to get more feel for the ball. 

Wing is definitely his best position. I wouldn't be against seeing him at #10 for the odd occasion but not until he's used to his team mates. Definitely looked more dangerous when he was starting his runs from the flanks.  

Talent is there for all to see. Surprised that he didn't try to take more on last night. Just looked as if he was more conservative in his play.

81~~~
Yeh he's not bad but he isn't Memphis size

82~~~
True. But I usually don't like calling footballers by their first names, we're not mates. Rio was maybe the only exception, mostly because of convenience. But even him I usually called Ferdinand (I made the effort of typing those six extra letters). 

Calling our players Ander, Wayne, Juan, Marcos or Luke... no way. Even the whole 'Morgan and Bastian' thing going on in their respective threads is getting on my nerves a bit though I understand why the lazy community don't want to bother with trying to spell their last names correctly.

83~~~
I'll start calling him Memphis once he gets to my birthday party.

With a gift!

84~~~
Number 9?

Not sure if want.

85~~~
Numbers are just for the tour.

86~~~
Ahh good.

87~~~
Does a footballer lose pace and agility by putting on so much muscle? Hope not, he's a beast now but his true qualities were his quickness and dribbling.

88~~~
I'm not sure whether i'd play him in that 10/second striker role, but you can see what he'll bring. There was a few moments in the game where he shown glimpses of magic, and linked up well with players around him.

I guess Van Gaal is experimenting with positions, but I'd like to see him as a winger next game, with possibly Fellaini, Mata or Herrera as the 10.

89~~~
Dont Think that you need worry yourself..

90~~~
It seems a bit of a waste to be playing Memphis in central positions to me. We have struggled a bit for quality wingers recently, and have now bought one of the brightest European prospects in that position - lets not feck it up by sticking him at #10 or up front, eh Louis?

91~~~
Yesterday was all about giving everyone 45 minutes on the pitch, it was never about tactics.

92~~~
Yeah thats fair enough

93~~~
I think you're making a bigger deal about this than necessary. Besides, it's less annoying than posters spelling their names incorrectly. Some still spell Januzaj as 'Janujaj' or 'Januzaz', imagine the horror of them trying to spell Schneiderlin or Schweinsteiger consistently.

94~~~
He's good and calm on the ball, which you wouldn't expect from such a young player, and he's great at going past players which is something we've needed for a while. Great creativity and passing as well. Wasn't involved as much as he would have liked as we didn't dominate the ball as much as we did in the second, but whenever he got it, I thought he showed huge promise. Will only get better but I think he'll have a very good season.

95~~~
I think its kinda like boxers. If you bulk then train you will never gain speed but punch hard. If you train and gain speed then bulk you both hit hard and fast.

So in Ronaldo's case, he lost quite a bit. In Memphis case he should be the same.

96~~~
He needs to shave that ridiculous beard/sideburns.

97~~~
Why do you care?

98~~~
Are you his mom ?

99~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
That's the best you can do?

101~~~
That's what I thought was enough for you <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

102~~~
Didnt play that well overall but showed moments of talent that excites me!

103~~~
Nah the glimpses of class was his vision to play a pass with virtually zero time to make the decision. Zaha had pace and tricks which look very flashy but not on the same level as Depay imo.

104~~~
some good ideas but not the best execution

105~~~
he's not the guy for that position. or at least a long way yet

106~~~
Think playing him centrally was possibily Van Gaal wanting to see how he'd do through the middle more than anything.

107~~~
Play him on the left, what's with playing him behind Rooney, some things never change.

108~~~
It really depends on the type of training he does while getting more muscles. Sprinters are physical beasts.

109~~~
First 45 minutes playing as a 10, he wasn't really spectacular or anything but had some nice flicks/touches/tried 1-2s. Didn't really dribble much and should've passed to Young, just wait for his performances on the left wing to see what he's capable of <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

110~~~
Quite odd to try him there. I am guessing LVG just wanted to try it out as it was one of those ideas that would either be great or poor? Can't wait to see him on the wing.

111~~~
First match to give everyone 45 minutes, I doubt 10 will be his position if the season starts or that we should read too much into it. Better try in preseason than in the actual season. Van Gaal might for some reason see him as a striker though, although his best performances in the short term will be probably be on the left where he's played the majority of his carreer.

112~~~
Hmmm...

Maybe LVG is planning on using Memphis and Rooney as an attacking due? A #9 and #10?

113~~~
So has Memphis been confirmed as wearing the #9? As I thought the tour numbers were temporary.

114~~~
Yeah the numbers are temporary, number not been confirmed.

115~~~
Think he's going to get the #9 anyways... He's a goalscoring winger, he's got huge potential and is a confident/cocky guy so he'll want a "big" number like that. Also there isn't any other number available really that is suited for him, and he'll be a front 3 player so 9 works.

116~~~
I reckon Memphis is hanging on to see if he can get that #7 shirt.

117~~~
Certainly possible, LvG is picky over his number 9's though, I remember him making Wilson change his number last year so it had a 9 in it, he ended up with 49. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

118~~~
What fun is it to play him in the correct position right away? We love to struggle for a few months first with players moved around, otherwise there's nothing to argue about on here.

119~~~
The moaning about him playing number 10 is a bit OTT, he was our brightest player in the first half. Plus, it's only pre season, the time to experiment.

120~~~
It's looking very likely Memphis will be a striker from comments in press conference and the player himself. Wouldn't be surprised if he keeps the #9.

121~~~
Very impressed by his first outing. If he improves his movement in the final third then he's gonna have a big future.

122~~~
Can't see him losing the #9, regardless of his playing position. I don't think he would have been given it at all, if there was a chance it would be given to someone else. He'd have been given 15, or 24 or something.

123~~~
if di maria goes i can swear you he will get the 7 shirt.

124~~~
Yeah that's true actually. Other than that though, I don't see him taking 15, 19, 24 or whatever the next available number is.

125~~~
He has big legs, he isn't going to be easy to dispossess like Mata.

126~~~
Goal! Nice finish.

127~~~
He's class... Going to stick my neck out and say he'll get between 15-20 goals this season. Great finisher and has the nose to get into a goalscoring position. Always in and around the spot where our chances come from. Also don't mind him at all as a 10, his play is inconsistent as he's just getting to know the position, but he looks really creative there and is a big goal threat.

128~~~
Can see his talent but He's not really a Number 10.

129~~~
Our "surprise" striker <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

130~~~
Nice half from him. Clean finish. 

What's impressed me with Depay are his basics. His touch and passing look more complete than I'd expected at his age and the type of player he is. Sometimes there's a fear with this type of player, they're happy dribbling and doing the fancy stuff but lack in the technical areas. Not so much with Memphis, he even brings the ball down under pressure well.

131~~~
Great footwork for the chance he created for Mata right at the end. He's a very exciting prospect.

132~~~
How's that for a cool finish.

What's exciting about him is that he's got end product in abundance, which usually is the problem with his type of player.

133~~~
What position?
Sorry for the questions in multilpe threads as I didnt watch the game. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

134~~~
#10, made some good runs but naturally looks to be getting used to a position he doesn't usually play.

135~~~
Glimpses, but I doubt he'll start the season as first choice.

136~~~
He looks more ready to be a starter than I thought before he joined us. Physically he's a beast and his first touch is very impressive. He hasn't exactly set our tour on fire yet but it's easy to see that he got of the attributes to be a worldie in a not so distant future.

137~~~
I like the way he's so committed in his play. Makes a decision early and follows it through. None of that indecisive faffing about that Nani used to do. Been a wee bit hit and miss so far but I reckon he's going to be class for us.

138~~~
This forum will explode if he scores 2+ vs Barca lol

139~~~
You know it <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

140~~~
Really cool and tidy finish.

141~~~
The first of many. Memphis mania is upon us.

142~~~
Thought he moved quite well. Showing promise.

143~~~
I'm tired of two striker systems that don't work. LVG will play 433, he's just in experiment mode but he's said multiple times that it's his formation of choice.

144~~~
Mata needs to be careful stealing Shaws BFF.

145~~~
A superstar in the making. As long as he LvG keeps him grounded, he has everything needed to be one of the best players in the world. Bold statement but i'm sticking to it

146~~~
want to see him on the wing and not as a striker tbh.

147~~~
Took his goal well. Lovely move that forced a save  from the keeper. Needs to lay of the weights a bit though.

148~~~
It would be bold if you said he will be one of the best in the world <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

149~~~
I'd definitely start him over young at the start of the season. We're going to need our wide players to chip in with goals and he looks a threat every time he's on the ball. Hopefully we see him in a wide position in the next couple of games.

150~~~
Yeah he works on instinct. Got a very good feeling about him.

Maybe that hinders his decision making somewhat, in that he makes his choice so quickly. Like this morning with that shot he took early in the game, he'd made his mind up early to work a shot. Maybe could've played in Mata. But these types of players, I like seeing them express themselves and letting them show us what they can do.

151~~~
My slight worry is that we may be repeating the same mistakes with him that we are making with Di Maria. We are playing the ball to his feet when it seems obvious that his strength is running on to the ball and running into space. Playing him as a no. 10 will inhibit all of his strengths. IMO.

152~~~
Apart from the fact that every attacking player would prefer running onto the ball in space, if possible, what makes you think this is particularly true for Depay? I'll admit I never watched him in Holland but the various youtube clips I've seen usually show him picking the ball up with defenders still to beat, then cutting inside onto his right foot to get a shot off.

153~~~
That's what I meant, maybe I didn't word it right. But he seems to be your traditional inside forward who looks to cut in and score from wide positions. We seem to be using him as a no. 10 so far though which doesn't showcase his talents at all. For example, from what I have seen so far, his passing is nowhere near good enough to play in that position. I could be wrong however. He may have done well as a no. 10 in the past.

Anyway, it is preseaon so probably no reason to get too fussed.

154~~~
Actually if anything, I've been pleasantly surprised with his passing as a #10. Not once has his passing seemed off or anything like that, for a winger like him it's really good actually. He's a very clever and creative player as well and has great movement so he always seems like he'll get a goal/assist whenever he gets on the ball while playing as a 10. The only thing you could say is that his spacial awareness for that position isn't that great yet, and that he gets caught waiting for the ball to come to him so the defender steps in front of him pretty often, but his touch and passing has been very good and creative so far IMO.

One thing I especially like from him there is how his dribbling opens up space for others and Mata/Rooney and him seem to have a very good understanding and find themselves in great positions because of it. Will only get better too.

155~~~
Gotcha. Although I was impressed with the creativity of his passing in the first game. Van Gaal seems to be intent on turning him into a striker anyway, so I guess we shouldn't get too hung up on the position he played at PSV.

156~~~
Looking more and more like Memphis could play a bit of striker next year.

157~~~
It looks very basic but that sort of finish is something we lack throughout our side. Rooney and Mata are good finishers but after that we're a tad stuck. Depay can go a long way to solving that.

158~~~
Yes. His off th ball movements is really nice and he has good instincts as well.

159~~~
His first touch and quickness around the box reminds me of Saha. The finish too. Saha had a flare for hitting the ball that way.

160~~~
Thought he'd be more relentless than he's been. He plays like he's in gear 1 most of the time and that surprises me somewhat. He's got to be more direct and try things more. He does seem to have good natural offensive movement off the ball in the final third which is a good thing as that probably means he'll put up some good numbers.

161~~~
It is pre season to be fair. Nobody really turns up the gears.

162~~~
It's his second 45 mins for us in a pre season match where all players aren't match fit.... he's hardly going to go balls to the wall.

I'm really excited for this kid.

163~~~
Hopefully you're right and he tries to take on his man and make things happen more than he's shown so far.

164~~~
From what I've seen at PSV and even a few times for us he does like to take people on.

Plus we have to remember, as we have seen with Januzaj, I think the days of our swift incisive counter attacks, running at the defence etc are over.

Van Gaal has a philosophy and that involves keeping possession, not losing the ball stupidly etc

It really doesn't benefit players who run at players such as Januzaj.

165~~~
He looks incredibly talented, but doesn't look like a #10 in the slightest.

I hope this is just an experiment, and he's shifted to the wing pronto.

166~~~
I think he is actually a decent Ten, very creative. . great first touch and passing,  can go either way,  good movement and quality finisher. 

For the sake of the side however I think we should utilise him on the wing for now and go 4 3 3. If we don'tbbring in a striker, he'll be a more dangerous 9 than Rooney simply cause he has legs in him and ability to create chances for himself.

167~~~
I just love the stuff he says to the media. He truly cares and there's no doubt he is motivated as hell to have a great career here. 

He has both unbeleivable talent and seemingly equally unbeleivable dedication. A professional like him is destined to reach the top.

168~~~
If anything, that shows he's quite mature. No need to go all out in pre-season games and try too hard, he'll have the regular season to do that. It's good that he's pacing himself.

169~~~
Difficult to judge at the moment with only 90Mins played. Those deft touches remind me a little bit of Berbatov and Cantona, and his occasional off target shooting reminds me a little bit of Ronaldo (2003-2005). He oozes confidence though. So far very impressed, and I think he'll emerge as the buy of the season easily.

170~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

171~~~
I hope LVG won't play in this position for weeks and months only to revert him back to what seems to be his best and most obvious position...

172~~~
Massive as in Shaw's ass?

173~~~
Expect some blunders/awkward interviews from Memphis in the future, he's had a few in his time at PSV. Media handling isn't his strong point and neither is the english language. Luckily he doesn't seem to care about what the media think of him ('I rather let my feet speak') so we can laugh at it, he does care about fans. He doesn't post extremely stupid stuff on his twitter anymore so he is improving/got told off too many times luckily.

174~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I can't wait to see him and Shaw down that left wing together <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

175~~~
They're the " hip youngin's" of the squad, they will band together.

So good to see <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

He speaks great English too!

176~~~
Shawphis/Memphaw

177~~~
Good to see our new man settling in. 

Doesn't look like he is short of confidence, and that is exactly what we need. 

Hopefully that can rub off on some of the other youngsters.

178~~~
Here's the full video of that interview

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2SbZJNfX0M?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

179~~~
Top player

180~~~
That interview just reminds of the good old United days when it was like a family! Not that any of us were there but you could feel it.

181~~~
Sure hope that wasn't under the shower Luke.

182~~~
Do we think he'll be a starter from the off?

Admittedly I'm asking this from a fantasy football angle!  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

183~~~
Haha wait for the Barca game tomorrow, if he starts in that and puts in a performance then I would expect we will see him on day 1.

184~~~
Yeah, good point. Tomorrow's game should give us a better idea about LVG's thinking on him, the midfield three, etc

185~~~
I think so. He's physically really strong and fast so he'll be ready that way, and on the ball he's really talented and has shown that and maturity on the pitch, not wasting or rushing things on the ball. He gives us something our other wingers don't, specifically his goal threat and his pace/strength so for that reason I can see him being one of the first names on the team sheet more often then not this season, right from the off.

186~~~
For those who've watched him regularly...is he better on the left or as a #10?

187~~~
He's definitely a winger.

But he can do a job up front or behind the striker if needed.

188~~~
Definitely not IMO.

189~~~
Well since he's played on the left about 98% of the times in his carreer I'd say he's best there. Van Gaal might see him as a 10 or 9 though.

190~~~
Nice to see Shaw and Memphis entering a relationship

191~~~
That interview is kind of disturbing <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

192~~~
Left or striker

193~~~
I can't get over how much of a tank he is yet so quick. His shoulders are massive.

194~~~
"He calls me massive all the time " <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/> <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

195~~~
Why do you say that? Just wondering as he's been decent so far in pre season and may get more opportunities in the final two games.

196~~~
Theres no way these two aren't in love with each other <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

198~~~
Caf shippers. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

I hope we get to see him play from the left of a front 3, I don't know why LvG would want to convert him to a #10 right off the bat, hopefully it's just a pre-season experiment.

199~~~
Except logic, normal human behaviour, real life...

200~~~
He's very likely to start the game against Spurs. LVG said he will most likely go with tomorrow's lineup for the new season and apparently during today's training session Shaw, Darmian, Jones, Blind; Schneiderlin, Carrick; Mata, Young, Depay and Rooney were training together.

201~~~
Shaw fancies him rotten.

Calves too...

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/25/00/2AB0053300000578-0-image-a-42_1437781161170.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/25/00/2AB0053300000578-0-image-a-42_1437781161170.jpg"/> 

Compared to Blind at least.

202~~~
I think a fair few on here see hima as just a promising young player for now, when in reality, he's far more proven and already quite a good player who is a starter for the national team. No reason why he won't be a starter here. In fact, even if he's still got a lot of developing to do, the qualities he possesses are exactly what our team lacks and doesn't have in anyone else, that's why I'd say if fit, he'll be starting the majority of our games. Even if it was only the Dutch league, the only other player in our squad to have ever had a more productive season then memphis last season was rooney. So for that, and him being physically a tank already, he'll be first choice.

203~~~
I want to see what he can do on the wing, not this second striker nonsense.

204~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

205~~~
This for me too.

He keeps coming in and dropping deep.  Some of that might be down to space from an still sorting midfield, but it really cuts down on the threat he poses.

206~~~
Plus Shaw and him have games naturally suited to one another. Depay cutting in and taking defenders on with trickery and Shaw bursting on the outside. 

Either that or him and Rooney forge a partnership up front.

207~~~
I've yet to see Shaw bursting on the outside (overlapping) with pace, timing and regularity! I hope your right though or he learns this atleast.

208~~~
He did it quite a bit vs Chelsea. I think he has it in him, just didn't have a great season last year

209~~~
Firstly, I doubt we will be playing this formation as it suits nobody in our team. I’m sure van Gaal will go with some kind of 4-3-3. In that case there will only be place for him on the wings, and I doubt LvG will be tinkering with Young/Mata who both had good seasons and were very important for us in the second part of the season. Secondly, I doubt he will be putting so much pressure on the kid. He did brilliantly in dutch league but he will need some time to adjust to this league and more importantly van Gaal philosophy. I know you lot rate him very high but I suppose van Gaal will continue playing the same front 3 that worked last season, we already have a lot of new players in midfield and defence that I guess will be immediate starters. 

Wait and see obviously, but I’m pretty sure I will be proven right 

I don't believe him then. You think he will go with Blind as CB and Carrick in midfield two? I doubt it.

210~~~
TBH I thought that last season with the 3 5 2. I think if we play this formation again today, then he is probably considering it for the Spurs game.

211~~~
Carrick worked well with Cleverley or Anderson next to him, I think it will have better success with Schneiderlin in there as well. van Gaal doesn't play these type of mind games. He says what he thinks and doesn't say anything when he doesn't want to say anything.

212~~~
Midfield two against Barca, seems familiar.

Firstly that was a few years ago, secondly I doubt Anderson worked well with anybody, thirdly we didn’t have enough midfielders to play 3 in the middle. We do now and I’m sure we will.

213~~~
midfield two against barca is suicide. 

it is pre season though. i just don't see why he's acting like 433 doesn't exist.

214~~~
I thought one of the turning points in our form last year as we were dreadful at times. Was Blind moving to left back as much as Carrick playing centre mid. Blinds timing of his over laps were excellent (although I see Shaw being this position long term).

215~~~
He'll improve over time in small things such as timing, and synchronising with the winger. The kid is rapid which will obviously help. Depay himself will most likely have a lot to improve on as well.

216~~~
I wonder who's faster; Memphis or Shaw? I know at first glance it looks an easy decision, but I've seen Shaw fly past players in games.

217~~~
From the little I've seen of Depay I'd definitely say Shaw.

218~~~
Workmen players like Young were very good for us because their industry helped us disguise weaknesses we had in midfield and defence but having spent loads in solidifying our midfield you would surely expect the manager to go with highly productive players in offensive positions. Last season we created and scored a few goals below the standard we expect from a club of our ambitions, that has to be addressed. And addressing it entails playing creative and prolific players and also giving those players the license to thrill. In this respect Depay wins over Young all day, everyday.
Supported by a midfield duo of Schweinsteiger/Carrick and Schneiderlin, a front four like this
-----------Rooney----------
Depay----Di Maria----Mata
will have everything and the ability to interchange will bring in the unpredictability we need.

219~~~
So... Depay as a #10. What do we think? He's barely had any experience at the top level and yet it looks as though LvG is entrusting him with the most important position in the team.

220~~~
Di Maria could swap with mata but that's a quality front 4 on paper,

221~~~
Eh?

He does that pretty much every single game.

222~~~
Not sure what games your watching Sam. The games I'm at it's frustrating watching the timing of his runs and his reluctance to burst forward. It's like he's worried about either going forward or not getting back.

223~~~
When we were playing the 3-5-2 he definitely looked a bit reluctant, like he wasn't 100% sure when he should be making his forward runs, but thats not surprising since he's never played in that system. By the end of the season though, once we were back to a regular back 4, he was bombing on all the time down that flank. He was especially good at it against Chelsea and Everton away.

224~~~
He is about to get that number 7 jersey if these Di Maria rumours are true...

225~~~
EDIT: I think it's high time we started giving players only when they have been class for 3 or more seasons.

226~~~
So basically no one gets the number 7 shirt.

227~~~
Pretty much.

228~~~
Its meant to inspire the player, not a reward.

229~~~
Well it doesn't seem to have worked not since Ronaldo anyway and he'd still have been world class in a #57 jersey.

230~~~
Sideburns gone. Thank feck for that.

231~~~
Really enjoying watching him play. A bit of flair, a bit of pace...

232~~~

233~~~
Mixed game so far, would love to see him on the wings tbh

234~~~
Really like him so far

235~~~
Thought he was poor this first half.

236~~~
Some of those little flicks in the middle of the park were <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

237~~~
We finally have a player that makes decisive runs behind the defence without the ball. Shame Mata hasn't caught up to it yet. He could've played him through twice. He's definately ready for a starting place here.

238~~~
Probably makes sense to move him onto the wings in the 2nd half.

239~~~
Is there a context to this tweet? Have found "one" what?

240~~~
He basically means we've found a very good player. Think he's there tonight watching.

241~~~
Great to have some arrogance back in the team. We've missed that.

242~~~
Agreed. Before people call him a Ronaldo clone, he is a very unique player in his own right.. he has a great 'feel' for the game, natural flair. His runs looked very dangerous, such a shame his movement was not rewarded.

243~~~
A lot of his runs should have been picked out in that first half but was pretty good overall I thought. He'll be a star for us IMO.

244~~~
He he looks so confident of himself.

245~~~
He definitely oozes confidence.

246~~~
His playing style is very similar to Alexis Sanchez, isn't it?

247~~~
Both Depay and Pereira seem to have that insane self belief that makes you think - United player.

248~~~
Thought in the first half some of his passes were abit sloppy apart from some lovely flicks that he made. Second half tho he was much improved and nearly provided a moment of magic with that turn inside the box but didn't quite catch the shot. I think it just makes a nice change to see a player with such pace and unpredictability that we have lacked for a number of years now. I would still like to see him play of the wing as well but another good performance form young tonight shoes that it's not going to be easy to force himself onto they wing.

249~~~
I thought his movement and desire to get on the ball was good.  Unfortunately, he wasn't able to hold the ball up in the middle (maybe he should be deployed out wide) and was not accurate in many of his passes.  To be fair, as others have stated, I thought he was off a few times in the first half but we weren't able to see the play and make the pass.

250~~~
Just oozes class. Some of his tricks and flicks were a joy to watch.

251~~~
Has LVG explained why it is him central and not Mata?

252~~~
Van Gaal mentioned that Barca 'couldn't cope' with Rooney and Depay. Might be seeing more of Depay in #10 this season.

253~~~
I like him as a 10. Gaals comments certainly suggest he's there to stay. He compensates for a lack of pace through the middle. But he did give the ball away now and again.  And at times, thought he should have been a bit more selfish but he opted to find Rooney, which I think might be what gaal picked up on in regards "thinking too much" about they interaction together.

254~~~
I can only imagine it's because he does a lot more running off the ball than Mata and gives us that drive through middle, which can be dangerous on the counter.

255~~~
Most likely this. He's also more of a goal threat and Van Gaal likes his #10's to be always those decisive players, who score and assist a lot.

256~~~
Also Mata drifts in quite a bit so its not that much of a problem.

Its good to have pace and quality for a counter attack. He will only get better especially his linkup with Rooney which you see signs of.

257~~~
An attacker of ours that doesn't make me throw things at the TV or stick pins in my eyes. Wonderful stuff and still much room for improvement.

258~~~
When Rooney gets his touch up to speed, I can see the two of them being excellent together this year.
At his best, Rooney is excellent at putting others through and Memphis has the pace and movement to get into excellent positions.

The two of them should be spending 2 hours a day watching videos of Rooney and Ronaldo from 2008.

259~~~
Loved his little backheels to kick start counter attacks. It's nice to see that United can still counter attack!

260~~~
Little flicks like those are vital to quick counter attacks and something we've missed... Like pretty much all our great counter attacking goals with Rooney and Ronaldo had those little flicks to start the moves off.

261~~~
He's brilliant. And I think <a class="username" data-user="61592, @bosnian_red" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61592/">@bosnian_red</a> is spot on. He adds alot of energy,  drive and pace through the middle and Mata comes inside anyway to link up like David Silva for city

262~~~
Any chance he'll be on pens for us this season?

263~~~
Strength.

264~~~
NL Max said he was pretty poor at pens.

265~~~
I think he is quite impressive. Seems in a very 'friendly' zone though, same with Rooney. Hopefully he really comes good in competitive games.

266~~~
Individual highlights for those who care

Edit; The video was shite, will find a better one
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XSDCx1PztIg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

267~~~
Such an exciting player, I don't think he'll be eased in as many keep suggesting, I reckon LvG is counting on him hitting the ground running. I'd still rather see him on the left than as a #10 though.

268~~~
He just has 'it'. Whatever 'it' actually is.

But he definitely has it.

269~~~
The X-factor.

270~~~
The mixture of physical, technical and mental ability. The latter in particular has impressed me in his press conferences. He's cool, calm, collected and poised to become great. He's easily my favorite signing of the summer and one of my favorites in a United jersey this year.

271~~~
Agree, he'll definitely be a starter from the off. Not sure why he'd need to be eased in anyway. He's a very confident player, has bags of ability, and is physically clearly ready. Also he's not just some promising youngster, but he's also developed and mature enough to be first choice.

272~~~
If anything I think he'd suffer more from being held back, he's so confident and as you say physically he's ready, absolutely tailor made for the PL, we need to unleash him from the get go and see if he can continue on his scoring path from last season.

273~~~
Agree, there's no need at all to hold him back. It doesn't make any sense to either as he's clearly ready. He also offers so many qualities that we lack throughout the rest of the time, and because of that I feel like he'll always be in the team basically.

274~~~
Depay looks a different player for us than he does for Holland so far. The Depay at United looks more conservative, and tidy whereas the Depay I saw at Holland looks much more explosive who takes more risk. It is still early times, but hopefully it will not be long to see this Depay on a consistent basis for United.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oEiRR0TEQ_o?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Maybe it is his positioning that is currently holding him back.

275~~~
Shaw is fecking rapid.

276~~~
He's doing alright through the middle, good movement etc, but I think him and Mata need to switch, Mata needs to be in that central role with Depay out wide, will free him up to run at players and showcase his dribbling and can cut inside etc.

Would thrive out wide for us from watching him.

277~~~
Loved the back heel passes.Which kept him going forward.

278~~~
Think he could help us more out wide breaking forward with more space but liked the chance he created for himself. Turned the defender well, just a pity he couldn't loft it

279~~~
I don't love his performances in the number ten position yet.

280~~~
Maybe sticking him in the middle, will teach him to make decisions and when to play the ball. The one criticism iv'e read of him is that his decision making is very erratic. Sticking him in the middle, gives him a lot less freedom than on the wings.

281~~~
I like what I've seen of him in the middle so far. Definitely preferable to him playing on the wing. It really wouldn't surprise me to see him and Rooney exchange roles as the season went on. Kinda like Rooney and Hernandez did a few years back,

282~~~
I rather give Depay more freedom, but if Depay becomes a better player playing centrally, I am all for it.

283~~~
Gaaly on Memphis-Rooney combo:

Am I the only one who gets the feeling from that that we will eventually go back to the 4-3-3, which naturally has a more wider approach when it comes to the forwards?

284~~~
Just wanted to add that I feel Memphis will really compliment Rooney's play, because when Rooney drops for the ball, Memphis will always try and run in behind. Yesterday there were a few occasions when he was through but we didn't pick him out. 

Having said that, I only think we had that space because Barca play with a very high line like ourselves. Be interesting to see how he gets on when we play teams that play with eleven men behind the ball, because we really struggled against teams like that last season.

285~~~
I hope so! Its very hard to understand LVG's comments at times though.

286~~~
yea,

that's him basically saying they'll link up and be able to find eachother better when depay is wide and rooney is central.

maybe playing them together is intentional for the footballing relationship.

287~~~
Not sure it has anything to with that, because by the sound of things, he's happy with how Memphis and Rooney have been doing down the middle. I just think he means playing with a bit more width, and making sure the wingers don't cut in too early.

Remember someone saying the other day how impressed Van Gaal was with Lingard for keeping the width, in comparison to Mata, who came in too early at times and closed the space.

Also, if you look at our second goal yesterday, Wilson kept the width, which stretched Barca. From there, Blackett was able to make the overlap and we scored.

288~~~
Those comments from Van Gaal suggest that we're looking at another option for right wing. Pedro, I guess.

289~~~
Sounds like Van Gaal is saying its good Memphis and Rooney are passing to each other a lot but sometimes he prefers when we pass the ball out wide.

290~~~
What comments? I don't think we need a right winger at all

291~~~
Ye that sounds spot on to me.

292~~~
I wouldn't advise that to any team, because he will shoot from distance and can score every time. That's the problem with players like him or Bale, you play deep they shoot as if the hunting season was open and if you play high they run behind you.

293~~~
And how often will they score from these shots? Not very often I would say.

294~~~
Finally a New United number 7 that fits the role.

295~~~
Well, four or five time per season, should be enough.

296~~~
Often enough for teams to see it as a big threat and try and stop it.
The lack of players with this ability lately has been one of the reasons we have struggled with teams who keep 11 men behind the ball tbh

297~~~
When he said "it should be better when we have a wider orientation" it sounds as though he prefers a winger who holds the width.

298~~~
That, or as <a class="username" data-user="28799, @AttackingFlair" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28799/">@AttackingFlair</a> said, using the wings more often, instead of just passing to each other all the time. Notice Van Gaal said sometimes they look for each other too much. '<i>Yes I think they try to do their utmost best to look for each other and <b>sometimes I think too much</b></i>'.

299~~~
"when we have a wider orientation" implies some sort of systemic shift to facilitate that, although there's probably not too much point in analyzing the finer nuances of Van Gaal's english. It's just a guess.

300~~~
I guess it could be interpreted in two ways..

a) The wider orientation coming from when Memphis himself, when he is wide, not central
b) The wider orientation coming from other players (maybe Pedro in for Mata?)

301~~~
No, the lack of a Hazard or Messi player has. That's exactly the same reason why Real Madrid couldn't break Juve down and why Barca could. Ronaldo and Bale needs space to be dangerous. Messi doesen't.

That's a worry this season. Depay and Di Maria (or Pedro) is great, direct players (like Bale). But who's gonna play the final ball in our team?

302~~~
Quite like the Memphis Rooney partnership. Think he's done well in this free-roam position to be honest.

303~~~
Memphis 7. Knew it all along!

304~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

305~~~
Was just about to post that, brilliant finish.

306~~~
Are those United booty shorts available to buy?

307~~~
Memphis is built like Hazard and Overmars. Short attackers with great speed and power.

308~~~
Goalkeeper should have come for the ball, sell him <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

309~~~
His thighs are huge.

310~~~
Looked really sharp today. Really strong at holding up the ball and has really quick feet to turn defenders. We just need to feed the ball into him more. He's class though, think he'll have a great season.

311~~~
He will have a very frustrating season if his partner up front doesn't step up.

312~~~
Needs to bulk up.

313~~~
Looks creative without actually creating very much on tour.

314~~~
He lacks the subtlety for that #10 role, that's either Mata, Herrera or Fellaini's job. Put him out wide and let him take on some defenders, his strength and quickness should help him get some purchase there.

315~~~
He looked out of place centrally at times. He didn't seem to have the level of awareness and off the ball movement needed to play there.

316~~~
In my opinion he is a bit raw still. Wasteful with the ball a lot of the time and really doesn't have the close control to play in that role.

Of course it's early days.

317~~~
His power and control allows him to protect the ball well centrally but I think we are denying him his chance to really shine with more space on the left to run at defenses, especially given how limited the quality of our options out wide are.

318~~~
Also to add on, anything creative or exciting we seem to do goes through him. He's the only one willing to try flicks or to make a chance. Just want him to be a bit more selfish and have a shot at goal instead of looking for the pass all the time which he was guilty of today.

319~~~
He oozes class. Will be a fantastic player for us once he gets a few full speed Prem games under his belt.

320~~~
Was on a different level  (a higher one) to the other attackers. If we are so determined not to play him on the left, I'd try him as a 9.

321~~~
I wish we'd play him out wide, he's looked good in the middle without actually doing a whole lot.

322~~~
I don't understand the American commentators' criticisms of him.  Thought he was one of the bright spots.

323~~~
I'm with you on that one.  I think with a little space, an isolated defender and the ability to cut in he'd wreck hell in the Prem.  

I am starting to wonder if van Gaal has slotted him behind Rooney to provide dynamism.  It's been a bit sense Rooney was a force to be reckoned with.  Memphis adds something there in a stale area.

324~~~
Just filling in until Fellaini is available then Memphis will be competing with Young for the left.

325~~~
Needs to play out wide.

326~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ruYVvYF8J84?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Showed how strong he is more then ever yesterday. Held off David Luiz and Thiago silva every time without a problem surprisingly, and showed his quick thinking and great touch on the ball as well. Really think he'll have a great season. 

My one complaint would be that he should be more selfish IMO and take the shot more often instead of looking for a little pass or an extra dribble once he gets to the edge of the box. He opens up a yard of space for himself really well and he should just shoot right away as he has a great shot on him. Maybe it's under LvG's instructions to not take the shot unless it's a clear chance, but it should change if so.

327~~~
I really wish he would, Young always has more space than him to work with (but he's no Neymar <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>) and I'd love to see what Memphis could do when running at a full back full pelt instead of this playmaking role he's doing at the moment.

328~~~
Showed glimpses of what he's capable of, but he needs to improve his defensive workrate/awareness. At times he stuck close to Verratti, but lost him more and more as the game went on. His hold up play is immense and his quick turns are a joy to watch.

329~~~
Exciting pre-season from him. Played some nice flicks and showed composure and strength to hold the ball. My only criticism would be that sometimes he holds the ball for a bit too long when early release might be more effective. Still early days though and I've no doubt that he'll be a great player for us for years to come.

330~~~
happy to see memphis more than likely getting the #7 shirt. 2 young talents in our 11 and 7 shirts this season will make me feel proud. He is gonna be great for us. i just know it. Been great in preseason in my eyes

331~~~
Probably our only attacking player who looks even slightly good enough for a 'top' team.

332~~~
No.

333~~~
We will drag him down soon enough I'm sure

334~~~
Probably agree with you, but I can see why someone would make the vague comparison. It's probably like Sanchez being a "Messi" type of player, while Memphis is more of a "Ronaldo" type of player.

335~~~
I'm not saying that you say these things as you said you aren't of that opinion - but anyone who says someone is a '____ type player' is simplifying the game way too much in almost all cases.

336~~~
Our new #7 if everything goes as planned?   Seems to be the type that wants to take the pressure and thrive under it. I'd say go ahead.

337~~~
I don't know what LVG is thinking putting Depay in the middle. He looks good, but there are quite a few players who deserve the spot in the middle than he does imo.

338~~~
You think Fellaini will be a weekly starter this season?

339~~~
He has that spark and confidence about him, he looks like a game changer, he surprised me too with his range of passing, he is a little selfish close to goal but if he develops that is no harm, was good to see his energy in the friendlies rather than rvp strolling around with his hands on his hips.

340~~~
Really excited to see what him and Rooney can produce together. They've linked up really well in pre season.

341~~~
rooney, memphis and pedro (we should get him) is a brilliant front 3.

not quite the messi-neymar-suarez or ronaldo-benzema-bale level but still a PL capable winning front line imo. we already got the midfield and just one top CB short from being a very very strong side.

342~~~
M7 lads. It's happening or shall happen. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

343~~~
Pedro might still get 7, although I would love it if Memphis gets it.

344~~~
We've had some right disastrous number 7s since Ronaldo left. Curse? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

345~~~
Everything about Memphis just screams United #7 imo.

346~~~
Yep. I reckon this lad has the balls for it!

347~~~
Think Pedro will get 9 and Memphis 7 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

348~~~
Something to cheer us up after Di Maria leaving <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

349~~~
Photo going around of Memphis with the #9 in stores.

350~~~
Di Maria could easily get those numbers in the Dutch league to be fair.

351~~~
True, he probably could but he still should of done better here and made it a bit more respectable

352~~~
Think people are expecting too much of a player who hasn't done it at a top level yet. Worry that if he has a few poor games the fans will turn.

353~~~
I don't think the fans will be too impatient with him. A lot of fans really stuck with Falcao for much of the year, and to some extent Di Maria. Those two are proven players where big things were expected, quite rightly. We know Memphis is still young and unproven, so I don't think the fans are going to hammer him if he has a few iffy games.

Januzaj had a poor year last season, but a lot here still have high hopes for him and want him to be given chances. I think similar patience will be afforded to Memphis as well. Or at least I'd hope so anyway.

354~~~
For the most part United fans are patient. The majority of United fans are excited about this kid and seeing how he develops so I'd imagine he'll be given time, at least a season to show his worth. Heck, many of us here and elsewhere protected Di Maria from criticism last year hoping he'd prove himself this year, Sadly it wasn't to be.

355~~~
He seems extremely big headed and arrogant in his own ability. Exactly what we need after our last two no.7's proving mentally weak. And the one before that being a decade too late.

356~~~
I was thinking the reverse.

357~~~
We're - well, I am -  expecting him to be like Ronaldo/Rooney when they were 20. Unreliable, but with ability to influence our season positively.

358~~~
No pressure then!

359~~~
From Christmas onwards people on here were fed up with di Maria.

360~~~
A full season and 10 goals from the wings? Too much?

361~~~
I only read now and again before I joined up. Surprising to hear that but I suppose you can't please all the people all the time. In a Facebook Man United group and most the posters there were patient with him based on his early season form and thought that after a summer break and a good pre season he'd turn it around again.

362~~~
Will be wasted in the middle, needs to be out wide.

Then he will start racking up the numbers.

363~~~
Let's hope it doesn't end up like the last one who asked for the number 7......

Although, this guy has the attitude, mindset and composure to handle it......Sort of guy who'll make it is own, whether we like it or not.

Cocky slag <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> ....I like that

364~~~
Wouldn't say fed up, more frustrated and concerned at that point. Fed up was more after the Arsenal red card, which was sheer stupidity. But agreed that until it was clear he was leaving, felt like most thought he could come back in a big way this season. Optimism was high after he had a good Copa America.

Anyway we move on. Good to see how Memphis has already integrated himself into the squad. Should bode well.

365~~~
He is more self confident than the last guy and he genuinely loves being at United unlike that other guy.

366~~~
Letting Michael Owen down these players

367~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9940074/memphis-depay-handed-manchester-united-no-7-shirt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/football/n...his-depay-handed-manchester-united-no-7-shirt</a>

M7 official. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

368~~~
Since he signed I felt he'd get the #7. Feels quite normal.

369~~~
He scored 22 including 7 FKs? I knew he was good and all but those numbers are nuts. Esp for an AM.

370~~~
I am excited to watch him tomorrow.

371~~~
Me too. Hoping for an instant impact.

372~~~
Looking forward to seeing him tomorrow...seems to have the personality/swagger of a United winger.

373~~~
That's just in the league, in the Europa league he also scored 6 goals in 9 appearances.

374~~~
Wow. Hope he has better season than AdM last year.

375~~~
Great to see him getting the 7. Where as some like Valencia shy away from the attention, he will take it on his shoulders and use it to give him even more strength.

His style draws a lot of comparisons with ronaldo, but his confidence and attitude is the most similar. Can't wait for him go get going <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

376~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

377~~~
He really does have that Ronaldo-like self determination to be the absolute best he can be. Its fantastic.

He seems to strike that balance between self belief/ego and hard work perfectly. Really, really excited to see him in action this season.

378~~~
If not his ability then its his hard work that will drag him on to become one of the best players

379~~~
It's jusr frustrating cause you see like Mata being played out wide and Depay central and it's like arrgh just swap them!

380~~~
I am already counting on him to score today and get us 3 points.

381~~~
We will see how he does, but in terms of attitude, we need players like him. Young, hungry, fresh, players wanting to play for United and happy to be playing for United.

382~~~
Ideally would like to see him on the wing, but still excited regardless. You just get the sense that he's ready for this league.

383~~~
He speaks very well for a young player, and a foreign player. He just oozes confidence.

384~~~
How can we be playing a 4-3-3 in any way when we have Depay playing as a second striker

385~~~
He will be in huge shock, the relative difference between United and PSV is huge.

386~~~
Play him on the wing for feck sake.

387~~~
He's been good so far IMO.

388~~~
I'm gonna love this guy, I can tell already.

389~~~
He's class.

390~~~
You can tell that he's going to be quality. Doesn't seem fazed at all by it.

We've lacked a bit of arrogance in the side.

391~~~
So obvious he's going to be great for us.

392~~~
Kept it tidy and tried some stuff, but hardly a great performance so far. Just saying.

393~~~
There's a chasm between the midfield and the forwards, he's not really a #10, he's playing just off of Rooney and there's no one connecting the midfield to them.

394~~~
Yep. He's not had much chance to shine, to be fair.

395~~~
We've been saying exactly that here, he's got that swagger about him.

396~~~
Totally unfazed and clearly immensely talented. He'll be a star player for us sooner rather than later.

397~~~
Pretty good half from him. I can sort of see why Lvg wants to play him in the middle. On one hand he looks very clearly like a wide attacker, on the other hand Rooney is not the same player as he used to be physically so Memphis adds some power through the middle. If we had someone like Costa I don't think we'd be seeing Memphis in the middle.

398~~~
Nothing special so far,  hopefully a better 2nd half

399~~~
I want to see more. hes been tidy without much else.

400~~~
He shouldn't play behind Rooney, he hasnt been doing well imo. Play him on the wing where he has more space and he will be deadly

401~~~
He was very shy, but he did the basic stuff good, decent so far.

402~~~
Good performance so far. He's an absolute beast as well.

403~~~
He has been average since we have bought him. His only goal was by a mistake from pre-season, whereas his highlights are mostly by good flicks and nice touches. Nevertheless, it is still early on and it will take some time for him to settle.

404~~~
Not a good performance. Early days though.

405~~~
I certainly wouldn't call it a bad one either.

406~~~
Good performance I thought. Strong on the ball.

407~~~
I would describe his Utd performances so far as having 'glimpses' of what is still to come. He had a couple of lovely runs and flicks today that were almost right but not quite there yet. I'm convinced that with more game time as the team settles down he will be a fantastic player for us this season.

408~~~
Really wish LVG would play him on the left wing where he thrives. He was decent in the middle but it's not the same.

409~~~
Looked good in first half but was very anonymous in the second all in all a descent debut for him.

410~~~
He's also learning a new position. Don't know why we don't interchange during the match. Must be a LVG thing,

411~~~
I thought that was a decent performance from him. Nothing overall spectacular, but showed lots of promise and you know he is going to be a cracking player for us this season.

412~~~
Every single good thing he did was when his starting position was out on the flank.

413~~~
Along with playing players out of position.

414~~~
Okay performance. Doesn't really look like much of a number 10. Also, he looked a lot slower than I expected. People were saying he is rapid.

415~~~
Looks quite confined and restricted in the middle. I know the logic behind it he's obviously got goalscoring instincts, but we lack a driven, penetrative and arrogant player on the wings. 

So many times today we were waiting for someone to burst and it was usually Darmian or Shaw.

416~~~
No the mistake your making is that he doesn't have rapid acceleration however, once he gets up to speed he's rapid indeed.

417~~~
A little bit poor from him. Mishit the passes, didn't have close control and didn't look threatening at all. Bit early though, EPL is a big step-up for him. Glad he's  mentally ready.

418~~~
Its part of his stupid philosophy , if you hear him, he said he buys and chooses players who can play in more than one position, hence his penchant of playing players out of position all the time

Pretty stupid if you ask me, fair enough if your squad is injury depleted, you make a player fill up that role, but if theres no injuries, whats the point of not playing a player in his best position

419~~~
He has a fantastic acceleration, but isn't a speedster over long distance. Not slow by any means but he isn't as rapid as many wingers are.

420~~~
He's showing promise right now but it can all go to waste if we keep fecking around with his position. Why aren't we just playing him on the wing? Someone educate me with what he brings centrally that he can't on the wing because I don't see it.

421~~~
Quite average today.

422~~~
In that case, he needs to start out wide. If we have to make use of his pace from the middle he needs great acceleration given he's not your usual technical, playmaking number 10.

423~~~
We lost any bit of attacking impetus when he came off... But he was quiet. Class when he got the ball, but didn't get on it too much. We only ever look like creating when he gets the ball though.

424~~~
You're both saying the exact opposite thing.

425~~~
Him and Mata switching positions will be the topic of the season and so far rightfully so.

426~~~
Replace Young with Depay and it opens up all sorts of other options for us in the middle since we have 700 players who can comfortably play there.

427~~~
He was more eager to receive the ball than Rooney or Mata. He actually looked pissed off when he was substituted <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

428~~~
Well from watching him play he doesn't have those small players acceleration like hazard or sterling, he has longer burners like bale or Sanchez

429~~~
Looks like he built too much muscle to be quick off his feet.

430~~~
Not a huge fan of him in that position. I don't think he did well. Ultimately he should be tried out on the wing I think.

431~~~
Yeh totally agree that's what we should be doing

432~~~
Looked good when he came out wide, less so in the middle of the park.

433~~~
For the future providing we sign Pedro, would love to see this.

Darmian----Smalling---Rojo----Shaw
-----------Carrick-------
------Herrera-----Schneiderlin
Pedro------------------Depay
----------Rooney---------

Or this if LVG persists with the current formation.

Darmian-------Smalling----Rojo----Shaw

--------Schweinsteiger-----
----Herrera-----------------
Pedro--------Mata--------Depay
------------Rooney

434~~~
His hold up play was great. He looks like a huge presence.

His pace is wasted in the middle though as he never has space to run at. All the times Young had Walker one on one and couldn't get past him, Memphis could have rinsed him if he was on the left.

435~~~
It's definately his acceleration which he's great at, not his topspeed. He's been caught up many times over long distance at PSV, never in short bursts when he can get a pass/shot off. His topspeed isn't bad at all, but he's no Bale/Navas. Not sure why <a class="username" data-user="95327, @TrustInJanuzai" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95327/">@TrustInJanuzai</a> thinks otherwise.

436~~~
Hope he gets an increase of a will to pass the ball more often. It'll come. Still quite excited about him.

437~~~
Yep that's our best team in my opinion

438~~~
That doesn't make much sense. Have you seen the physiques of 100m runners?

439~~~
That's what it looked for me. He doesn't look very nimble and swift in his initial burst. Or maybe it's more to do with the position which stifles him and forces him to play like a number 9.

440~~~
In which case he not quick then because I would class players with quick acceleration as hazard, sterling even Messi, from what I've seen of him he has nowhere near that sharp speed and instead look like he takes longer strides to get going.

441~~~
You have a point I guess.

442~~~
Cheers. Hopefully he expresses it more in games to come. In this system it's the burst that matters more than the full speed.

443~~~
He'll come good, of that I'm convinced. It'll take some time, and there will be a few ups and downs, but I've no doubt that he'll become one of the biggest stars in the Premier League. He has the confidence, and the ability and physique to boot.

444~~~
Yeh that could also be true as I thought the service to our strikers today was horrendous

445~~~
I guess there are differences though, he can have rapid acceleration in a straight line without being nimble when he twists and turns.

446~~~
Didn't make alot of noise. Can LvG just please play him on the wing, that's where he'll get the most out of his skillset.

447~~~
On the flip side, our strike force is nothing great either. If young does his usual whipping of crosses in we have such little presence in the box to bother defenders. No one turns a defender, or has great hold up ability. I genuinely feel the front three is our biggest weakness as opposed to the defence as some feel. Which is why I'm hoping Rooney brings back his best somehow.

448~~~
I'd rather him as a second striker than no 10, he can be a Tevez kind of player in the future. If not, just put him on the wing.

449~~~
Had a couple of good moments in the first half but didn't get into the second half and looked annoyed to be brought off, tough start for him given he is also out of position.

450~~~
Playing him with his back to goal a lot is quite limiting. He looked very dangerous when he played of Mata at one point in the first and as an inside winger he can play off Rooney and move in. It's weird to see him as a second striker.

451~~~
I don't think Rooney was that poor today, we just had too large a gap between the midfield and the strikers which meant that the ball wasn't going into Rooney and Memphis enough up top. I honestly believe it doesn't matter who you stick upfront in this team at the moment they won't perform until the midfield service improves. One thing that would massively help that is to go with a proper 4-3-3 with Herrera starting as he he drives the ball through the midfield and then has the eye for a killer pass. People are seriously underestimating this problem in my opinion.

452~~~
I dont understand how Depay's getting higher rating than Rooney? Depay's had his moments but I think Rooney contributed a lot more to the team, even though he didn't get on the scoresheet.

Rooney was relentless with his closing down and forcing Spurs' defense to move the ball out quickly. Forced a few bad passes out of them in the process as well.

453~~~
His performance dropped in the second half, but I felt he looked really good in the first. Held it up well, showed some nice skill and dribbling and played some nice passes.

454~~~
It's the classic new-signing match analysis. Memphis was average. Although he does look so much more comfortable running on the wings.

455~~~
Would be good to see him swap with Mata and go on the wing when he's struggling down the middle. As with Rooney not much to feed off, was a really scrappy game.

456~~~
Just a question, what do people think Memphis his strong points are? I've read many comments saying he'll be much better on the left wing (I don't disagree mind) but the arguments they give for it are mostly flawed. 

At PSV he's played everything as left winger (at senior level) but as he progressed he rarely stayed on the left wing to just beat his man. You'd see him in front of the rightback, filling in for the striker, in the middle pulling the strings etc. He was allowed to roam all over the pitch because he has good vision/passing aswell and he was basically involved in all their attacks even if he didn't score/assist. He is a complete forward and not just a one-trick pony, he's developping his game to more than just beating his man.

What I do agree with is that at LW he can beat the offside trap, has a bit more room to dribble and ofcourse he's much more experienced there. When I look at his skillset I see no reason why he can't play centrally though. I think he might be a bit too short for 9 (not usefull for crosses) but the 10 is very important in van Gaal's system, if he sees Memphis as long term plan I'd see that as a huge compliment. I really don't mind the experiment that much.

457~~~
A great deal of the "he'll be much better on the left wing" is made up of unspoken "he'll damn sure be better than Young".

458~~~
Me neither. We just have to give him the ball more to do his thing, as we are too content to play it slowly around the back 4 currently without trying anything. Him at #10, when he gets the ball, is perfectly fine though and shows huge promise IMO. His hold up play, passing, strength has all been very good. It's just a matter of passing it forward quickly so he has the space to turn and run at the defence.

459~~~
Give it one game, I'd love to see that.

460~~~
His strongest point is probably the one that he doesn't have any visible weaknesses to his attacking play in the age of 21. It's just that people been waiting so long for someone in the mood of Ronnie or even Nani they want him to be a classic winger badly but with his range of talent he probably can make it everywhere upfront, indeed.

461~~~
I think we should be patient with him, moving from the Eredivisie to the Premier League is a huge step in itself. But the relative difference between PSV and United is huge too. PSV were by far the best team in the league last season, and with players like Wijnaldum, Guardado; Luuk de Jong, Willems they played excellent and fluid attacking football which resulted in a lot of variety, and a lot of clear cut chances and at the end goals. We arent like PSV, we dont create a lot of chances, have a slow build up and we have very little creativity in our final third. This changes the role for Memphis a lot, because now he'll have to have his share in the creating, and be much more clinical as we barely create chances during matches. While at PSV, although playing wide he was more like Ronaldo. Getting in the box, making runs, positioning as a striker occasionaly; having space to dribble in the final third. It will be interesting to see how fast he'll get used to our play and the PL. Being played out of position doesnt really help him too.

462~~~
Thought he was good in the first half. He assisted* the goal and slid a lovely one through to Young who really should have scored or at least worked the keeper but opted to take a touch and cross with his left instead.

As it wore on he tried to write the headlines himself though with some daft long shots when better options were on and he was anonymous in the 2nd half.

Promising start IMO.


*kind of

463~~~
I'd love to see that too

464~~~
I'm all for him as a number 10, he is such a talent. Immediately, he would be better on the wing, but long term. Let's make him our focal

465~~~
I think his best talent is his ability to tear away down the left with pace, power and dribbling. Whenever i have seen him play, that is where he has been most effective.

466~~~
One year ago I would've agreed with this, but last year he has developped his overal game so much that it would be a waste for him to only do this imo. He became much more influental for PSV when he got the freedom to roam and wasn't stuck to the wing. He can do much more than just beating what in front of him and breaking away with pace, I actually like him central where he will get the ball more often to make things happen. That's what really benefitted him last season, he was the star man and the go-to guy to make things happen if PSV failed to break an opponent down, he could do the same for us at 10.

Especially since van Gaal's 10s are extremely high up the pitch (by instruction) and I also think he compensates (on paper for now) nicely for the weaknesses of Rooney. I think with both Mata and Memphis out wide we would be far too narrow as both come inside too much to be balanced. Young at least keeps the width well on the left for now. His best position for now is obviously LW, but testing him at 10 isn't stupid or stubborn at all from van Gaal. If it works out he could make that position his own, the downfall for him could be losing possesion too much and that means he will need to adapt.

467~~~
Thought he was bang average and quite frustrating today tbh. He was involved in one good piece of play but that was about it. Then again, I could write the same exact thing for any of our attacking players today and it would still be true. 

I am confident he will come good however and really feel he should be moved to the wing.

468~~~
I trust LVG but I'll be super frustrated if he doesn't at least trial him on the wing, we now have about half the number of players in world football who can play in the 10, can't say the same for our flanks.

469~~~
His best contribution to the game (and our best move of the game) was when he combined with Rooney and Mata just outside the box---with him playing one-twos while cutting in from the wing.

470~~~
Looked a primadonna when taken off, a few nice touches, but otherwise a forgetable debut.

471~~~
If Pedro comes how do you see LVG using him?

472~~~
I think his confidence is his best ability. It's half the battle when you're got the number 7, exception and a big fee. Quiet debut though.

473~~~
To be fair it's a lot easier to be integral in the buildup and central in all aspects in a smaller league. There's less time in the premier league and you have be better to excel in that aspect. Valencia if I'm not mistaken has played centrally for his country to increase his influence. His influence isn't good enough to warrant being central at United.

474~~~
Huh? Why?

475~~~
Play him on the fecking left Louis

476~~~
He'll come good.

Decent debut.  Nothing spectacular but he sure is confident.  Makes me confident too.

477~~~
Difficult to tell since Pedro is so comfortable with his left. He will most likely play on either wing though, he hasn't really got the physique to play in the middle I don't think. It also depends if Memphis can transform into a van Gaal 10- he has the all the needed attributes but has to learn alot still. If he can't he will most likely claim the left wing spot meaning Pedro plays on the right. 

Ofcourse it's a big step up, for what it's worth I also think he'll take longer adapting if he continues at 10 since it's a different role. What I meant to say was is that it isn't all that different from when he left PSV though, at that time he had progressed his overall game so much (he really did improve so <i>much</i> more after the WC) that the team actually played worse if Memphis didn't roam around and just made things happen. He's no ordinary winger, he rarely keeps width and has much more in his locker than what some people expect him to do. He became much more influental once he learned to do more than just cutting inside so I can fully understand van Gaal's decision to play him central and try to get the most out of him. He is so complete going forward at only 21 that a position change might benefit our team greatly in the long run, if he can't adapt he'll make a great left winger though.

478~~~
I think people see him as a Ronaldo-type, who should be deployed in the same position: on the left wing with full freedom to roam inside.  Also, many want to see Mata/Herrera deployed where he is currently, with Adnan being groomed to be the future #10 instead.  

With LVG's comments about holding the width, maybe he doesn't want Mata and Memphis on the wings at the same time since Mata would do much the same (roam centrally).  And this is just a case of getting all his best forwards on the pitch, same as last year with the diamond.  Perhaps this will change if we make a big signing (a la Pedro).

479~~~
I think he needs to gradually introduced into the team and earn his spot..they are players in this team that have proven that they are better premier league number 10's than Memphis, He played almost a wing-foward last season and should be played there here until he acclimatizes here..I feel that some of the experimentation that LVG are  such that he will only play players that he seems to trust, rather than taking a chance with players that could be better..Instead of getting players for the philosophy, Maybe we should be getting a philosophy for the players we have now.

480~~~
What sort of football did PSV play last season? Did they suffocate teams or invite pressure to create space?
Is he better from stand still, or once he's gained speed?

481~~~
Agreed. People on here getting too excited over someone who's long term prospect.

482~~~
Counter attacking football mostly (the club will deny it as that is blasphemy in Holland, but it was their best weapon). Wijnaldum, Memphis, Narsingh, Arias and Willems are very fast and combined nicely with a good passer in Maher, defensive workhorse in Guardado and target man in de Jong. Once they got the ball in a dangerous position they'd break away at pace. They weren't the best at breaking compact teams down but always had a few options: a long range shooter in Memphis or crosses to de Jong who scored 10 headers. Good at setpieces too.

483~~~

484~~~
LVG seems to be really trying to force this whole Rooney/Memphis partnership, which I don't think is a particularly wise thing to do. Nor does it look remotely like working.

The best partnerships just happen, or form over time. You can't force it.

485~~~
This guy knows. Can we make him manager? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

486~~~
He doesnt understand the philosophy..

487~~~
<a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> I find your perspective on Memphis interesting but fundamentally disagree. Memphis is clearly a gifted player but I do not believe he will thrive in the highly congested central areas, especially in the Premier League. In European competition he might be given more time and space. Domestically, however, he will be swarmed upon the second he gets the ball. Clever though he is, Memphis does not have that Iniesta level close control required to wriggle away from that level of attention.

To my eyes Memohis would be much better suited to playing off the wing, where he will get more time and space, and have more opportunities to exploit one v one situations. I agree he's not the kind who will hug the touchline, and I don't want him to be that. Ronaldo wasn't that when he was at United and it didn't harm him or us one bit. A Memphis coming into defenders blind spots from the flank, or cutting inside to shoot would be a very dangerous Memphis for United to have indeed.

488~~~
I don't think anyone does.

489~~~
Why the feck was he pissed when he was subbed? That's not a good attitude for a new signing, you're not entitled to game time, son.

490~~~
Awesome. Thanks. That was the impression I got, as many of his goals seemed to be against stretched defences. He's powerful, so he should be able to transfer his skills to a more dominant team, given time.

491~~~
Well, if your debut at a competitive level for United was rather poor, you would not want to come of either because you would want to improve with the small minutes remaining. I do not blame him for the attitude he showed and I m glad he was disappointed by his performance because that means he will try and do better next time.

Nevertheless, I feel Van Gaal is being a massive troll by playing him through the middle. I have not seen much beside little glimpse in the last 5 or mores games he has played for United that shows his true quality.

492~~~
He was stifled today and will continue to be if he's played as a #10. He would be far more effective on the wing.

493~~~
You have to laugh...our manager is something else

494~~~
I have never said I see him at his best at 10 because he still has to prove that. However, if you've followed him troughout the years you'll notice that after the WC he improved his overall game at such an absurd rate (yes I know, only ED) that I don't disagree with this experiment of playing him centrally. On paper the idea doesn't sound bad to me, he'll compensate for Rooney's lack of speed and he will be involved alot all over the pitch just how he was at his best for PSV. If he continues his development after he has settled he can easily play at 10, even under high pressure. The downfall I see with him centrally is conceding possession too often like Di Maria did with passing, not that he can't cope with the intensity of the PL or that he doesn't have the control of Iniesta right now.

I also think Mata and Memphis both out wide would be far too narrow for van Gaal as both cut inside and roam. For all we know this experiment gets dropped as Pedro comes in. I just tried to explain to the 'ohh look van Gaal is playing players out of position again'-peoples that I can actually think of the logic behind it. I would play Mata at 10 and Memphis LW if I was the manager but Memphis has potential to play anywhere across the front 4 if given the freedom.

495~~~
I'm hoping we'll see Pedro and Memphis wide and either Mata or Herrera through the middle eventually. I can't believe van Gaal intends to stick with Young and Mata as wingers again

496~~~
Has to be the plan, maybe it's just <i>too</i> obvious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

497~~~
It's these little odd things by Van Gaal that just don't make sense that he keeps doing that really get to me... like wtf does he see???

Mata whos best central is played out wide.

Memphis whos best out wide is played centrally.

Herrera who is our best midfielder and our main creativity/mobility in midfield.. benched.

Blind at CB?

Why is it these things that are so obvious to everyone else aren't to him? It almost feels like stubborness, "everyone else thinks that would be the logical thing to do so i will deliberately not do that"

498~~~
In your opinion, very subjective as to whom is our best midfielder. We got worse after he came on

499~~~
True but i think a combo of one defensive/enforcer style ie Carrick, Schneiderlin or Schweinsteiger and ine creative/mobile midfielder like Herrera would be much better than just 2 defensive/enforcer midfielders together.

Herrera was phenominal when played in that main midfield role last season bagging goals, assists and all round great controlling of the midfield.

500~~~
Well i will try to answer you:
Maybe Van Gaal thinks Memphis is not good on the left wing and that Young is not good on the right wing. So the formations that comes to you is Young right, Memphis central and Mata left.
Ofcourse We can play Memphis right, Herrera central and Mata left but it will be even slower attack then now. Buying right winger like Pedro will solve the problem.

501~~~
People used to be bewildered at the things Fergie did aswell to be fair.

502~~~
Need to have him playing facing the goal. Really think it restricts a skilful player who is direct if they have to start on the turn.

503~~~
It's very frustrating. Just like the 3-5-2 or the stuff he says about left footed centrebacks.

504~~~
I think we need to play whats better for the team, not just for him.

Yesterday there were a few times when he got the ball in the middle in an advanced position and Rooney had come back to him to help as a single striker is entitled to do. At that point he needs the two wide forward to be bombing forward and giving him options, as the striker is not there, but Young isnt good enough for that and Mata isnt fast enough. Memphis should be that player.

505~~~
It's a process.

506~~~
Fergie did took some odd decisions, but you understood the logic behind them. It's more like this: we have plan A and plan B, most will chose plan A but Fergie will go for plan B. In Van Gaals case, it's a totally odd decision that no one understands. I'm still trusting him because of his experience but the (little) knowledge I have of football has left me clueless about what he's doing.

507~~~
If LVG has bought him in to play purely as a #10 then its a poor decision. If he doesn't like wingers who cut in then he shouldnt have brought him. Almost all wingers nowadays do cut in. That is why they are an added threat unlike Young or Valencia who are one just one trick ponies. If Memphis cuts in, it gives Shaw some extra freedom to bomb forward and draw one or two players with him.

508~~~
He never really got into the game today, we didn't play much through the middle everything went down the flanks with runs from Shaw and Darmin. He didn't look like a natural in the position.

509~~~
Going to get many of those types of games from him this season, whether he is central or wide. We can't expect too much from him just yet, he will learn from games like this. Wasn't bad but needs to adapt and I'm sure he will show his quality in the long run.

510~~~
How will things form over time if you dont let them have time together?

511~~~
We have to be patient with him. He's still a kid.

I just hope he has the right attitude. For some reason it's the only concern I have with him. Not based on much apart from some comments here and there and what his attitude used to be when he was younger.

512~~~
Van Gaal is like that showboating guy you play with at kickabouts who ignores you when you're open and an easy pass away who'd rather rabona the ball through 3 defenders to pass to the fat kid on the other side of the pitch.

513~~~
I think the logic is that Young has established himself as our best option on the left and deserves to start there (which I agree with, despite the unfair stick he gets on here)

Sticking Memphis on the right takes away his ability to cut to the right of a defender and shoot (his signature move) and Mata has done very well for us on the right but not so well centrally (albeit from a small sample).

I might not agree but there is a logic there. Sort of.

514~~~
Pogue I was at the game yesterday and I realise we don't have the quality a Barca or Bayern have up top as yet. But you can see what LVG is doing we lack a centre half as it stands and fix the GK situation. But for me we are going the right way no doubt about it. But I think LVG is in for some stick along the way as imo we will struggle for goals with this front three. As said the quality is not there of a Barca and that's no slight we have good players. But more importantly what we lack is movement in our front three and until we get this we will be to predictable and rely on special moments or mistakes. Our two wide forwards (wingers) need to be making diagonals across the line but don't and we look static and turgid. If we can get this working then we will challenge if not we will not score enough. Role on Pedro who does this.

515~~~
I was suprised how much he played like he is 30+ years old. Static in the build up and run around just when it was absolutely needed. One Example is when Schneiderlin passed a ball in the way he runed and he started that run at the walking pace, just to realise that Tottenham defender will get a ball first and only then he ran to the ball as he would have to from the start of the move, needless to say Tottenham defender was first to the ball. I want to see more movement from him, maybe it will come with games, maybe it will came with switch to wing. But i want to see our young attackers to work as hard as posible in attack and he didn't do that yesterday.

516~~~
I agree 100%. Our two midfielders sit deep, while strikers (Rooney and Depay) stay high up the pitch. As a consequence, the responsibility is on wingers to be the connection between midfield and attack. Young is working his socks off but he has his limitations. Mata is struggling because all he can do is keep the ball moving, for obvious reasons he won't beat a defender. Two strikers means there is too crowded in the middle so wingers are asked to stay wide to stretch the defense. 
Like you said, 4-3-3 would suit us better. One midfielder sitting deep controlling the tempo, another (Schneiderlin) doing dirty job and Herrera in front of them to support the attack. Rooney leads the line, with Memphis and Mata on left and right respectively with a licence to drift inside, while Shaw and Darmian keep the width. 
Like van Gaal said, he likes to play formation that creates triangles between players, and rightly so because it worked very well last season, especially against big teams which were stretched across the pitch. The way we play right now is very flat and it makes strikers isolated. I don't understand why we are playing this way.

517~~~
Young was getting nothing from Walker. Feck knows why we didn't move Memphis there to try and test him. Young could've moved to the middle or the right.

518~~~
He is clearly a winger and should play there. He was lost and poor yesterday and when you see that Young is not getting anything, why not put him there? Another strange decision by LVG

519~~~
The only times he looked comfortable, and like he was alive/in the game was when he'd pick up the ball in a wide position... as if he actually knew what he was meant to do with it when he picked it up in those areas.

I hope this central thing doesn't carry on for too long... I don't think it'll do the lad any favours. He's trying to adjust to a new country and a new league, you'd think we'd make it easier for him by actually playing him in his natural position.

520~~~
I thought he was poor on Saturday, not the only one mind. I think the front 4 was very poor as a whole. Slow, laboured, static. Still early days.

I do agree with everyone that thinks he should be wide left. Just seems to make sense. Even if he's wanting to start with Young, Depay and Mata you could theoretically have Young playing through the middle. I just think all the times Young had their full back 1-on-1 and didn't really do much with it. I think Depay might have done more with those opportunities.

521~~~
Yeah, he was disappointing IMO. Although I'll give him the benefit of the doubt as every man and his dog knows he should be playing in Young' position.

522~~~
wont judge him till he's playing in his favoured position.

523~~~
So he's playing behind Rooney because <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-uniteds-memphis-depay-eager-6222870" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Young is player very well...</a>

524~~~
I don't think people should be overly critical just yet. Give the lad a chance! He was ok. I agree that I want to see him on the wing though.

525~~~
MEMPHIS ON HIS DEBUT
"It was a great experience, different than playing at PSV’s stadium. That was a perfect stadium also, but this is the biggest I’ve played in."

MEMPHIS PROUD OF NO.7
On wearing no.7, he said: "It’s an honour to wear the number 7 and I will wear it with pride. I know the history of the number, I appreciate it and I want to show that I can wear it with pride."

MORE FROM MEMPHIS
“I want to bring creativity and goals. Of course, I have to play with discipline in midfield and I can’t lose the ball too much, but I can take more risks on the wing when I enter the final third. That’s when I can do tricks or take a risk."

526~~~
So his fee has gone up to €44m already....

527~~~

528~~~
Hopefully Memphis will show his confidence one day and just tell LVG to just try him out on the wing. It's a mindfeck.

529~~~
Sooo is he going to move to the left then.... hmmm I hope so

530~~~
Forgettable from everyone pretty much except Darmian. Let's see how things pan out with Depay in the middle for a bit, could work well.

531~~~
So LVG is rewarding Young for last season's performances by giving him a chance to cement a place this season, but will move Memphis to the left when Ashley suffers a dip in form? Or is that reading between the lines too much?
Either way, it's almost certain Memphis will get some game time on the left at some point, it'll be up to him to perform there.

532~~~
I must have missed something, but when did we pay 31 GBP for Depay?

533~~~
Never

534~~~
That is what I thought, but the spoiler 'said hefty 31M price tag'.

535~~~
They still struggle with currencies and add ons. Or they do it on purpose.

536~~~
Mentions that he might try Memphis on the left. I really can't wait to see him play there.

537~~~
I think im one of the few in here that really liked him in the middle.

538~~~
Probably, because there was nothing to like. He did absolutely nothing particularly interesting, nothing that Mata wouldn't do.

539~~~

540~~~
We already knew that, Muller and Litmanen are perfect examples of that.

541~~~
I remember in his interviews he said about options for that point forward, sometimes it had to be SS, sometimes it had to be a midfielder up there. I did not recall him saying he would prefer one to another

542~~~
Most of the time he uses a second striker, even for Nederland, he chose Van der Vaart over Sneijder, for a long time iirc.

543~~~
When Fellaini is back from suspension I think we might see Memphis on the left.

544~~~
Then he should stop saying he wants to play 4-3-3 if he prefers a second striker to a midfielder. We need that link from the midfield to the attack anyway, Memphis isn't the man I don't think. We'll get there eventually though, probably when Young is injured and we are forced to play a proper link man, and end up playing much better.

Anyway, his second striker comments sound like the beginning of the end for Herrera. I don't think he fancies him in a 2 man midfield.

545~~~
Not really, he prefers a second striker for the additional goal threat, if we sign an other goalscoring winger, there is a fair chance that he plays Mata or Herrera in the middle.

546~~~

547~~~
exactly. as a matter of fact when he first came we all thought he would definitely use rooney as his ten as he already said he likes his number ten as a more second striker than midfield. he always said this. One thing with van gaal especially when hes asked questions he always goes back and says " but i have said this already" because he has


maybe you see what you want. most already had reservations over him in the middle and basically had their minds made up already. like blind at CB. It would have taken something master class for Depay to convince anyone. He did well and i like the pace he brings in the middle. something mata cannot do. He may well move to the left. But the reason why this is being hated is because herrera doesnt play, and nobody likes that on the caf. where as i couldn't give a feck.

548~~~
Actually I think that you are the one victim of that. I have nothing against him playing in the middle, I see why Van Gaal would like to try that and I think that it's not a bad idea. But he hasn't been good there, yet.

549~~~
well maybe i should be more specific. he was ok there. i should have said i really like the IDEA of him there. he wasn't fantastic there against spurs... but who was? not that its an excuse but with a few more games the idea on paper of what he could bring to the position may come to reality.

550~~~
Hopefully, but I don't think that's necessarily what he said. He just implied it is a stylistic preference, without divulging that it is to cover a goalscoring deficiency.

551~~~
Agreed, the idea is interesting, the performance was a bit meh. But he has the tools to succeed there.

552~~~
Agree with all this. Van Gaal's tactical abilities continue to be a worry.

At least he mentioned the possibility of moving Depay out to the left though, so that's a positive.

553~~~
I have given up interpreting him
<a class="externalLink" href="http://jeddavies.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Louis-Van-Gaal-interview.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jeddavies.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Louis-Van-Gaal-interview.pdf</a>

554~~~
If he prefers a second striker to a midfielder in that central position, why not play Mata there?

555~~~
Our manager is starting to really upset me.

556~~~
Not enough goals, maybe?  And Depay is a genuine goal threat, if you play him on the right you put him in a position where he can't express that, and Young is surprisingly weak on the right. So my guess would be that it's the lack of decent right winger.

557~~~
which is probably why we are after pedro

558~~~
Mata's probably the second best finisher at the club. Although, to be fair, Memphis may be better. I haven't watched him enough to know one way or another.

I had assumed that Young was holding down the left wing slot on merit (which Van Gaal more or less confirmed earlier this week) so I do wonder why we don't play Mata in the centre and Depay on the right. Although that takes away Depay's signature move of cutting back onto his right foot for a shot.

Basically, yeah, I can see a certain logic in what he's doing but I think Mata could do a decent shop behind Rooney. Quite possibly better than Memphis.

559~~~
Just a little thing for Van gaal both 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1, are 4-3-3. 

In this video he shows his two optons for nederland and you can see that in the 4-3-3 he chooses Sneijder and in the 4-2-3-1 he chooses Van der Vaart, eve though Sneijder can play in both systems.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ac7Bk7fhbb4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

560~~~
I think if we continue to lack a decent link-up in the middle of the pitch between the No. 10 and midfield, that we're better off moving Memphis to the left and then playing either Mata or Herrera in behind the striker. My ideal line-up at this point would be Rooney up top with Herrera in behind him, flanked by Memphis on the left and Mata on the right.

561~~~
Welcome to the club..

562~~~
One thing that surprised me was that he has great control and his passing is actually really good. Good quick flicks and tricks but he also made some high quality passes. Slightly different from the impression I had of him being a direct pacey winger and not as complete as he looked like he could become.

563~~~
you and probably every other United fan.

564~~~
You'll be pleasantly surprised then this season. That's a big part of what Memphis earned his transfer with, not just his goals. In the year before the WC he already was a great winger (Eredivisie ofcourse) but last season he improved his overall game so dramatically, it was like he was being held back in the years before. I can't explain how much he improved in 1 season. Offensively he's very complete and doesn't have a real weakness other than his decision making which he will be working on.

565~~~
If you sift through the b.s you will find the truth and this week he said it all - he is not playing Memphis through the middle because of the potential he has, no, he is doing that to keep Ashley Young in the side. Not that there is something bad about playing Young if he is in form, which he was when the season ended. Same as the left footed cb fetish he has going, it's just to accommodate Blind.

I don't really have a problem with playing Memphis there but pushing him up so high terribly affects the build up and I also think we can use his pace to great effect he starts a bit deeper than he was on Saturday. If he doesn't want that then he has to play Herrera in place of one of the two DMs. We need that central thrust from somewhere and if we get right then there will be more space for wingers to exploit.

566~~~
What I don't understand, is if he wants to keep young in the side at the moment, move him to the right, Mata in the middle and Memphis on the left.

Surely having Mata and Memphis in their best position is more beneficial than having Young in his?

567~~~
When will this guy start scoring?

He was among the top scorer in Europe last season and I have yet to see signs of prolificacy in that department for United this season. His only goal, even though well taken was a fortunate one made against a sub par team. I understand it takes time to settle, but I can not help but feel our coaching staff are managing him wrongly and if managed better, he would continue where he left off last season and appear more prolific in front of goal.

568~~~
We've only had one competitive game so far this season.

569~~~
I included his performance in pre-season. Even though those are not competitive matches, I still expect to see prolificacy in the goal scoring department. I have no doubt he will find his feet, but with the current path he is on in regards to his performance, it might not meet my expectation. He needs to be advise differently and played in a role similar to hazard or Ronaldo, e.g. free roaming left.

570~~~
Yep. We haven't even played our second game of the season yet and it looks like you aren't on the wind up..

571~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

572~~~
It is a win win scenario for me at the moment. If he scores for Aston Villa tomorrow, that will be great for my fantasy team. If he does not, my point will start exhibiting some concern about the issue I spoke of.

573~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fairplay. 2 games in though there is hardly an issue to raise. Not a single United player has scored yet this season.

574~~~
Yea, what is even worrying is Rooney scored only one goal in preseason and barely looked prolific, yet he suppose to be our primary striker next season and score 20 plus goals. Anyway, I m just being an optimist and their is a possibility something can click with them as the season progress.

575~~~
In which... he scored.

576~~~
The basis for my argument is appearing prolific, not whether he has has scored only one goal in pre-season.

577~~~
Is this what you call optimism? I don't think it means what you think it means.

578~~~
I ment pessimistic. I usually mix the two up, but in reality, I am a realist who use facts to support my opinion.

579~~~
Young would be half as useful on the right. 

I'd just drop him and play Herrera through the middle.

580~~~
I hope Memphis will score a hattrick today so Amadeus can be satisfied.

581~~~
It's hilarious to see the number of people who expected Depay to waltz in and immediately replace Young on the left. Probably the same one's who are under the impression that he's some sort mazy dribbler and is going to go past players for fun when really, he's more or less at the same level as Young when it comes to dribbling with the ball.

It was never going to happen. As sad as it might sound, Ashley Young is the best thing about our attack right now and all those moaning and whining about him not being dropped should just give it a rest. Depay is more likely to be dropped than Young. In fact, pretty much every person in our attack is more likely to be dropped than Young and rightly so.

Besides, the experiment of him playing through the middle has plenty of promise and definitely worth sticking with for a few more games.

582~~~
Rooney currently doesn't have the right pass in him  to put Memphis through on goal through the middle. Against Spurs Memphis made some great runs and could have been found by an in-form Rooney or Mata but it just didn't happen. Rooney's passes to Memphis were either too short, too long, at the wrong time or just completely overhit. I can accept Rooney losing his pace as he gets older but this was something he was really good at while transitioning his play style over the years.

583~~~
Don't really understand this post at all.

We signed Depay on the basis of his excellent performances on the left, a position we needed to upgrade because Young, while a decent player, does not produce performances even close to those of similar players at our rivals. That's just obvious and something that Van Gaal has explicitly talked about recently when he compared Young to the likes of Neymar and Hazard.

I can't speak for everyone but in terms of what I expected it would have been the two competing for the same position with Depay eventually winning out on the basis of his far superior goal scoring. To put that into perspective in 116 games for United Young has scored 13 goals, this is less than half of what Depay managed just last season. I also disagree with you on their respective dribbling abilities, over the last two seasons the number of times Young successfully beat his man were 1.66 and 1.13 per 90 minutes, Depay managed 2.82 and 3.37, a clear upgrade.

Instead Depay has not seen a single minute in his best position and has exclusively been used as a second striker while Young has no competition for his place on the left apart from younger players. Given how feeble our attack has looked both in pre-season and against Tottenham I am struggling to see how this experiment has shown 'plenty of promise'.

584~~~
It's a good thing Young is not competing with Neymar or Hazard then. We don't know why or with intention LVG signed Depay. For all we know, the intent was always to play Depay through the middle. Given LVG's comments it's obvious he rates Young on the left. And it's not like Depay is a conventional winger either like Young is. Depay is more about goal scoring and getting on the end of chances than creating them.

Yes, Depay is more productive no doubt (although it remains to be seen if he can get anywhere near the same number of goals in a better league) but he's not a clear upgrade on Young when it comes to dribbling which is actually quite obvious when you watch him a few times.

Depay has played 60 minutes of official football for a new team in a new league. Nice of you to give it so much time. And yes, I think there's been promise. It's possible he will grow into the role and do very well. It's well worth persisting for me.

585~~~
I don't dislike him but I think he's an average player, but has tremendous work rate and always does a shift - something which LvG seems to love! I just feel that in those positions that Young finds himself in might be better suited to Memphis. I feel like he could create more in those positions. 

I'm sure he'll get a chance on the wing in due course, it'll be up to him then to show what he can do as I don't think centrally we're getting the best out of him from the little we've seen in pre-season and the first game last week.

586~~~
Jesus, you're not hard to please, are you? I guess we should just sell him or put him in the reserves? He obviously is an abject failure here.

587~~~
Quality stuff, guys.

588~~~
Let's sell him. The transfer window is still open.

589~~~
We've got some 3 games before September 1st? Let's give him three games to decide his fate.

590~~~
My problem is not with Depay as I think he is a quality player, but with Van Gaal and how he is playing him. If you have watched Depay play before, his performance at United thus far as been below average. He has not been giving the right positional freedom or instruction to progress his game from my point of view. Playing him behind the striker seems more of a hindrance than a benefit. But, as I stated before football is unpredictable. He could somehow start appear prolific and become a better predator in the box.
That would be great but I have higher hopes that Smalling scores a hat trick today.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Hyperbolic </span>

591~~~
No. I honestly think we've all seen enough to know he's not good enough. One game is enough to see that.

I was being sarcastic originally by the way. He'll come good. He's got something about him that you don't see often (talent & attitude without being a nuisance).

592~~~
To be fair to <a class="username" data-user="8785, @Trigg" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8785/">@Trigg</a> , I'm fairly certain he's talking about Young there. If not....<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

593~~~
So was I, and I knew you were.  

People forget he is just a kid.

594~~~
Apologies to trigg, if that's the case.

595~~~
Doh. Sarcasm inception. 

Exactly the point though. I'm confident he'll turn into our main man at some point. Whether it's this season or two seasons time isn't a problem. Everything about the kid screams something special though. Maybe that's a bit too much, but at the very least he'll be a good player for us given time.

596~~~
Feck me, you're a little ray of sunshine, aren't you?

Look, if your issue is with Van Gaal's approach and recently chosen position to play Depay in, then maybe you should post more than one sentence of positional criticism and then not follow that up with several separate posts criticizing the player specifically because he hasn't scored 20 goals already in the handful of preseason, and ONE WHOLE actual match he's played for us. 

You may want to grab a pint or two and sit out the next couple months of football if you're going to get this downtrodden over our players form(s) in August. We're not known for lighting the football world on fire early days, and I feel as though maybe the strain from the disappointment may cause you to stroke out, or possibly cause you to morph into Eeyore.

Relax, brother. We've only 10 months left in the season.

597~~~
One sentence of positional criticism? I have been vocal about my opposition towards Depay positional role for a long time. I might even say I was the leading advocate towards playing him in a more free left role.

The Smalling part was a hyperbole. And my problem as I stated already is not his one goal scored, but appearing prolific and like a player who could continue his goal scoring form from last season.

598~~~
Give him time, give him a chance, guy has just started his career and you're already worried if he's profilic or not.

599~~~
A few hours later and Young is dropped <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

600~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

feck me!

601~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

602~~~
Haha <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Why do pundits keep saying Depay was £31m...Redknapp just said it now and Yorke nodded his head in agreement

603~~~
I was indeed speaking about Young, <a class="username" data-user="4910, @amolbhatia50k" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4910/">@amolbhatia50k</a>

604~~~
This was always coming but i'm glad the way it's been handled not just dropping Young from day 1 as many would have done. 

Looking forward to see what Memphis can do on the left tonight.

605~~~
That can't be true. Young's never been able to dribble with the ball. Delivery, work rate and set peices? Yeah. Dribbling? Nope. If you youtube "Ashley Young dribble" you get a page full of FIFA videos.

606~~~
Yep, Young has a grand total of about two tricks. Granted, he does us them effectively.

607~~~
Thanks. Now start predicting how Herrera is never going to start.

608~~~
And one of them is "cutting in"...Which I don't really count that as a trick, tbf. More "moving a bit"

609~~~
Depay playing out wide <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>. Seems what I wanted is finally happening. However, their is a difference between being a restricted wide player and a free roaming one. Hopefully, Depay is giving the latter and has more influence in our attacking game. However with Januzaj as the number ten, it hard to see the latter happening.

610~~~
He's made some good runs off the ball, the passes just haven't quite picked him out accurately enough. Would like to see him run at the Villa defense more in the 2nd half.

611~~~
When we sort our service to him out instead of high balls, he'll bang them
In. Absolutely no doubt about it.

612~~~
Hasn't really impressed me so far, but he's still young. I think the whole "Basti/Carrick/Rooney" thing belies just how young this team actually is. Even Mata's only just turned 27! He'll come good, but he's definitely better on the wing.

613~~~
Needs to get more involved and take the RB on more often. For all of Young's criticism, he tries to make something happen every time he gets the ball which I really like about him. Memphis needs to do this too.

614~~~
He has been more impressive today than any of his previous performance. He is winning the battle against Bacuna and has made some great runs inside. We just need to give him more space, allow him to drive forward with the ball more often and not pack him in the middle.

615~~~
He seems slightly restrained today but thats fine, we don't need him to step up in this game as of yet.

616~~~
Can't see how people can be disappointed, if we had a little better passing he could already have a brace,  his movement is brilliant.

617~~~
He has to score that one, that's just poor, completely rushed it.

618~~~

k

sake Memphis!!!!

endured 75mins of your crap display, butthat would have completely fantasy footyed me happy!

fark

619~~~
Take the lad off. Not his night tonight but you can see what he's trying to do. Hopefully he settles quickly and gets to the form he showed for PSV.

620~~~
Don't think he's been poor at all, should have scored but that movement was something we've lacked since ronaldo basically, so its encouraging.

621~~~
It wasn't far off and the run was good. Even Shearer and Henry didn't score them every time. Not his night but you can see the talent.

622~~~
Don't think he rushed it at all. Thought he took it really confidently and early. Did everything right but missed by a couple of feet. Should've scored mind

623~~~
Sitter, great run though. He'll score plenty for us.

624~~~
Poor miss, but it was great movement to latch onto Mata's through ball. He'll get us goals and plenty of them. Just give it time.

625~~~
Atm not better than Nani. But hes younger, loads of talent. Lets wait and see,

626~~~
For some people, it's always either piss poor or world class. There is no middle-ground.

627~~~
I never denied that talent, but he should've been calm and just finished it.

628~~~
Yeah. Annoying really. Despite the miss he's played well but you'll see people say he was poor because of a narrow miss

629~~~
He's been on the cusp of being through 1v1 in acres about 3 or 4 times but we've just not been able to find him. Great movement.

630~~~
He offers such a threat on the counter. Fantastic weapon when the other team is chasing a goal. Could be key to our away form espacially.

631~~~
Good game I think, sure he had some mistakes and was sloppy at times but he made few good runs, always active and always trying.Like how he opened himself for that Mata pass, good effort but just wide.

632~~~
Good game, another time he could have had 2.

633~~~
Shame he couldn't find the net when someone finally found the pass for one of his many runs. 

It'll click.

634~~~
I thought the was really unlucky with the bounce of the ball for his chance, it looked like it was going in initially

635~~~
He can sharpen up, but his movement is brilliant. Could've been put through a number of times.

636~~~
Average today.

637~~~
Best performance at United so far in my opinion(which is not really a complement). Should have done better when Mata put him through, but he just was not prolific enough. Continuing to play him in this role will only benefit his game.

638~~~
Very bad miss but the amount of runs he made behind the RB that were not spotted was amazing! He is the opposite of Young in that respect.

639~~~
Looks a lot better from the wing. I liked him today. Tried a few things. Shaky start but got into the game.

640~~~
He makes very intelligent runs. It can't be long until he starts bagging some goals.

641~~~
Very bad miss? It was inches away.

642~~~
He was OK. As expected, he's going to get better as the season goes on. No worries from me.

643~~~
Not good, not bad. His movement off the ball stretched Villa a lot while he was on. Big room for improvement but this was expected.

644~~~
Did well and looked alot better than he did last time. Had a good chance and narrowly missed and had another good shot saved.

645~~~
Doing all the right things, just a bad day at the office in terms of end product. But it's good to watch a player get in behind, take shots and make things happen. No doubts about him.

646~~~
He looks good but still a bit raw. Pretty much what I expected when we signed him.

Bit unlucky with the shot near the end. Wasn't far away.

647~~~
Thought he looked far more comfortable wide left drifting in. Found himself in good positions and made some good run that we failed to find the right ball. When we did he fluffed it.

648~~~
Feeling his way into the pace of the prem. Looked really good in flashes. Can't help but feel he's gonna a beast on the wing, which looks to be his strongest position. 
So excited about this guy, Im really not all that bothered about signing Pedro. Don't want to hinder Memphis's development.

649~~~
Hardly involved I thought. Better as a LW for sure but he didn't do a lot with the ball and shooting from everywhere was a bit stupid. Needs more time obviously

650~~~
Wont have done much to dispel the "Dutch Nani" label with that performance, but at least he's playing in his proper position now. He's still pretty raw but the talent is certainly there.

651~~~
Redknapp also thinks he plays number 10. He was like we need Pedro who can play on the wing instead of Depay and Mata who are 10s.

652~~~
From there, he should have scored or made the keeper work. Therefor bad miss.

653~~~
I'm not worried about him, he's going to become a very good player for us. Shouldhave put the chance from Mata's sexy pass away.

654~~~
That horrible FK must have hurt his confidence. He should have with the following chance.

655~~~
Raw springs to mind. His movement is phenomenal, though. His effort on goal was very nearly excellent and his goalscoring threat is already evident.

He'll make mistakes, definitely, but I'd rather see him express himself than crawl into a shell.

656~~~
His movement is excellent. Won't be long before he starts banging them in.

657~~~
His movement is fantastic even if his finishing wasn't quite there tonight.

658~~~
More of a danger wide left than Young has been for a long while. It'll come for him. Once he gets that first goal the others will come. No doubt about it.

659~~~
It's all there but he's going to be inconsistent, I like his confidence and movement a lot.

660~~~
agreed, showed a lot of promise in making the right moves, shame he couldn't finish that one chance-expected him to score.

That free kick was pretty shite mind!

661~~~
Hasn't impressed me, but he's only played two games, so it's far too early to judge.

662~~~
You can tell he's a player. One of those days where it just doesn't come off.

663~~~
He will blow hot and cold. Still raw.

Bit like Januzaj.

664~~~
Good movement today, didn't come off from him, and some bits of sloppy play.
Still looks a threat, which is good, should have scored.

665~~~
I said it before the season started I didn't expect him to set the world on fire immediately, it's going to take him time to adjust to a new league with a much higher level and all the expectations. If he gets a goal it will help him a lot, he's trying too hard to produce something.

666~~~
Good runs off the ball, poor on it. Looks like he's going to take a while to settle

667~~~
I was impressed with his movement this evening, with the rest not so much.

668~~~
Think the lad desperately needs an early goal in his United career. Looks like he is always trying to justify that he deserves to be here.
Hopefully he'll settle in before too long and start playing with the swagger he had at PSV.

669~~~
Thought he was pretty poor tonight but I'm certainly not worried. He will take time to settle.

670~~~
I think those hoping for him to be Hazard-esque for us can put that to bed, his key strength is going to be those smart runs he makes in behind, if we can get Pedro for the other side we'd have two great options in the wide forward roles making runs for our midfield to pick out.

671~~~
Shame he fecked up his chance, would've done him a lot of good. 

Great off-ball movement but still, a lot to improve.

672~~~
He made that one run three or four times, and could have been through each time with better balls. So much better than as a 10.

673~~~
Young would've been better. In fact if Young had played as Depay did tonight there would be calls for him to be dropped.

674~~~
Agreed. He should have scored but it was hardly Torres tier

675~~~
He isnt yet fully in sync with his team mates, hasnt yet got the hang of their body language signals as to when to move etc for them. I think once he and his team mates learn each others games he will come right but he has been a bit of a let down for me so far. Easy to see the potential though.

676~~~
Indeed, because Young has played his whole career in the Premier League and 4 or 5 years for United. Bizarre comparison.

677~~~
Movement is there, determination is there and the confidence is there. He comes across as someone who will succeed purely because they won't settle for anything less, it'll come.

678~~~
Not to mention Young cant do any better than he is right now and Memphis's ceiling is high.

679~~~
Pretty much the feeling I got when I've seen that horrible free kick and the chance he didn't put away. You just feel that he'll spend bloody hours on the training ground to work on both finishing and free kicks.

680~~~
Absolute cnut for missing that chance as he would have sent my Fantasy Football team top.

However he looked bright on the left, some excellent runs from him. His movement and determination are second to none, needs to sharpen his finishing but it's all promising from him.

681~~~
I know he wasn't far away but really he should've buried that chance. Overall tonight I thought he was poor but he needs to be given time to adjust to playing in this league.

682~~~
He looks like a confidence player, the sooner he gets his first goal the better, he'll be flying after that but now he's too eager to prove himself.

683~~~
The first line is so obvious that you're kind of wasting your life typing it. Footballers miss easy chances, it happens, and there'll be dozens of worse ones this season. 

I thought he was decent other than that. Not amazing, but the main thing for me is how much he's getting involved. Nothing I've seen yet has me worrying we've made a mistake.

684~~~
He made so many runs today and the team just didn't see it/couldn't play the pass for it. Mata slipped him in well and he definitely should have scored - but I don't know how many times he sprinted towards the goal and players just didn't lob the ball over for him. There was one moment when we were countering from a Villa corner and I think it was Schneiderlin who dilly-dallied for far too long and lost the ball when Memphis was in space galloping towards the goal.

Still - he'll click. He just needs to gain more confidence on the pitch. Isn't taking players on just yet.

685~~~
He looks quite tasty. Has loads of potential. Better him to grow into the team rather than start amazing and have huge pressure like Di Maria.

686~~~
It's bizzare to compare two players who play the same position? Don't be ridiculous.

687~~~
Created no chances. Didn't beat his man on the outside once and had a couple of shots off target. He was poor.

688~~~
I'm worried he'll get the Nani treatment from the fans unless he becomes seriously prolific. It began after about 50 minutes in the match day thread but we all know that's not a great measure of sanity.

689~~~
Yes it's bizarre to compare the way how a meh performance by Depay should be received by supporters as opposed to Ashley Young. One has had 2 games in the PL under his belt and is 21, the other is a PL veteran and has been with United for half a decade.
So yes, as you said, some might have called for Young to be dropped if he performed like Depay did today and yes, it's not going to happen as of now with Depay as United fans know full well that young talented footballers need time and patience.

690~~~
Still better than Young against Tottenham.

691~~~
United fans often don't. That's the problem

692~~~
Yeah, you're not wrong actually. 50 percent of of redcafe wanted Ronaldo gone after his first few years and it all exploded when he dared to 'get our new supertalent/toy sent off' at the WC. If the caf had its way Ronaldo wouldn't even have been here to help us to three titles and a CL.

693~~~
Are we talking about Depay? If so, I would like to know what you have been drinking because most  of your statement is inaccurate.

694~~~
About the same. I thought he was ok tonight. Shame he put that chance just wide. It was a great run and pass.

695~~~
The pass was absolutely georgous. Shame Mata had some brainfarts as well.

696~~~
Thought he was mostly forgettable.  He is certainly a talent but he is not the finished article.

697~~~
They're directly competing for the same spot. Of course they're going to be compared. The team will and should be selected on what they can offer. Young did more last week than Depay did against Villa.

698~~~
Christ knows what you have been supping all night. The harshest criticism I've seen.

699~~~
How often did he take his man on outside and beat him and how many chances did he create? If the answer is any more than none then you should worry about what you've been supping.

700~~~
He wasn't poor.

701~~~
He was. He did very little in the game and missed a great chance. He's an attacking player who was barely seen in the second half and created nothing nor looked particularly like doing so.

702~~~
It was the type of game that if he scored that chance, people would have said it was a very good all around a performance. But because he skied a free kick and narrowly missed, he was poor? Come on. He had 7 shots in the game, and while some people might not like that, I definitely do as it shows he's not afraid to have a go and god knows we need players like that considering nobody is ever willing to shoot.

703~~~
2 games in, and showing some flashes of brilliance; Very hot and cold in that game to be honest, but he was one of only a couple to take hold of the attack and make something. Can't fault a young player to do that when we were looking so dire in attack.

I'd give it at least until we are halfway through before we see some consistency from him. He seems like that sort of character who really believes he will succeed, so will only be putting pressure on himself to deliver. He will make mistakes, much like he did today, but once his confidence allows him to perform to his expectations, he will be an absolute star here, I have no doubt about that.

Very excited about him still.

704~~~
I've no issue with a player shooting. It should be done more often. I do have an issue with players performances being judged differently because of the name on their shirt and their arbitrary 'ceiling'.

705~~~
Surprisingly low standards by some posters here. Feck sake, let's call a spade a spade. Sure, his 2nd PL game and he's young and all that but a shit performance is a shit performance.

706~~~
I too thought Depay was disappointing. You can see he's desperate to impress and get into shooting positions but he's just struggled these first two games to adapt to a far harsher level of football than he's been used too. 

It's perfectly understandable and he will be fine but it may take him half a season to properly adjust. Right now he looks the sort to me who may struggle for consistency in his first season.

One for the future though and these early games are all part of the learning curve.

707~~~
Sums it up.

I'd rotate him and Young on the left.

708~~~
was abysmal in the first half. Had a couple of good moments in the second but no point dressing up his poor performance and would have still been disappointed even if he scored that chance. I am sure he will get much better as time goes on however as he seems a little too eager to impress/make an impact. Just my opinion. I regularly criticise Mata but he was by far our best attacker today.

709~~~
There is nothing wrong with him having some average/bad games in his first go at the premier league, he needs to settle here but the talent is there for all to see and he seems a determined lad.

710~~~
I think he is suffering from the similar scurvy that a few of the other players are (and past players were) suffering from. I<i> really really want to take this ball up field and try to put it in the net....</i> <i>But I can't because it isn't what the gaff really wants... Plus if I lose it I won't be starting next week. </i>It will come in time, he's in a new league but for how well he is built I think he can develop.

711~~~
I like him a lot more on the left it suits his talents better even if he wasn't great he has the space he needs. Not a lot came off for him tonight but he is good to have on the pitch in that he gives defenders things to think about constantly. One for the future I am sure but to be fair on Young if he had put in that performance tonight he would have been slated as said.

712~~~

</ul>For me it wasn't a good performance but preferred his performance tonight over the game against Spurs. Had some great chances tonight to score but it just didn't happen. I think some will get frustrated with him pretty quickly, and Rooney's lull puts some added pressure on Memphis but I'm not worried.

713~~~
I won't criticize because he's young and has bags of talent. He wants to impress and just like that horrible FK showed he's a confidence player and when the entire stadium jeered him it must have hurt. I think among all the players we have signed, he's the one we're gonna have to be the most patient with because of his age and the state of his development as a footballer. There are more reasons to be positive than the opposite for me.

714~~~
Epic work Damien, that site is buggy as hell on chrome for me for some reason.

715~~~
Good to see him making great runs in behind the fullback (though Bacuna looked a bit clueless) and he took the chance correctly, just missed the corner.

On the ball, not as promising but getting 7 shots off is itself a good sign, I think. If he follows the expected path for his kind of winger he'll be selfish and only sporadically productive then improve at those and eventually put it all together and make better decisions while also strengthening and then all will be right with the world.

716~~~
You can see the talent with him, but there will be some frustrating matches along the way.

717~~~
I think he has been good in both our matches so far. He did a lot of good stuff today, and will score most chances like that one in the future. Loved to see him running inside, I suspect we'll score a lot of goals by him doing that and shooting or playing a one two

718~~~
The shot was really well taken on the run, and unlucky not to go in. It was a matter of inches. We don't have many other players who could have taken that first time.

I think he'll score 10+ this season.

719~~~
Good thing for him right now is that Rooney's potato form is taking the attention and pressure off him. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

720~~~
Easily. Think he'll be closer to 20 personally. He's incredibly fit so I think he'll be starting the vast majority of games, and with his movement and shooting technique it's a matter of when he scores his first goal. He missed the chance but it was a narrow miss and a very difficult technique to take it on first time. Ok, maybe he should have taken a touch, but it shows his confidence to hit first time and he very nearly pulled it off. 

The really encouraging thing about him though, is that we haven't had someone with his type of movement and ability on the ball in a long time, coming from the wing. He's only shown his dribbling a tiny bit so far, but he has a very good and consistent touch, is a reliable passer, but most of all, his pace and movement will always cause a threat.

721~~~
With Bastian hopefully starting soon, we'll see more passes for Memphis' runs behind the defense.

722~~~
On the flipside, is it putting a lot of pressure on him to score since he is coming off a season as top goalscorer and Rooney doesn't look like he wants to. He could be better off with someone scoring often so he can pick and choose his chances better.

723~~~
So much better on the left. Looked naturally suited to the role. And while he didn't have a great game, he showed glimses of his quality which is what I expect to see from a 20 year old talent.

Good stuff. Hope he gets his first goal soon to give him some confidence.

724~~~
His off the ball runs are very good. Should play on the left. He needs to finish off chances.

725~~~
Playing mata centrally benefits memphis.

Should have scored but he'll be okay. Just need a few more games to get things kicking.

726~~~
He's raw as expected but still so promising. His movement is very encouraging. The chance from Mata and the one from Adnan in the first half were both runs that Young just wouldn't have made. Once his finishing improves he will be a real player.

727~~~
TBH he is already a very good finisher, don't let that miss last night fool you

728~~~
Fair enough, but i mean in general his whole game will improve,along with his finishing. Which will make him a top player.

729~~~
What happened to his pace? I remember watching him on his debute for Holland against France two years ago and he was rapid. Plays with no pace or power anymore.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6qd-vrvBBg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

730~~~
Jesus what an overreaction! He's played two games at the start of the season which have both been close and cagey affairs in which we have had little open space to run into. I don't know exactly what you were expecting but yesterday he made a number of very strong, direct and pacy runs down the channels like the one for his missed chance. People really need to calm down abit and judge him after 10 or so games

731~~~
I thought it was accepted that he isn't rapid, everyone knows that. He's got power though, that's one area that there should be no concerns, even if he didt get pushed off the ball too easy at times last night. He just needs to adjust to the league.

732~~~
Did he play left wing?

733~~~
Yes.

734~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

735~~~
For feck sake <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

736~~~
He showed flashes of his abilities when he cut inside from the left and tried to get shots on goal. Van Gaal has to encourage and allow him to do that.

737~~~
There's major goal potential in Memphis' game. He seemed too eager to impress again, but he made a couple of very good runs. Not seen runs like that been made by a Manchester United winger in a long time. Brings up memories of Kagawa pointing to where Valencia should be moving to against Swansea. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

738~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjpHYeHamIg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Didn't think he played poorly at all, and watching his touches back and I have the same opinion. Didn't have an amazing game or whatever, but looked a threat and if he keeps making those runs then he'll rack up the goals I think. Played some smart passes into Rooney as well who didn't really do anything with it. A lot more to come of course, but it was a solid 6.5/10 performance and would've been a 7.5 or 8/10 had he scored that chance.

739~~~
We don't really play with a style suited to showing pace or power, to be honest.

740~~~
His direct runs from left to the inside channel were a thing of beauty, No doubt that once we adjust to him and get used to where he wants the ball he will score lots and lots for us.

741~~~
That miss was horrid but you have to be encouraged by what he brings.  He likes to take on defenders and shoot, he has the attributes to become a real game-changer.

I'd like to see him link better with Rooney and there are signs of him building a relationship with Shaw.  He and Shaw tried some plays on the edge of the box that weren't quite coming off but as they get used to each other's style, that should improve.

742~~~
Much much better performance from him. Clearly he has been itching to play on the wing and we could all see glimpses of what he can do. That miss should be have buried but to be fair to him he took it on first time and on the run. He should start on the left over Young.

743~~~
Created nothing, never got past his full back, a couple of wildly overhit crosses and shots and a horrible miss. If Ashley Young had put in a performance like that he certainly wouldn't be getting praised or being called unlucky.

Would still stick with him because he's clearly very talented but my god, Ashley Young is judged to an entirely different standard around here.

744~~~
He split their back 4 wide open at least 3 times during that game. With more accurate passes from our other players he would have had at least 3 chances on goal.

745~~~
Of course he is judged on different standard. Young cant be any better than he is right now, Memphis is young, just got to the PL and his ceiling is high.

746~~~
Are you kidding? One is 21 and new to the League/Country and the other is 30, has played in this country his whole career and has been one of our highest paid players for the past 3 years.

747~~~
Memphis needs mata being @ #10 to play to his full potential i think. If we get pedro the movement of those two in front of mata and rooney occupying the CBs will give him loads of options and space in which to do it.

748~~~
Relax, he needs time to adjust. Hazard wasn't great in his first EPL season either.

If it was 12 year ago, some of posters here might 've wanted to sell Ronaldo after his first few games with us.

749~~~
He is cranking up. Let the season continue.

750~~~
He was poor on Friday and anyone that says otherwise is fooling themselves. In saying that, I expect a lot from him in the future as he's clearly a huge talent. It's an awful shame he missed that glorious chance he had as it would have done wonders for his confidence (not that he looks short of any, mind). He is still settling into a new team in a new country and I have no doubt he will come good. Not sure he will start against Brugge, but if he does, hopefully he will have a good game. 

As for anyone comparing if Young had a similar performance, I mean what? The clear difference between the two is kind of obvious I would have thought, no? Jesus, Young really has a small hardcore following on here that wildy overrate the lad.

751~~~
Does anyone think Memphis could become a great striker? He has got all the attributes.

752~~~
He played ST for Netherlands alongside Robben in the WC, right?

753~~~
I think he could become one of the best if played there on a constant basis.

754~~~
As long as he keeps making those runs, eventually someone will find him. What people need to understand is, he is more of a goal scorer than a creator. Where as Young hardly ever makes runs in behind, this guy will make them all day long.

755~~~
Imo Memphis in his carreer will either turn out to be a LW/10/ST, although I can see a problem with his height at striker as he's not very tall. When he was very young he has played some matches as striker but since his youth matches which where broadcasted (they start at around age 16 I think) he has only played a handfull of games on the right wing but otherwise only LW. On the right he can't cut inside and shoot, one of his best traits so I don't think that's ideal for him. His only game as striker was a 15 minute sub at the WC.

He's developping his overall game so much that a move centrally could work out for him in the long run, but right now he's better at roaming LW. Like you said he has the attributes to succeed elsewhere, wether he can adapt his game he will have to show if he's given the chance.

756~~~
Really? Seems at least as tall as Rooney and taller than Aguero.

It just seems that there is a lack of high quality strikers combining all abilities needed in the market. Most available ones are either missing something or they are completely overpriced.
He could be a real option there.

757~~~
Wouldn't worry too much about his height... Aguero is a short fecker yet he's up there with Suarez as the best striker in the world. He's strong enough physically to hold off defenders which he showed in his few games as a 10 for us, was actually really surprised that his hold up play was so good against physical defenders like David Luiz, Thiago silva and in the spurs game. Long term I think he'll be a left winger for us, but he'll get his fair share of games to fill in at the other positions when needed.

758~~~
It's the only real weakness I could think of going forward but it's not that big of a deal no, last year he scored from a header twice with a good technique which was new for him. I'm not worried that he'll be bullied but it's just that he won't win alot of headers and some managers may want that from their strikers. I actually think he will be a LW too, but he's still young enough to change position in the future and I wouldn't mind it if he does. He will be great wherever he ends up I feel. He certainly gives us more options across the front 4.

759~~~
So far he is what I expected him to be. Player taken out of counter-attacking team and put into possession based one.

I hope he improves his close control and dribbling, because so far he seems reliant on pace and strength. His crossing is fine, and movement seems very good though.
Right now I’d say he is a good option, not sure he should be starting ahead of Young, and definitely not in the hole.

760~~~
Yep, exactly what he looks like. In fact, most of our attackers have played their best football in counter-attacking teams: Mata, Rooney, Young and Memphis. Fellaini didnt, but Everton were hardly a passing team. 

We actually don't have a top attacker who's been exceptional in a high possession team. Which explains partly why they look so disjointed and lacking in creativity.

761~~~
I could see him making that transition eventually.

762~~~
Goal vs Club Brugge:



That control and footwork <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

763~~~
Another point added to the already large list of what Van Gaal has gotten wrong at United. Depay looks a much better player wide left than he does as a number 10. I am glad Val Gaal did not persist with playing him as a number 10.

764~~~

765~~~
feckin' A

766~~~
I'm in love.

767~~~
Two very well taken goals. The first one was class because of his patience, the second was simply an outstanding finish. Very intelligent player.

768~~~
and this is why he should be played on the left

two wonderful goals

769~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

We should give him a new 6 year contract with a 150 million buyout clause. Madrid proof ourselves!

775~~~
He hit the whip after the 2nd goal, I think I'm in love.

776~~~
He's going to destroy some fecking teams on his own this season. The problem is, we just need more than him with that bit of spark.

777~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Cools is their third choice RB and seems absolutely awful, both those are two fantastic goals.

779~~~
He's no Ashley Young.

780~~~
10 more years of performances like that please, no pressure like.

781~~~
Yes son!

782~~~
Still average at best <a class="username" data-user="93114, @BringNaniBack" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93114/">@BringNaniBack</a>

783~~~
He's good

784~~~
Get in. Nice finishes. Weird decision to try and pass when in on the keeper, would like to see a replay.

785~~~
Awesome so far

786~~~
Their RB can't catch him.

787~~~
Two brilliant goals. In a difficult moment for United. That's pure class. Hattrick please.

788~~~
Absolutely superb so far. Looks twice the player on the left. 

Him and pedro on the flanks will be absolutely ace.

789~~~
Clear why he is best from the left.

790~~~

792~~~
I'm just happy we have an attacker that doesn't make me want to rub shit in my eyes.

793~~~
Two very good goals. A breath of fresh air this kid is.

794~~~
Dear lord, to those who doubted so soon.

He has well and truly put his stamp on Old Trafford now. Time to watch him absolutely fly now; we have been craving a player to take the game by the scruff of its neck for such a long time, and Memphis looks exactly that

795~~~
Jesus wept! Talk about glass half empty.

796~~~
Better than Bellion <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

797~~~
He better not feck off to Madrid when he becomes the best in the world.

All joking aside, I have a feeling this is the kickstart he needed.

798~~~
I wanted to see him hit the nae nae

799~~~
Anyone still think we should play him as a #10?

Showing exactly why we signed him tonight, fantastic goal threat coming in from the left. I actually feel bad for Young because he did his best for us last year but there's no way he can win if they are both given an equal chance for that position.

800~~~
You're seriously underrating Bellion there, mate.

801~~~
I know it's early days, and it's Brugge, but the fact of the matter is he's been better than di Maria was for us in his entire time on the OT pitch. Correct?

802~~~
Quite simply our best attacker right now. Makes runs, looks to create, takes on shots, just so positive compared to a lot of our players. It's great to see someone like this in the team. Confidence will just keep growing for the lad.

803~~~
We have a sparky match winner in our midst.

804~~~
Took his goals excellently, but it must be said that Brugge seem to think tackling him is optional.

805~~~
He played one bloody game there...

He's a bit rough around the edges but you can't deny he conjures up similar feelings to when you were watching a young Ronaldo. People said the same about Nani but this is different - that arrogance is something Nani never had.

806~~~
10 year contract in the morning...

807~~~
Great game, sexy goals, but I still can't believe why commentators can't get their heads around him wanting to be called Memphis and not Depay.

808~~~
Fantastic! Absolutely fantastic!

809~~~
Well that should put an end to Ashley darn Young being g a regular forward player for Manchester United. Hopefully now just Pedro in for Mata and we're looking a threat out there. I hope the boss is patient with Adnan too, as I think the long term reward will be brilliant too.

Anyways, back to Memphis, been brilliant, not just with his goals but his link play. Will be nice to see a hat trick completed in front of the Stretford End. Gwarn my young Dreamchaser.

810~~~
People needs to calm down with their hyperboles at the moment. Those were two great goals, but poor defending because if the opposing manager did his job, he would know not to show Depay his right foot. I want to see Depay perform like this on a consistent basis and when he becomes double teamed and forced to use his weaker foot.

Anyway during the second goal, it is good to know he knows how to whip and nae nae <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

811~~~
I like him very much. I am not sure he'll score goals like his first against better opponents, actually, I think he definitely won't, but it's good that he is scoring them when he has the chance to do so.

What I liked about both goals is his first touch and touch after that, his technique is very consistent and that will probably make him more consistent player for us than Nani has been. I am mentioning Nani because they are obviously from the same ilk and I like them both.

Now let's go for a hattrick.

812~~~
Get Pedro on the other side and our scoring options from wide will be ridiculous

813~~~
On the topic, when was our last hat-trick?

edit: RvP v Saints I think

814~~~
Depay! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Hopefully we play him more as a left winger.

815~~~
Probably that one yeah. It was ages ago.

816~~~
What kind of shit celebration was that? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

But the gooooalss <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I can excuse him.

817~~~
Couldn't even start to think of one before that, to be honest. Maybe <a class="username" data-user="61812, @Mrs Smoker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61812/">@Mrs Smoker</a> would have the stats on it

818~~~
Ok his goals were the fecking bomb

but even without them he has been our biggest goal threat. Tearing that right back a new one with his speed. Some careless passing at times but who gives a feck when you come up with that magic

819~~~
See what happens when players play in their best position ? when he cuts in from the left he is so much more of a threat then when played at no.10

820~~~
<a class="username" data-user="20951, @acnumber9" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20951/">@acnumber9</a> and that is why Depay should be played. Feck Young, we need to develop this type of talent and not lambast him calling for a 30 year old to replace him for not immediately setting the world alight in his second premier league match.

821~~~
RvP score hat trick vs Olympiakos in R16 of 2013-14 CL. That might be the last.

822~~~
lvg will give a feck

823~~~
As a 10? He played the whole of preseason their and yes; one competitive game. It was a pointless experiment if you ask me. Anyway, I agree he does have some swagger to his game and hopefully Van Gaal will not restrict his individualistic tendencies to have him more conservative.

824~~~
Thankfully LVG didn't take that many matches to make that decision.

825~~~
any gifs of second goal? want to send the link to a friend 

<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

826~~~
Special player we have, he'll be a star.

827~~~
I can see Memphis being really dangerous against the better sides in the league this year. It's tough for him in games like our first two where the opposition is sitting deep but against Arsenal, City or Liverpool, when they actually come out and attack us, he's going to find so much space.

828~~~
What kind of celebration was that? FFS

829~~~
I hope this is a lesson from VG, play him on the wings

830~~~
Also, dare I say it, but he has a style of play very similar to Ronaldo. Am I the only one seeing this?

831~~~
It's the stepovers.

832~~~
Finally we look like we've replaced Ronaldo with another player who can produce magic on the biggest stage. Get Pedro in and we'll be looking very good, especially if Rooney gets his act together and scores those 25 goals he promised!

833~~~
streamable ok ?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/o9c9" width="560"></iframe>

834~~~
He loves the backheels, doesn't he?

835~~~
Those two finishes were clinical. 

Also, what a pass from Blind for his second.

836~~~
I said we would've had a stronger team with Young on Friday night. It doesn't mean Depay hasn't been great tonight and his being great doesn't mean I was wrong on Friday. Football isn't about petty point scoring. I'm not a child.

837~~~
Let's go with Rio's comparison. He's like Overmars.

838~~~
It's the cutting inside and shooting coupled with the close control and sheer quick feet. It is like watching Ronaldo all over again. I'll be more than happy if he goes on to replicate him (without the whole Madrid nonsense this time)

839~~~
RvP v Villa was more recent.

840~~~
trying to get any kind of link to copy and paste. Not being able to with streamable. Not sure if im doing something wrong

841~~~

842~~~
seems to use it more than his side foot. should just go on the pitch with reverse mirrors

843~~~
Yeah you are.  Perfecting the art of kneejerking.

844~~~
After Saints, we had 3 more hattricks. RVP with two, Aston Villa and Olympiakos, and Kagawa vs Norwich. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

845~~~
He's bloody wonderful. He will get his hat trick, growing in confidence.

846~~~
this better?

847~~~
Just came in, should score the third after Rooney's brilliance.

848~~~
Smalling is running out if space in his pocket.

849~~~
He's been fantastic. but.. is too selfish and missed a sitter

850~~~
2 goals and an assist... So good

851~~~
He's entertaining as well as gifted. Strong too. A very memorable match for him, I'm pleased.

852~~~
Huge difference maker tonight. Two beauties and a cracking cross for Fellaini. Exciting stuff.

853~~~
Early days yet, but if he can keep that up, then he'll be a huge asset.

854~~~
Brilliant performance.. quality skills, passing, finishing, touch... the complete performance.

855~~~
Shitttt, at fecking last we have an exciting winger.

856~~~
Brilliant, he's going to score some goals for us cutting in from the left.

Looking forward to Memphis and Pedro on the wings. 

Really saved our bacon tonight tbh.

857~~~
He passed it a couple of times tonight where I think he should have held on to it or shot, I don't think he was too selfish at all

858~~~
Could have easily scored a hattrick, wonderful performance from him today. Hopefully he can keep this up in the Premier League.

859~~~
I think quoting somebody at half time of a players third game to engage in that kind of posting is a little more knee jerky than saying after a game I feel Young would've  performed better. I never even commented on Depay's ability long term. In short, you're talking shite.

860~~~
That was an absurd cross for Fellaini's goal.

861~~~
If there's a chance to shoot, he will shoot. That's not selfish, that's being hungry for goals.

862~~~
Not even his high gear and he's scoring more from the wings than anyone from striker position.

863~~~
Been a while since a number 7 in a United kit had such an evening in Old Trafford.

864~~~
Brilliant first half. Looked to lose focus in the second half, perhaps he was knackered. He strolled through the last half hour, but looked to have lost a bit of concentration.

His goals were both beauts, and the one he missed would have been incredible. Immense counter attacking, Shaw did brilliantly.

865~~~
What a player. He's going to be huge for our hopes of competing for any sort of trophy this season.

866~~~
Fantastic game. Great for his momentum.

867~~~
Wore that shirt nicely tonight <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

868~~~
Could have scored 4 tonight, he's an absolute threat and this is only the start. Can't wait to see more of him, he makes me feel excited like something is going to happen every time he gets the ball

869~~~
Would of put money on it if my bet365 wasn't cleaned out at the weekend. Bet365 were offering 7/1 on fourth golascorer. Should of had four but the one from the Rooney backheel was a banker, or should of been. Amazing display nevertheless!

870~~~
Can't wait for him to produce more of that stuff. He was outrageous in the first half, and his cross was as good as you'll ever see. He'll be involved in a bucket load of goals this season.

871~~~
He could have passed to Rooney for a much better chance on goal at one point

872~~~
Fantastic performance, make some who judged him early in this thread look like right weapons. Hopefully he can carry it on.

873~~~
So much potential. A liability defensively though. Shaw was left with two men way too many times.

874~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMt_2WIU8AAKWd_.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMt_2WIU8AAKWd_.jpg"/>

Maybe it's because I'm tired but this made me laugh so much! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>


On to Memphis, he does miss quite a few easy chances and this was apparent during his last 2 seasons at PSV. In same games he scores 2 like today but he could have had 4 or 5.

875~~~
Hope he becomes a world class player in his 4 years here before his inevitable move to Madrid.

Not trying to jinx it but we might have found Ronaldo's replacement.

876~~~
So a pointless negative throwaway comment after a new young talent struggles in his second premier league match. 

Great job.

877~~~
We can always bring back Ashley Young.

878~~~
I believe, deep inside Owen, sleeps a genius of a philosopher.

879~~~
I'm incredibly disappointed that he didn't finish this match with 4 goals, seriously. Beautiful goals, very well taken but how the feck did he manage to miss that Rooney's layoff is beyond me, same goes for that Villa chance. He's going to be a monster when he polishes his game even more.

880~~~
Brilliant performance. Could've, and probably should've, scored a few more goals.

881~~~
He isn't selfish at all, it's perhaps the thing that has surprised me the most, how good his eye for a pass is.

882~~~
He was good but should have scored 4 tonight, it's very encouraging he's getting into these positions though. He will be disappointed not to have had a hat trick tonight. Great cross at the end as well.

883~~~
Can't believe we spent all of pre season and then the Spurs game playing him as a #10

884~~~
I think I was more impressed by the cross than the goal. When's the last time we've had a winger put in something like that? Brilliant.

885~~~
Can get 15 goals this season when he gets fully accustomed to the team, very exciting player.

886~~~
That was bloody good. First time he's played with confidence for us, and it showed.

887~~~
the thing is that he knows when to pass but he knows when to not force a pointless pass. Often selfish players do the opposite, they play the pointless passes but when theres a good pass to make they go a bit greedy.

888~~~
It was phenomenal. Fellaini didn't even have to jump. Blind would've scored it. 

What a player. Worthy #7 finally.

889~~~
Looks gutted he missed that Rooney lay-off, understandably but he keeps being in the positions I'm sure more braces and hattricks will come! Lacked a bit of composure from that move, seems to score the harder ones and over complicates the easier chances but probably due to his age, he certainly doesn't lack confidence!

890~~~
Van Gaal is an eccentric individual who wants to be different. I understands the psychology to that as sometimes thinking the conventional way, is too easy.

891~~~
That attack that could have sealed his hattrick was an absolute joy. Shaw was running riot on the right side, Rooney with an amazing lay off and Depay had his hattrick to score. Wonderful performance in the end,

892~~~
What a performance. Haven't seen such an exciting attacking performance from a United winger in a while. Was just bombarding them.

893~~~
Good point from Hoddle on BT just now - the lad can actually take a corner.

894~~~
Let's just be happy he didn't take ages to make the most sensible decision.

895~~~
Best player ever.

896~~~
Key word is "sleeps."

897~~~
Great 2 goals, 1 assist, no complaints. He missed the easiest chance though

898~~~
Missed a Hattrick for us <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>. SELL SELL.

899~~~
His corners have surprisingly impressed me. I dont know how many corners Di Maria took last year that never cleared the first man.

900~~~
Interesting post-match interview with him. Seems furious with himself for scuffing that chance on the counter. Good to see that even after a MOTM performance, he still feels he could have done better. Looks really up for the challenge, and has a real desire to always do better.

901~~~
Scary upside really, still so much more to offer. And oh yeah, he has big guns than Hazard.

902~~~
Think sometimes he hesitates a little, but he is brilliant. His shooting technique is great. Always clean strikes. (apart from the sitter) <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

903~~~
Yeah I liked that a lot. Shows just how determined he is.

904~~~
Brilliant by him. Sorry for him for not getting the hattrick but he got the assist.

905~~~
Great display overall, even without the goals. He just looks like a player, that wants to get involved all the time and make things happen. The runs he makes into space, even when the ball is on the other side of the park, is clearly something we have been missing on the wings for some time now.

906~~~
He was shockingly bad at everything.

907~~~
Definitely selfish. He ignored about 6 runs Shaw made for him and 1 from Schweini and chose poor options in most of those cases.

Still had a great game before anyone jumps on me...

908~~~
The flair for his goals was just wow. Great player in there if he fulfills his potential. Great performance tonight.

909~~~
No, a comment on the game and his performance in that specific game right after the game had finished. Great job on your unique ability to continue with your head firmly lodged where it gets little sunshine.

910~~~
Fecking missed the game, but after reading in here it sounds like di maria won't be missed.

911~~~
Januzaj over Herrera/Mata in the #10 is another baffling one. but well I guess he'll figure it out by Feb

912~~~
You're allowed to ignore runs sometimes. He picked out a lot of passes when he didn't have to. In fact didn't he try to square it across to Januzaj when he was practically through on goal and should have shot himself?

913~~~
Until big Phil returns!

Top performance though

914~~~
He did have that chance where he was clean through on for his hattrick and chose to square it for someone else instead though.

915~~~
Needs to improve his whip dance though..

916~~~
Just oozes confidence.

917~~~
I love him. Just what the team needs, a player with his class and confidence. Can't wait to see what he does vs Newcastle on the back of this.

918~~~
Needs to form a better understanding with Shaw, who could be an incredible threat with his pace, as he never really made proper use of the overlap until the opposition had already settled defensively.

Two good goals, may be should have had four but it will be good for him to get off the mark. He still made a fair few mistakes and poor decisions in the game which we can hopefully iron out of him but he always looked to be the most dangerous player on the pitch which bodes well considering his age and relative newness to the team.

Without the last minute assist I don't think he would have been a clear MOM but in the end deserved it.

919~~~
Yeah his corners were actually very good! Been too long since we had a decent corner taker.

920~~~
He's not Ronaldo but he's the closest thing we've ever had since.

921~~~
hey now!

922~~~
Great game. 2 goals and 1 assist. Should probably have had 3 goals but it was a great game non the less. Hope make a lot of progress this season and become one of our best players.

923~~~
More money going on him to bag a goal against the barcodes... actually I better not jinx him!

924~~~
Di Maria is forgotten.

925~~~

926~~~
Doesn't seem like it in this thread. Some people can't stop banging on about him.

927~~~
Brilliant today. Seems to do better when he doesn't have time to think about it but that will come with experience. MOTM by a country mile.

928~~~
That's exactly what you want from your players

929~~~
I'm really excited by Memphis, he's young, fast, tricky and unpredictable.

930~~~
Class. Was a threat throughout the whole game. Scored two great goals and made a super assist for Fellaini. Just wish he finished his 'nae nae' celebration.

931~~~
We have a gem here. I can just feel it!

932~~~
What a performance. So good to see a United winger do step-overs, flicks, tricks, backheels, score goals, and swing a great cross in!  Complete performance today.  Could have also been perfect if he had scored that one chance!

933~~~
Oh My God. What a performance. M7

934~~~
He is just like Ronaldo isn't he.
Good we need that hunger. Pedro on the other side and Mata pulling strings and we're set.

935~~~
2 stunning goals and a quality cross for an assist. 

If only he scored that Rooney flick, what a glorious performance it could have been <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

936~~~
Sometimes. I'm pretty sure he ignored every single overlap. Certainly in the 2nd half he did.

937~~~
Another piece of the jigsaw in place and all of a sudden this team is really starting to take shape. 

Memphis could be the flat track bully that we lacked last season.

938~~~
What a beautiful team goal that would have been. Typical United goal of old. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

939~~~
That first goal was stunning. It had everything.

940~~~
Second one wasn't bad either! Nor was the cross!

941~~~
Absolutely chuffed for him. I've said the same thing every game since he's come here - "Good , but looks short of his usual confidence/swagger". 5 minutes into this game, way before Brugge got their goal he looked his usual self. Full if confidence and took an early shot on goal as if it was a warning shot. 

Fantastic performance with the only downside that he didn't get his hat-trick.

942~~~
Someone needs to tell Van Gaal not to tamper with Depay, as he could easily decline as fast as Di Maria did with poor man management. Just leave him as he is and he will have an excellent season.

943~~~
I love his attitude. He's going to be something special.

944~~~
Two quality goals, an assists and got himself in positions to score two more, he's a proper wide forward and it's great to see. I also love the attitude that he's more annoyed with the ones he missed than pleased about the two he scored.

945~~~
Now I know why janmaat got himself red carded <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

946~~~
2 average performances and a brilliant one - I'd settle for that sort of return

Hopefully LVG has ditched his mental experiment to use him as a No 10 <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

947~~~
He has that Ronaldo/Nani attitude that we've missed for a while.

948~~~
Well the good Di Maria only lasted like 7 matches. The imposter after than was utter wank. Depay looks class and he actually wants to be here.

949~~~
I love him already!

950~~~
The number seven shirt finally has a worthy wearer again.

951~~~
If he keeps working hard,keeps progressing as player,club needs to pay attention on his contract,give him 5 years,at the end of 2nd year offer him new 5 year (repeat).I know people might say,why we should offer him new one after just 2 years,when he has 3 remaining but seems last year of contract bs turned into last 2 years.Not saying Memphis is that type of person/player but fear crazy times incoming when it comes to agent/player power.

952~~~
Sun sport 
"Skills Depay the bills"

953~~~
Take it out on Newcastle Memphis.

954~~~
What a contrast to ADM. Fanstastic.

955~~~
How much did he cost? I know it isn't £31m like Sky keeping saying and Daniel Taylor just wrote £25m in his article for tonight. I thought it was 31m euro which is £22m?

956~~~
And you are right.

957~~~
Definitely looked happy on the LW. Think he should (and will) stay there from now on. MoTM. Great goals and a brilliant cross for the third.

958~~~
IIRC, it was 27m euro that could go up to 31m euros with add-ons. <a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> has the reliable Dutch sources that I can't arsed to check.

959~~~
The fact he didn't score that third one may be a good thing, because you can tell that really irked him.

He'll get his head down and look to score more and that's exactly what we need. Rooney isn't going to be firing 30 for us, so we need someone like Memphis to take the initiative.

960~~~
That's the right attitude. This is the secret to Ronaldo's success - never satisfied, always wanting more and Memphis is the same. Very encouraging.

961~~~
Absolutely agree. Let's see how he goes for the time being, but we have to be alert this time around.

962~~~
Polar opposite to ADM - Actually wants to be here and appears determined to succeed through any means necessary. Good to see!

963~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpRzu3udaEY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Top attitude from Memphis, looked quite disappointed with himself to not get a hattrick.

964~~~
That attitude is spot on: very good is not good enough. That is what makes the best players, so if he can get close to the top then good on him to have that drive. Definitely the most excited to see how his career progresses alongside Januzaj. 

Also, get Adnan to Memphis size and he would have no problem being bullied off the ball!

965~~~
I really like his attitude, he's cocky and constantly wants to improve. He scored 2 great goals but he could have easily scored another 2 (the one he passed sideways to Januzaj instead of shooting, and the one he fecked up from the Rooney flick), it's nice that he's disappointed for not scoring 4.

966~~~
I thought that he would need more time,a project to shine in 2/3 years but really impressed me tonight.Very good signing

967~~~
I love his attitude and composure on the ball, hopefully it won't be long until his free kicks will be testing many goalkeepers. I'm looking forward to seeing him develop over the next couple of years.

972~~~
There'll be games where he frustrates the shit out of me. Was good tonight though.

973~~~
He's such a goalthreat, always pops up at the right moments and has the striking technique to score from outside the box on a consistent basis, not just a few times. His finishing has been a bit subpar but I'm confident that he will sort that out.

974~~~
cheers for taking the time. appreciated it

975~~~
Real attacking performance. Gave the ball away and was out of position occasionally, but you cant have it all.

976~~~
absolute beast. definitely gonna get the #7 shirt this year

977~~~
He has that self-belief that borders on arrogance, but is kept in check because he has such high expectations of himself. Not too different from Ronnie is that aspect, not to mention the sheer power in his long range shots. Every right-back in the country will have their eyes on him now though.

978~~~
Which makes it important for the Shaw-Memphis partnership to start clicking properly.

979~~~
We've finally found a worthy number 7.

980~~~
A complete performance by Memphis. No matter how much we try and hide the comparison with CR7, he shows those attributes of a young Ronaldo. There will be time when he frustrates the shit out of us all and then he might just come up with something magical. Really getting excited to see him play more. 

Get Pedro on the right, Memphis on Left with Mata playing behind Rooney and we will create more chances. Plus he is building a good understanding with Rooney and Shaw.

981~~~
Doesn't just seen happy to be here. Is excited and driven to play at OT. Going to be a good one.

982~~~
Looks a complete attacker and seems like he will become the go-to guy, if he isn't already. Takes the corners and free kicks, scores goals, trickery, it's all there bar the consistency. Well suited to the left side.

983~~~
Yup agreed. Have just mentioned this in the Luke Shaw page. If they start properly creating space and options for each other, they'll be very hard to stop down the left wing.

984~~~
Surely now this boy has the LW position locked down. Hes far far better when playing on the wing it gives him many option. Hes a decent finisher though I expect him to put away easy chances like the one he missed towards the end. Maybe its the crappy Under Armour shoes <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

985~~~
Loving his attitude, seems to have the right mentality to be a proper united number 7. 

He will improve so much more, and get the consistency in his finishing and decision making. Great performance last night from Memphis.

986~~~
Let's see what mr. Owen has to say. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://scontent-vie1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/11921617_1730332953778896_8025866031231321137_n.jpg?oh=332887cfb2fe644e2b03e2f313e30f1c&amp;oe=563E39A5" src="https://scontent-vie1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/11921617_1730332953778896_8025866031231321137_n.jpg?oh=332887cfb2fe644e2b03e2f313e30f1c&amp;oe=563E39A5"/>

987~~~
Finally a player with flair is on our wings. He is just the kind of winger United fans love.

988~~~
Memphis and Shaw look like they're going to develop into a real threat down the left over the course of the season. Here's hoping they both stay fit because they work really well together.

989~~~
Haha <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> A bit unfair though, as it's pretty obvious that he meant "looks like a a footballer <i>should do,</i> doesn't he." And he went on to explain why.

I was a bit disappointed and baffled when I heard Owen was commentating, but I was positively surprised.

990~~~
Tbf he has already gotten much bigger. He can't get too bulky or it will hinder his speed and agility. He does seem to be naturally rather slender. You can't really compare him to Memphis, who has a completely different body.

991~~~
He appears to have a great attitude about on him out on the pitch, head down and work hard type of a lad. If he can consistently fire out performances like that or near enough to it anyways we'll be a completely different animal this year when it comes to going forward.

992~~~
Both goals were absolutely incredible. The first one and the little seal dribble, wow. He really could be some player for us. A footballer Michael?

993~~~
<a class="username" data-user="20951, @acnumber9" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20951/">@acnumber9</a> is waiting in the shadows sharpening his stilettos and ready to pounce when he has an average performance. Who cares about giving time to nurture a top talent, immediate results or bench him for Youngie. Imagine scoundrels like him in our coaching staff.

Disaster.

994~~~
Cross for the third goal was fantastic as well. Sort of like Di Maria's against Arsenal last season.

995~~~
Why do you have to stoop to this kind of childish bollocks, just enjoy the win and his performance.

996~~~
This. Hopefully the Caf will remain patient when the games where nothing goes right for him come. He was given a lot of space tonight, Brugge were playing an open game.

But I'm very excited, he just gets you on your toes when he has the ball. Is he genuinely two-footed? That unpredictability of whether he'd cut in or not would make him a very dangerous attacker.

997~~~
He had something like 7-8 shots on goal. That kind of personal ambition we've lacked since Ronaldo left. Very good performance. Sometimes we've lacked someone to take that responsibility and when you think about it he should be on 4 goals right now. I think yesterday was the first time, he's woke up to the challenge so now he's set himself a bar.

They were open but he doesn't need that much space. He just needs to have a good final ball.

998~~~
Don't mind his selfishness at all, he's shown that he'll put the teams chances before his own when time is right when he tried to lay it on for Januzaj. I just think that he himself realises sometimes he is the teams best chance to score, looks really threatening everytime he picks up the ball and advances towards the box, his long shots are gunna be a real asset for breaking teams down.

999~~~
Two goals were superb regardless of the opposition, chorus land should have ended up with with a few more. It's so easy to see why he has to play on the left.

1000~~~
That was a "just give him the ball" kinda performance! Been a while since we've seen that from an individual. Great to witness and awesome to see how much it meant to him.

1001~~~
LVG needs to stop saying shit like this or Depay will start playing shit. Imagine waking up and seeing LVG's fat head going in for a kiss... who would want that? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <span style="color: #ffffff">maybe apart from his wife!...maybe</span>

1002~~~
I have to say I really enjoyed watching him play last night. It's been a while since I have enjoyed an individual performance like that for us. He's such a positive threat every time he picks up the ball, always looking to drive at the defence. It wasn't perfect and I'm sure he'll frustrate on occasion but it's nice to have a player who you can really look forward to watching every week. Bring in Pedro for the right side and use Mata/Januzaj through the middle and we might just have ourselves an worthy attack.

1003~~~
Looks to have the ability and attitude of someone who is going to be one hell of a player for us. Think we're going to see some inconsistency early on but there'll be plenty of performances like last night to come from him.

1004~~~
There are certain matches that stick with you for a long time nae forever, because you feel like you've witnessed a player truly announce themselves as a United player. Ronaldo v Bolton, Rooney's ECL debut, Kleberson v Blackburn.... well okay, not all of those matches bare the same fruit, but I'm confident last night we saw the start of something really special. 

Take a bow Memphis Depay <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

ps. The fact he was so pissed that he missed his hatrick chance shows his drive to improve and become a great player (imho)
pps. I scored a lovely chip in my local match last night. I didnt give a toss about my earlier misses. I'll never be a "great" <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1005~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Haha.
I watched his post match interview, this kid reminds of Ronaldo. He was really pissed off with himself. This guy is going to the top, we need to make sure his contracts are tied up always because Madrid or Barca will come knocking in a few years

1006~~~
ppps. That LVG "I want to kiss him" clip is properly creepy !!! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1007~~~
Really exciting performance, agree with <a class="username" data-user="1919, @MancFanFromManc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/1919/">@MancFanFromManc</a> that we'll be looking back on it in a few years as the start of something very special.

1008~~~
He was very good but then he probably could have had 4 goals on the night. The one where he tried to square it for Mata was odd, not to mention the one he blazed over the bar from the penalty spot. What's good to see is he looked pissed off with himself in the post match interview. 

But yeah, he was fantastic and his two goals were sublime. He's electric over the first 10-15 yards.

1009~~~
A shame he missed that chance. The game was so reminiscent of Rooney vs Fenerbache on his debut. 

One thing I really like about him is he always has plenty of shots per game, which is really something we lacked. He's also got a great shot, and excellent movement, so it's basically a guarantee that he will score a lot of goals even if his finishing is erratic at first with him being a young player. But we needed that directness in our attack that we lacked for a long time. Think he had like 8 shots yesterday, and between 5-7 against both Villa and Spurs. Can't see him scoring less then 15 goals or so in all competitions, which would be a terrific total for his first season in England really.

1010~~~
This guy reminds of Rooney, when we first got him.
He was aggressive, powerful, physical, fast and had 1 thing on his mind - score a goal.
I'm impressed.

1011~~~
I know, I was just joking.

But he does need to sort out staying on his feet, otherwise he won't get anywhere in terms of development. Some of the best players in the league like Silva are small and slender too, but you don't see them going to ground after every tussle.

1012~~~
The best thing about him is his desire to become a top top player. His post match interview showed he was still disappointed that he couldn't score more and that is very impressive. He's the sort of person who wouldn't settle for just "good" and would want to be the "best" he can.

1013~~~
He needs to learn something like Judo. Clearly has no clue how to shift his weight to make himself solid.

Either that, or he really is fecking weak.

1014~~~
I remember a point in the match, which might not have been visible on TV. Shaw was caught well out of position and Memphis realised this and sprinted full pelt into the left back position where a Brugge man was free to roam through on goal had his teammate noticed him. I'm aware that he didn't offer Shaw much defensive cover in that game, but that little moment really impressed me. (Can't find a video clip unfortunately).

1015~~~
great to see him playing with his usual confidence. against spurs and villa just got a feeling he was a bit nervous (maybe) but he was bloody brilliant yesterday.

a slight space and chance to shoot, and he will. we need this kind of a player and glad we have memphis.

1016~~~
Does anyone think he could be better than hazard?  I eint saying he is at all; that would be stupid but he does have a bit more composure around the box than hazard did at a similar period.

1017~~~
He's a more productive player (or has the style of one), Hazard is more of a play maker. However, Hazard really should do better in front of goal. But I don't want to stray off topic.

1018~~~
i think memphis got more goals in him than hazard does. in terms of overall play memphis still got some catching to do but i can see memphis outscoring hazard even in his first season here.

1019~~~
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Dapay was brilliant the last game, such a breath of fresh air after the mediocre wing play we have been subjected to in the last few years, even during Fergie's last couple of seasons. However, he won't get the amount of space in the PL that he got in the last game againt Brugge. There are lot of frustrating times ahead, where he would try things and consistently lose the ball and frustrate. Hazard excels in those situations, let's see if Depay can.

1020~~~
Yep i get that & i think we would be better off having a forward on the right than a playmaker like mata. 

Players like memphis are frightening when you know that a similar player is playing on the other side.

1021~~~
Depay: Can play like 9/10 and will score 2 goals. Can play like a 1/10 and score 2 goals.

Pretty much exactly what you need.

1022~~~
I think he can be.. he is naturally more athletic, has amazing shot technique, better set piece taker aside from pens  and has a wonderful eye for a pass. Long way to go obviously but he has the potential.

1023~~~
Does this sort of thing belong here? The player specific tweet thread looks underused (not sure what to do <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>)

1024~~~
That is pretty cool.

This goal got me thinking, are the Adidas CL ball's heavier and have a more realistic inner weight? The Nike ball to me always seemed way to light, like a volleyball almost. Like you weren't kicking a solid ball, more a balloon with nothing inside it.

1025~~~
Didn't the commentator mention those balls are awful light when Schweinstieger misplaced a Scholes type pass to switch wings?

1026~~~
Not sure, I probably didn't have those comms. I always thought those Adidas balls felt more solid, less floaty.

1027~~~
A good performance, maybe a goal against Newcastle and he will really be able to get going, the crowd will really give him that confidence.

1028~~~
Saw some on twitter willing to bet he will be our top scorer this season. I think I'd go along with that personally.

1029~~~
Signs of brilliance, but also frustrating.

1030~~~
100% exactly what I was expecting from him being a young player in a new league. Especially in that sort of position.

1031~~~
Needs to stay calm, could have a goal and an assist already.

1032~~~
Greedy bugger.

1033~~~
Yeah, me too. It was obvious before he joined that his decision making wasn't going to be ideal, but that will come with time.

1034~~~
Definitely got a touch of Nani in him. Frustrating as feck at times.

1035~~~
Decision making a bit off at the moment, our most dangerous player though.

1036~~~
Still our most likely player to get or create a goal. Frustrating though

1037~~~
We'll see if he's really Nani if in a few years time he shows this. For the moment, given his age, this type of performance is perfectly understandable.

1038~~~
gonna be infuriating at times I can tell.
back to his take the wrong option/end up on the floor league form

1039~~~
The pace of PL matches is on a whole other wavelength than the Eredivisie, therefore he's bound to have frustrating moments but the talent is clear to see and it really is a matter of maybe 1 season before he regularly starts banging em in.

1040~~~
Frustrating but his talent is abundantly clear and he picks up some good positions.

1041~~~
It would be nice if he would pass to his teammates.

1042~~~
He'll score today

1043~~~
Our only threat that half. That is all.

1044~~~
Yes the one where he shot from that crazy angle when he should have pulled it back was criminal

1045~~~
He tries too hard which can be good and bad at the same time.

1046~~~
He's been very wasteful, but at least he looks to be trying things and is always lively.

1047~~~
Started off well like our whole team then after about 30 minutes went to shit like everyone else really.

1048~~~
Lies Januzaj has been a threat, should have 2 assists

1049~~~
Back to Bellion? All jokes aside, he looks lively. Just needs to relax a bit. He's had some good moments.

1050~~~
Yep, I said this on Tuesday, he's a bit selfish.

1051~~~
Seemed a lot greedier so far today perhaps due to the goals midweek.

1052~~~
Wouldnt call him selfish, just gets it wrong today. Shoots when he should pass, and passes when he should shoot.

1053~~~
I think it's been awful performance so far from him. Shadow of the player we seen Tuesday night.

1054~~~
Having a bit of Nani today.

1055~~~
Great start. Shame how he went missing after messing up the one on one. Gotta keep his chin up and keep playing.

1056~~~
I don't care if he is selfish, our best moments came mostly after his play. His shooting is letting him down though.

1057~~~
He can definitely make something happen, but his decision making needs to sharpen up. Looks constantly dangerous, but a little wasteful so far. Definitely looking much sharper out wide than in the middle though. He's getting behind his man plenty. Just needs to keep his head up. Shaw has made great runs a number of times, but he's chosen the wrong option.

1058~~~
This is the reality, he's a 21 year old. No one should be going overboard on this performance or on Brugge.

1059~~~
He was very lively I felt. Got past the RB(a CB) easily and could have scored 2 maybe but krul saved. Nothing awful at all

1060~~~
Yeah, he seems to dwell on missed chances for quite a while. It showed him a few times after that one on one and you could still see him grimacing and shaking his head. Same as in midweek. He missed that sitter form the Rooney backheel, and he just looked pissed off for the rest of the half, even into the post match interview.

1061~~~
Spot on. Just what happens with a young player like this.

1062~~~
Wasteful today.

1063~~~
if it was Young having this half, this place would go crazy<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> completely wasteful in the final third but I'd back him up and send him into second half with the same instructions, the rightback's having a mere and we should make use of it, using Shaw more often..

1064~~~
So what if he is wasteful.. he is a bundle of creativity and a chance making machine. He is a threat who can attract attention and make space for others.

1065~~~
Perfect performance for a youngster. Confident, taking people on, but making a few wrong decisions. It will come in time. 

Because of his size and price tag people seem to expect the finished article. If he was the finished article he would have cost 3 times as much.

1066~~~
He needs to improve his decision making and end product. Other than that, he has been our most dangerous attacking player despite how poor those aforementioned attributes has been.

1067~~~
Extremely frustrating today.

1068~~~
Should've took him off after an hour. He was knackered and could barely run at the end.

1069~~~
Childlike mentality if he's going to not actually play if the referee gives him a hard time.

He basically didn't play after 30 minutes when the ref gave a couple of fouls against him.

1070~~~
A lesson in patience so far then.

Has the right tools but not the right brain at the minute but he's young and learnin'

Nani mk.2 performance today though.

1071~~~
Looked knackered in the last 30mins.

1072~~~
Wasn't great today, lost the ball far too much and didn't do much with it.

1073~~~
Utterly disappointing in the league so far.

1074~~~
Rubbish today.

1075~~~
Really needs to work on first touch especially when he's running onto the ball. That's where the likes of Ronaldo and Robben can really kill a defence.

1076~~~
Faded badly in the second. Should've been taken off instead off Darmian, although not sure if Young would've made a difference. We really need another quality attacker.

His corners are class though.

1077~~~
Frustrated with him today. Damn he's my captain in the fantasy

1078~~~
Very poor today in all aspects, even his touch was off. Hard to believe he's not bottom of the match day ratings.

1079~~~
No idea why he was left on. A 20 year old playing three games in a short space of time, he barely got involved after 30 minutes, it was clear he was cooked. Obviously not his fault and I am not having a go at him but it was bizarre not subbing him, especially with Young being hungry for some of the action.

1080~~~
Was beating his man for fun in the first half, and only being let down by the final ball or wrong decision. Not sure what happened in the second half, but he wasn't really in the game anywhere near as much. 

Still exciting player to watch and another day things will click and he will have a few goals/assist.

1081~~~
He seemed tired and was unable to involve himself in the last 20 mins when we could have used his pace to break them down. Maybe, Louie should have replaced him with Young.

1082~~~
He looked tired, 3 games in a week for a club like Man United is tough for a 21 year old. He has a harder time pulling stuff off in the Premier League, but hopefully that will come with time and experience.

1083~~~
Typical young winger performance. Inconsistent and frustrating. Not a big concern.

1084~~~
He looked tired and sluggish after the 60th minute mark. We could have done with Young at that time.

1085~~~
Made some really dumb decisinons today, but still managed to be our most dangerous attacking outlet.

1086~~~
Tired really quickly.

1087~~~
Expect more performances like this this season, needs to do better but will come good in the longterm

1088~~~
Should be coming on as a sub this season/starting in the league cup.  Some very poor decision making today, which isn't surprising for a young player but very frustrating that the club have pinned all their hopes on such a young and inexperienced lad.

Don't get me wrong, no doubt he's going to be a very good player but he's not ready yet.

1089~~~
I love memphis, he does something great then something stupid, and i'm fine with that, he's one of the few unpredictable players in the team.

1090~~~
Inconsistency is to be expected. Gets past players at will which is great to see as we haven't had that in a while (7 dribbles I think? When was the last time a united player did that?). End product can be frustrating but you can tell he's got the talent. Visibly tired in the second half though.

1091~~~
I thought he should have been subbed off. I blame van Gaal a bit for his performance today, clearly playing him too much the last week or so. A shame he had a bad match but it'll happen.

1092~~~
He was tired and should get a rest against Brugges (deserves one).

1093~~~
He looked completely shot at the end.

1094~~~
We seem to be reliant on him. No one else takes the onus to do something out of the blue.

1095~~~
Glad to see many sensible comments about the lad, he's going to have a few off performances at this stage of his career. He's a trier though, always trying to make something happen which is good to see.

1096~~~
The only one of our creative players who looked like doing anything of note. Needs to improve his decision making and final ball but the talent is obvious. I think we're in or a season of being entirely too dependent on him to produce the spark in our attack.

1097~~~
The "magic" was there in his game in the first half, he was tearing the fullback apart, but his work after that was poor, and he gradually just disappeared from the game.

We will get a lot of this given he's still a kid.

1098~~~
It's a bit ridiculous that we're this expectant/reliant on a 21 year old really.

1099~~~
Was really poor today but is always looking to create, which is what we need.

Some of the things that came off for him last year will prove to be more difficult in this league.

He is still adjusting and expect this to be a work in process over the next month or so.

1100~~~
You wouldn't see that with Bayern, Real and Barca. Not even City or Chelsea.

1101~~~
Yep, I don't agree with it. He should be one of the cogs and not the go-to guy.

1102~~~
There was too much pressure on him. It seems if a side has him covered, they'll be fine. We need some magic elsewhere. Mata/Rooney/Januzaj need to get their asses in gear.

1103~~~
Didn't really come off for him today but I was happy with his performance in the sense that he's always trying something.

Could do with watching a few videos of how ronaldo heads the ball though!

1104~~~
Exactly. My worry is that the structure of the squad makes us far too reliant on Memphis performing, but that's not his concern.

1105~~~
He seemed like the only player out there who gave a damn in the first half especially.

1106~~~
To be honest, I'm impressed by his level of skill. Was genuinely taking the piss during the beginning of the game. 

Hopefully with time he spots and picks the pass better when it's the better option.

1107~~~
Stage 1 of his ronaldofication - the frustration. Did plenty good things but did more bad esp the final ball e.g. ball-hogging, going down easily, on-sight shooting w/o enough control, wrong passes when he did at times. It'll come.

He's 21 and he's shown that he has it in him so I'm not too worried. The problem is when all 3 attackers don't perform we don't tend to score so hopefully he will have more on than of das esp if he's continually paired with the hot & cold januzaj and the freezing Rooney!

1108~~~
this. It was the same with LVG at the World Cup relying on one player; Robben.

1109~~~
Excellent play in the lead-up to the goal. Lovely little pass to Rooney as well.

1110~~~
He's going to get a shit load of assists this season isn't he? I think he'll weigh in with a fairly decent amount of goals too!

1111~~~
Very quickly becoming my favourite player at United. It's been a long time since we've had a player who makes you want him to have the ball at any opportunity, just to see what he does. RVP (in the early days) and Nani (in 10/11) had a bit of that, but we've missed having a player who will run at a bunch of defenders at any given chance. I love the urgency he provides to our play. 

Early days yet and he still has so many things to work on, but it's good to see that he has hit the ground running with us. If he improves his decision-making and stays injury-free, he will prove to be a magnificent signing.

1112~~~
He's by far our most threatening player, he frustrates a lot but Im glad that he's getting in positions.

1113~~~
I'm assuming you mean shooting at almost every opportunity? I personally find it refreshing as most of our players won't try it. To me Memphis also has a pretty decent football brain. Very good player considering his age

1114~~~
If he is like that at his age, with so many things to still improve, I cannot wait to see the kinda player he can become once he matures in his game.

1115~~~
He is very exciting to watch; reminds me so much of Nani, but it feels like he has so much more drive than Nani ever had to improve.

1116~~~
He's already our best attacking player.

1117~~~
Once he works on his decision making, he'll be absolutely brilliant.

1118~~~
T

Today his decision making has been very good imo.

1119~~~
We're already relying on him, as he's the one attacking player who plays with real confidence.

1120~~~
He messed up that chance when him and Rooney had a 2 on 1. Otherwise yes his decisions have been very good

1121~~~
It's been decent but big moments like that chance he could have easily passed to Rooney could be costly in the future.

1122~~~
One thing I will say about him, watching him over the past few games, is that he needs to use his left foot a bit more, even just a little. If he can do that, he will truly be unplayable.

1123~~~
Yeah that's one but generally he's been more concrete than vs Newcastle.

1124~~~
Agreed.

1125~~~
He needs a goal today. He's been playing well though - Rooney 2 on 1 aside, he's made the right decisions every time. Should have had an assist for Schweinsteiger, too.

1126~~~
Good game. Constantly dangerous. He should have been subbed imo. He plays non stop.

1127~~~
Was very good, but again, looked knackered post-70 minutes. Not sure why LVG won't give him a rest!

1128~~~
Imagine Januzaj in Moyes form on one wing and this fella on the other, he's beast I hope he will work hard so we can see him reaching the very top, he has all the potential

1129~~~
Special player. Great assist and deserved a goal. Should've won a penalty too.

1130~~~
A joke he didn't get a goal tonight. Very good game from him. You saw Schwein in his ear constantly too. Noticed it in the background when Chich was lining up his penalty. I actually wanted Memphis to take it, and I bet he was expecting it too. Needed another goal under his belt tonight to keep him sharp. Excellent assist for Rooney's first, and played Herrera in well for his second. 

Dangerous for an hour, then looked tired and went right down to first gear. People need to give him a better final ball - when we counter, he's always in miles of space due to his pace.

1131~~~
Another good game.

1132~~~
Once his decision making process improves he's going to be really good. Can get past players with ease, he can just hold on to the ball a bit too long at times though.

1133~~~
Hangs onto the ball too long sometimes but once he gets that sorted will be a beast.

1134~~~
He's not great at penalties, missed about as many as he's scored. I don't expect him to take them any time soon unless he's been working on them in training after de Jong got that duty at PSV somewhere at the start of last season.

1135~~~
Lovely to see a player so young and with that "fear factor" play consistently well. Most flair player i have seen either have great or terrible games. He can assist and score. We have missed that since Ronnie.

PS: He seems stronger mentally than Di Maria as well. It is weird for me to see someone that young and with so much less experience than Di Maria have stronger character. You can just see it in his eyes, he looks to improve and not dwell on disappointments.

1136~~~
Sometimes he was frustrating tonight but mostly shown us what we can expect to come, very very happy with how he's started the season. That assist was wank worthy and I didn't know he had that in his locker.

Champions league record so far:
2 games
2 goals
2 assists 

Not bad at all even if they were against Brugge. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1137~~~
Class tonight. Should've scored but his pass to Rooney was brilliant. He played in Herrera to square it to Rooney and the run before laying it off to Schweinsteiger was great.

1138~~~
Yep, he needs to learn to release the ball earlier on some occasions. To be expected though, from a young and confident player.

1139~~~
If this is his young, inexperienced settling in period, can you imagine how good he'll be in a year or two? Special talent.

1140~~~
Started off like he was still playing in the Newcastle game, then got it sorted out and started looking for his forward partners and ended up having a good game.

1141~~~
Only concern is that LvG will burn him out. Wouldn't have minded him getting a rest either against Brugge or Newcastle. Will wait and see though because he was good again.

1142~~~
Did really well again tonight but my only worry is that he's been very poor in the league so far. Hope that changes soon! Same goes for all of our attack to be honest.

1143~~~
"Very poor" is a bit of an exaggeration. But I agree with you that his European performances have been much better than his three PL ones. 

He's definitely an exciting talent. When you take into account his age, there aren't many in the world with more potential. His decision-making is still a bit lacking at times, but he has all the attributes to reach that much talked about "world class" or - as Fergie would put it - "top, top" level.

1144~~~
Fantastic run for the first goal. Granted that Brugge's defenders were all over the shop last night, but Memphis really tore them a new one.

The fact that hes still so young makes it even more exciting

1145~~~
Good at shooting but bad at finishing apparently from the 5 games we've played this season. He could easily have an extra 4+ goals for us right now but he stuffs up that one glorious chance he seems to get every game.

1146~~~
The ease in which he finds himself in goal scoring opportunities is really comforting,  it'll click for him soon and he'll bag himself a hattrick. Doesn't give Shaw any help defensively but Shaws that good it doesn't bother me too much.

1147~~~
On a scale of 1 to ten for quick players. How quick do we think Memphis is?

1148~~~
I still think he will turn out to be the bargain purchase of the summer

1149~~~
He's definitely going to frustrate and excite in equal measure. One would hope that as he matures his frustrating moments will get less frequent.

1150~~~
I get a Nani feeling many a time. He has skills. But he shoots to the skies and sometimes takes unnecessary shots.
Hope he will have more of excellent moments.

1151~~~
7.5/8

1152~~~
His top speed isn't THAT quick, but his acceleration is the real weapon he has. His top speed is quick enough that nobody will catch him easily, but his movement and acetylation is what buys himself so much space, it makes him almost seem quicker than he is.

Michael Owen is such a gormless balloon. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1154~~~
The move and pass through to Rooney is something we never see from any of our players. Beautiful pass and vision. He can only improve from here.

1155~~~
His "frustrating" moments aren't even frustrating me. He brings so much freshness, creativity and speed into our attack that I completely enjoy watching him. He has to work on his finishing but apart from that I really love watching him play.

1156~~~
The "frustrating" thing about Depay is how vocal the fanbase is about wanting creativity and purpose in our play and how quickly players who try it are slaughtered when they don't come off.

1157~~~
Your auto-correct is a smart-arse isn't it?

1158~~~
Yup. At least by some of them. Quite annoying.

1159~~~
They don't frustrate me either, it's more like "if only that worked" rather than "ffs what are you doing ?"

1160~~~
Haha! I have no idea what that even means and definitely haven't said that before <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1161~~~
What I like about Memphis is that he seems to have a burning desire to get better. The same desire Ronaldo had, and that other great champions have. He was gutted when he missed that one on one yesterday but he's up and at 'em again straight afterwards.

1162~~~
Yes I agree, really good positive and ambitious attitude, it's a great start.

1163~~~
Goes to show the fine margins. I see no difference in that then Rooneys offside against Newcastle

1164~~~
Isnt that the truth! Some in here are complainng about Memphis shooting a lot and then say we dont have anyone who shoots. Also, do people realise Ronaldos shot per game average? That guy is constantly shooting!

1165~~~

1168~~~
Big game for him today, I'm expecting a more open game so he needs to take chances that I'm sure will come

1169~~~
He's getting frustrated, needs to relax a bit.

1170~~~
Sloppy as the game got on. Would like to see him beat a player and just get a cross in the box. We should try him on the right wing.

1171~~~
We're too reliant on him and he's either not used to lack of space he gets or not good enough to cope with it yet.

1172~~~
Im not seeing much of this apparent determination ive heard so much about him. seems a bit disinterested for a team chasing the game

1173~~~
He shouldn't be the one to score/assist all our goals, he should be a player to develop alongside other established forwards.

1174~~~
Been garbage.

1175~~~
I don't know what he is waiting for, been waiting for most of the game

1176~~~
He's had as bad a performance as I've ever seen a United player have. Rooney included.

1177~~~
I feel sorry for the bloke. He's completely knackered.

1178~~~
Spot on although he has been shite in the league every single fixture so far

1179~~~
His worst game. We can't expect him to play week in/week out. 90 mins in Europe on Wednesday wasn't good for him.

1180~~~
Been absolutely shite.

1181~~~
This. Ridiculous to expect a 21 year old to carry our attack

1182~~~
Needs time to settle. 

Mata and Rooney been far worse.

1183~~~
Doesn't seem to offer us anything right now against a proper team.  Probably shouldn't be expecting/relying on him so much given he's only 21 and new to a proper league, but that's the situation we find ourselves in with the state of our squad.

1184~~~
Yeh I agree that's his worst performance where he really did struggle. I'm sure there will be many more ups and downs with this kid but just give him time.

1185~~~
How the hell was he allowed to complete the full 90?

1186~~~
That's why you don't sign a 21 year old kid and rely on him so much.

1187~~~
Struggling with the pace of the league. We shouldn't be relying on him anyway.

1188~~~
Poor but we should not be relying on a 21 year old kid in his debut season at the club to save us every game. Other players & the manager have to do more.

1189~~~
Can you blame him? He's played the full 90 in every single game bar our first one. This whilst he's adjusting to the much faster pace of a new league. It's absolutely maddening that LVG hasn't rested him at all... bordering on complete idiocy.

1190~~~
One very good game surrounded by shite performances. Young should be starting.

1191~~~
Young should have come on for him instead of Mata

1192~~~
You don't see Bayern, Real or Barca relying on a 21 year old player who just transferred from the Eredivisie. He's not ready yet to deliver week in week out but he is a special talent.

1193~~~
Our depth on the wings is pitiful. We need to be giving him the odd game here and there, not playing him every week.

1194~~~
This lad should be being carefully brought into the team. Instead he's been dropped in the deep end and frankly looks shocking.

1195~~~
Atkinson was giving him nothing all game, he became more and more disinterested and casual with pointless flicks and that stupid short freekick.

1196~~~
Agree. He can't even go past a man in the Premier League it seems. The pace is too much for him. He needs to be dropped IMO.

1197~~~
Was crap today.

1198~~~
He looks exactly what he is in the PL, a very talented and confident young player who is having to get used to playing at a higher level than he's used to, he'll be fine.

1199~~~
Awful. Shouldn't be expected to produce miracles though. He has nobody to pass to up front.

1200~~~
He played horrible but it's his first season at a big club in a big league so we shouldnt really expect much of him yet this season.. however he seems to be a starter

1201~~~
A performance to forget.

1202~~~
He was woeful today; constantly turning into danger and over hitting passes in the rare exception that he did find space.

1203~~~
Needs time to develop. Positioning and decision making are sorely lacking.

1204~~~
Days like this are to be expected. The worrying thing is there wasn't even a single moment of brilliance by him, even Rooney had one when he almost scored at the end.

1205~~~
Not his day. Think Toung should have come on for him instead of Mata.

1206~~~
I've said it before and I'll say it again. Both Memphis and Rooney have been utter dross in every single game in the PL this year. They've done next to nothing. Yes, there is a big issue with Mata on the right but those two are our biggest drawbacks right now. Playing well against brugge means feck all as we've seen from their performances in the following games vs Newcastle and now swansea. We couldn't sign another attacker soon enough.

1207~~~
Looked like he downed tools in the second half to me. Was more interested in throwing himself on the floor and moaning at the ref.

1208~~~
***Glass half-full head on***

He's a youngster finding his feet in a new league, and has shown plenty of flashes of ability. So some leeway should be given.

But he needs to be less selfish if you ask me. Currently Nani-esque with his ability to go from the sublime to the frustrating in the blink of an eye.

1209~~~
For a #7, he depends so much on Luke Shaw making a forward run and creating space for him to do anything meaningful. His lack of pace is rather concerning.

1210~~~
Simply gave up in the second half, I don't usually do this but what kind of idiotic character did I just watch, the team was down and all he could do was moan and throw himself to the ground at any slightest touch. Stupid.

1211~~~
gonna have to be patient with this guy, ignore all the going to ground and wasteful possession.
it is criminal he'll have to be such a key player already for us.
is the sort we should have spent a season easing in

1212~~~
his head drooped today and stoped running.... it was a bit nani esc

1213~~~
He's been incapable of taking players on and making space for himself. He basically just let Shaw do his job for him. His passing is also horrendous.

1214~~~
He's been like this practically every game in the PL so far. All his magical moments have come in the two legs vs Brugge. He's yet to have above a 4/10 performance yet in the league for me, and the same goes for Rooney. I would be very very surprised and disappointed if we go in to the season without buying another attacker. And a very good one, at that. Yes, he's young. Yes, he's got buckets of potential and Yes, he's been absolutely abysmal in the league so far. I'm not going to dress it up just because he's young and shows an odd exciting moment here and there. He should be a second option to an already established attacker. I don't understand how we can have any hope of winning the title with him as our main creative/attacking outlet. Rooney as our main goal scoring option gives me no comfort as well.

1215~~~
He spends half the match on the floor. Young did more when he came on

1216~~~
Not sure why he stayed on ahead of mata. Definitely a promising player but we should have got in another established attacker do we didn't need to rely on him this much.

1217~~~
I'm a big fan but he was pretty rubbish today, wasn't in the match at all really apart from the first 15.

1218~~~
Young also had plenty of space and many 1-on-1 situations that he didn't handle well. Memphis was constantly faced with two guys cutting all of his lanes off. Nonetheless, he has to find other ways to be effective then, especially make runs off the ball, even if it's just to open their defense up. He couldn't do anything with the ball today so he started being lazy and that's poor.

1219~~~
He's been rubbish every game in the league so far. Not just today. He was just more rubbish today.

1220~~~
An awful day from him, he's young and will learn but needs to be dropped for a couple of games to wise up.

He fell on his arse today more than falcao did last season, kept losing the ball and failed to cover properly for shaw, he's too casual and needs some hairdryer treatment asap.

1221~~~
Played like a spoilt brat.

1222~~~
He is a young talent, but I think even he would agree that the BPL is a different standard than the Dutch league.  He is showing the desire to improve but at this point he is only potential.

1223~~~
Got to say I'm a bit surprised by the slating he's getting on here.  Wasn't great by any means, and had some poor moments, but he still looked about the most likely source of something happening.  Kept trying stuff, even if not much came off... are you all turning into LVG "keep it safe" clones?

To be clear, I'm not saying that he had a good game, just that nobody did, and at least he was trying.

1224~~~
I thought he got fouled a few times today, but nothing doing from the referee. You need to get back up if you don't get the decision, rather than slapping your hands on the ground.

Did well in spells, especially the cut in and ball to Herrera which Mata pulled wide. Some of his crosses were good too, which we're pretty terrible at attacking. But he can look very lazy when we don't have the ball.

1225~~~
Get used to it, he's a kid and has loads to learn. 

The problem is no one else in this attack can give him a breather. The team don't look to the other side because they know they'll create nothing and turn back.

Not good that MUFC are almost relying on a kid to spark us into life.

1226~~~
What did he try? He deferred to Shaw all day long.

1227~~~
What on earth game did you watch?

He didn't try <i>anything, </i>he was routinely stuffing up 2 yard passes and falling over. In fact, the most disappointing aspect of his performance was that he was so utterly useless at doing the simple things.

1228~~~
Gave him little support too, on or off the ball. He gave the ball to Shaw on the left, then ran into the box. The pace of Shaw and Memphis against the full backs could be dangerous, but we rarely see them attack in tandem. Memphis always comes inside and Shaw is mostly isolated.

1229~~~
Yup, not his fault that we are depending heavily on him. No wonder we are looking absolutely woeful going forward with Rooney declining and Memphis still finding his feet.

1230~~~
He's still young, first season at United and has lots to learn. No he's not going to be our next CR7 just yet. Probably has a lot of talent but stepping up to the Premier League is a whole new ball game. Really needs to find some consistency quickly and cut out all those poor decision making, else he might even up like Nani. Hope not.

1231~~~
He's going to have lots of games like this I imagine, it's not fair to criticise him as he's so young and new to the league though. I said before the season started I was surprised so many people had him in their strongest XI because I thought it would take time for him to settle. I think he's going to be a Nani-esque player, hot and cold.

1232~~~
21 year old in having a bad game in a new league shocker. Give him time, he has massive talent.

1233~~~
Brugge aside...

1234~~~
This. He was useless today, but none of the other attacking players (bar Herrera in the first half) showed anything at all. The team was simply rubbish going forward today. Give him time.

1235~~~
The move that ended up with Matas wide shot? cam inside, nice ball to Herrera who also did well to get it to Mata.

1236~~~
Agreed, people want risk taking then when a young player who is going to be inconsistent just by the virtue of being a young player tries to make an impact he gets hammered. 

If we played fast football in a 4 3 3 and took some risks hed tear it to bits and get a few goals. Its just him on his own most of the time trying to cut in and make stuff happen, hes a good player but you cant expect him to be Hazard in his first season.

1237~~~
Perhaps it's tactics, tiredness or something else but it strikes me that he doesn't have much 'battle' in him -  almost as he gives up when he's not getting the ball and things aren't going right.

Probably reading too much into a bad performance...

1238~~~
He's new to the league, young. Deserves a lot of time to get settled properly. He tried but the game seemed to passed him by. Am sure he will come good. He's got talent. Just needs to know when to dribble and when to pass. Seems to take a lot of time on the ball.

1239~~~
Haven't bothered to read everything, but for goodness sake, this guy has a raw talent, but has only played in the Dutch league. He will learn so much this season about what it takes to play in the EPL. It's not going to happen this season, perhaps marginally better next season, but he has the raw talent to make it work.

1240~~~
Picking your post purely as en example, but this sounds all too like the Nani haters.  If he's treated the same way, I can see a similarly frustrating 6 years or so.  Just give the guy a chance, and judge him by standards that are appropriate to how he plays.

1241~~~
He should be here, with time to develop, and work his way into the team.

But because our attack is so piss poor, he's been thrown straight into the deep end, and expected to perform miracles.

1242~~~
He needs a bloody rest. People forget hes only 21, and hes played what, 5 games in something like 12 days? I knew it wouldnt happen, but he should have been rested for Young today (or even the Brugges match).

LVG is doing to him what Moyes did to Januzaj. Relying so much on him and you could see he was tired. No reason why he played the 90 minutes today when you could see he has been tiring for a game or two now.

1243~~~
There's no denying he has raw talent and the sky is the ceiling. But that doesn't take away from the fact that he's been terrible in all four league games so far and one of the contributing factors to our attack being so woeful in general. People say at least he tries something but I saw somewhere he has completed 3 successful take on's in 4 league games? That's not acceptable for our starting winger and it's all well if he's trying but if nothing is coming off then it's still a problem. He's supposedly the only one in our attacking 4 capable of taking on players but he's not doing that successfully whatsoever right now, neither doing much else. This problem should be addressed before the window shuts or we're going to see similar performances all season until he starts performing as he did against Brugge but why are we relying on all of our magic to stem from a 21 year old who is yet to adjust to the league and with no positive sign he is going to do that any time soon?

The real issue at hand is that he should be eased in rather than being thrown straight into the deep end. I'd say he's gotten progressively worse in each game as well, which is an indicator to his declining confidence. We should really not be relying on him as we are and it's only doing damage to his development. I'm not saying he's overrated, just that he's not delivering so far and putting all the pressure on him to be our main creative and attacking outlet is hurting both our performances and his psyche. Neither he or Rooney are playing anywhere near the standard that is required of a Manchester United starter. At least with him, we can bring someone in to start ahead of him where as with Rooney this isn't the case due to his untouchable status.

1244~~~
He needs a rest, I'm not sure what LVG is doing. For a manager who stresses the importance of fitness so much, I'm not sure why LVG has been oblivious to this.

1245~~~
You missed off some of my post but it was hardly comparable to being a 'hater' of Nani or Memphis. Either way Nani was talented but wildly inconsistent, which is the reason for the frustrating 6 years. To claim it's somehow the fault of people on a forum or even the match going fans (who didn't ever target him when I was there) is a massive leap. 

Memphis seems a hugely confident/egotistical person...if it doesn't work out it'll because he often plays like he did today, i.e. very poor. Nobody is writing him off as far as I know, they're just commenting on a player who had a bad game.

1246~~~
The problem is too many people here thought he is going to be the next Ronaldo that's unrealistically high hopes for a young lad like him. He will need his time to find his footing in this league and show what he is really capable of.

1247~~~
He's definitely got ridiculous potential, but I wouldn't say he's completely ready to start for a club like United. He's making mistakes and losing the ball in situations that he probably wouldn't have done in the Dutch league. I'm happy for him to keep on starting as long as Louis manages him a lot better and doesn't expect him to be our main threat.

1248~~~
Exactly, and maybe he will, maybe he won't....but for goodness sake we have to give him a chance. Ferguson would, that is for sure. And you're right, the expectation is too high. To be honest, scoring a couple of goals the other week has probably heaped too much expectation as well.

1249~~~
well...he'll only lean by playing in the league. I'm sure LVG knows this...but with these sorts of players, you need to give them game time and experience of a new league.

1250~~~
Plenty said he will be erratic in his first season and at shouldn't pin all our hopes on him. Well low and behold, a young player moving to a massive club is erratic. Who would have thought it?

1251~~~
He's the only player, bar Shaw, that can go past players for us.

Just think about that for a second.

1252~~~
Obviouly not the finished product yet. That's his biggest problem. United need the finished product and the fans expect him to be that. Can't expect that from a 21 year old in his first season here. He has every tool to make it here.

1253~~~
Wouldn't be too worried. The talent is there. He has the platform. No great pressure from his price tag. He will be fine.

1254~~~
It definitely isn't helping him that uniteds attack as a whole is so flat always, and that van Gaal isn't really one to encourage creativity. Huge potential though, but of course he will be inconsistent. Find me a winger making the step up to a big league and instantly becoming world class. Even neymar at Barca was inconsistent in his first season.

1255~~~
A rest probably wouldn't hurt him.

1256~~~
Still as not lit up the PL like he did in the CL.

1257~~~
Great signing. I would rather he grew into the PL than do a ADM and fade after a few good games.

1258~~~
His reluctance to track back is annoying the shit out of me at times.

Whether it's him being lazy or our stupid tactics, it's annoying.

1259~~~
Said it before the first Brugge game, we rely on him a lot, when in reality he hasn't done enough in his career yet to be a guaranteed starter.

We should of bought someone like Pedro who could of helped ease Memphis in. If Memphis isn't doing it out on the left, we don't exactly have a top class replacement for him and it hurts us.

1260~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1261~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He looks so comfy.

1262~~~
Someone should send him a snuggie.

1263~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm guessing he travelled by Tardis.

1264~~~

1265~~~
The Memphis with no name! Get him a stogie.

1266~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1267~~~
Thought this was quite interesting and didn't know where to put it;

1268~~~
Feel free to make a new thread in the United forum. This is just a place to talk about his performances.

1269~~~
he loves his second father so much

1270~~~
He is always there to argue with a referee, isn't he?

1271~~~
Seems to get frustrated easily and a lot of the time it's his own fault. His decision making at times, is atrocious. However, he's young and still learning. Hope we don't overplay him.

1272~~~
Not having a great game here for Holland, seems to be identical to his United performances in the league thus far. Good moments but losing the ball easily at times to.

1273~~~
He's been having a pretty good game I though, been the Dutch's main creative outlay and probably should have had a couple of assists from his crosses with better finishing

1274~~~
He has had some good moments don't get me wrong, but very frustrating ones to. Hasn't really had the beating of the fullback and has lost the ball a fair bit.

1275~~~
He's been the best dutch player by a distance really. Hasn't been amazing, but he's giving his all, going past plenty of players, putting in dangerous crosses and nice passes into RvP. The only one from the dutch who can hold their head high after that game really.

1276~~~
We have zero depth. Worried we'll run him into the ground.

1277~~~
Some lovely crosses from Memphis against Turkey today. Shame his teammates could do feck all with them.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/g97x" width="560"></iframe>

1278~~~
He should stop complaining so much IMO, use that anger to produce some magic instead.

1279~~~
I watched first half so saw those two crosses from first half. He is really good with crossing. These 4 crosses could have easily yielded 2-3 goals on another day and with some better finishing. His cross for Fellaini's goal against Brugge was class too.

1280~~~
The last 2 crosses were peaches. Shame Wijnaldum and De Jong completely bottled it.

1281~~~
Bloody hell. Some awful finishing there.

1282~~~
Those last two misses had me laughing out loud.

1283~~~
Even at PSV he would be pissed after a failed attempt, that's never stopped him from trying though. He's played matches where he bottled everything but still scored twice in the dying minutes. He's a perfectionist on the field and if he misses a chance even though he scored he's dissapointed about the missed chance and start training on it. I don't see a problem with that part of his mentality myself, although some gestures/shouting to the ref do annoy me.

1284~~~
that finishing:-D almost looking like they clear the ball rather than finish it.. I have a feeling Big fella will score next weekend

1285~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The last two...


Look at Rooney now that he's cut down on the complaining...

1286~~~
Like those four crosses?

1287~~~
The left foot cross is very encouraging. He needs that if he is to thrive on the left wing.

1288~~~
What a waste of those lovely crosses.

1289~~~
Some of those crosses would give Fellaini a semi

1290~~~
Lol at those last 2 misses. What a joke.

1291~~~
That is the issue though. I wonder if he allows decision to impact his performance or not. He seems to be disappointed and then work a lot less harder after arguing with the whistle-person.

1292~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1293~~~
Jesus those misses <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That could have quite easily been 4 assists right there. Some absolute peaches from Memphis.

1294~~~
He never stops working hard, he's had alot of 'frustrating performances' but still managed to score or assist in the same game at PSV. He's not one to let his head hang soon, he always keeps trying and that's why I don't see a big problem with it. Even after the Brugge game he was dissapointed in himself for that missed sitter, he's not happier today if he didn't score twice and gave an assist (on top of the Netherlands probably not going to France 2016). The argueing with the ref just annoys me, but that goes for every player who does that.

1295~~~
Hmm. If its just arguing and still going on with performing then its fine as long as it doesn't impair his performance. But sometimes he cuts a frustrated figure when something doesn't work for him and I worry about his mentality. That Bastian's arm around him after Villa game (I think) made me worried whether he really had a strong mentality though. From what I have heard he is a vastly talented confident lad with strong mentality but his performance so far has been a bit inconsistent though that's probably due to new league, new culture and stuffs.

1296~~~
The last one makes no sense. Was he trying to clear the cross?

1297~~~
My fear also. He's not a better option than Young in the premier league at the moment although he will be but we don't need to force it.

1298~~~
My god those are some lovely looking crosses he put it. Hopefully, he can continue doing that with United - not even Rooney in his current form would miss those.

1299~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I watched the game and taught, what were his teammate doing? Nevertheless, Depay played well and I am glad at United, Van Gaal moved him back to the wings where he is more productive

1300~~~
Those crosses are great, lots of curve and lots of pace. Can't even think about the amount of times our players have just floated shite lofted balls into the box hoping someone can make something of them, he actually seems to cross it with a purpose. It doesn't take much to put one of those into the back of the net

1301~~~
Memphis crossing to Fellaini will be tough to defend.

1302~~~
Definitely. His cross for the goal against Brugge was superb. Hopefully they play together a lot more now that Fellaini is back from suspension.

1303~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1304~~~
Id be checking that strikers betfair account after those misses.

1305~~~
No, it is Luuk De Jong. No further explanation needed.

1306~~~
I watched a-bit of the match but turned it off after about 30 minutes as it was pretty crap. Lovely crosses from Memphis in that video and some hilarious 'finishing'.

1307~~~
Willem Van Hanegem "blasts" Memphis

I'm not sure I really get what he's trying to say. Is that a criticism of his work-rate?

1308~~~
He just sounds like an old school native Dutchman actually. Moaning at the immigrant boys.

1309~~~
I like how he says that he doesn't care what players are doing outside of the football field but than goes on to bash his clothing style.

1310~~~
But Memphis did look like a bit of a dick in that hat and scarf.

1311~~~
Wasn't he supposed to have been one of their better players in that game?

1312~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1313~~~
He did say Memphis should stop putting on muscle and I agree

1314~~~
Van Hanegem has some weird criticism, I don't rate him that highly as a pundit. He's becoming a bit bitter and rarely says interesting stuff imo.

He was just blasting everything after the 0-3 loss and named Memphis too as being too individual. He also said Memphis layed on the ground too much.

I haven't seen the whole match but Memphis wasn't great, he lost the ball 26 times but also was one of the best going forward. Tells you all about the performance of our NT.

1315~~~
The issue is under Sir Alex, these sorts of players will be brought in, rotated and expected to grow into their roles. There would be an existing structure, and them some sort of transition as they develop.

Due to us having average attacking players, he's been brought in and expected to be our best player, and lead us. Hopefully by next season, him and Amrtial are ready to play a more leading role, and we could do with adding a proper go-to guy.

1316~~~
He wasn't great and I agree with the criticism that he complains too much, but in that game he looked like the only one likely to create anything. Also, Sneijder looked much more greedy than Memphis did - Memphis put four very good chances on a plate for his teammates.

The game was really poor by Netherlands though, RvP looks shot, Sneijder is meh and there's not much else to the team. Even getting Robben back in great form would only hide the big problems of the team.

1317~~~
FFS. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What's happened to the Dutch? Those were absolutely abysmal misses.

1318~~~
There's plenty of clubs that bring through youth by relying on them and putting pressure on them to perform.

Just because we did it one way under SAF doesn't mean we can't do it another now.

Theres more than one way to skin a cat.

1319~~~
It depends on the expectations of the club. Everton can't aford to have Barkley only playing 20 mins. Young players are, by nature, frustrating and under-cooked. Those are not the traits a top team wishes to base it's quest for trophies on. It doesn't even mean they have to be subs, it does mean that their role is of supporting cast though. Neymar at Barcelona is an example. He came at 20, and was not integrated slowly, but did not need to be the man straight away though. Memphis could also have gone to Barca and gone straight into the team. Our other forwards aren't particularly threatening though, so any new addition in that area will be turned to in hope that they can provide something.

1320~~~
Brilliant crosses. Has bend on them and alot of power, nightmare for defenders and keepers. Who were the strikers for that match, that was abysmal finishing.

1321~~~
It's really something when u put in 4 great chances in a single match, 3 of which with ur man free in the box and they put the ball AWAY from the goal.

1322~~~
Just posted this on Facebook.

1323~~~
We bought ronaldo at the age of 18 and he was thrown straight in. He was a first choice starter in his teens. Same with Rooney although one could argue Rooney was on a different level altogether to most other teenagers.

1324~~~
Needs to get the finger out after international break. Liverpool on Saturday is a big opportunity for him.

1325~~~
I honestly thought he'd kick on after the hatrick vs Brugge, but you forget he's 21 and it'll take time for him to gain consistency of that kind of level.

1326~~~
I know I'm late to the part with this but what the feck did I just watch? It was like watching Will Ferrell sabotage his own team in Semi-Pro.

1327~~~
Hatrick?

1328~~~
Yeah it's like a hat-trick but with more hate. Bit like a hatefeck.

1329~~~
Double, my bad.

1330~~~
He literally should have had at least 2 or 3 assists against turkey.

1331~~~
Ronaldo's competition was Quinton Fortune, Kieran Richardson, Darren Fletcher and the invisible man. Rooney's competition was Alan Smith and Diego Forlan. They were playing in a team that really weren't of the standard to challenge for the title which is partly what gave them the breathing room to develop rapidly and establish themselves in the team as teenagers. The situation Depay, Martial, Shaw and co. are in is not too dissimilar.

1332~~~
Personally, I'd start Young. Don't think we can afford another one of his PL performances so far. Give him 30 mins.

1333~~~
Nope, can't you see that by playing young players (no matter how experienced) Van Gaal is destroying the club. Again.

1334~~~
Won Manchester United's goal of the month award.

1336~~~
Willem van Hanegem is an ex-Feyenoord player who seems to be especially bitter towards (ex)PSV/Ajax players and modern players in general. He always rants like that.

1337~~~
Very Nanilike at the moment

1338~~~
Lol

1339~~~
He wishes. All the bad stuff without any of the good.

Take him for Young at HT.

1340~~~
Basically it's like watching Nani in his bad form but also with much less talent in his legs. Another thing to drop on comparision is that Nani would be dropped long time ago in this kind of form.

But I think he'll come good, I have high hopes for him, even though it's quite clear that people overrated him a lot before the season started.

1341~~~
I have seen nothing from him in the PL whatsoever to say that he should be in our team over Young.

1342~~~
Nani without the dribbling ability

1343~~~
Will we sell him like Nani and di Maria?

1344~~~
Disappointing so far today. Looks short on confidence. Clyne is a good right-back but he's not testing him enough.

1345~~~
he'll come good, hopefully he won't be dominated by Clyne like this in a few years time, shit defender like Clyne..

1346~~~
Ok Nani, you have had your usual display, now for the bit of magic, just once please.

1347~~~
He's dangerous in that he's always trying to go forward when he gets the ball and has plenty of pace and dribbling ability, but he really needs to work on his close control. He loses it way too easily once he gets near the box.

1348~~~
Even if his dribbling is poor, the few times he had a bit of space and time, he fecked it up which is disappointing.

1349~~~
He's going to Nani the hell out of us this season, isn't he? 

I still have full confidence he will come good, but my god he has blown hot and cold so far.

1350~~~
He's supposed to be very good at going past players, but he seems heavy and not quick over the first 5 yards. I hope it's just the fact that he's not trusting his instincts and thinking too much. He has, without doubt, huge amounts of raw talent.

1351~~~
He's not a very good dribbler. Been saying that right from the start.

1352~~~
Feeling a little underwhelmed with him, I still feel he has match winning quality though and it's hardly like he's keeping world class players on the bench so might as well stay on and hope he can play similar to the games against Brugge.

1353~~~
I don't remember Nani being so outclassed by a fullback.

1354~~~
Why does he not run with the ball? He's built like a brickhouse. Assert yourself a little more.

1355~~~
His close control really is disappointing in tight spaces. Brugge will give you the time to control the ball but it's likely that it will not happen in the PL.

1356~~~
With him playing like this and Mata playing on the right we are lacking any real threat from out wide.

1357~~~
That's why I think it's down to low confidence. He should be driving at Clyne but he's constantly avoiding the confrontation.

1358~~~
Clyne has been excellent for them in fairness

1359~~~
Such an in decisive little cnut.

1360~~~
Yup. All 4 fullbacks have been quite good I think, probably among the best players for their teams.

1361~~~
Not sure if starting him every game is a good idea, I expected Young to play in most games. 
He seems surprised he has so little time on the ball. Add to that he isn't a very good dribbler like some on here expected him to be and you get this kind of performance. Long way to go for him, just like I expected.

1362~~~
We're paying a bit for relying so heavily on a kid from the Dutch league. I expected him to struggle albiet not this much.

As for his abilities, I'm surprised he's so lacking in mobility. Doesn't seem to have that much pace on the ball nor a really quick burst. All I'm seeing is muscle and power, and trickery. Hopefully he improves this.

1363~~~
I was a bit surprised that Van Gaal bought him and put him straight away in the first team, he's still very raw palyer who in a top team like ours shouldn't be automatic starter. I'd go for young after half time, him having played like this this place would have gone crazy

1364~~~
Thank feck.

1365~~~
To be fair to him he's the only player on the pitch who isn't playing insipid football, he's trying something different? It's just not working right now, although he created our only real chance of the half.

1366~~~
Idiots on BeIN seem genuinely confused that he's come off.

1367~~~
Harsh, but was frustrating.

1368~~~
youngs just done more in 20 seconds than depay did in 45 minutes

1369~~~
What a goal.

1370~~~
Wrong thread? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Memphis has been extremely frustrating for us. We know what he's capable of but it's just not happening!

1371~~~
He doesn't play for Spurs, mate. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1372~~~
Yup! I don't care though haha!

1373~~~
Bollocks, got him confused with Dembele.

1374~~~
Understandable. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1375~~~
He's still doesn't really know what he's trying to do when on the ball. He needs a go to move I believe and work it from there.

1376~~~
Young  should be  playing ahead of him, this is not just based on today but the whole of last season where he was one of out best players. It was unfair to drop him this year imo. 

Depay will come  good but he's not ready to be starting every game yet.

1377~~~
His decision making is atrocious but what vexes me is his tracking back. Almost none.

1378~~~
A fecking 19 year old had to show him how it's done.

1379~~~
Harsh, Martial came in fresh as a sub though.

1380~~~
You know Memphis is only 21 himself right

1381~~~
Young did much better than him. He played it too slow and hardly took his man on. Let's see if he keeps his place for the next game

1382~~~
Poor today.

Early days though. It's to be expected.

1383~~~
Several times in the first half I saw him holding/rubbing his hip, did he pick up a knock?

1384~~~
tired

1385~~~
Not a good day for him today, was it? Awful first half aside, Young came on for him, and made an immediate impact, leading to our first goal. Then Martial scores his debut goal cutting in from the left side, showing more in his debut than Memphis has in all his EPL games so far. I think Young deserves to start next game on the left. Maybe a bit of rest would do Memphis a lot of good.

1386~~~
Has to do more in the way of taking on his man and running with the ball. To be effective he also has to be comfortable using his left foot. It's so obvious what he's going to do for defenders when he keeps cutting inside onto that right foot every time.

1387~~~
He still needs time to get used to the big step up in quality and someone needs to point out to him that he need a little variation in his play because right now he is just too predictable.

1388~~~
He was always gonna have games like this in his first season here, we knew this.

1389~~~
No he wasn't.

I think we expected frustrating performances, him trying too much, overcomplicating things, being inconsistent but flashes and glimpses of his ability.

Right now we're not even getting that, we're getting a player who's not trying anything, not beating his man, not showing <i>why </i>he was bought here. He looks like a deer in headlights.

He needs an arm around his shoulder and to be taken out of the firing line for a couple of games imo.

1390~~~
Agreed. We aren't talking about a completely raw, young player here. This is a player who was one of the best in the Dutch league last season, and an established member of the Dutch national side. He has had a hard time adjusting to the pace and physicality of the league, and how quickly defenders close down on him. But even when he does manage to get the ball in space, and with time to make the decision, he often makes the wrong decision or fails to pull off whatever he is trying to do.

1391~~~
Hate to bash such a young player but he was the worst player on the pitch today, very wasteful. 

Hope he learns from this and works even harder, he can't afford to drop the head this early in his career.

1392~~~
Ouch! Apparently a case of the attacker making the defender look good, Clyne and Gomez were ripped apart after HT!

1393~~~
I'm not going to critisise Memphis at this stage

But young came on and made a huge difference.

1394~~~
Has struggled in the Prem so far. Hopefully adapts sooner than later.

1395~~~
Such an odd thing to say.

1396~~~
Get a grip.

Pretty much all of our attacking hopes this season are going to be on a 21 & 19 year old. Both need a seasons grace and both are going to be inconsistant from time to time until they are settled and matured.

Ideally it should be Rooney taking the pressure off them, but instead he probably burdens them more and they'll have to carry a fat 200k per week 29 year old passenger most weeks.

It is a lot of pressure on two kids. Give them time.

1397~~~
Indeed. TBH I've only seen 2 games this season- Swansea and today- and he's been really poor in both, and that's coloured my judgement- especially given the hype and the #7.

1398~~~
You go into most threads and somehow find a way to slag Rooney off even if the discussion isn't about him. Relax dude.

1399~~~
Meh, an off day in a high pressure game. Not much point reading too much into it.

1400~~~
"What's 5x7?" 
"Rooney is shit"

1401~~~
Quite simply should not be a starter at this stage. We are to blame for this not him! He's looked short so far in the premier league but it will come!

1402~~~
No, that's just you being shit at math.

1403~~~
Memphis needs to learn to cope with adversity. I don't think he was terrible first half. However, what I did notice was that he again he faded after a decent start. It was similar against Newcastle and Villa. Memphis will skin his man once or twice but then he'll put in a bad cross or something, and then his whole game will fall to bits. He's a real confidence player. Unlike Ronaldo who will take 12 shots to score once, Memphis will try to show something three or four times and if it doesn't happen for him he'll retreat a bit. If next game he scores early or creates an early goal he'll be brilliant. My worry is, if he doesn't he'll fall away again.

1404~~~
He is struggling with the level badly. I must admit I'm one of those that needs convincing about him.

1405~~~
Looks like he wants to prove himself to much and plays with high shoulders. Hope he gets his prem goal soon so he can calm down. The talent is there, but hes not getting it out

1406~~~
Are we friends?

1407~~~
In one respect his Attitude is great in the way he wants to be the best in the world, but his on the pitch attitude isn't good enough. He just acts like he is the best player in the world and doesn't try enough.

1408~~~
Shouldn't we be looking to play him as a striker? Scored a lot of goals in Holland. We need a backup striker other than Fellaini.

1409~~~
Memphis and Martial both need to be brought along gradually. Good on LvG for using Young today and hope he does it more often to take a bit of pressure off.

1410~~~
Don't think he's great in close space. He seems to take time making decisions, not a perfect thing to do while playing at 10 or 9.

1411~~~
To be expected he'll be up and down initially. Will be the same with Martial.

Hopefully the consistency will come with age and experience.

1412~~~
Definitely correct, it was more of an emotional overreaction if anything. I rate them both highly, I still think Memphis has a pretty high ceiling, he's just struggling in terms of adapting to the new league while Martial has basically had the perfect opportunity delivered to him to shine and he took it.

1413~~~
Apart from the overall refinement to his game which will take time, Memphis needs a few good performances in the PL to up his confidence.

I'd like to see him play more as a team player though. Sometimes I feel like he's functioning in complete isolation.

1414~~~
I think over time we'll see that Martial is still pretty raw as well. The opportunity to just go at the defender was never there for Memphis tonight. Whenever he had the ball on the wing, there were two guys covering him and Clyne did an outstanding job of limiting him. Nonetheless, as you said, he has to learn to be more of a team player and take advantage of all the attention he's getting. I was disappointed that he didn't look to move around more off the ball, which in my opinion is one of the aspects he really needs to improve.

1415~~~
Can't rush judgement on this kid.  He's only 21 making the jump from the Dutch league to the EPL.  There's going to be frustrating days like this and flashes of his brilliance and potential like what we saw against Club Brugge.

1416~~~
It's his choices that let him down.

1417~~~
He got clattered by Lovren I think when the referee didn't give him anything. Looked worth a yellow from my seat.

1418~~~
Abit rubbish today.  Looked overawed by the occasion as he seemed to be rushing things or being overly ambitious.  

Not a problem, he will have ebbs and flows:  but with the reduced squad size, he will get plenty of game time, and Im 100% convinced his talent will quickly shine.

1419~~~
He looks raw technically.

1420~~~
I'd prefer him to be rotated with Peirrara in that position to be honest

1421~~~
He's trying to do too much. Having shots on goal when he has no chance of scoring, holding on to the ball for too long and making the wrong choice when he actually does decide to pass the ball. I'm sure with time he will grow out of this, we have seen it with other players at the club past and present.

1422~~~
Very raw. When he's dribb, it looks like he's doing it by luck, like he's not under control. Similar but nowhere near as bad as Zaha. When it comes to wingers p, I think we are very short on quality.

1423~~~
Yeah can't wait to see Pereira. Who I think is a much better dribbler.

1424~~~
Pereira was great in preseason. Is he injured or something?

1425~~~
My biggest worry from the day we signed him. He seems much more confident when running with the ball at speed, but his close control is rather poor.

1426~~~
Yes

1427~~~
Bad today, but days like this are bout to happen, need patience with him.

His head drops too easily at the moment. Get that sorted, and a bit better decision making, and he'll be great.

1428~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> from the other thread "what hate?..."

He looks mentally drained, I am surprised he's logged so many minutes, especially with the credit Young built up going into this season. Needs a couple of games rest.

1429~~~
Some people are far too knee-jerk. Saying guff like he has no pace, can't dribble or has no technique... His displays in Holland and in Europe for us show what he can do, and he will prove it. 

He's young and the sensible amongst us knew that he would take a season to adapt, and his performances thus far have offered a glimpse of his potential. For comparison, take a look at the initial performances of Hazard at Chelsea, who came in at a similar age. It took him the best part of 6 months before he started playing towards his optimum level, and the least Depay deserves is a similar amount of slack cut for himself.

1430~~~
Massive overreaction on here. He was poor today and has generally struggled to impress in the league but he has already shown glimpses of what he is about and I have no doubt that he has all the tools to become a very important player for us. Few 21-year old wingers coming to a new league would be able to be consistently good. It's only 5 games!

I for one hope he will be trusted by LvG.

1431~~~
He needs rest. Hes 21 coming into a new league, and yet we have played him pretty much every minute of this season, were going to burn him out. Hes had like 7 games in 25 days or something nuts like that. And its like we are relying solely on him to inject pace.

Also think he will be more suited to CL games this season but will adapt long term.

1432~~~
Good idea to take him off Young, wasn't exactly with it today. Too hesitant I think, he really didn't mix it up at all, kept looking to go out wide when he's so strong coming inside. I assume it was probably an instruction to make the most of Fellaini

1433~~~
I thought he looked worryingly slow today. In fact he looked well off the pace of the whole game, wouldn't be surprised if he was carrying a knock or is just tired from all the games he's played. 

I think he needs a rest, and in all honesty, he doesn't deserve to be starting ahead of Young right now.

1434~~~
It also needs to be said, he's not a very good dribbler. Which is a big worry for a winger, especially when the guy on the other flank is Mata, who's even worse.

1435~~~
I wouldn't say he's a poor dribbler. He was dribbling well vs Newcastle a while back. 

But I don't think he's a great dribbler especially in tight spaces from what I've seen. I must admit that I did think he was a bit better in that regard. Let's not forget he's only 21 and it's his 1st season in the Prem. Some players take time to adjust. Young should play midweek vs PSV though imo.

1436~~~
He's more of a Bale then a Neymar (style wise) when it comes to dribbling. Pace and Power rather then touch and technique.

1437~~~
Agreed.

1438~~~
Lost the ball 21 times and despite getting no calls is still begging for fouls & free kicks rather than hustling to retrieve balls he loses. The change when Young came on - direct running and tracking back - neither of which Depay has even tried to do...

He has all the necessary skill and physique but mentally he isn't close at the moment. I don't want to guess but the way he expects a free kick every time he loses the ball it's almost like he thinks he's made it...  that or he got it easy when he was in holland. 

Still he's very young, inexperienced, new to the league etc but an attitude change will serve him well - Martial showed more fight than he has so far in that little cameo when he stood up to Lovren's challenge.

Definitely think he should be used as an impact sub until he adapts. Young earned his place last year and on today's performance to start the next match. 

Give him a year with less pressure than starting every game, time to adapt and see what application is needed to become a starter and we should see better displays.

1439~~~
An off game for him. Needs to get his head in the game and perform week in week out.

1440~~~
I think you are spot on with his assessment. He seems to sometimes take it over himself too much to stand out rather than play as a team player and in games when things don't go his way usually looks bereft of ideas and creativity. He's not the Messi/Robben type of dribbler though, more like Bale type who takes the ball into the space utilizing his pace. He seems indecisive in close space and usually resorts to beating his man via pace rather than doing anything extravagant and when he has someone to match him for pace like Clyne, he clearly struggles. Perhaps LvG is aware of this as well as he tried to play him in number 10 positions where he'd have more chance to practice close control and quick decision makings. As of now, he is still very much a work in progress and need to improve massively to hit the heights he himself, us fans and the club expect him to hit.

1441~~~
For sure. I've always said that we will see a lot of up and down performances from the two of them. Sometimes they might even be in and out of the side. They're kids after all.

1442~~~
He's young and has so much time to develop a better decision making. I'm not worried about him, his substitution will make him a better player in the long term.

1443~~~
Looks tired at the moment.

1444~~~
Classic redcafe. Players aren't allowed to play badly without people inferring that this means they have permanent flaws in their technique.

1445~~~
He has the makings of a very good player. He is young. Give it time.

Young n learnin and all that.

1446~~~
I'm very confident that he'll come good for us. Very good in fact.

1447~~~
My biggest frustration is what this says for our transfer policy this summer. I can accept depay will take 2-3 years to get upto speed, he will hopefully become a good player. Same with martial. But why the hell didn't we buy any attacking players who can help us NOW?

1448~~~
We need to look at a winger in the January market if it's possible. He isn't ready yet. However he could have picked up form by January. We are still in a position that our best out and out winger is Ashley Young.

1449~~~
Sure lets do a City/Chelsea and buy our first XI and not build our team around young players.

1450~~~
That is scarily true, it's the biggest problem in the team. Mata is also struggling on the right side. We need to get back to Valencia and Young on the wings and replace them with better players when the opportunity arises. Depay, Adnan are quite simply not better at this stage but have the potential to be. Mata is a square peg at right wing and we get no or very little attacking from that side because of this. It is a shame as he's got so much quality but it's stifled in that position and hampers the team.

1451~~~
Precisely, how anyone can start judging him now is beyond me. It's the same with Martial...sure great goal, but young players are not consistent, that comes much later, so it's a case of enjoying the good games they have and being forgiving when they have off days.

1452~~~
The best thing for him right now is come of the bench against tiring defenders and get his confidence back up. Once he gets a couple of goals in the league he'll probably get a lot better in other areas of his game.

That said, I've never been overly convince he's all that. He'll do very well to get close to Nani's level from what I've seen of him.

1453~~~
Yep, we are building a team for the future not just the now. How can people not see this?

1454~~~
He's thinking too much and is afraid of making mistakes, I think, he needs to just get on with it. And for the love of God, stop going down at the slightest contact.

1455~~~
That's extreme and simply not true. I don't know anyone who expected anything different from the performances he has put in for us so far. He's already shown us his skill through his penetrative runs and ability to beat a man, which he's had no problem of accomplishing. His main problem is his decision making. The main reason Young looked good is because he knows what he's doing and makes quick decisions. Memphis has a bad habit of remaining stationary on the ball and taking far too long before he makes a decision. Definitely Nani-esque in that regard. Those quick decisions that Young makes all come with experience.

1456~~~
He's young and so far only done it in the Eredivisie - which is not a very high standard when you compare to the PL. He needs time - I thought he shouldn't have been starting as often as he has in his first year. Stick him on the bench and bring him on as a sub after 70 or so and let him try and make an impact in a short time. He gives me the impression that he believes he's made it already thanks to his one great season in Holland.

1457~~~
Agree with this - I think one of the big challenges for him is to up his game to PL levels of speed and nimbleness needed on a flank. So far he looks out of his depth.

1458~~~
I didn't think he was that bad yesterday. 

Part of his problem was not getting close enough to goal with his runs or possession. And for that, Clyne deserves credit. A couple of times Memphis beat him initially but Clyne got back to meet him again. 

Off the ball he wasn't looking to play on the shoulder quite as freely as we've seen before and I can only assume that was a deliberate instruction for fear of Clyne pushing forward and doubling up on Shaw. Something we only really saw in the 2nd half when Memphis was withdrawn.

That said, he still has to work on that final ball at times. Sometimes he checks inside and walks straight into the DM covering so he needs to be cuter with that move. Or more aware of when to try it perhaps.

I like him and want him to continue playing. Think his fizzed crosses to Fellaini could well be developed upon. Especially if Fellaini can get to them before defenders can react well enough to marshall him. However unless that does develop then Young's high crossing + Fellaini is almost as important a combination for our team as Juan and Ander.

1459~~~
You tried the latter and still ended up rubbish to be fair.

1460~~~
Everyone knew he was going to start off inconsistently, why the sudden hatred? He's show flashes of sheer brilliance, that's enough for me so far, extremely confident he is going to be a star here.

1461~~~
He doesn't look ready yet. I'm all for giving our young lads playing time but Young needs to start the majority of games for us right now until Memphis has adapted better.

1462~~~
I'd actually hate to have seen these same people on here when Ronaldo was here during his early days... It actually boggles the mind how myopic they are.

1463~~~
We're doing both things at the same time. These young players we're buying, they cost a lot of money too.

1464~~~
Against Brugge, yeah.

All I'm asking is he tries it in the League, he might have a whole game where nothing comes off, thats fine. What I never want to see from him again is just the complete lack of anything that he showed yesterday.

He's shown nothing in the League so far, it's not been good enough.

1465~~~
Thats a bit harsh imo. Not saying he has been brilliant, but opposing teams have been very wary of him, and locked down their right flank very tightly. He has shown some intelligent movement, good technique and we all know his physique is excellent.

Besides, the team as a whole has not been good going forward this year. Any attacker, never mind a youngster would struggle to create something when the opposing team is in full balance and your only target is a sluggish Rooney.

Right now Young should play ahead of him, but i don't really know what people here expect of him. He has time on his side, and im sure he will come good

1466~~~
Quality young player who's game will go up and down for a couple of years yet. It's not like we haven't seen it before with young players. Ive watched him for the Dutch team and he's got lots of qualities. We will see better performances initially in CL than PL where the tempo will suit him better.

1467~~~
Just ask yourself, would any of Real/Barca/Bayern play a 21 year old player already week in week out after transferring from the Eredivisie? It's very harsh, the kid needs time to naturally improve in the PL, he is a good talent but not that good that he can excel immediately.

1468~~~
Give him chance, he's played a handful of games in his first season in a new league and is only 21. He'll be fine, just don't write him off yet. Still one of Europe's most exciting young talents.

1469~~~
I get he's young and will get better but I see no reason to play him ahead of Ashley Young at the moment.

1470~~~
P
Pretty much this. Also he did track back yesterday. Once or twice he lost the ball and belted up the line to win it back as well. Just needs to get some confidence against teams in the premier league and he'll be fine.

1471~~~
I thought it would take half a season before Memphis was able to show his quality with us and I think he's done better than I expected so far. Yesterday was probably his poorest game for us so far. To say he's not good enough on the basis of one half is as much an overreaction as those who were hyping him post-Brugge. Lots of ups and downs to come, we have to be patient.

1472~~~
He had a good start but faded.

1473~~~
Lad really needs to be picked against PSV, level he's very used to, knows the team inside out & will give him a massive confidence boost.

1474~~~
He needs a confidence booster.  Looks like he is playing within himself.  The pressure of having to be our creative spark seems to be getting to him.

1475~~~
It's the pace of the game that's the issue for him just now I think. It looks like he's still expecting a few more seconds on the ball that what he will actually get. He just needs to adapt and at 21 he's got plenty of time. I think a lot more people would be a bit more forgiving if he and Martial weren't the only attacking buys. There is a lot of pressure on him to deliver straight away and it doesn't allow him the chance to adapt more slowly. I wouldn't say Van Gaal has hung him out to dry but an experienced, top signing could've done a big job in lifting some of the expectation off him. If Martial throws in a couple of bad performances some will be saying exactly the same about him.

1476~~~
Also against Aston Villa and Newcastle where he made penetrative runs (two quality chances missed in each match) and beat his man easily (Newcastle), so this thing about him not beating his man or showing glimpses of his quality is far from the truth and is somewhat reactionary. I agree that it's definitely not been good enough, but that is to be expected from a young player who hasn't even reached 10 PL games for us and is adjusting to a completely different league.

1477~~~
He'll come good, calm down. You can just tell he's got it. Just needs time. Too talented not to succeed.

1478~~~
He will be fine. He has shown he has the ability, but so far he hasn't shown the mentality. He's come in expecting the be the spark and i think has been a bit shell shocked by how tough the league is. Once he settles down he will start taking players on and making things happen.

It could be much, much worse. Look at Firmino.

1479~~~
He has all the tools but he makes the wrong choice every time. I don't even think it's a matter of consistency. I just don't think he knows what to do at certain times. It'll come, though.

1480~~~
Anyone else think he's looking a bit <i>too </i>bulky? Ironically the complete opposite of the usual 'needs to bulk up' comments.

He doesn't look as nimble as I remember him looking for PSV. A bit like when Ronaldo bulked up and lost his dribbling/skills. Been hitting the gym a bit too hard me thinks.

1481~~~
Memphis is putting too much pressure on himself and it's messing with his performances. Think he needs to be on the bench for a bit and come on when we've got the game won and there's not so much pressure or expectation. It will free him up mentally. Otherwise, I'm not worried about him, he will be fine. Just needs some careful handling so he doesn't lose his confidence. We also have quite a lot of games coming up which he can use to get his mojo back, especially those games in Europe.

1482~~~
Neymar. From a worse league. 21.

1483~~~
We want it all and we want it NOW!


I'm finding it harder and harder to enter discussions on the boards, for the same reason I can't watch games with drunk people

1484~~~
Neymar was a much bigger star than Depay at the age of 21 though. More known internationally.

1485~~~
United in heavy transition v Barcelona 2013. You really need that pointed out to you?

1486~~~
At his age, in his position and after the move he has just made there are lots of reasons his form will be inconsistent.

1487~~~
What does it matter? He was a star who was unproven outside of the shite brazilian league.
He asked a question. I wish to be pedantic and answer it. Now get the pub beards and cheap beer breath out of my face.

So at ease tigermen. I am a fan of Memphis. Just pointing out a technicality.

1488~~~
It matters because Neymar at that point was further in his development than Memphis, Brazilian league aside. That's why he already was a key starter for Brazil and won the ConFed with them.

1489~~~
Plenty of sceptics on here when Neymar first plied his trade in Europe. All that stuff you said sounds more convincing now when he turned out to be a star. Hindsight and all that.

Thing is: when you're talented enough, Barcelona, Bayern and United will give you your starts.

Madrid... maybe not so much.

1490~~~
Yeah well sceptics will always be there. Sceptics said Rakitic is an average player and Sevilla was his ceiling. Despite the sceptics, he was already quite a household name.

1491~~~
Against Brugge he was the best thing since sliced bread and now he's rubbish...give him time, he's still adjusting to the league. Against Brugge he had a lot more time and space to attack into, in the PL you don't get that and he will need to adjust his game, he's knows that and he will improve that aspect of his game. Look where he's come from, how hard he's worked, got himself a life/personal coach, the lad is driven within himself to be a success, give him time....

1492~~~
Yep. But it works both ways. In the end, maybe you always saw a 40 goals a season player in Neymar when he first landed at el Prat, but plenty did not... it was still a gamble considering his age and unproven status outside of the Brazilian league and internatiinal football (plenty of flops bought on the basis of good world cup tournaments, never mind a South American cup tourney). He also seemed to have a bit of a showman status and cliches of tricks over substance et all persisted around him, as is normal for a young player. Barca took a gamble.

That is not to say Memphis is a failure for mot adapting as quickly as Neymar, the circumstances are different and different footballers grow at different speed.

1493~~~
This - at the end of the summer I've been happy with our transfers apart from not having a proper experienced backup/competition to Rooney (CB too but that has become less of an issue). It would have meant less pressure on the youngsters to fill that gap..but given the current situation hopefully they can do that.

1494~~~
We always knew he would be hit and miss to begin with, anybody thinking he would be the reincarnation of Ronaldo from the first game is mental. 

It's good to have the option though, Young came on and did great, he links up better with Shaw and the other players around I find, where as Memphis is always looking maybe 1 step ahead too quickly. He will only learn by playing though.

1495~~~
I personally thought to much pressure was put on him from the start. At his age coming from the Dutch league to be your big white hope,  it was always going to be tough for him to meet expectations initially.

1496~~~
Not really convinced by him so far. I understand players need time to adjust to the new league, but his decision making is worrying and reminds me of Nani. Hopefully he'll get a couple of good performances to help with his confidence.

1497~~~
That's not understanding he'll need time though.

1498~~~
First, Neymar didn't hit the ground running from day one too. At that time a lot of people said how bigger succes is Bale and all that.

Second, give a guy little time. He played 7 games in 2 different positions and 2 of them were really good performances. He showed glimpses of his quality in every match till Liverpool game.

Third, saying all that he really must work on his close control of the ball.

1499~~~
Reminds me of Nani when he first arrived, he's going to be hit and miss for a while. Could do with a few games on the bench, start Young and let Memphis come on as a sub.

1500~~~
I definitely think he needs a break. Give Young a few games and ease Depay in from the bench, as he really should have been from the beginning. The consistency will come, but there's no point in forcing it.

1501~~~
So what's new? We're on his back cause he's not like Neymar?

1502~~~
Aye, there's definitely been a lot of pressure on him, since people are largely expecting him to be our most productive player besides the strikers this season. He's got plenty of ability, but areas he needs to work on to improve massively.

1503~~~
he was like a deer caught in headlights against Liverpool. 

I think the occasion got to him. He did have time on the ball on a couple of occasions with chances to run, he just didn't seem to hold it together upstairs and lost concentration.

1504~~~
Why compare him to Neymar?.  Neymar was always going to become one of the biggest players in the world, you could see that very clearly from his ability with the ball. The technique and skill were all there to see from the very beginning. Sort of like when we all first saw Ronaldo. Memphis is a tremendous talent but he simply isnt anywhere near the level that Neymar is or was when he first appeared.  The comparisons with Neymar are unfair.

1505~~~
It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that he's having a run of average games. He's 21, new to the league and there's enormous pressure on him to be our star attacking player. I have no doubts that he'll improve and deliver Brugge performances on a more regular basis.

What concerns me about his game at present though is his first touch. He always seems to take the ball behind him with his first touch and it becomes easy for the defender to close out the space especially when double marked. He received the ball in dangerous situation where he could have been 1v1 square with Clyne but his touch allowed Clyne to close out the space he could have had with a better touch. Its something I'd expect our coaching staff to improve on considerably in the next few seasons.

1506~~~
There have been other cases of this Agbonglahor or what his name is did this he was scary quick and sharp..  But started his body building regime and lost a step or two. Our Memphis is a bit like that he just looks to bulky, he needs to loose a bit of muscle. Get a bit of agility and sharpness back. His muscles are making him stiff and sturdy not quick and agile.. 

Beyond that I haven't seen his brilliance,  just a powerfull young player with potential.

1507~~~
If he does not improve in next 3 games,just terminate contract and get rid,otherwise if we wait till winter transfer window,he could hurt us even more by wasting that spot,i rather not play with 10 man every game. <span style="color: #ffffff">hope i am doing this right</span>

1508~~~
Send him on loan to Germany!

1509~~~
Is that right? A lot of people thought he was going to turn out to be another Robinho, who had similar massive hype coming out of Brazil, earned a big move to Real, and turned out to be a massive disappointment.

1510~~~
Well I for one never had any doubt. Most of the people who couldnt see it were blinded by the fact they didnt like how showy he was because of his haircuts and antics. It was blindingly obvious just looking at his abilities that he was going to be huge. Not sure how anyone couldnt see it.

1511~~~
He's getting incredible amount of stick <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> This season's Daley Blind of the last two months of previous season.

1512~~~
I think Depay might actually benefit from being the one who comes off to the bench and into the game, rather then having to be on at the start. Seems when you come off the bench - especially for us - you can play with a bit more freedom/intent, because generally everything that's come before it has been largely insipid.

1513~~~
I think that's fair. He's a young lad in a new league. Maybe this takes him out of the firing line and takes a bit of pressure off.

1514~~~
Wow, so caf have found their new scapegoat in Depay now eh?

1515~~~
This will probably be the Martial thread next month.

1516~~~
Martial will get the same treatment after a couple bad performances. He wasn't even that bad in the first half against Liverpool. Our left side was certainly our most threatening in that half. Our right was ineffective. His final delivery was poor and his decision making could have been better but this will improve. I agree he could be used as an impact sub in the bigger games where his pace and energy could cause massive problems later on in the game but we all need to give the lad time to find his feet and grow. Let's not give him the Nani/Young treatment straight away.

1517~~~
Where do those "ffs give him time" post come from? Obviously nobody wants to get rid of him or something, people are just realizing that he isn't all that and he has to improve a lot of aspects of his game to be a regular starter for us. He's got the talent, no doubt about that, but he hasn't shown anything in the EPL so far, what isn't a surprise (for me at least).
People who predicted 20 goals+assists from him only have themselves to blame. I don't have a problem with his poor performances, I am only worried how van Gaal managed him. IMO he's playing way too much and he should not be picked ahead of Young.

1518~~~
I agree coming on rather than starting will do him a world of good. Last 30 mins when the game is stretched, he has more space to work with.

1519~~~
Indeedd. I can't believe how negative people have become after just 5 games of season, especially as he has already shown glimpses of genuine talent. Against Newcastle he was very good in the first half except for final delivery and was probably slightly unlucky not to get a goal. I'd definitely not say he's been terrible for us so far but the amount of stick he's getting is unbelievable.

1520~~~
He will deliver 20 goals + assists this season. I can put any money on that and I am 100% sure that barring long-term injury I will be correct.

1521~~~
Depay is adjusting to a new league. You can see how shattered he looks. Once it clicks then he'll be our player of the season.

1522~~~
Aye, I think he's been poorly managed by LVG so far.

1523~~~
Why?

1524~~~
Because he competely played him into the ground before the international break, giving him 90 minutes in games where he was clearly knackered from around the 65/70 minute mark.

1525~~~
He seems exhausted and it was already the case before the international break.

1526~~~
Will be interesting if he starts tomorrow's game.

1527~~~
No he's not, he's got to get up to the pace of the league, best get him in now. He's young and can handle it.

1528~~~
Well he obviously can't, considering a) how knackered he looks and b) how his game is suffering because of it.

You can get up to the pace and the league and not have to play every single 90 minutes.

As I said in another thread, I think it would actually benefit him more to come into the games as a substitute, where he can express himself a bit more.

1529~~~
He's not exactly lit up the Premier League since the beginning, so I'm not sure how suddenly now his game is suffering. His best performances have come in Europe.

1530~~~
He's been poor in the PL games, but the quality is there. I have no doubt that he will develop into a top player.

He just needs some time to adjust his style to the PL, he's clearly doing better in Europe. Hopefully he starts tomorrow.

1531~~~
No, but he was still better in the first few games then he was against Swansea/Liverpool.

1532~~~
Have to give LVG some credit on Saturday, I was thinking it was the wrong decision to take him off, although he wasn't tearing Liverpool apart he and Luke Shaw seemed to be our most likely players to create something. I know Memphis is quick, but is it just me that thinks he is not using his pace right now? The past couple of games I have seen him receive the ball to feet and just wait so he can pull a trick or two on the fullback. IMO he needs to be a bit more direct. But of course he is still young and there will be plenty of mistakes and inconsistencies in his game before we get the finished product.

1533~~~
This and he needs to use his left foot. He just always looks to get it on his right, and right now it is all too predictable.
Saying that, he did setup a decent chance for Fella, the one time he went down the outside and put a ball in with his left.

His performance vs Liverpool reminded me of Di Maria

1534~~~
What are the chances of him starting tomorrow? Objectively speaking, Young performed better when he got his chance and should be the one that deserves the place more. However, Memphis has been impressive in the CL, plus I vaguely remember LVG once saying that he likes to play players against their former clubs. What do we think? Do you want him to start and do you think he will?

1535~~~
He needs to spend some time on the bench and should be utilised as an impact player. 

Young was impressive against Liverpool, and was undeservedly dropped after the Spurs game; he should start the next few games.

1536~~~
Looks like an out of form Nani. With way less of the abuse from fans of course.

1537~~~
I'd start Memphis against his old team in the Champions League where he's looked the most promising so far. If he returns to form then it'll give him a boost in confidence and he can continue against Southampon. If he doesn't we simply draft Young back in. 

What I'm most impressed with Ashley Young mk.2 is his mentality, whether he starting, substituted on or merely used to eat up the clock he has the perfect attitude. For that reason I think we're fine to start Memphis despite Young maybe being more deserving at this moment in time.

1538~~~
Must admit I couldn't believe how many people on here actually thought he was just going to set the World on fire this season. It is going to be a rollercoaster with him for the first 12-18 months, Have to take the rough with the smooth. Unfortunately at the moment we are seeing the inconsistent side to him.

1539~~~
Stop playing him every week Luigi.

1540~~~
Agreed. He needs to mix up his game a little more.

1541~~~
I didn't think he was <i>that </i>bad on Saturday but when the change was made at half time I guess Young did make us more threatening. I read Danny Murphy on the BBC saying Clyne had him in his pocket all half and was superb; again I didn't see it that way but I'm not a professional observer of the game. I thought Clyne played shit fwiw and Depay had the better of him on several occasions. What do I know.

1542~~~
What a goal! 

Slight joy after Shaw <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1543~~~
Made that goal look effortless.

1544~~~
What a goal. can't even enjoy it.

1545~~~
Great goal.

1546~~~
Wondergoal.

3 goals is a decent little haul this early in the season.

Matter of time before he starts doing it in the league.

1547~~~
Great skill and nice finish for the goal. Does anybody know if he's adept at playing on the right? as Young is useless out there.

1548~~~
He loves playing against Benelux clubs.

1549~~~
Always gets on the scoresheet when I don't have him to score anytime. Which is always when my bet365 account is dry during the CL week after I've rinsed it after the weekend. Don't worry though boys, this trend will more than likely continue!

1550~~~
Brilliant goal. PSV coach must be embarrassed after his comments.

1551~~~
His goal was sublime quality. Other than that I thought he was distinctly mediocre. Starting to think thats what we get from him, a nice piece of play and maybe a goal now and then other than that, a sub standard general performance

1552~~~
Excellent goal and probably our best player. Hope he can transfer this to the league.

1553~~~
He's been a bit of an enigma so far. He flits between looking great and really dangerous to incapable of doing the most basic things. And once again went home with 20 minutes left.

1554~~~
Great goal and seemed to link up well with Martial. Hit and miss at times, but I thought he was our most dangerous attacker.

1555~~~
Good goal. Frustrating otherwise.

1556~~~
I think he will be very good once he improves his close control. Might be difficult for him but he must work on this aspect.

1557~~~
Too often he thinks he's better than he is, and tries to make things happen himself.

1558~~~
Excellent goal and for 70 minutes looked dangerous, really should have had two more although Mata forced him slightly wide on one of those chances. Completely faded in the last 20 minutes which I don't get as I thought he was fitness freak like Ronaldo.

1559~~~
Nice goal & thought a lot of our chances came through him. Did well.

1560~~~
Re his cardio, I wonder if he's carrying a bit too much muscle? The more beef you carry round the harder your heart and lungs work to oxygenate it.

1561~~~
Good. At least he tries to do stuff unlike some others in the team.

1562~~~
Memphis actually destroys the notion that LVG tells his players to play safe<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1563~~~
Thing is if you want a goal like he scored then you've got to accept he's going to do some other annoying things. It's the way these players are more often than not. Key is getting him to a place where he's contributing enough that you can get away with it. But this is why we needed an experienced good winger in his peak. Someone who will make the right decision more often than not. I just can't understand not getting that.

1564~~~
Good, because thats exactly what we need. It wont always come off, but you need risk takers in the side

1565~~~
He did some good and some bad today.

But looked a threat most of the time.

1566~~~
i agree entirely you need risk takers, much too why I was completely against how we handled the AdM situation, but at times Memphis decision making lets him down.

1567~~~
Good performance. Did some very good stuff, scored a goal and then there were other creative attempts that didn't pay off but that's just par for the course.

1568~~~
That was a great goal, awesome footwork. He'll come good, no doubt.

1569~~~
He tried hard today especially in the first 20 or so minutes of the second half. He has a good understanding with Martial from the look of things. 

Keeps getting tired near the end of the game though, not sure whats up with that.

1570~~~
He played well tonight, the goal was an absolute beauty. It was a bit frustrating when he was switched to the right because Young was struggling against their left back. He played fine there but personally from what I've seen so far I prefer him on the left.

1571~~~
Awesome goal, very well taken. Bit hit and miss besides that, which is to be expected. Looked promising together with Martial, it has to be said!

1572~~~
I thought he was excellent yesterday and up their as our best player on then night. I personally found it frustrating that he was moved to the right wing as a way of trying to improve youngs shite performance and it didn't really work . By moving him to the right it takes away Depays biggest threat which is his shooting, I have no doubt that if that Martial layoff had come on the opposite flank then Memphis would have banged it in. I think he also put in some really good crosses in the game and generally just carried a proper threat. It's such a shame that our experienced players like mata and young let us down so much in attack as I think that cost us the game. 

I think certain fans need to realise that not everything he tries is going to come off and you have to stop being so frustrated by this. You can moan about a team taking no risks then, criticise a player that's trying to create something. You can't have it both ways!

BTW PSV have confirmed that we signed him for £19m after all.

<a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a> and your £37m fee.

1574~~~
Him and Martial are going to be unstoppable in 2-3 years but I believe we will see true glimpses of quality from them even earlier. He'll adjust to the life here and Premier League and I expect him to be knocking goals on a regular basis in the second half of season. Intelligent and effective player.

1575~~~
Tremendous footwork for his goal, was really impressed with the composed finish too.

1576~~~
Have I previously commented on Depay's fee? If so, providing the quote would be useful.

1577~~~
Sure, there you go:

To a poster saying it was £21.8m you replied:

Can't be bothered to search for more quotes but I am sure there were many, you specifically said he cost £31m.

1578~~~
He's such a spanner <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1579~~~
*GlastonSpur has gone offline*

1580~~~
He'll spin it around say that he meant that £20m was obviously not correct and he didn't actually mean that Depay cost £30m+.

1581~~~
He did...


So much for...

1583~~~
Strange but I still saw him bad yesterday. He had a moment of class for his goal, and clearly proves that he can produce, amd make thing happen

But I still think that his overall production was pretty poor. He didn't crossed well, or beaten another player. He's fast but he doesn't use his speed with the ball, like Young, to TRY, to beat a player. He's way too static with the ball at his feet.

Whether he's afraid by LVG philosophy or so, I don't know, but to me, he has to improve massively

1584~~~
I have gotten used to the fact that he will frustrate me and ruin many attacks. Hopefully he has more genius moments like yesterday.

1585~~~
You seem not to understand the clear difference between my <b>citing a media report </b>of £31m (or any other figure for that matter) and my alleged saying of such and such (as if I myself was the source of the information). The existence of the media report - from the BBC in this instance - is a fact that can't be disputed.

What can be disputed is the accuracy of any given media report. But your citing - many weeks after the event and thus with the apparent benefit of hindsight - of an apparently PSV-derived figure - carries no negative reflection on my citing (at the time) of the BBC report .... as much as you clearly wish otherwise.

And by the way, it would be good if a link to the source of this PSV-derived figure were given, rather than simply giving the figure.

1586~~~
As you can see, <a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a> has clearly not commented on Memphis' fee. Yes he has showed to us the BBC report and noted that PA and others have quoted a fee of 31m pounds and he has noted sarcastically they lack credibility huh. 

But if you look into it a bit more deeply you will note that <a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a> himself has never actually said anything about the fee for Memphis. He has merely referred the United fans to publications commenting on the fee. He is merely an innocent bystander. It is us ill meaning United fans who infer that he thinks the fee for Memphis was 31m pounds. Poor innocent <a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a>

1587~~~
Not sure how you came to that thought but if that's the case I'm not sure you'll ever like him as a player as I can see him always being one of those players that produces moments of magic but is also quite wasteful. Overall yesterday he was far less wasteful and the majority of our most dangerous moments went through him. He drifted out the game abit in the second half because we moved him to the right wing where he is far less effective but eve then he put in a great cross to fellaini who should have done better as well as linking up far better with Martial than our other attackers. Mata and Young were the big problem yesterday and were a big reason we fell flat in attack

1588~~~
Blah blah blah. You decided to ignore what PSV director said at the time and go with rumours with absolute certainty that it was £31m because you are a massive WUM.

I don't think I need to provide you with anything, you are so good at finding unbelievaby high fees for United players and unbelievably low fees for Spurs that you can find it yourself.  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1589~~~
He was one of our best players yesterday, he's involved in any piece of dangerous play we have. That says a lot.

1590~~~
There was plenty of Dutch press laughing at the BBC report, at the same time you kept posting it, The PSV director even said he wished they'd got that figure. 

You just conventionality continued to ignore all of that, despite being posted plenty of times, as it didn't fit with your anti-United agenda. 

That chip you have on your shoulder must really weigh you down. I'm amazed you even mange to get out of bed.

1591~~~
I see. Suddenly BBC reports become reduced in status - when convenient - to mere 'rumours'. And once again, it would be good if you gave a link to the source of this PSV-derived figure , rather than simply giving the figure.

1592~~~
Got frustrated with him in the second half when he refused to run at the full backs or try to take them on, made no sense when we needed something special to break them down. Don't know maybe he was tired at the point.

1593~~~
Find it yourself. I am not your link provider. It's reported in a lot of sources and comes from PSV director (he actually said the same in June which you promptly ignored in favour of reports which put us in bad light. 

You somehow ignore BBC as a reputable source when it comes to Spurs players fees (Soldado, Bale) <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1594~~~
Fantastic goal and a few other bright moments here and there but a fair few occasions where you can't even guess what he was trying to do. Very hot and cold in the match and doesn't seem to have the ability/desire to drive/carry the ball in to the final third consistently, which is what I expected he would provide when we signed him (having not seen much of him previously).

Despite this he was pretty much our only hope of creating something yesterday, as Mata and Young severely underwhelmed, and seemed to have a natural understanding with Martial which bodes well for the future.

1595~~~
great goal yesterday, but still worried about his premier league performances which have been really poor.

1596~~~
Well when PSV's owner comes out and says that the English sources got Euros and pounds confused, and that they wish they got 30 but really it was around 20m, then I'll believe him ahead of random journos.

1597~~~
Inconsistency is a given with someone at his age.

Plus, he seems to be really good friends with Shaw and it absolutely had to have been on his mind.

1598~~~
Hoping that goal vs PSV gives him a bit of confidence going into today's game. Needs a good performance today.

1599~~~
He plays too slowly. Needs to realise it's not the Dutch league and he won't get much time on the ball.

1600~~~
We need to drop him for 1-2 match.He needs to feel the pressure to up his game.

1601~~~
He lacks intelligence most of the time, prefer Young at the moment with some distance.

1602~~~
Needs to up his game. Even though we shouldn't be, we're heavily reliant on him at the moment and when it's not working for him, we struggle.

1603~~~
Let's be honest, he's been consistent... Consistently shite.

1604~~~
Young deserves to be ahead of him ATM.

1605~~~
Poor player. Not sure why he is the team over Young.

1606~~~
What's up with Young? Injured?

1607~~~
The ball just bounces off him constantly in the league. Bizarre.

1608~~~
Another in a long line of Eredivisie frauds.

1609~~~
Needs a rest, looks shattered already.

1610~~~
Nice piece of skill for the goal.

1611~~~
Unlucky not to score really. Did well to work into the position though.

1612~~~
Has a reputation for free kicks, been pretty poor for us so far in this respect.

1613~~~
So far like for like Nani replacment. Equally uneven and frustrating. Still ealry days.

1614~~~
Think it'd be better for him to start a few games from the bench and play some games against tired legs.

1615~~~
Some of the comment in this thread are completely over the top and retarded.

A 21 year old footballer playing his first season at the highest level in a new league and he gets written off immediately when things don't go exactly to plan in a few games, Really?!!

1616~~~
Even the most basic of tasks like holding up the ball is a struggle for him.

1617~~~
I didn't think he was <i>that </i>bad

1618~~~
Did brilliantly for the goal but crap otherwise.

1619~~~
He does easy things wrong but can pull of something special. Still a very raw player, not a finshed product by far

1620~~~
Has been decent imo

1621~~~
Not worried about him at all, this is to be expected.

1622~~~
Just hasn't shown his talent in the league at all so far. I still think he will come good though.

1623~~~
Does he ever actually run with the ball? He's built like a brickhouse but he turns onto his side and stands the opposing fullback up almost every time.

1624~~~
He does absolutely nothing. How young is not starting ahead of him I'll never know.

1625~~~
Young has got a rough deal. Memphis has done nothing to take over his spot. I know he's young and all but Young should be starting over Memphis atm.

1626~~~
Not sure if van Gaal strategy is working for Depay and the team. Young clearly is far superior player right now, and I understand boy needs game time but he’s playing too much, looks tired and not up to speed. Would rather see him against tired defenders than from the start.

1627~~~
He's only in the team because he's more likely to score than Young but I'd still bench him and make him earn the spot

1628~~~
Slightly harsh comments in here. He's very hit and miss at the moment and Young should be starting, but give him a few months and I'm sure he will be fine.

1629~~~
Ofcourse. The talent is obviously there. I just don't see the sense in playing him over a clearly better player for 90mins.

1630~~~
Disappointed. He didn't run at Yoshida once.

1631~~~
Thought he was decent today. Bit bad moments, a few moments of class though like for Mata's goal where he was unlucky to hit the post. His pace and ability and quality of crossing is a huge bonus though, he'll be a top player without a doubt IMO.

1632~~~
Pressed his ass off today, that's about the only good thing about his performance today.

1633~~~
He has good moments, but isn't doing enough to warrant a place in the side, in my opinion. Think Young should come in for a few games, and use Memphis as a impact sub.

1634~~~
He's weirdly not very good a dribbling, at all. That's a bit of a surprise to me. But he's capable of doing something so ridiculously good that still makes me optimistic.

1635~~~
Think he's just inconsistent at it... Dribbled past players at will against Newcastle, and showed good dribbling in other games (and for Netherlands when I watched him). Think he just needs time to get it all to come together at once, he shows moments of his class every game but is just inconsistent with it. Which is expected with a young player coming to the premier league.

1636~~~
He's very erratic with his first touch, at times it bounces off him and other times he kills it like on his chance where he hit the post and Mata scored the rebound. Early days.

1637~~~
Patience.....

1638~~~
not good today , i hope he's just tired not shit.

1639~~~
It's amazing how he shits himself 19 out of 20 times as soon as he is close to the box and then he does that dribbling for the third goal goal which was more difficult to do than many other things he messed up today.

1640~~~
ok

1641~~~
He's 21, get a grip.

1642~~~
He is only starting over Young because he is Dutch. At least Young can go past a player!

1643~~~
Really needs a game or two break. Looks exhausted.

1644~~~
Hah! Bless you all.

1645~~~
Because Young can't do what Depay did for the third goal. Young is a more mature player, but we're a less productive side for his inclusion.

It'll click for Memphis. He does a lot of good things and knows where the net is. A league goal will do him the world of good.

1646~~~
Yeah, that one against Liverpool. Other than that, Young has been poor as well

1647~~~
Feel sorry for him as the combination of Carrick/Schneiderlin sat too deep and couldn't affect the game in a positive way, then you have Rooney playing as a "10" who continues to stink the place out.

1648~~~
3 goals, 3 assists, 9 games. Not bad. Was decent today, people are talking shite.

1649~~~
He's a bit all over the place at the moment. Struggling to bring it all together.

Still showed great quality helping set up Mata's goal with the shot off the post. 

LvG is showing a lot of faith in him and I think that will continue.

1650~~~
He has been showing glimpse of talent here and there, but his overall play isn't quite there yet. Needs more time though he will come good.

1651~~~
Puts in some excellent crosses and plays some really clever passes into the striker. You just need to give youngsters time to develop properly and not expect everything all at once. That very rarely happens. Ronaldo was inconsistent as hell for a few years before becoming world class. Young is solid, but he can't do some of the things Memphis does.

1652~~~
Also, people criticizing him so much is weird as hell. 21 year old moving to the premier league, already has 3 goals and 3 assists in all comps in 9 games for an attack that isn't the most functioning if truth be told. It's not even like his all around game is terrible. It's just inconsistent, some moments of class, some sloppy moments. As you would expect from a promising young player. 

Those calling Young to be starting... How many goals and assists did he have all season last year? 2 goals and 6 assists in the league all season? There's no comparing their productivity.

1653~~~
Young hasn't done anything to deserve being dropped, and Depay has hardly set the world alight, but LvG is right to persist with Depay. I've already seen enough to convince me he's going to be a special player and his involvement in Mata's goal is exactly why you persist with inconsistent but promising youngsters. It's the same reason why I was against Fergie rotating between Lindegaard and De Gea during De Gea's rough start. The signs were there for De Gea and they're there now for Depay. It'll click at some point, but until then we just have to be patient.

1654~~~
Words fail me.

1655~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1656~~~
He hasn't been good in the EPL yet, but there's obviously plenty of time. His performances in Europe are encouraging and he's still showing flashes of how brilliant he can be. The turn for our third was great.

1657~~~
Not brilliant, but definitely an improvement over his performance against Liverpool. Had some moments where he looked fairly dangerous.

1658~~~
Has not shown much in the league, that's the problem. He seems lost at times, I would say calling him "inconsistent" is very polite. 

Not that I'm worried or anything, kind of expected that. He will come good but IMO he shouldn't be ahead of Young just because he has the potential. Young is making us play better as a team and I don't think anybody would question that.

1659~~~
Awful again, should never be starting over Young

1660~~~
Where do you find those stats?

1661~~~
<i>Awful </i>is a bit of an exaggeration. He wasn't brilliant, but showed some decent stuff here and there. Certainly offered more than someone like Rooney.

1662~~~
He "looks bad more than" Young because his movement is far better than Young's and he finds himself in more dangereous but also more difficult positions than Young throughout the game

He is getting into good positions all the time and you have to give him credit for that. Young is nowhere near as good with his movement as he is, but of course the problem is that Depay almost always messes everything up when he is close to opposition box, probably because he is still young and quite inexperienced in the PL. Saying that, I don't think he is playing well at all, but I still think he is better option than Young for the reason I wrote above.

Young is really far from efficient player, he can dribble all he wants and put cross after cross, if we can't score from that it doesn't mean a lot.


Btw, he should be working on his heading too, that's third or fourth free header since start of the season where he didn't even test the keeper.

1663~~~
2 goals v Brugge, 1 goal v PSV
2 assists v Brugge, 1 assist (if it counted) against Southampton

Unfortunately the majority of his productivity came in 1 game against a poor Brugge side at home <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1664~~~
Says it right here on the caf next to his name

1665~~~
It counts. 

I think he's done okay so far. However, he could definitely do with a little rest - I'd like to see Young start ahead of him on wednesday.

1666~~~
He needs to be managed well, but it might be down to a lack of options on the wings as to why he is playing a lot of football at the moment..Rest or a Goal would be a blessing for him.

1667~~~
Is he competing with Rooney for worst performance award?

1668~~~
No, because Rooney has done absolutely nothing in his league games.  Depay has been sloppy but he created a goal for us, was very unlucky not to score today.

1669~~~
ok

1670~~~
He wasn't actually bad. Not great but just lacking a bit of cutting edge right now. Lovely play for the third goal though.

1671~~~
No because he had a decent game with a few moments of class and a few bad moments. Created the 3rd goal basically though. On the other hand, Rooney, Carrick, and our defence were all very poor.

1672~~~
He's obviously got a lot of potential, but I do think he should be made to work a little harder for his place in the side. He's been great in Europe, not so much in the league.

1673~~~
Was shite for most the game today but I'm not worried about his future, he's only 21.

1674~~~
He hasn't been great in the league but at the same time I'm happy with him and feel he will only get better. You feel even though at times he can be hit and miss that he can do something brilliant, which he can.

1675~~~
Kid needs some rest. Can't keep on running him to the ground.

1676~~~
I have to say I'm struggling to take to Memphis so far. He plays with a arrogance and confidence that his performances, thus far, haven't really warranted. That does irk me somewhat. He also seems incredibly lazy, or just slow? Maybe both. He's shown some fantastic moments of ability, which have been great, but his overall performances have been poor. In all honesty I have been quite underwhelmed.

I'm also quite worried with his lack of dribbling ability. He just seems incapable of beating a defender, and he's not <i>particularity </i>fast is he? At least not on the ball anyway. His running off the ball is a lot quicker.

1677~~~
He isn't playing particularly well but he's still creating. There's always a moment in a game where he does something no one else is capable of doing and that's encouraging. He'll find a bit of consistency in the next few games.

1678~~~
I thought he and Martial were the outfield players that had the most influence in our victory today. That much needed pace we've been longing for. 

His dribbling and ball control isn't quite as consistent as it could be, but I hope that will come with experience. 

He's a player you are happy to pay money to watch. We're lucky to have him playing in our shirt.

1679~~~
Needs someone on the right side creating to take some of the pressure of him. Obviously talented but still short in terms of a title winning winger as he is just now, but will improve in time.

1680~~~
Someone like...Juan Mata, who's been getting goals and assists this season?

1681~~~
It's probably not what you're referring to but even though it isn't working for him at times offensively he's not neglecting his defensive duties. I Think he's shown great discipline for us in that regard.

I can understand some people being underwhelmed with him so far but in reality it was very likely that he'd struggle initially. I Think he's shown particularly in the games in europe and against Newcastle that he's very capable of beating a man, but his ability is not unconditional and he struggles a bit when he isn't allowed space which Southampton were very effective in closing during their best periods of the game.

Still he seems to keep creating chances in pretty much every game but he makes seemingly silly errors, particularly often adhering to miscontrolling the ball, at decisive moments. I Think that maybe he's just a bit to hotheaded at times which might be due to the pressure on himself and indeed our entire offense at the moment.

1682~~~
Memphis has 1 goal more and the same number of assists...

1683~~~
I'm not disputing that; more disputing the idea that Memphis is struggling because Mata isn't pulling his weight on the right.

1684~~~
His numbers are actually really good when you consider that he's 21, in a new league and a new team. He might not be getting everything right but he is still being pretty efficient for us. In general he's been no worse than many of our other players, I think people are just expecting too much from him too soon.

1685~~~
No one will se his potential until we get an equally capable player on the right.  The amount of times i see 2 or 3 defenders marking memphis just because mata has already cut in to the middle.  A player who can keep width and cut in WITH the ball will make defenders less capable to mark memphis out the game.

1686~~~
They haven't come in a new league, though. They've almost all been in Europe.

1687~~~
Oh, I agree then. That's just a weird argument <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Memphis wasn't even bad today. Was decent overall, created a few chances, hit the post for Mata's goal, and made a few good runs. He's a kid coming to a new league, he's obviously going to be inconsistent. He's showing moments of class and that'll only improve though with time. Martial has started brilliantly but I'm sure he'll be inconsistent this season as well. Simply because he's 19 years old. Both of them being productive so soon though is a great sign though for us going forwards.

1688~~~
You're all going to turn on him the way you did with Nani, I foresee it.

1689~~~
It's insane really, he was solid today and didn't give me any reason to be concerned about him.

1690~~~
Aren't you even slightly worried about the fact he can't actually dribble? I mean, for a winger, thats a massive issue.

And we wasn't really solid was he? He didn't do anything all game until the turn and shot for the third goal. Which was fantastic.

I don't see whats wrong with having a few concerns. No ones righting him off, or calling him shit. Just commenting on his performances, which haven't been all that great, apart from flashes of brilliance here and there.

1691~~~
He's definitely been much better in the CL than Prem, but I think as soon as he adapts, he'll do much better in the Prem as well.

I thought he was decent today, albeit there were a few frustrating moments. His decision making needs to improve and he needs to release the ball quicker at times.

1692~~~
He's exciting to watch that is a fact. I love how he beats a man. Still has a lot to learn in terms of decision making but with experience will learn. He has everything though to become our best player.

1693~~~
He's what you'd expect from a highly-rated flair 21-year-old so far. Prodigious skill, outrageous moments, certainly worth his spot in the side but not yet a consistent contributor.

That said, after that turn and shot onto the post for Mata's goal today, the 'hasn't scored in the Prem yet' point is hardly relevant. Some scrappy tap-in or whatever would hardly have been as impressive or promising as an assist like that.

1694~~~
He reminds of me of a young Cristiano Ronaldo in that sense that his talent is so outrageously obvious, but only in small flashes. It is very frustrating, but he is young and lernin <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1695~~~
Luckily for him, Martial came in and took the pressure off his shoulders and he deals with it very well. If he hadn't come in, Memphis would be under much bigger pressure by the media to deliver and score.

Hopefully, he'll improve.

1696~~~
I'm still waiting for him to consistently best his man.

1697~~~
Cheesy Mata is coming up well short in this position. In fact both wingers are right now, Depay it is understandable as he should not be playing every game as he's not ready but is because he's our best winger. But Mata is truly awful in this position. The fact we have great possession and Mata chips in with a goal or a assist now and again does not detract from the distinct attacking block on the right hand side of the park. Give me Mane everyday of the week and watch the difference in our team then! Mata should be 10 or nothing.

1698~~~
Firstly he isn't a winger. He isn't going tear defenders apart from young Giggs did. He's a forward for me who is at his best using a quick piece of intelligent skill to lose the defender and shoot/pass. That definitely looks to be his strength. And given he just topped the Dutch goalscoring charts it makes the best use of his goalscoring prowess too. Add to his strength and it's a good combination.

Secondly, he didn't drbble much in the last game, but I would argue that "can't dribble" is a step too far. That skill for the goal was dribbling, the skill for the PSV goal was dribblng, and against Newcastle in the first half his dribbling was quite good.

At the end of the day he is just 21. Glimses of his big potential and a bit of end product is all you can expect at this age. I see the tools there for him to dribble better so hopefully he does.

But I don't think he's stinking up the place as this thread would suggest. Massive overreactions all round.

1699~~~
Too much is expected from him whereas he's just a kid.

1700~~~
I'm not saying that as a sole reason Cheesy as Depay has been stone average in the league games and looked heavy legged, I'd go as far to say he's struggling to adapt to the physicality and pace of the league (that will come). But Mata has not exactly unburdened him with his performances. Defences are hardly being stretched with Mata!

1701~~~
I think it's a fair point actually. It's a lot harder to find space when all the attacks are set up to go from your side. Defences will put a greater emphasis on that side naturally. Now, Memphis can and will do better with time anyway, but having a big threat on the other side dragging more attention that side would help greatly. Even Neymar, for example, has Messi dragging entire defences to the right leaving Neymar with much less to do on the left to hurt teams.

1702~~~
Yep exactly the centre half comes over and closes the space for 1 v 1 same with the midfield leaving Depay a lot to do. If we had someone like Mane on the right then it's much harder for this to happen and leaves opportunities for Depay to be 1 v 1.

1703~~~
I'm not concerned about Memphis in the future. We all knew that the first season would take some adapting. He's been showing flashes, and will only get better as the season goes by. Maybe a rest would do him some good, but maybe he just needs to play to get the PL under control. Hard to say.

What I do think is a factor for our impatience is the impact Martial is making. In the ilk of <i>"If Martial is more expensive and is already scoring, Memphis should do even more."</i>

1704~~~
Once he gets used to the PL and that teams double him, he will be brilliant. People just need to relax and give him time

1705~~~
21 years old. Give him a season or two as an impact player off the bench perhaps? Plenty of time for him to come good.

1706~~~
He's kind of going under the radar in the last two games because of the excitement about Martial and concern about Shaw but that's a goal in each of our last two games which have been mainly due to individual brilliance from Depay. Encouraging to see.

1707~~~
I am genuinely surprised by the harsh criticism he has received in this thread, as I have been becoming more excited about him the more I see him play. We just need to think about the long-term and not about a particular game.

He has fantastic talents and I don't know how somebody can't see that. He has great speed, strength (although he isn't great at using his strength to his advantage yet, and he would get better at it as he gets used to the PL, not unlike Smalling actually), technique, movement and vision. He can beat his man inside as well as outside in a one-on-one situation based on his technical and physical attributes. He also seems to be generally intelligent in his play. I see him developing as a complete modern wide-forward who would be a great asset in a possession oriented team as well as a counter-attacking team. He also appears to be forming a good attacking partnership with Martial, which has the potential to be as good as the Rooney-Ronaldo combo. 

Justified criticisms of him would be that he has surprisingly low stamina as he looks physically shot in the premier league games, and that he is a bit lost in rapid PL tempo. Both these points can be attributed to him being new to the premier league and LVG has already cautioned us beforehand that he would find it difficult initially. He can work on these issues and I am pretty sure he would do better in the second half of the season and next season. The other criticism I would have of him is that he hasn't been able to form a good partnership with his supporting LB and tries to do too many things himself sometimes. Having said that his combination play with the other attacking players has been great till now so again it doesn't seem to be a long-term issue. Perhaps he is trying too hard to impress. 

The best thing to happen to him is the arrival of Martial - this has reduced the burden and expectancy from his shoulders. Both the young players can now jointly share the burden and will get breathing space to grow individually and together (again I can't help but keep thinking of Rooney-Ronaldo combo). His output till now has been good for his age. I can bet that those writing him off would have to (gladly) eat their words in future.

1708~~~
This.

I don't get all the optimism. He's been decent in the CL, and nearly invisible in the league. If Young was performing like Memphis you'd see this place do a 180.

Willing to give him a few seasons to bed in but so far he's been meh.

1709~~~
He's actually not gone under the radar that much, he's being criticised heavily (has been for the past two weeks).

1710~~~
When I say under the radar, I was talking about his positive contributions. Those were two really excellent pieces of play, for which he's not got much recognition IMO.

1711~~~
Young rarely had such an attacking threat even last season when he was praised. Young often has been marked by 1 player and even if he gets past him, he rarely puts in a dangerous cross/scores a goal. Whereas Memphis has been closely marked by two players all the time and yet has produced individual quality generally in every match. He has been our most threatening attacker over the course of this nascent season, although Martial may take over him soon! 

And when you say he has been decent in the CL, what does it say about our other attacking players? As he has been better and done more than Rooney, Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, and Young in CL.

1712~~~
I agree.  I guess it's a matter of taste, but on the basis of what I've seen so far I can certainly put up with the crap parts to get the good parts.  I'm ever more convinced that his potential is absolutely immense, so would be madness not to stick by him.

1713~~~
I agree.

1714~~~
Wait people writing him off,not ready to give him X years to improve,while in same time there is talk about Mane (23) like 'Uh,oh he looks good,we should spend 25 mil on him etc."?

1715~~~
He reminds me a fair bit of a young Nani. Shows glimpses of doing something amazing and then messes up the most basic of passes. Also seems to be trying a bit too hard to show his ability but it's clear as day that the kid is excellent and is causing the opposition all kinds of problems.

1716~~~
Just because he is attracting some criticism doesn't mean people are writing him off. There might be a few that are but those people are just being dramatic. I criticised him because he hasn't been that good lately IMO, not writing him off though. I am sure he will be just fine in the long run.

1717~~~
He's not been as exciting a player as I thought he'd be in the league. In the CL though, it's been a different story. I think he'll be twice the player in 2-3 years and those who are writing him off this early are mental. Not that there are many.

1718~~~
His bad performances are a direct result of our rubbish transfer window (in terms of attacking players). Had we someone who was genuinely good enough to replace him, then he'd be given time off, unfortunately, we don't. Young is a decent player, but I don't think he's good enough to be starting consistently as he just doesn't produce the goods often enough. However, it is about time that the two were rotated, as we don't have many choices, and don't want Memphis to burn out so rapidly.

1719~~~
You aren't going to develop Memphis better if you sign a Reus for his place alongside him.

1720~~~
Could have kept Januzaj and rotated the two.

1721~~~
Young is better than both atm. 3 players to rotate 1 position?

1722~~~
Individual brilliance for his goal at PSV and individual brilliance for Mata's goal yesterday. 

His output, just like Mata's will be good this season. Both of them will only truly be appreciated at the end of the season when they have both get 30 goals (combined goals and assists) this season.

1723~~~
Yep, I'm not entirely sure where the idea he's not playing well is coming from. He's not yet had a game where he's single-handedly bossed it for us, but he produces wonderful moments every game, looks consistently creative, and has scored arguably our nicest goal of the season (and all-but-scored a very nice one against the Saints.)

He's not playing <i>brilliantly</i> yet, but he's doing well. Certainly well enough for a 21-year-old who's only a handful of games into his Premier League career.

1724~~~
he'll get better. a bit of inconsistency is expected from the very start.

statistically he will get pass 10 goal mark which represents a good start.

1725~~~
Id play Young in the EPL, especially with October fixtures coming up.Without Shaw, Young will offer greater protection to his LB, and has been very good in the bigger games. Memphis should come of the bench against tired legs.

Id start him in Europe though.

1726~~~
I'd say he'll break 15 goals. He's already on 3 and a couple of near misses so 10 seems a certainty.

15 would be a brilliant return. Should be aiming for 10+ assists too (also has 3 already).

1727~~~
Haven't 2 of his goals come against Brugge? Brugg, were a side decimated with injury and who  were not in the CL - they were qualifying to try and get into the CL. 
Rooney also got a hat-trick against Brugge, so it shows you how bad they were.
He is unlikely to see weaker opponents than Brugge, for the remainder of the season. 

The acid test is the EPL. The EPL is one of, if not the, toughest league in Europe, where new players can struggle to adapt. 
I'd say Memphis should be judged on what he does next year.

In saying that, the raw materials are all there. He is strong/fast/physical. And he likes to go for goal whenever he gets the ball. I remember an 18 year old Rooney being very similar to what Memphis is today.

1728~~~
"Can't" is a bit to far, but I am a bit worried that he looks (to me) like he has lost a bit of faith in his ability to take on fullbacks from deep in the league though. His little moments of brilliance have come in the box and we need to get him there and get him pulling these little moves off around the area and not from so far deep that it makes no difference. 
Ah, it seems this discussion has made it's way over here to the Depay thread. This has definitely been a problem.

1729~~~
Memphis looks struggling with the pace of the PL. He's bossing it in Europe so far, but he's been bossed in the PL (tiny bit exaggeration). The burst of pace we see from him in Europe barely appears in the PL. Every time he's about to run with the ball, defenders catch up with him and he has to stop and check then pass backwards or make a cross. There are even occasions where he was easily shrugged off the ball and put on his backside when he failed to beat someone.

What he needs to do is inject more urgency into his game. At the moment he's taking too long with the ball. Taking his jolly good time, which invites defenders to come onto him.

I believe he still needs time to adapt, but once he does that, I expect consistent high level performances week in week out comfortably from him.

1730~~~
Was just watching the highlights of the game against Southampton and there was one instance in the first half where he basically dribbled just outside their box and took out 4 defenders marking him with one move and passed to Martial. That was lovely and shows what he is capable of it even if its too much to demand consistently from him now.

1731~~~
Every single PL team we've played couldn't be employing the exact same tactics against him, surely.

1732~~~
I don't think teams in the PL would feel they need to employ special tactic against Memphis. Simply closing him down quickly is effective enough to put him off his game so far. I don't think PL defenders are wary of him.

1733~~~
Agree with all that, especially the bolded part. He hasn't been great so far, but he hardly deserves all the criticism he has been getting in this thread. Did everyone expect him to walk into the league and have a Sanchez like impact in his first season?

The kid is talented, anyone can see that, he will score and assist a fair few this season. Probably go on a two or three game run where he looks world class. But anyone expecting him to drag us to silverwear ala Hazzard is going to be disappointed.

As a side note, I wonder what Martial's thread is going to look like once he inevitably goes on a bad run some time this season?

1734~~~
Get the feeling him and Martial are going to strike up a devastating partnership interchanging positions and causing defenses all kinds of problems with their pace and power.

1735~~~
Yep. The two of them are going to destroy the league in a couple of years.

1736~~~
I see that happening too, hopefully with Januzaj and Wilson too. I'm getting giddy at the prospect of it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1737~~~
And Pereira! Do we have the best set of young players in the world right now? (Genuine question as I have no idea what other clubs have)

1738~~~
It really is looking extremely promising, now if we can just get the #10 and RW spots sorted out to create a Fantastic Four! 

It would be great if they also got into the mix, big season ahead for Januzaj in particular.

1739~~~
The most excited I've ever been in terms of what he and Martial could do. Rooney and Ronaldo started off with early elimination if I recall from Europe and then kicked on.....hopefully these two can have a good stab at Europe from the off!

1740~~~
He has great harmony with Martial and Mata. Then we have Rooney providing the wrecking ball support

1741~~~
Definitely looks like he likes to play with more urgency, same as Martial, no wonder they often look for each other on the pitch, Mata and Rooney play a much slower tempo than these two.

1742~~~
he's almost like Nani his worst but Nani could at least had his dribbling spot on. You knew if there was any player t score a goal it would be him though.. sub him off for Pereira or wait a couple of minutes, maybe the goal can help him to raise his game

1743~~~
He needed that goal. 

He's so selfish, which was to be expected. If he can work on his final ball he'll be class.

1744~~~
Good to see him off the mark now in the league.

1745~~~
He needs a goal during bad games .. that will teach him to be more effective on a bad day.

1746~~~
Happy for him, needed that in the league.

1747~~~
Great he got the goal after a poor game. Hopefully the goal will settle him. He over does it too much and dwells on the ball for too long.

1748~~~
Thank heavens for that goal. Should open it up a bit, and make for a better second half.

1749~~~
You have to realize, he never gets any space. The problem is, Rooney in particular has become such a non-threat with the ball that the Sunderland defense can comfortably give him space to take it away from Memphis and to a degree also Martial.

1750~~~
Poor again. Needs to stop taking the free kicks too, utterly hopeless at them. Rooney and Mata would be better choices.

1751~~~
Not playing well but has 4 goals and 4 assists for us in like 10 matches. Not too bad. And his raw ability is unreal, needs to get smarter and more patient tho.

1752~~~
Mata hasnt scored a direct free kick for us in a while as well.

1753~~~
Teams are doubling up on him.

1754~~~
Nice to see him off the mark in the league. Will give him a lot of confidence, 5 goals and 4 assists for the season so far, not bad from 11 matches, eh?. His decision making needs to improve though, and he needs to stop taking freekicks because he's shit at them.

1755~~~
Still only showing glimpses. His cut inside earlier on the game was great, but he dwelled and ended up making the wrong decision. He makes good runs in behind, but doesn't anticipate the ball too well.

Good movement for the goal. Not a pretty goal but he needed it. Seems to have upped his work rate a bit, which is good.

Sunderland can't really park up anymore, they need a goal so hopefully he'll have some room to run into in the 2nd half to make something happen.

1756~~~
Well, Rooney poses no threat, so <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1757~~~
Was Ronnie as frustrating in his early days?

1758~~~
Havent done anything to justify his place yet. Awful game and his body language has been very negative

1759~~~
Awful is a ridiculous overstatement and I'm not even going down the 'body language' road. 

Frustrating from him at times today for sure, but he's clearly got bags of talent and he seems to link up well with Martial.

1760~~~
Yes, very much so. To be fair to Memphis, he rarely ever has any space to go at the defense. There's always a second or third guy waiting, so his big strength is basically eliminated.

1761~~~
We're only winning 2-0, emotions are high.

1762~~~
He's not a winger, is he?

Not having a winger who can dribble and create space hurts us.

1763~~~
Young is clearly better. 

No offence.

1764~~~
Young should start instead of Memphis

1765~~~
Terrible today*, and he’s actually getting worse with each game. I think he needs to be dropped for a few games. The more he struggles the more he tries to do everything on his own.

It doesn’t get any easier than Sunderland.

*Usual disclaimer about how much potential he’s got blah blah blah.

1766~~~
Considering United are going to be playing mid-week games for a while, i'd either let him start on Wednesday and then rest him next weekend, or vice-versa.

Glad he got his goal today.

1767~~~
should be dropped from now on, YOung's miles better was more dangerous in his little cameo than Memphis in last 4 games.. Imagine Januzaj having chance to play week in week out like Memphis. The problem is he wouldn't never gets a chance like this...

1768~~~
People are ridiculously negative towards him.

1769~~~
Goal aside, that was pretty dire. Hes a positive player, and always looks to create something, but his decision making is just horrendous

1770~~~
He did have a chance like this and people were saying the same things.

1771~~~
So true and the same for Mata as well! If we are going to be a force again these two positions need upgraded.

1772~~~
I thought Memphis would kick on after he scored, instead his performance worsened in the second half. Its difficult to know what to do with him. He has the talent to play for United, he has shown that in Europe. The problem is he loses all composure in the Premier League. When Martial put Memphis through in the second half he really should have scored, and he let his head drop after that (which is a worrying tendency of his). It seems crazy that Martial has so much more composure than Memphis does. Young was much more dangerous from the left today.

1773~~~
Memphis is finding it a bit difficult at his early stages. At times he's brilliant but at times he's dire. Still, 4 goals and 4 assists in 11 games. Why are many being so critical?


At the end of the day he was crucial in scoring that first goal.

1774~~~
What? When did Januzaj was allowed to play almost 12 consecutive games from the wing despite being average most of the time?

1775~~~
Did seem intent on trying to beat at least 3 defenders, typically in a confined space. Surprised he wasted that great chance supplied by Martial.

I like him but that wasn't a good performance.

1776~~~
Poor again. I think a rest would benefit him greatly.

Young does deserve to be starting ahead of him.

1777~~~
Needs to be dropped to the bench. He's been terrible and does not deserve to be starting ahead of Young.

1778~~~
Januzaj received a chance early in the season where he started about 4 or 5 games in a row. I'm a huge Adnan fan, but he didn't do better than Memphis in that time according to the caf. The same attributes, "wasteful" "poor decision making", "has the talent but needs to be polished", were given to him.

1779~~~
How will dropping him allow him to adapt to the league? It will be Di Maria all over again should we do that.

1780~~~
I don't get why people think Young is better. Depay makes a lot of mistakes, yes, but he's far more productive than Young ever was for us.

1781~~~
Martial has had a perfect start to his United career so far to be honest. Watch his body language when things aren't going well for him for a few games before you compare it. Memphis has struggled so far in the BPL and being an ambitious guy, something like bottling a great chance will piss you off, especially if you're young and eager to prove yourself.

1782~~~
Young doesn't score goals. Memphis has bagged four in all competitions and it's still September. 

I find some of short-sightedness surrounding this lad baffling. It's all there. He's getting into goalscoring positions, contributing towards goals in just about every game and poses a real positional threat to defenders due to his movement (which is truly exceptional). 

Sure, he makes mistakes and he makes wrong decisions, but that's part and parcel of having the bravery to send out kids to lead the line for Manchester United. And when it pays off the rewards will be great.

1783~~~
Bring him on when we are winning where he'll have more gaps and less pressure. Young has been very good every time he's started on the left and should be our starter ahead of Memphis

1784~~~
It's stupidity, more or less.

1785~~~
The same reason people wanted Januzaj benched and now that he's out on loan, a lot are crying for him to be back here. There's an insane negativity towards young players around here, but I suppose the likes of Bebe and Macheda have contributed massively towards that.

1786~~~
Glad he's got his first premier league goal. Hopefully he can kick on from here and produce better displays in the prem.

1787~~~
seriously...the guy scores a goal and all you see are posts about him being shit...on a day when we've topped the league...what a miserable bunch of people on here.
no doubt he could've done better, should've scored a 2nd goal as well, but regardless of that and how shit he presumably is, he still creates chances and you can see he's one of the players that can change the game by himself, there's no coincidence he's being doubled a lot.
4 goals, 4 assists in 11 games by a player that's "terrible"? doesn't make sense...and he's only going to get better.

1788~~~
He's overdoing it too often I feel, maybe the arrival of Martial has exacerbated this aspect as he's not the shiny new toy anymore, but getting a goal will be a boost for him and hopefully he can start to use his brain a bit more in the final third.

1789~~~
Thought he was very average besides the goal. He is a long term purchase and thus getting the starts otherwise it should be Young starting over him.

1790~~~
Good goal for him. Decision-making and finishing really erratic again but meh, he should improve.

1791~~~
yeah..the Young fecks up and you'll be shouting for Memphis to come on..sheesh

1792~~~
He tries to hard, he needs to relax and simply play football.

1793~~~
Funny that a lot of people are just quick to point to stats and say how productive Mata is, while Memphis is terrible and needs dropping <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1794~~~
I believe in him long-term but at the moment he needs to be dropped.

1795~~~
Bringing on Young against tired legs is deceiving quite a few on here. If Young did get the nod ahead of him I'm damn sure you all would be calling for Memphis to come back into the starting 11.
He had a good game in my opinion. He should have squared back to Martial for his chance though. He was more direct today which is positive to see.

1796~~~
Thought he played well today. Final ball inconsistent and is obviously a young promising player, but he wasn't poor by any means. Improved in the second half as well IMO. The first goal will be a huge boost for him I think as well, as he was lacking a bit of confidence. The dribbling and going past players bit was a lot better today then last week though.

1797~~~
Yes. Agree. 

Young and Perreria need to be given a shot at this role.

1798~~~
Memphis doesn't have stats to back him up though, not in the league anyway. Today was his first goal/assist in it.

1799~~~
Eh? What the feck are you on about? I have been saying for a while now that Young got a hard deal. Memphis didn't do anything to take his spot especially in the league. Had I been saying it based on 1 game, tonight would be a shit game to pick seeing as he scored.

1800~~~
The exact same can be said for Young, is that why hes looking deceiving good because were bringing him on when we're winning, have more gaps and less pressure running at tired legs?
Which game of Young's are you referring to?

1801~~~
Yeah, a bit over the top, but if you focus solely on his league games, he really has been quite disappointing so far.

1802~~~
He will get better but Martial looks streets ahead of him on the ball.

1803~~~
He got an assist last week technically (shot off the post before Mata). But 4 goals and 4 assists in all comps so far is very good, and that's really encouraging even if the performances are inconsistent. For the most part he's been decent, some very good, a couple of bad games, but people are overreacting I think. To be so productive at the start of his career here only bodes well for the future when he actually kicks on and his final ball becomes more consistent. Think he can definitely become someone who scores over 25 goals in all comps regularly. Might even get to 20 this season the way he's going.

1804~~~
I think his talent is obvious but seems he couldn't make right decision most of the time

1805~~~
He's been good in Europe but generally a bit shit so far in the league. Not saying he's not talented, or won't make it here, I'm sure he will, but right now I don't really think he justifies his place in the side. 

He's a far more frustrating player to watch than Nani was, and we know what his treatment was like on the Caf. Tough times ahead.

1806~~~
I don't think Young got a hard deal at all. Two seasons ago this site wanted him out like a cancer in the kidney. Last season he put in some terrific performances and people were saying different things. Memphis deserves his chance to prove himself regardless since his pedigree was solid. Ok...so it's not working out quite so well at the moment, unlike the younger Martial, but I understand why LVG persisted with him...giving him more time. That is all.

1807~~~
Martial's performances have probably been doing him no favours. We have to remember that what Martial has been doing at 19 is freakish (and he will probably go through a rough patch himself at some point). Memphis is struggling with decision making and composure mainly which could well be related to the pressure he's feeling as a young lad at United, trying to force things. I'd like to see him rotated for a little bit with Young and spend more time as an impact player off the bench. He's showed enough glimpses of quality to see that the talent is there and there is plenty of time ahead for him to come good.

1808~~~
If he scores the second goal, no one moans. 

Had an OK game, just needs to improve his decision making. The reactions are way OTT though.

1809~~~
He is still trying to find his footing in the league but the signs of improvement are there, no doubt. A few unlucky moments from him but overall a good game I feel.

1810~~~
He always cuts back on his right foot and should just left it fly more often. A bit too much indecision at the moment but is understandable given his age. Will get better in time.

1811~~~
He's a young player, and with all our struggles the recent seasons creating opportunities, he sure knows how to find some. 
His movement is excellent, his decision making has let him down but the potential should be there for all to see. 
We know what Young brings to this side, a good link up with the full back and a few good crosses, but he's not a goal threat nor a regular on the assist charts. 
Young is also 30, the potential to improve further is low, and he doesn't exactly run behind defences, same can be said with Mata and Rooney as a 10. So the 3 of them together behind the striker is a recipe for the slow ponderous football we all like to say goodbye to.
Let's persist with him, we'll reap the benefits soon enough.

1812~~~
From you that is. 

Yes he's talented and has potential (blah blah...) but he's been crap in the league. There's absolutely no reason for him to continue to start games.

Young never deserved to get dropped and should be reinstated to the team.

1813~~~
I predict that opposing managers will figure out Martial...and he'll then have to adapt his game. Memphis is apparently falling over himself and easy to deal with. However...I reckon that is one or two seasons time, Memphis will be dynamite....just saying

1814~~~
Erm...Rooney?

1815~~~
He has turned his career around, yeah, credit to him for that. I understand why LVG has persisted with Memphis too, I even said it in my post but as of now, Young is the better player which is the only point I made.

1816~~~
It's ridiculous how people mention how productive he is compared to Young, despite today goal was his only contribution in the Premier League so far. You really should get the facts straight.

1 goal/assist every 539 minutes is hardly productive. But I don’t want to play that game.

My problem is he plays like a striker so we have 4 of them on the pitch and we struggle to create. That’s why I prefer Young at the moment. Memphis can get his share of minutes in Europe and as a sub, no need to play him every single game.

1817~~~
What about him?`

1818~~~
Young getting a hard deal is just bollocks. 

He doesn't score goals and seldom provides a moment of excellence that impacts heavily on a game. He works hard, is a reliable outlet, and will appear to be dangerous, but more often than not it's just posturing.

He's done well to revive his United career, but we owe him nothing. If and when he offers more goals and direct assists and he still finds himself sat on the bench, only then can we discuss his raw deal.

1819~~~
Frustrating performances so far from him but his talent is clear to see.
Still feel he would be better coming on as an impact sub for a few games against tired legs. Also Youngs performances also deserve a start IMO.

1820~~~
Why? Because he was deceivingly good when he came on to run at defenders with tired legs when we're winning the game and he's under no pressure?

1821~~~
well..I think you'll find that Young probably will start this week in the CL, which is probably why LVG rested him.

1822~~~
Because he's been better than Depay in the league. That's why.

1823~~~
He needs to be rotated. You can see him tiring, theres nothing wrong with him not starting matches so early into his career with us espeically with the way Young just gets on with business and is very direct. Nothing wrong with him coming on as sub to add pace. We need to be careful with him imo.

1824~~~
Ashley Young has scored ten Premier League goals in just over <b>four</b> seasons at United. That's just over two a season. He's scored 13 in all competitions.

Depay has scored four and we're still in September. And people wonder why he's getting the nod ahead of Young?

We play a game that relies upon creating clear cut chances and finishing them off. On the whole, we struggle to create many openings. Our wide forwards are therefore under pressure to move between the defenders and finish well. Young, as threatening he can be, doesn't offer that in the way Depay does, and it's why Van Gaal will persist with him even in spite of a tough start to his league campaign.

1825~~~
You can tell the talent is there, but he just needs to improve his decision making and confidence. No doubt he'll come good and start tearing people apart. However, going forward, I prefer to see Young starting and let Memphis come on (if need be) against a tired opposition.

1826~~~
There's always a reason why Young plays well, and it's never because he's actually a decent player. This week it's tired legs. There's a good few days to think of a handicap to credit Wolfsburg with if he also plays well in midweek.

1827~~~
He is no Ronaldinho but it isn't as if Memphis is ripping the league apart with goals/assists.

1828~~~
Can someone please explain this to me? 
why would you replace Memphis for Young who came off the bench and plays okay against tired legs, while we're winning and under no pressure? 
Is it to make it easier for him? 
Isn't that what it was for Young?
What happens if Memphis plays well coming off the Bench?
Are we going to go around in circle with the pair of them?

Memphis starts -> doesn't have the best of game -> Young comes of the bench -> has a good cameo = Should start next game

Young starts -> doesn't have the best of game -> Memphis comes of the bench -> has a good cameo = Should start next game

Repeat.....

1829~~~
Which game? Starting or as a sub?

1830~~~
Justify a place in the squad.

1831~~~
But we're in a thread about Memphis and I was talking about Memphis.

1832~~~
Depay has been crap in the league. You can throw all the stats you want but I'd recommend using your eyes for better judgement. Not only has he been crap, he's been incredibly wasteful, barely beats his man and has missed several good chances.

Young has been better in the league so far in the limited time has and did not deserve to get dropped. I don't give a flying feck how poor Young was a few years ago. He's been in very good form since LVG has taken over and if not for his great form towards the end of last season we wouldn't be in the CL. So, yeah, Young didn't deserve to get dropped and unlike he hasn't played Brugge to have his fill of goal and assists.

Regardless, it's your post, that all people wanting him dropped are stupid, which was ridiculous. Keep that arrogant shit to yourself. Depay is a gret talent and he'll come  good. But the lad need to be dropped now. If Jajuzaj had got half the chances he has...

1833~~~
<a class="username" data-user="58565, @Varun" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/58565/">@Varun</a> 

He's not, but to steal a phrase from our manager, it's a process. Last week he contributed heavily with a lovely touch to almost score against Southampton. He was inches away from scoring against Villa earlier on in the season (which is another example of the movement he offers the team). And now he's scored today and should have scored another if not for a poor finish.

Depay is a goalscorer, and I think he gives Van Gaal, amongst others, some comfort in that he's going to hit the net quite regularly. It's why he's playing so much and it's why he's already seen more clear cut chances here at United than Young has in four years.

Ultimately, playing Young ahead of him reduces the likelihood of scoring goals.

1834~~~
Played much better today than normally, probably should have had 2 goals but at least he penetrated the defense more and wasn't always stuck in the left wing position.

1835~~~
There is no way Memphis should be dropped for Young (unless for rest). He needs all the support and patience from supporters to grow.

1836~~~
I think the argument is fairly stupid, yes, because playing Young ahead of Depay reduces the likelihood of the team scoring goals. And that's what it's all about in the end.

Young has been in good form relative to his abilities and limitations. His level of good isn't good enough as far as I'm concerned and I said as much last season.

I generally disagree with you on Depay regarding his league form. He's been nowhere near as poor as you, and others, are indicating. His movement is genuinely brilliant, and while not as obvious to the eye, has already helped the team so far this season.

One question, if we were to start Young out left regularly for the remainder of the season do you think he would get into double figures? I think he'd be lucky to hit five.

1837~~~
Jesus there's some amount of nonsense written at times.

He's a young wide attacker who plays in a style that's going to see risk taking. He's playing his first few games in a new league, known for being a tough environment for those kind of players to get used to.

He's bagged a few goals, assists and shown enough glimpses to see he's going to be a top player. He's learning in every game and will get better and better. Give the guy a chance and if you're really in doubt, try and get your hands on some games from Ronaldo's first season at the club, or some of Robben's early stuff.

1838~~~
This is absolute nonsense. Memphis is a very unpredictable player at the moment. He is still getting used to the league and it's pace. Ridiculous to say he should be dropped.

He had a lot of nice tricks and flicks which were fun to watch and although he is lacking the final ball at the moment, he is not playing badly. Just looks a bit lazy on the ball. He needs to play. Januzaj, has been given opportunists. You need to stop comparing. 

Memphis and Martial are learning to form an understanding with each other. No way in hell should he be dropped. Young is a very resource too come in the second half and shake things up like he did today.

1839~~~
I just think he'd do better against tired legs and tired minds and typically there's more space/ time towards the end of the match. Should lead to more confidence and hopefully he'd build on that and be able to dominate matches from the first minute.

1840~~~
In an attempt not to be compared to a certain mad winger I have avoided this thread for a while. I had hoped Memphis would've done better in his early time here, but he hasn't been great yet and only shown glimpses of what he can do. I still have no worries that he will turn out good though, at PSV he's also had alot of frustrating games where he would make the wrong decision more often than the right one. That has never stopped him before, he would still score in games he was completely useless otherwise as he doesn't give up easily and 1 moment is enough. Reading his body language (just because others do it aswell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>) is near impossible, he will be pissed off at every chance he fluffs and he rarely takes it too far that it affects his performances. He has done that a few times though (usually during a dry spell at PSV), hopefully his goal today will prevent that.

I think a reason why he's struggling is obviously the league and a new team which he needs to adapt to (being doubled up on aswell), but also his position oddly enough. Even though he played all his matches as LW at PSV, in his last year he would rarely stay there. Jetro Willems had a great understanding with him and has a perfect cross with both feet, he would at times play as LW when Memphis was roaming (which he was allowed to). PSV were also a team that are great on the counter with rapid players like Narsingh and Wijnaldum, Memphis wasn't the only fast player and neither was he the one to keep the width as Narsingh is a traditional winger. With Mata on the right Memphis has to play <i>a bit</i> more like a traditional winger (for the benefit of the team) and not roam everywhere he wishes like he could at PSV. He has to play a bit different than how he did last year and revert to his older days.

The years before the WC Memphis was extremely selfish and would <i>always</i> try to take his man on at LW, succesfull or not. In his last year he improved his overall game so much that he could do much more than that, he didn't rely on purely pace/trickery but also his passing and vision. He became a team player and when he didn't think he could beat what's in front of him/sees a teammate he would pass. I think his transformation into a complete player (he really changed alot in 1 year) makes him a much bigger talent but it probably also means his decision making (imo his only real weakness) will take longer to improve. He now needs to take that skillset and use it on the LW more than in central area's like he did at PSV. I have to say I am impressed with his defensive workrate so far, he rarely defended in his short carreer pre MUFC.

I'm sure he will do well in the future, but for now he still is frustrating.

1841~~~
You should have started with that. You don't rate Young and nothing will change your mind, not even actual performances on the pitch which so far in the league have been better than Depay.

For all your bigging up of Depay, all he has to show for it is 1 tap in.

1842~~~
You say it's nonsense and all you can come up with is how he lacks the final ball, is lazy and has flicks and tricks which are "fun to watch". Not nonsense after in that case. 

Januzaj never got such chances, nowhere near. In fact he only ever started more than 3 games on the trot once under Van Gaal which says a lot.

1843~~~
He's best suited to counter attacking football and we play the complete opposite. 

Scored his first league goal today which was a plus, fecked up a 1 on 1 chance and lost the ball a few times running at the entire team. He's been slow off the mark but I've faith he'll come good.

1844~~~
He will improve as he gets older and more experienced in the league. He's nailed down a starting role and he's making things happen despite not getting much space in a lot of our games. Unrealistic to expect a lot more at this stage really.

1845~~~
He will change my mind when he scores goals or even looks like he's capable of scoring goals every week.

Young hasn't performed better than Depay in the league either. The latter hasn't been great, but the signs are there, much of which I've already attempted to explain above. Seems we simply disagree.

I wouldn't even say I'm "bigging him up" too heavily either. I just think a lot of the talk in here the past couple of games has been markedly harsh and, at times, very short sighted.

1846~~~
he wasn't given far as much of chance as Depay, he started three games in a row as CAM, what are you actually talking about? 

Not that he's done anything special, was average tbh but Depay's been starter since the day one, didn't have to fight for his place at all whereas adnan played out of position every game.. he's long term CAM, but right now he would have benefited form playing out wide where he could gain more confidence.. he couldn't be possibly worse than Depay in last four games or so..

1847~~~
Didn't see the game but glad he got himself a goal in the league, he has made good progress so far and has scored 4 goals which is fantastic, the fact that he's found himself in so many situations where he could score is a testament to his work rate and positional game.

When he finds true form as martial has managed to do then he will be frightening to play against. Going to be a very good player.

1848~~~
He's going to have one of those seasons isn't he, now for the CL.

1849~~~
Reminds me of Ronaldo in his first couple of years with us. Bags of talent but a bit selfish and wanting to do all on his own which leads to inconsistency. Hope he is able to reach the same heights.

1850~~~
You're exaggerating things in a very negative way regarding Depay. I don't know if you're pissed that Adnan got loaned out or what your problem with Depay is, but he wasn't nearly as bad as you make him to be. 

And Adnan hasn't been anything special in a wing role under LVG so far either when he was given the chance there. They both still need plenty of development.

1851~~~
The thing that annoys me most is in his style of play - he very rarely wants to isolate his fullback down the wing. He almost always look to cut inside, or link with his fullback. With his speed and physicality I'd like to see him bulldoze fullbacks a little more; a little like how Valencia did at his best.

1852~~~
He's so much slower then I expected, and almost never beats a man. He also never seems in complete control of the ball when he's running. I'm incredibly underwhelmed so far tbh. 

There's been flashes of greatness, but for the most part he doesn't look <i>that </i>special. I think Young should be starting for now.

1853~~~
They're nothing alike. Ronaldo could beat a man an was well on his way to being one of the best in the world. He's been remarkably underwhelming. His movement is good for getting chances but his all round game is sorely lacking.

1854~~~
Is he? He looks incapable of beating a full back and hasn't showed much pace. His movement has been the standout.

1855~~~
Patience people, he'll come good. He needs to relax a bit and not try too hard. I am not worried about him at all, I do think he needs to be rotated with Young a bit more often though.

1856~~~
Biggest problem is that he has his head down most of the time, he isnt super quick just quick. I think he needs to play on the right as his crossing might be biggest asset, but you cannot drop mata. Young is better right now on the left. 
He reminds me of Nani more and more as he plays. The decision making, the losing the ball, i hope it changes, right now though looks very very poor.

1857~~~
He's not as quick as i thought he was.

Still not worried. Has showed plenty of moments of class.

1858~~~
It was another mixed game from him but I'm glad that he scored.  We should definitely split his playing time with Young to avoid burning him out.  I think he would be very useful in the later part of games when fatigue starts setting in.

1859~~~
Eh? He skinned the right back on the outside about 4 times the first half. People see what they want to see I guess.

1860~~~
When Memphis finally starts clicking on all cylinders is when we'll be able to challenge for all titles.  He's the final, missing piece to the puzzle.  He's got all the physical tools to succeed, just needs to sort out some of his decision-making.  Bit like Nani for me so far.  Funnily enough, thought that he'd be one of our transfers most ready to contribute straight away.  Mind you, still believe he'll come good.

1861~~~
I'd start Young over the October month especially in those tough away games..Memphis would start in Europe though..

1862~~~
His first couple of years Ronaldo was called out as a one trick pony. He could beat a man at times but would run into a cul-de-sac on many other occasions. He was very inconsistent as a result. It was only after the 2006 WC that he kicked on. There are a lot of similarities between Depay and Ronaldo in that regard.

1863~~~
I thought he played well today.

1864~~~
People on here are crazy. You all expect him to play like a 26 year old ronaldo in his first English season <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Yes his passing can be a little loose but he is always dangerous and keeps the defence on their toes. Him and martial are the future of our attack, the fact they keep the defence so busy is the reason Mata gets so much more room.

1865~~~
The talent and promise is undoubted. Consistency will come with maturity.

1866~~~
I think you might be onto something here because on the right he doesn't need to take the extra touch to turn inside and he is a good crosser like you said. Besides Mata is equally adept at doing his thing on the left too just as long as we don't use him like a winger. With Martial's tendency to drift left the balance of the attack will be maintained when Mata drifts into central areas. I think, for now, Young should be starting games and Memphis taken out of the firing line until he earns his spot back.

1867~~~
I've been saying, if Memphis had Mata's room, things would look completely different. Didn't we pair Memphis with Young in the PSV game? While the result was poor, Depay was brilliant and it's not that surprising given that the defense had two attacking wingers plus Martial to worry about.

1868~~~
To be honest, I think it's a bit weird that Depay is a first XI player already for Man United. Can you imagine him starting for Bayern, Real or Barca? In 2 years time, yes, but right now I don't feel he is good enough to be a regular starter.

1869~~~
Agreed, thought that was the best he's done in terms of beating his defender consistently. Lacked decisiveness with his end product - took too long to decide between shooting not passing and ended up wasting opportunities that he himself was mostly responsible for creating. Good instincts on his goal though

1870~~~
I don't think he's anything like a young Ronaldo. Ronaldo would beat his man for fun. The problem Ronaldo has was he'd rather do a stepover than a cross. 

Depay will get better though. He's young and needs time to adjust. Just look at Sterling at City. City fans are basically saying the same stuff. Very little end product or his shooting is poor.

1871~~~
And who else in our squad would start for these?

1872~~~
De Gea but I think that one speaks for itself. The rest won't either although I could have imagined Darmian being Dani Alves' replacement for Barca.

1873~~~
Lack of options would be the driving force there, Young is ok and a good back up option but he has his limitations, and to be fair Memphis has four goals already.

I do hope we don't over play him though if we can help it, but hard to see how we can avoid it.

1874~~~
You can't buy maturity, it will come in time but so far he's scoring in almost every competition. If Mata's crossing in the first half was just a bit more precise he would be closing on hat-trick today.

1875~~~
Right now we're not as good as Bayern, Real or Barca though.

1876~~~
Yes but that should be the standard for a club of United's size, do you agree?

1877~~~
Whilst i agree with what you're saying, he is starting for United, so he should be judged by the same standards as Rooney, Mata and Young. I'm not saying its fair, but time is one thing he doesn't really have.

1878~~~
Of course it is but you can't just get there overnight, it takes time.

Besides, as we've seen, signing ready made world class players doesn't provide any guarantees.

1879~~~
Letting Young play instead of Memphis won't get us there, though. Giving Memphis all this playing time, though, gives him a better chance of improving to that sort of level.

1880~~~
My theory is that he is still not used to the pace of this league. He looks far better in Europe where the game is a bit more tactical and slower.

1881~~~
Not playing that great but still providing a solid goal threat, which is exactly why we bought him.

Four by september means he should get well into double figures for the season. Young has managed five goals in his last three and a bit seasons.

1882~~~
He has played 7 games in the league. He has to get experienced in the league where defence is much better than the Dutch league. We all saw his quality vs brugge when he created chances out of nothing and even scored 2 beauties in the first leg. He has already scored 4 and assisted 3 in all competitions. Cut him some slack.

1883~~~
Tries to much.  Abililties in abundance but he has to pass the ball quicker

1884~~~
Fans here truly are unforgiving aren't they. We knew from the get go that he would be frustrating early on as all players in his mold are. He's show us moments of genuine quality and I'm happy with what he's produced so far. Can he improve? Absolutely but teams are afraid of him and his presence in the pitch opens space up for others. It'll come, he's got too much talent for it not to.

1885~~~
No pace? Wow. He's actually very fast.

He's like Nani. Frustrating but talented and productive. He's gonna get better.

1886~~~
He's just very sloppy on the ball sometimes, which is incredibly frustrating. Hopefully, he'll kick on after that goal.

1887~~~
Not nearly as talented as people make him out to be. His shooting, dribbling, passing and crossing have been miserable to watch so far. He of course has some talent, but he has yet to show anything of it against decent defences. Did well against Brugge but there was room for an elephant along the lines of that defence. I'm not saying he won't perform at some point, but his potential isn't that huge. The best players should play so I'd start Young ahead of him.

1888~~~
The likes of Muller or Alaba were once thrown into the cold water. Coman is currently getting plenty of playing time with Bayern and is starting games. Martial is doing very well for us so far. There's still no better way to improve than to be thrown into the cold water, especially if you have to improve your decision making. He will be shown plenty of tape of his performances and eventually he will click and perform better.

In 2009/10, Pedro was a regular for one of the best Barca sides ever and he was only 22 at the time and is by no means a more talented player than Depay.

1889~~~
And at the moment we are not Barca, Bayern or Real.

1890~~~
Patience, young ones. This is a player alright. Needs time.

1891~~~
Yep Depay should not be a starter but he is and that's not his fault but even when Nani first came there were glimpses that he could be a star. With Depay in the league he's looked out his depth imo. I think that will change but it strengthens the point he should not be a starter week in week out!

1892~~~
Whoa, do you all remember how frustrating Ronaldo was in that first season, with 4-5 stepovers followed by the wrong decision. This guy will come god and has to start games and giving him game time like SAF did with Ronaldo.

1893~~~
Also, which of our players aside from Shaw, Schweinsteiger, Smalling and De Gea get into those teams? Any?

1894~~~
I disagree massively with the pessimists here. He's going to get 10-15 goals in all competition in his first year on the team, age 21, playing out wide. There are very few player in a top league in Europe, in their prime, that can do that. Last year in the Prem, for example, only Sanchez, Hazard and Chadli got over 8 goals playing exclusively out wide. I think Memphis gets there this season.

We can certainly deal with the giveaways and such while he's developing, as he's still going to score about 10 more than Young would. And who knows, he might even develop quickly and start creating for others, scoring more or playing better overall football.

After Shaw (assuming he recovers), De Gea if he stays and Martial, he's our most valuable player going forward, and 2 of the names I just mentioned have questions marks now.

1895~~~
This. And his potential is obvious and immense, yeah he was a bit shit today, but I want to see Martial and Memphis every single time. As fans we've had to watch some dire stuff for a very good while now, having two huge attacking talents out there suddenly makes us very exciting and fun for me. I can feel sorry for Ashley who deserves to be on the pitch, but he can have the left back spot while we're waiting for Shaw, because Memphis has  to play.

1896~~~
I think hes a good player but he annoys me a lot, 
which i find a bit weird as i had endless patience for nani or ronaldo when he was younger and pretty inconsistent.

Sometimes he just looks kind of disinterested or something, I just want to slap him sometimes.
He really brings out my completely illogical fury.

1897~~~
Darmian, Carrick and at this rate probably martial. Carrick would be taking the absolute piss is most other leagues. The fact he's doing what he is at his age in the premier league is remarkable. Even scholes at Carricks age didn't do this.

1898~~~
Has massive potential but he was incredibly frustrating today, could not get him off the pitch quick enough.

1899~~~
Needs to lay off the weights, he's too stacked! It's affecting his mobility and agility.

1900~~~
Ok he wasn't great but he scored and was always a threat to the opposition. Gets criticised.

Rooney has been horrendous all season but the ball bounces off him into the net and he plays diagonal passes to Valencia for days. Gets praised.

Have faith in the lad and settle yourselves down will you?

1901~~~
Just no. I'd be surprised if he was even 80kg. His athleticism is impressive partly because of his weight training.

Memphis is fine. 4 goals and 4 assists in 10 games is good all things considered. Can he and will be do better? Of course. 

He should of either scored the second or squared it to Martial on the 2v1 situation.

1902~~~
Yeahh, some people need to let loose in this thread a bit. As much as I respect Young for turning his career around at United, his end product isn't better than Memphis' is. 

I hate to bring stats into this, but Memphis' goals and assists to the end of September is only 2 behind Young's for last season and this season combined. Yes, he is frustrating to watch most of the time, and he is still adapting to this league a lot. But through 3 or 4 poor decisions, he makes one and it can change the game completely.

The lad is only 21 for fecks sake, and one major reason he is getting a lot of shit is because he is being outshone by a 19 year old new signing, who has fitted in seamlessly. This guy is our future on the left, not Young; so why drop someone after he's got his first premier league goal, only to most likely make him start in 2/3 games when Young either gets swapped back or has to play in another position?

1903~~~
A little wasteful at times, but he's got goals in him. Very happy so far.

1904~~~
Really? By skinned do you mean got a couple of yards away from him before running back into traffic? People really do see what they want to see.

1905~~~
It's a team game and we currently look a better team with Young in it.

1906~~~
Ronaldo at 18 was better than Depay is now. He was constantly taking on his full back. Something Depay doesn't do anywhere near enough.

1907~~~
Had 2 players stuck on him all game, people see what they want to see.

1908~~~
Ronaldo was 18. And they aren't the same player so the comparison is pointless.

1909~~~
Right. What's that got to do with what he actually did? The only goal created down our left flank was by Ashley Young beating a full back and actually getting a cross in. Not something Depay has done much of.

1910~~~
4 goals and 4 assists in 10 games, is that right? That strikes me as a very good start, and that's ignoring the moments of wonderful quality that he shows every match.

Consistency will come as he settles in. For a youngster new to the club and the league, he's well on track.

1911~~~
Delighted for him that he scored today! He really needed that goal in the league and I hope he'll kick on now. 

He's one of those players where he'll take a lot of flak from fans. He tries things and at times it doesn't come off. But he seems to dust himself off and go right back at it. You have to love that kind of player. It's much the same as Ronaldo and that will help him in the long run. 

Memphis will get better as the season goes on and he'll benefit from the introduction of Martial too. Between the two they seem to have the makings of a promising partnership and martial will create space for Memphis to go at people more.

1912~~~
No he wasn't, it was only towards the end of his second season here where he really kicked on. Besides, Ronaldo is Ronaldo and not a fair marker to anyone. Depay has played 10 games in a new league, it's incredibly hard to judge exactly how good he is right now.

1913~~~
No he was not. Ronaldo at 18 was a very infuriating and inconsistent player. He was a one trick pony and although he beat his man many times, he did not have much end product. Not to mention that he didn't have two player glued to him all game and he was not first choice winger for us.

Don't let Ronaldo's current standards confuse you with what he was at 18.

1914~~~
Darmian definitely isn't better than any Alaba, Lahm, Carvajal, Marcelo, Alba or Alves. Those are all excellent fullbacks.

Carrick is still quite a player but just not as good as Kroos or Busquets at this point. Carrick vs Alonso is a tougher one, admittedly, but I suspect Guardiola would prefer Alonso (picked him over playing Schweinsteiger in that role and using another CM) and that's not even considering Javi Martinez.

Martial over Lewandowski, Benzema or Suarez? I doubt it, although if he's a proper phenom I guess he could be cited as being ahead of Benzema. 

In terms of our players good enough to basically walk into any team in the world I really do think it's just De Gea, Schweinsteiger, Smalling and Shaw. Hopefully Martial and Memphis join them soon. At their age, it's okay if it takes a couple years.

1915~~~
Going to be patient with him. He is showing good signs, whether he ends up close to Nani or CR7 is his choice and how he develops. Signs are there that he is going to be great. Not helping him with teams doubling up on him. He needs to release the ball quickly to release that pressure from him.

1916~~~
We give him time.  I forgive his shortcomings.  But calling it as it is isnt condemnation.  He just have to acknowledge the critics and built on ala ronaldo. 

You keep it simple and take your chance when they least expected.  With memphis it's almost like he needs to dribble inside 9 out of 10. His selfishness (if i can call it so)  makes him very predictable and will become his weakness in a way defenders are prepared for it. He needs to mix things up to get the most out of his explosiveness. 

And things he did will fail most of the time,  doing it every matches will have a side effect of attracting monkeys on his back pretty fast.

1917~~~
Wonder if he would have been subbed at half time were it not for the goal. Seemed to be in the cards for him - lots of good runs ending in poor decisions leading to ball loss. Won't do his confidence any harm though today's game that's for sure. Hope he does look back at games and notice he is really a head picked up here and there to making a lot bigger impact on games.

1918~~~
I would rather see Ashley Young in his position. His general play is pretty awful and he loses the ball far far too much. Someone posted 26 times in one match for Holland recently. It is only his Dutch privilege keeping him in the the team at the moment IMO.

1919~~~
You have just named 4 of our players that would and arguably Darmain or another midfielder. So that's half the team! But yep they have more established blue chip players than us if that's what you are meaning and they are attackers where our attack has potential but not the game changers in. (Lewandoski/Robben/Ribbery/Muller)

1920~~~
I would play him over Ashley Young every day of the week.

1921~~~
Ronaldo started several matches at 18, he was explosive with brilliant technique. Not only his one-on-ones, but also his crossing was way above that of Depay. Depay doesn't often have two men glued into him, his touch often let's him down which makes it seem like he doesn't have space. And his decisive passing has been dreadful.

1922~~~
Excellent manipulation, well done. 

You said "we struggle to create many openings". I agree with that but shouldn't we chose those players who are more likely to create? In that case Young is miles ahead of Memphis. 
We can also play with 2 sitting midfielders and 4 strikers like we did yesterday but I doubt that will be enough for teams better than Sunderland, which is vast majority of this league.

1923~~~
Ronaldo was very very wasteful earlier. His crossing was decent to good but nowhere near Beckham standards while his shooting was wayward. Ronaldo had pace to burn without a doubt and he would beat his man but he would run up blind alleys many times and do those little step overs but he was nowhere near the levels he started showing post-2006 WC. 

And that is my point about Depay. I think Depay has a lot of potential, it is just his desire to do everything on his own which sometimes lets him down, similar to how Ronaldo was earlier. As for the defenders on him, you will see many times there are two players covering him whenever he gets the ball.

1924~~~
I think the worst moment in the match was his free kick. It was the poorest i have seen in a long time, he came with a reputation of good free kick taker. It was horrible.

1925~~~
He can be frustrating but honestly it's just a matter of tuning himself up to the same wavelength of his teammates. He's young and he'll get much better. To criticize him now doesn't mean he isn't considered a great talent.

1926~~~
The WC 06 was indeed the event that completely changed Ronaldo. I think he got from the away crowd (+ plus the protection and love from the home crowd/SAF/his teammates) transformed him mentally.

1927~~~
I agree he is a bit indecisive and lacks composure. But he has 10 times the talent that Young has and is more likely to win you a game. Not a finished product obviously.

1928~~~
People want him benched already?! Jesus guys.

1929~~~
How is it short sighted? I don't think you know what that means.

No one's saying we should sell him or that he should never ever start a league game again. He's being called out for being poor in the league, which he undoubtedly has been.

Not sure why people keep bringing up Ronaldo and Nani. Aside from the fact that both looked a lot more polished in their debut seasons both of them started less than half our games in their first season. Depay is on track to start over 30 games at the current rate despite doing very little when he actually plays. If for nothing else he needs to be dropped to give him some 'rest'.

1930~~~
He is frustrating but you understand why he plays ahead of Young. He is far more likely to score or create a goal than Young is, Young manages to look good, beating his fullback for fun but with very little end product whilst Mempis is still settling in but making poor decisions at crucial moments in the attack we have to bear with him because the benefits that will accrue if he turns it around are immense.

1931~~~
I am really not a <i>fan </i>of him so far, but we get carried away here. This guy is still very, very young, it's his first season away from home, his first season in the premier league and his stats are not bad at all. 4 goals, 4 assists. That's totally o.k., isn't it. Yes, he is this kind of player who can be frustrating to watch, but he will decide matches and he will get better and better - specially when he feels the support of the club and the fans.

I have a good feeling when it comes to his future.

1932~~~
At the moment I rate Pereira higher than Depay and since people really don't want Young to start games for whatever reason (which is unfair and he's the victim of this situation) then van Gaal should give Andreas at least a couple of games to see what he can do.

I must be watching some other games because I don't see him as a player "likely to create" at all, certainly no more than Young. And that's even if I ignore how selfish he is. He's more likely to get at the end of a cross in the box as he is more of a striker, while Young is our only winger.

1933~~~
Haven't watched the game back or highlights yet and don't know if it was picked up on TV but after he scored the first goal and everone was going back for kick-off he turned around to their keeper and gave him a little wave for all the time wasting, was funny, got a big cheer from the crowd.

1934~~~
We need him to step it up if we're going to win the league, I feel. Here's hoping he and Van Gaal work out how to improve his performances, which has so far been frustrating.

1935~~~
We aren't going to play the Brugges anymore.

He should and need to be dropped for the sake of the team and it will only make him to work harder instead of thinking he's already undroppable when his performance is nowhere near guarantee that.

If he's not Dutch and came from the academy instead of bought he would have already been dropped after the first 3-4 league games.

1936~~~
I fully agree. People really overrate his likeliness to create. He had one good game against Brugge (and their terrible defence) where he looked dangerous. Other than that, he's been really wasteful.

His dribbling has been quite awful to watch as I think several fullbacks have completely dominated him. Best players should start and he currently isn't good enough to warrant an automatic starting position. Should at least start some PL matches from the bench.

1937~~~
How can a player settle and improve if he isn't given the playing time? Why are fans so impatient when it comes to young talent, out of any team in the league you'd think we would understand it more than anybody. How can some fans not see the talent that this boy processes?
People need to start supporting the team.

1938~~~
You only see two colours - it's always black or white for you, there's nothing in between. 
Some of you need to understand that we have enough games to play Young (who has not reached 200 mins in the league), Depay and even Pereira. But so far it seems Memphis is automatic starter although he's been producing very poor performances (in the EPL). He's been good in Europe and that's where he should be starting. 

Nobody's saying he should be playing in the reserves, but playing him every game in current form makes more harm than good for both team and player. 

You're right, we need to support the team, but right now reading the caf it's more about Memphis getting the stats than team playing good football. Boy needs a rest and he needs to be taken out of the spotlight. Too much pressure on him.

1939~~~
What <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
The boy needs games to gel with the team, he hasn't even been that bad but right on cue the caf turns overly critical. As for saying its all black and white with me, I have no idea where you got that from but carry on.

1940~~~
<img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

1941~~~
And your point is...? Hopefully not another along the line of "the manager always right".

1942~~~
My point is your constant belly-aching about alleged bias against academy players is tedious. Any idiot can see that Memphis has far more potential than academy players who play the same position so sticking with him is common sense, not bias. He's got a decent return already too and he'll only get better from here.

1943~~~
Goals against bad teams can still be important. His brace in the first leg against Brugge made our qualification considerably easier than if we had travelled their after a 1-1 draw at home. Sunderland are also a bad team but yesterday we were struggling to open them up and it looked like we would be heading into HT level until he scored. 

I see no reason to drop him. His goal threat is too important and his overall performances are only average, not poor. His cafe rating is 6.2 while Young is on 5.9. People are saying things like he loses the ball to much and doesn't beat his man but according to squawka his pass accuracy is 82% and his successful dribbles are 1.84 per 90 minutes, Young is worse on both counts with 80% passing accuracy and hasn't yet successfully take-on anyone. Pereira is only other option for that position and while I would like to see more of him it should be coming off the bench, not throw straight into the team.

1944~~~
Let's not get all hasty here. Supporting the team is too mainstream now, criticising a youngster(who's actually got a pretty decent return all things considered) is the right thing to do. He's already got 4 goals which is already more than what Young got last season and what Nani got in his first season. He's a goal threat and consistently works hard for the team. Add to that four assists(or three if you don't count Mata's goal as his assist) and that makes it an excellent contribution for a 21yr old settling in a new country with a new team. 

It's all irritating to see his goals against Brugge being discounted for. We were actually in a tight spot in that home leg and he carried us in the home leg.

1945~~~
Not to mention PSV. He was our only player that kept trying.

1946~~~
He and Martial actually. Young and Mata were quite poor that night. 

4 goals and 4 assists in his first 10 starts and yet people want him dropped. Jesus.

1947~~~
Knee jerk reactions as usual around here. He's young. He needs time on the pitch to improve. We will reap the rewards of giving him that time. Have some faith.

1948~~~
People want Memphis dropped for Young?

That moment against Southampton that setup Mata's crucial goal is the reason why Memphis starts. No one else in the squad can do something like that, maybe bar Martial.

I actually think Memphis and Martial are the main reasons we are on currently top of the league. They are players that defenders hate coming up against. They strike fear into the opponents, make fans stand up and take notice when their on the ball. We've badly missed players like this.

He may not produce every time he drives at defences, but he is one of the every few players in the team that actually has the confidence to take on his defender, which is such an important part of creating chances.

1949~~~
Looking for a thread where I can lose all sense of perspective for a while. Been days since the last one. Could this be the place? No sense of context? Check. Futile comparisons with the past? Check. Wonky reasoning? Check.

 I've found my thread!

1950~~~
Indeed.

1951~~~
Every time I see a bad cross or something, I just think back to the countless balls Ronaldo put into the crowd.

1952~~~
Nowt wrong with his output but he gives the ball away far too much and fails to deliver as wide player. Whilst Young might not match Depay's goal output, personally I believe that the team would score more with Young on the wing.

1953~~~
Common sense?I don't see any common sense of how he should start <i>every game</i> over Young or Pereira.I do agree that he should get most of the time on the pitch out of these players due to his potential but it's a big difference from him being undropable.Pereira has potential as well, does it mean that he should be anywhere near starting regularly for us at this point?

Decent return?Rooney did score 3 against Brugge as well.The last goal was a tap-in.He has been very wasteful and ineffective in games how about that?

As my previous post stated I think it will be more beneficial for him to sit out 1-2 matches and see how can he improve.

1954~~~
I'm more than happy with him. Progressing nicely. Not fully up to speed yet his contribution is already great.

1955~~~
Ronaldo took the best part of three seasons before he started putting any sort of consistency into his game. The 2003-4 and 2004-5 seasons were largely forgettable seasons minus a few good performances here and there. And he had a shocker of a first half of the 2005-6 season. It was only around February of that year that Ronaldo brought in the consistency to his game. And he was around the same age Depay is now with two and a half years of adaptation to the league and the club when that had happened. 

Bear that in mind the next time you want to compare Depay to Ronaldo. He'll come good, I'm absolutely sure of it. He has to get used to his teammates and build up a chemistry with them. You can see so many hints of what he's trying to do but his teammates haven't cottoned on to it (like his flicked passes into space or backheels). Shaw's injury hasn't helped also as he won't get the same level of support from Young or Darmian and needs to build up a new chemistry with whoever gets the nod for the medium term until Shaw comes back fit. It'll be patchy for a little while but I think by the second half of this season we'll see a more mature Depay.

1956~~~
That is a fair opinion but then Young takes a lot of flak here for not having a great end product.

1957~~~
I'm not sure why some people's expectations were that he'd blitz the league in the first couple of months?

4 goals and 4 assists including crucial CL qualifying performances and he's not even up to speed yet. He's playing well.

1958~~~
Pretty much what <a class="username" data-user="87922, @vi1lain" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87922/">@vi1lain</a> says. I think many expected big things from him, instantly, but you have to remember he tore a relatively poor Dutch league apart. 

If you tone down your expectations to those of a 21 year old, then he's been ok, not great but not that bad. At times, he's been very frustrating to watch but you always have a sense of expectation and excitement when he gets on the ball. I wouldn't be averse to seeing him rotating more with Young, as a break could be very useful for him.

1959~~~
My only disappointment with Memphis is that I feel Nani would have offered us much the same, perhaps with a higher output.

Regarding Memphis, he needs time to develop - that is fine, although I think perhaps we shouldnt be afraid to rotate him a bit from time to time, although we dont really have many good other options since we sold ADM and loaned out Januzaj.

1960~~~
I think he still needs to tune in into the PL, he has to do everything he used to do at a higher pace. He can't trust his moves and touches to work here to, that's unsettling his game and affects his general form and his crosses and free kicks to.

1961~~~
I think people are confusing him with the Ronaldo Comparison, he doesn't look super fast first of all, and secondly Ronaldo used to beat his man at will, his problem was over doing it, he used to go past a player then cut back and would try to beat him again, it became very annoying and infuriating, and Ronaldo looked destined to be a top player, his basics were top notch, with depay however his touch and vision has been very poor, he doesn't get his head up at all, one thing i will give it to him his finishing looks class, but overall he has been very underwhelming, he looks like he will be more Nani than Ronaldo.

1962~~~
Nice to see him get his first Premier League goal (although he should've scored that other chance he had), lets hope this is the first of many for him. He's starting to look a bit more settled in English football.

1963~~~
I'm a fan. But really disappointed with his 1v1

1964~~~
It's shortsighted because his regular game time seems to be part of a longer term plan to build playing relationships between Van Gaal's ideal front four. Plus, it's further evidence of a general lack of patience on the part of football supporters (not necessarily you, in fairness).

If Depay wasn't contributing then perhaps dropping him would make more sense, but while he continues to directly influence the scoreline then it's understandable that the manager is pleased with him and therefore he gets to stay in the side.

1965~~~
He's playing exactly how I expect him to play for now. He's hesistant & indecisive which leads to undercooked passes or giving the ball away cheaply, it's frustrating to watch now, but we paid for potential, people should never forget that. I think he'll take his time to get a grip of things & he'll then kick on from there, right now, he's not the one to "carry" the team, but he'll contribute for sure.

1966~~~
Yeah, that's what has disappointed me the most, tbh. I see people comparing  him to Nani, but he's twice the dribbler Depay is, in my opinion. Memphis does seem to be stronger mentally, and more of a goalscorer though. He's more like Ronaldo than Nani, despite being more similar in stature to the latter.

1967~~~
Bit better yesterday. Glad he got his goal. Still would like to see him go at players more, though. I mean, Young was only on for about 10 minutes, and he created an assist by taking on the full back. Having said that, like I've said before, it's becoming more and more apparent that Memphis is more of a winger that wants to get on the end of things and score goals, rather than dribbling with it.

1968~~~
He dribbles the ball too close to opposition players. I reckon he needs to get his head up more often and make better use of his body to shield the ball. I've barely seen him make use of his strength on the ball since he joined us. It's weird to see such a hench guy not use his physical assets better. He falls over far too much.

1969~~~
He was up and down yesterday and should have buried that chance for a second, but he was good and will only get better. 

The negativity towards him on here is incredible, and those suggesting Young is better than him is just as strange. Young is a solid squad player who will put a good shift in 9/10 times, but Memphis is much more productive and his ceiling for developing into a top player is very high. Memphis should be starting on the left whenever possible.

1970~~~
I'm not confused at all thank you. What's Depay if not inconsistent and infuriating?

1971~~~
He's got no assists in 7 games in the league. He's got three assists I can remember. They were against Bruges and Ipswich.

1972~~~
He got an assist vs Southampton.

1973~~~
Defenders always seem to get the ball of him in those situations.

1974~~~
The guy is obviously more dangerous and productive than Young, even if he isn't quite as reliable in keeping the ball. I'm not sure why people are trying to contest that. Weren't we all complaining that we were "too safe" on the ball a few weeks ago? This is what taking risks can look like, especially with young players.

1975~~~
Hitting the post isn't an assist.

1976~~~
It's officially counted as an assist. He still created the goal.

1977~~~
It's not on whoscored. Crediting somebody for doing something he never tried to do is silly. He shot and missed.

1978~~~
It's on the PL website and transfermarkt.

He still made the run and forced the chance.

1979~~~
Seems to be lacking confidence a bit and isn't thinking decisively, as a result.

He should improve. Talent seems very obvious. Just needs it to click for us.

1980~~~
I think di Maria got credited for 3 assist that were all deflected shots.

1981~~~
And that's silly too. It's the kind of stretching to justify performances that people used to do for Kagawa and it's an example of why stats can be misleading. I watch him and I don't see a creative player at all. I see a goal scorer albeit one that isn't a great finisher yet. His movement to get opportunities has been great at times and it's what's stood out. What's also stood out is very poor decision making, playing with his head down and seemingly incapable of getting away from a full back. He slows our play down more than Mata does.

1982~~~
Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to defend him. I'm still very much of the opinion that we need someone like Reus or Griezmann who can beat a man with pace and skill which is still very much something that is missing from our roster at this time.

I also feel people on here expected too much from him and the young Ronaldo comparisons really didn't do him any favor in that regard. He is still very raw and maybe like you said much more of a striker than really a creative winger.

After the Carling Cup game I actually wanted Perreira to get a start in the league for us against Sunderland as I felt he was offering more of the aspects we were missing than Memphis does atm and I feel a bit of rotation would do Memphis good as well.

1983~~~
Yes he is inconsistent and that is why I compared him to the Ronaldo of 19-20 when he had bags of potential but his decision making let him down at times. That is why I said I see similar ability in Depay but his inconsistency will improve with time.

1984~~~
Excited to see how Memphis and Martial develop. Both players excite me and I think we've got a good future in both of them.

1985~~~
But Depay isn't that age and Ronaldo was better. If you want to compare them it should be done at the same age. Though comparing them is going to end in disappointment.

1986~~~
Not too down on him, although I would not be opposed to Young starting for him for a couple of games. 

I admit though I was extremely frustrated he didn't score or even get that ball back to Martial.

1987~~~
The Nani comparisons are just incredibly lazy imo. He's nothing like Nani, who was a genuinely fantastic dribbler, with a great long shot and crossing ability. Memphis hasn't shown any of that...yet.

1988~~~
He produced an extremely good run and shot, beating the keeper, and as a result Mata was able to score. He may not have meant to set Mata up but him being good at football set up Mata's goal.

Besides, it's not really about whether you value certain types of assist or not. The vast majority of stats sources consider that an assist, so it is one. If you think that's wrong, then disregard assists as a way of evaluating a player.

So it is indeed 4 and 4. Or was. Now it's 5 and 4.

1989~~~
I think it is just comparing inconsistency rather than any specific trait.

1990~~~
He did and it was a great piece of play. It's not really an example of him being creative. Where's the 5 come from?

1991~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3250868/Memphis-Depay-celebrates-Manchester-United-success-Chris-Brown-s-ex-Karrueche-Tran.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...-success-Chris-Brown-s-ex-Karrueche-Tran.html</a>

Hmmmm... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1992~~~
He usually plays too relaxed or with very little intensity. Something Rooney does too nowadays actually.

1993~~~
God it really doesn't take people long to turn on players, no such thing as patience in the modern game. He's been solid if not spectacular but you'd be mad not to think he will come good.

1994~~~
I really like him, seems to have a great attitude and all the tools to be a top player for us, yes he's a bit inconsistent at times but that's totally understandable, it's easy to forget he has already scored four times for us, and some crackers in there too.

Give me him over our last number 7 that's for sure!

1995~~~
Why so many negative comments?

I think he's been good. He's scored and/or assisted in pretty much every match.

1996~~~
He will be fine. 
We do have short term memories here. Ronaldo had a bedding in period at the start of his career here and people were giving him stick. I'm sure that Memphis has the attitude and desire to get better and achieve his potential. Just imagine what a difference it will make when he steps up a level and links up with martial. I could see it being reminiscent of Ronaldo/Rooney in the 2006/07 season.

Let's just hope januzaj improves in Dortmund and comes back a more complete player. 
A front 4 of Memphis, Januzaj, Pereira and Martial is quite exciting if you ask me!

1997~~~
Because it was 4 goals and 4 assists and then he scored against Sunderland? Or was the 4 and 4 from after that game? I've been working late a few nights in a row at work so I keep replying to everything a day late, possibly I've got confused there.

1998~~~
Exactly. And produced some wonderful moments too.

1999~~~
Sort of agree. I do think he's shown potential when it comes to long shots and crossing (that cross to Fellaini vs. Brugge springs to mind, and his corners are pretty good, when we're not playing them short, that is), whereas he hasn't really shown that much when it comes to dribbling. But yes, early days.

2000~~~
Yes he has. He's scored a superb goal from range against Brugges and great feet to beat his man on numerous occasions, most recently when he hit the post in that 45 pass goal. He also hit a great cross for that last minute winner by Fellaini. 

He's been very inconsistent and only occasionally played with confidence but all the elements are there. He just needs to put them together.

2001~~~
This guy definitely needs to show hunger on a continuous basis. His confidence levels seem to flip flop too much for my liking.

2002~~~
First 6 games in a new tougher league, not suprising he has looked so much better playing in the UCL.
Anyway he still produces the odd moment, he'll come good. Sanchez last season has a poor start to the season and ended up being on of the best players in the league. Di Maria last year started off like a house on fire and then didn't see the light of day after xmas.

His talent is there, don't have any issues with Memphis, just needs some time.

2003~~~
He seems to me like somebody who's used to being the cleverest player on the pitch. But none of his tricks are working in England because the defenders are too canny to fall for them. He either needs to try something new or take the simpler option more often.

It also has to be said that he's been double marked in almost every game so far. I went back to re-watch the Sunderland game and difference between the space he got and how much Young was afforded was stark. It's good that he's drawing attention away from his teammates, but if doesn't use the ball better it counts for nought.

2004~~~
Teams are parking the bus against United so it was always going to be harder for Memphis against 2 or 3 defenders at a time. He also needs time to adjust to the league, but also needs to learn to make the right decision as his play is too individual sometimes. There were times in the Sunderland game where he beat his man and then wanted to beat 1 or 2 more players instead of looking for the pass right away, which led him nowhere and the ball was lost. 

He's not as invincible with the ball at his feet as other players, so he should improve his decision making faster and play smarter so he could be more effective in the domestic league. I'm sure he'll become a great player for us, though. The talent is there and he's making an impact right away despite some annoying performances, which were always going to happen for a player arriving in a new league. People should know better than to expect some phenomenal consistency from a 21 year old player and it's been said by Van Gaal multiple times - we need to give him some time to show what's he's truly capable of. 

4 goals and 4 assists so far is a great return and long may it continue. His play in our third goal vs Southampton showed exactly why he's starting for us.

2005~~~
I guess the performances of Martial put some additional pressure on him. No one would expect a 21 years old player from a weaker league to come to United and immediately set the world on fire.
However, Martial did exactly that and is even younger.

I do not worry too much as Memphis clearly has the attributes.

2006~~~
He has four assists <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2007~~~
He hasn't shown anything close to Nani's dribbling ability. For all of Nani's faults (and there were plenty!) his dribbling ability was always absolutely first class. He could consistently beat players for fun, something Memphis been able to do at all, bar the odd trick here and there.

2008~~~
I actually think Marital's arrival and performances have taken a lot of the attention off him. Everyone is raving about Martial and similarly a lot of expectation to be the breakout young player for the season has transferred onto Martial from him.

Will it help him? I dunno, maybe he's someone who thrives when all the attention is on him but getting the limelight taken off him now could also help him settle into the team without fans expecting him to dribble past every defender in the league and play like CR7. He's probably a little behind when Ronaldo was at 21, but he's not too far off. Needs to get used to being marked by 2 players every match

2009~~~
Memphis just isn't that type of player.He can pull out tricks here and there but he's not the type of dribbler that can beat players for fun.

2010~~~
Which was exactly my original point, him and Nani aren't similar players. And any comparisons between the two are just lazy. As lazy as the the Nani/Ronaldo comparisons were.

2011~~~
The problem with the Ronaldo/Nani comparisons is the supporting cast that each were put into. This team is still getting their chops down, the ones they were being worked into were established and everyone's roles were clear. You can argue the strengths of these teams/supporting casts but I don't think you can argue that the stability of the SAF teams at that point are well ahead of the team we have now. 

The philosophy is starting to sink in but we are still working several new players into the squad and to point at any one individual, or to say that one switch will fix things I think is a bit naive, not to mention unfair to the one in your sights. I see no benefit at this point in time in putting him on the bench and starting AY, these guys need time together. There were a few times that Mata or Martial came over to the left side and I swear they were all standing there with that "ok, I am here, now what?" look on their face. Once they have all been playing together for a while, and know what the other guys is going to do <span style="text-decoration: underline">instinctively</span>, then we will start to see the potential start to shine through. The players are all thinking too much (cept DDG) but we are getting closer to the point were you are seeing things click here and there. And, we are top of the league while this is going on, not to shabby of a place to be while working out the kinks.

Bottom line, I just think we should give him at least another 11 games before we DiMaria him.

2012~~~
So, for a second season in a row people on here are wanting a very talented expensive summer signing, who's putting up good numbers, to be benched for Ashley Young?

What?

Memphis needs game time. Putting him in and out of the side won't do any good. With him and Mata either side of Martial we possess serious goal threat.

2013~~~
A lot of posters on here banging on about his lack of consistency is very harsh. He's 21 ffs.

2014~~~
I reckon most people are happy with him so far, it's just that the ones who aren't are more noticeable. I'd be interested to see a poll to that effect.

Honestly just seems like he's pressing to do too much at times in addition to trying to do it as fast as possible.  Just needs to slow down and calm himself and the performances will improve.  He's been okay just not great and that's understandable for a player moving to a new league.  

Even then 4 goals and 4 assists in all competitions is a nice return with the added benefit that he seems to be improving his work rate defensively and generally seems to give a shit which wasn't the case with Di Maria.

2016~~~
Give Memphis half or a full season to adjust himself to the pace, intensity, strength and style of the league.

I remember Arsenal's signings like Bergkamp, Henry and Pires really struggled in their first year. And they were like 22-26 years old when they signed from Serie A, French Ligue. 

Seriously feel we will see the best of him in a years time or so. In the mean time, we should expect him to be a it frustrating and make wrong decisions. Its all part of the learning curve. We can learn from Wenger in the sense he gave his foreign contingent at least 1-2 years to adapt before making another signing.

Will be the same for Memphis.

Even Blind has looked so much better with us this year compared to last year.

2017~~~
Nice post.

2018~~~
This forum is puzzling at times. Half the people on here spent the best part of the last year spewing bullcrap about how we've lost our identity and don't invest in young players anymore. 

Now we've signed one of Europe's best young talents, who is already producing a decent assists/goals return, and he's been given up on.

I know LVG with stick with him, and once he develops properly, we will have quite a player on our hands.

2019~~~
Probably will become good but still shouldn't wear fake gold teeth.

2020~~~
I understand the calls to give him time. But he has flattered to deceive in the league. Being "happy" at his overall outings on the wing is selling his presumed talent short.

2021~~~
Feck me, the negativity towards Memphis is strong.

And we are a club that prides itself on giving youth a chance...

2022~~~
As a defender who would you dread coming up against more, Young or Depay? Exactly.

2023~~~
I don't think anybody is giving up on him or being negative, really. At worst, there are posts trying to diagnose where he's struggling and attempting to come up with possible solutions that may help him.

2024~~~
That question isn't as rhetorical as you seem to be implying.

2025~~~
What is his goal/assist return so far? I'm sure it's nothing to complain about

2026~~~
I think if you asked 100 defenders this question it would be incredibly one sided.

2027~~~
I dont know why any criticism towards him is being met with stuff like "negativity", "he is just a kid" arguments.
If he is a kid and is trying to do too much, thus missing simple things, then it needs to be pointed out and I am sure the coach or his staff will tell him to calm down and how to do things right.
If his FK abilities or crossing abilities are average or below, then the staff will be telling him what to do right.

Saying people are negative because they criticize I think beats the purpose of having a thread on performances.
Unless of course one is saying Memphis is crap (which he is not) and needs to be sold asap (which is mental) is taking an extreme view.

2028~~~
Let's just ignore his excellent performances in the champions league and his very important contribution so far and say he's average.<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4 assists 4 goals so far and he's average. He's already scored and assisted more than some of the best players in the league. How daft can you be?

4 and 4 in 11 appearances.

2029~~~
I think some expected a Hazard like debut in the EPL or something like that. Give him some time and he'll come good. I think he knows that he can do much better and will do his best to improve.

2030~~~
Obviously, stats can be misleading, so we shouldn't decide he's been playing well just because of those 4 and 4. What encourages me, though, has been the quality of the goals and the glimpses of real quality we've seen when scoring/creating those goals. Something else worth considering is that he's been getting stick for his poor finishing (which is fair) but he'd be comfortably our top scorer if he'd taken the relatively easy chances he's missed. He has a nack for getting into goal-scoring positions, which is a very good thing and will mean he gets more and more prolific as he settles, grows in confidence and starts to slot a higher % of his opportunities (which is inevitable, really)

2031~~~
I have no concerns at all personally. We have got a real top talent on our hands I'm convinced. Everytime I watch us I can't help imagine our attack if we didn't add Martial. We'd be really, really ordinary.

2032~~~
His stats in the league are poor. He has 1 goal and 1 assist in 7 games. I'm all for giving him time, but people really should remember that the Brugge matches are boosting his stats a lot.

2033~~~
This place...posts of some...amount negativity vs young player coming from Dutch league in his first PL season,some say how fans know their football,nope,they just want more instant things and being thicker then ever,if we dont win a thing for few years,i fear some might not be able to take it.

2034~~~
And the match against Ipswich. And the game against PSV.

Basically, he's scored and created goals in every competition he's played in and this is being used as evidence against him. Hmmmm...

2035~~~
Gold teeth aren't always fake?

2036~~~
Exactly half of his goals and assists came against Brugge, if that's the sort of stat that impresses you - go crazy. To big his stats up for scoring and assisting against Ipswich and Brugge is crazy, and to suggest it's bad to rationalise the situation regarding his stats is even more baffling.

2037~~~
He'll come good. The fact that he's shown he's capable of performing in the CL and CC (to some extent) illustrates his potential. It also highlights his struggles to cope and adjust to the pace of the league. At times, you get the feeling he's playing in slow motion, however, with time and experience this guy will turn into the beast we expect him to be.

Exciting times ahead.

2038~~~
No problem with him. He's shown he can be effective. If the the goals and assists keep creeping up, then he'll have had a fairly good first season. He strikes the ball very well so he's just got to start taking more care with that final ball.

2039~~~
Memphis thread so far:
-he’s been very good in Europe, but he’s clearly struggling in the league. Maybe we should use him as a sub and rotate with Young or Pereira? His stats in the league are not impressive either.
-ffs, give him time, he’s young, and he’s not been bad in the EPL he still has 4 goals and 4 assisits <b>in all competition</b>*!

*my favourite argument, people overlook the fact that he got half of those numbers in CL qualification games, just to prove he isn’t that bad in the league.

Very low level of discussion in this thread. You can’t criticize him at all because a bunch of people will jump on you for being negative.

This.

2040~~~
Yeah I just read back to see where all the criticisms were that sparked so much defensiveness, there doesn't seem to be any so I'm confused. 

Young player is inconsistent shocker.

2041~~~
I have no problem with his output. I think his passing and dribbling are what need more work.

2042~~~
Memphis is struggling "in the league" with Young outperforming him in couple of occasions. Probably due to being young, adapting to new league, Mata being crap thus putting multiple defenders on Memphis.

Now, what should we do? 

 - Give him start after start after start, regardless of whether he plays excellent or average. Coz hey!! If you dont play him, he ll never improve.

 - Give others (Young or Pereira) starts and put Memphis on subs

Which side will you choose?

2043~~~
A bit of both?
Sub him after 60 mins if hes having a particularly poor day.
He pisses me off but i'd still want him on the pitch more often than not.
Harsh on young but ... long term i think its in our interest.

2044~~~
Yup, goals in the champions league don't matter. He's shit. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2045~~~
Who exactly is saying he's shit? The guy isn't beyond criticism no matter how young or inexperienced he is.

2046~~~

2047~~~
You can brush it off as being Brugge, but those weren't exactly tap ins he scored and required top level quality to pull off. 

And calling for Young to replace him, that would further put us back to being largely pedestrian in attack. With Young, Rooney and Mata, we'd have 3 players playing behind the striker seemingly unwilling to take runs behind the defence. Depay has helped Martial in making those passes a real threat in our attack again. Young is also 30, we've seen his top level, it is very good all round play, but the end product is statistically very low. We need to aim higher and I believe we are doing so by playing Depay regularly.

2048~~~
I can completely understand if people feel that Memphis has to improve and criticize him for his current performances. But I can't agree with opinions that he should be used as a sub with Young or Pereira starting at all: 

Firstly, Goals/Assists in European competition do matter - he hasn't just looked good against Brugge, he was also our best player against PSV. Does that not matter? If scoring against european teams was so easy, other players would also do that and hence comparison across all competition is best way to judge <span style="text-decoration: underline">attacking talent</span>. In fact using PL statistics is an arbitrary division given the quality levels in European games was the same if not better. 

Second, if we had a Di Maria or other superstar being benched in favour of Memphis, these points would have made sense. But he is keeping out Young, who for all his efforts, is an average player. Young got 2 goals and 5 assists in the whole last season, which is not much different compared to Memphis' PL output. That is not accounting for the fact that Memphis also had a shot on post resulting in a goal against Southampton which he didn't get credit for. This is further not accounting for the fact that Memphis has usually been marked by 2-3 players whereas Young has been afforded much more space (partially due to the fact that he has often come on from bench). Young hardly performed when started in the first match against Spurs and there were desperate calls by fans to move Memphis to the wing. Pereira is likely to be even more inconsistent, and didn't really do well even against Ispwich, which is being considered beneath our level by some people here (not holding this against him - he is young, similar to Memphis). 

Third, moving away from statistics, Memphis has clearly been one of our most important attacking player, even in the premier league. While Rooney has been poor, Mata can work best only when the penetration is provided somebody else. Remove Memphis and the quality of our attack would go down by a lot. I don't get how people can't see this.

Fourth, and most importantly, Memphis is clearly one for the future who should be given the space to grow (and he has been showing signs of progress). With a bit of pain, we could be set for a long time with a real quality player.

2049~~~
I know we have not been used to playing Cl qualifiers but it's rather strange to see the revisionism regarding Brugge after we thumped them in the second leg. The tie was possibly our biggest game of the season and Memphis produced 3 moments of quality after we had conceded an away goal. I think with him more than the stats people should look at the fact that he is shown that he is capable of producing quality out of nothing and at this age he is obviously going to be a bit inconsistent.

2050~~~
Seems to be the argument being made in Rooney's case.

2051~~~
The difference between his European and League performances has been enormous, but we faced much easier opponents in Champions League so far. The problem I see with Depay is he seems to be getting worse with each (EPL) game, maybe it’s in his head but I really don’t think putting so much pressure on him since day one in Manchester is working. He had in my opinion his worst game vs Sunderland, and it doesn’t get much easier. The assumption that if he did well against Brugge (very poor) and PSV (poor and we should’ve won easily) so he’s going to do it in the league is wrong IMO, although quite a popular one on the Caf.

I get your point on Di Maria. I’m actually more concerned about Pereira who to me looks like a better prospect than Memphis, but I admit I generally prefer his style.

There were calls to move Depay to the wing from day one, because he never really looked like a player who is comfortable in the middle.

But the most important is this part:
Well, I strongly disagree with you on that. I don’t think he has done much in the League games. His dribbling is almost non existent for somebody who was called a winger (I noticed people tend to call him “attacker” recently), his passing and close control is poor. He doesn’t cooperate with his teammates at all, the more he struggles the more he tries to do everything on his own.

What he truly is great at is movement and crossing, he’s also quite good at long distance shooting. Comparing that to Pereira who has much better close control, and is also excellent crosser I don’t think there’s much between them.

Memphis IMO isn’t the main reason why we are top of the league. I believe we would’ve done it without him. I believe he’s a talent, but maybe he isn’t ready to be a starter here.

He needs playing time obviously, I’m only questioning if he needs to start every game, especially as we have Young, Pereira and possibly Martial who can do a job on the left at least as good as him.

2052~~~
Well as LVG said previously in the press-conferences about Rooney that he scored 3 goals, it doesn't matter for him if it was in CL, in league cup or in PL, he scored them. The same goes for Depay. Someone has to score and create in non-PL games, they are as important. It is really unfair just to isolate the stats from the competition which is the worst stat-wise for a player and argue that he isn't good enough.

But to argue that based on the stats in the PL he should get dropped in PL or at least rested. You have to look why stats and displays in the PL are not as good as they are in other competitions. The oppositions usually double or even triple mark him, Sunderland started doing the same with Martial, which is for the player who is marked the worst nightmare but it is one of the best things which can happen for the other players. I am sure LVG saw that and he saw the addition space for the rest of players and he is happy with throwing Memphis in the first team because of that - double mark him and you will give space to the rest of the team or don't do it and he will do something - score or assist.

Still 1 assist and 1 goal is not so bad in the 7 games, especially when you think that he could easily have 2 goal more (chance against Sunderland and post against Southampton).

And the most important thing - you can't have players who will play in the CL and cups and not in the PL because in the PL they are not as good. It is simple for LVG, you are in the first team or you are not in the first team. We want consistency in our starting 11 so they know each other and can play as good as they can together and the most important thing we don't want  to do is to change our starting 11 to much.

2053~~~
He also scored against PSV. Which was my point. He's scored in every competition he's played in and not just against whipping boys.

2054~~~
Pereira didn't do that well against Ispwich even though he showed excellent close control as you said. But I haven't seen Pereira enough to comment on whether he is a better prospect than Memphis (but would be glad if true as I really rate Memphis). 

On our disagreement on Memphis' performance, I do think he has also shown the ability to dribble (of the Ronaldo/Bale type and not of the Nani type - which most of here are comparing him to), but he hasn't shown it enough times in the last couple of games. His first touch is also good but is inconsistent. But these should be fine as he adjusts to the PL. Having said that, I agree that his best attributes are his movement and passing that have helped us create a lot of openings.

I really think an attack of Young, Rooney, and Mata behind Martial would be very average (based on this season alone), and Martial would be left with too much to do on his own. For all his efforts, Young does not have the end product to make the difference. Mata, as I said, cannot provide penetration on his own as he cannot go past defenders. He is more of a finisher who can bring the additional quality in the box after the Martials and the Memphis of our team have created havoc and created space for others. And nothing needs to be said for Rooney unfortunately.

Edit: Also I doubt that we faced much easier opponents in Europe. PSV and Brugge are more difficult than Sunderland, etc. However PL, you have less space and time, which you have to adjust to. Some (like Martial) do it faster but some take time. See Fergie's letter to Cantona about Sheringham needing to adjust even though he came from a PL team just because teams up their game against United.

2055~~~
I've no problem with the guy, just don't think his current ability is as useful as Young's current ability. Seems odd to persist with him starting when Young was so consistently useful for us last season.

2056~~~
Do you guys think Young would have been in that position for the tap in against Sunderland? I don't think so. My point is one of Memphis' best qualities is his desire to score goals. The moment he saw the ball leave Blind's foot he was racing to the far post and it wasn't as if you could expect Mata to cushion it for him. He was racing cuz he sensed a chance might fall his way. Now that desire cannot be coached. That will see him score more than enough goals easily to share the goal scoring burden. 

I do agree that he needs to improve his general play quite a bit but that's alright. Not everybody can take to the league like Martial has done. In any case his contributions against Brugee (even if it is only Brugge) were actually important ones, not like he score 2 goals at the end of a 5-0 rout.

2057~~~
4 goals and 4 assists, he's looked brilliant and poor, but can't ask for much more from a 21 year old. So much potential and I hope we keep playing him, his positioning has already improved from the first week. Young had 4 goals and 6 assists last year in total so I think Memphis should keep starting. Plus his link up with Martial is very good. Not all signings start like Martial.

2058~~~
People have this problem with effective players. Depay is three times as effective as Young, just like Mata is. Depay and Mata are 1 in 3 goalscorers and produce more assists because they understand to get into good areas. We need those types of players with a question mark next to our strikers. Neither Young nor Pereira will contribute enough on that front for us.

2059~~~
I've seen more of Pereira and I like him, IMO his attributes are much better fit for van Gaal style than Memphis.

My point is I'm not impressed with his technique. Whatever you call it he has to improve on that matter, but I'm not sure it's about "adjusting to the league". It would be the same in every other top league.
What you mentioned about his dribbling style is what I was worried about before he came here - he seems to be reliant on speed and strength to get ahead of opposition players, what works two times better for counter attacking teams. I said he will struggle in possession based football where close touch, acceleration and agility are more important, and so far I've been proven right, unfortunately.

That's where we disagree. It's all about team performance - and I'm pretty sure we would see significant improvement if Young replaced Memphis.
You know why? At the moment we play with four strikers - Mata, Rooney, Martial and Memphis.
Most of the time Mata is recycling posession, and comes to life in the box. Rooney is fighting not to lose the Ball but if you hit him the right way, he might even score a goal. Martial is doing surprisingly well so far but we can't expect him to score and assist on regular basis. Memphis as we already have agreed gets into good positions, but other than that, I fail to see his contribution. I think we are much more threatening with Young because he's a winger, he works well with fullback, he contributes a lot to our general play way more than Memphis. But it seems most people want as many goalscorers as possible on the pitch. Add to that, Young is very unpopular player and you get why people will forgive Depay a lot.

Sunderland is the worst team in the league and Memphis struggled to make an impact other than a tap in (kudos for a good run).

2060~~~
Neither of them will score as many goals as Memphis that's for sure. But we might score more goals as a team with Young / Pereira playing ahead of him, which is my point.

2061~~~
It's absolutely ridiculous that people are getting their knickers in a twist because some people are pointing out the obvious i.e his performances in the league haven't been very good so far. It does not mean that they are not supporting the team (<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>) or they think he's shite and should be sold or don't realize that he's still quite young. Pointless parroting "4 goals and 4 assists" every time some dares to criticize him doesn't help when it's his league form that's in question.

2062~~~
Why on earth are people calling for Pereira over Depay? What's this based on exactly? Love pereira, think he's going to be a star for us but this is a little silly

2063~~~
I'm calling to give him a chance. Depay hasn't set high standards and I believe Pereira fits our style better.
<span style="color: #ffffff">*Waiting for the <i>4 and 4</i> post...*</span>

2064~~~
The stats don't back that up.

2065~~~
4 in 4 <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/><img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Depay tore up the Dutch league, Pereira has been playing almost exclusively U21 football, to throw him in when our team is our just getting settled would be counter productive.

2066~~~
What stats?

2067~~~
He's closer in terms of style of play to current Ronaldo than that of young Ronaldo. He has done well so far considering he has only just arrived. I have no doubt that he'll be a top player in the future. Comparisons to Nani are simply untrue. Memphis is a wide forward who has a very good positional sense and finishing ability already and both will only get better. Nani was great on the ball but was never a proven goalscorer. Memphis will be a proven goalscorer.

2068~~~
1 assist in 8 appearances, poor output last season when we scored very few goals.

Young has a decent delivery and works hard, which is a great option to have from the bench, but he doesn't get into positions to hurt teams enough. Depay does, which is why he scores and assists more.

2069~~~
Here's my humble opinion on Memphis.  He needs to continue pressing on, keep his head high BUT not try to always create for himself.  If a player always tucks inside, how hard is that to defend.  Look at highlights from goals scored on any given day throughout professional football, many come from wings beating the defense to the corner and getting a low cross or normal cross into the box.  Why is Wayne struggling to score buckets of goals?  One reason is because we attack up the left and Wayne is reduced to watching Memphis try to dribble past a defender and cut in, while ignoring runs by his teammates or 1-2 combos.  In the last 2 games he's begun looking for Martial for combo passes.

Memphis is certainly a talent, but he has a lot of growing to do IMO.  I've rated him a 5.0 in games on this site so far this season...   I didn't see that until after the above post so I guess I've put my money where my mouth is... although 4 goals and 4 assists in 11 competitions ain't bad.

2070~~~
I don't follow. Surely you are not talking about Young, who has 2 assists in less than 180 minutes?

2071~~~
Not sure he should start every game, he's bound to get burn out. Looks like he could do with a short break to be honest, a few sub appearances and then back into the side.

2072~~~
1 against Liverpool is all isn't it?

2073~~~
Surprising lack of <a class="username" data-user="12627, @Gambit" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/12627/">@Gambit</a>  in this thread. I remember you bigging him up Marek Hamsik 2010-style in the Memphis transfer thread. What say you about his start?

My eagle eyes are on you.

2074~~~
Got one against Sunderland for Mata's goal. 

Pretty laughable to count Youngs assist v Liverpool though. Martial did all the work.

2075~~~
He hasn't even played badly ffs. A few bad games, a few very good games. Mostly decent games. People were just expecting him to light up the league from the start, and that doesn't always happen. He's still been decent and worthy of starts though.

People on here are way too quick to judge wingers. 1 bad decision and they make their mind up, ignoring the good stuff he does. He's a winger. They're always going to be inconsistent and lose the ball now and then. Then with young, people dont expect him to have a big impact so when he does something positive people notice it more and it sticks in the mind more, compared to Memphis who they expect to do well and not have feck ups.

2076~~~
He's been good to watch, and statistically good. He could stay at this level for the whole year and that would be fine for his debut season. But I expect him to get steadily more and more effective until he's our key attacking outlet by April/May.

2077~~~
Took a hefty deflection did it not? Nobody seems to have counted it as his.

If you count that for him then you can add one to Depay for the Mata goal vs Southampton as well.

2078~~~
Looking forward to seeing him progress this season. Seems to be more effective in the champions league thus far, hopefully he can be a little more consistent in the league throughout the season. Always exciting seeing young talents blossom.

2079~~~
All things considering, he is a 21 year-old winger and has just moved to a massive club - he's going to be inconsistent.

I'm reserving my judgement on him until at least next season, it's only fair. Though it is unfortunate at the amount of criticism he is getting on here.

2080~~~
He was always consistent and wasteful at PSV, people just obviously didn't watch him. What we saw at PSV though is he has the ability to make a game changing moment that not many others can, think of the goals against Brugge, he will have moments like that in the league soon. 

If people get on his back too much about being wasteful, he will just end up getting the ball and passing it backwards like we used too, and nobody wants that. Yes he can improve, but that only happens with game time. No coincidence though that since he and Martial have linked up we've been scoring 3 goals on average. 

He makes many good runs and movement that drags the defence around, sometimes that's more important than individual actions.

2081~~~
Bingo. Also, in most games so far he's been drawing 2 defenders on him whenever he gets the ball or is about to - that creates a lot more space for the likes of Martial to get in behind.

2082~~~
More than happy with his start. He's not playing to about 60% of what he's capable of and yet is still making a great contribution. Once he gets settled, figures out LVG's philosophy (which is another consideration nobody talks about) and gets up to speed everyone will look back at these early months and realise it was him bedding in.

2083~~~
A lot of the criticism against him is understandable to me. Last season Di Maria got lots of chances even when his form dropped, all while Young sat on the bench, and people got pissed off because it looked like Di Maria was getting minutes because he was a bigger name on a bigger contract etc. A similar thing could happen with Memphis instead, which really would be a Van Gaal issue not a Memphis one.

As for the player himself, I like what I've seen so far. People have latched on to a couple anonymous games, but overall he's been what you'd expect a talented young winger at a new club to be.

2084~~~
Has moments of brilliance but is also very wasteful. I'm sure he'll come good, at times he looks phenomenal. Expecting him to be more consistent in his performances come January though. Not sure why people are having a go at him, he is performing pretty much as I expected him to to be honest. The talent is there anyway, no doubt about that. Can't imagine many wingers his age, toy with Carvajal the way he did anyway.

2085~~~
Everyone needs to remember he's also having to adjust to the philosophy. He's not played under it before.

2086~~~
Frustrating player at times. Brilliant at the other times. Young attacking winger that just came to a bug club in a new country. It happens. I have bug hopes for him and knew he would have been hot and cold. Happy with his progress so far. Will get 10 goals this season which is what I saw him getting. Just needs to settle and stop trying too hard.


He has though.

2087~~~
Cut in - cut in- cut in...  

Needs a bit of diversity in his attack IMHO.  Go left for a change.

He is frustrating for me to watch as well but a few rays of light are shining down as we see his combinations with Martial.  Hopefully they get on the same page and blossom as a partnership.

2088~~~
If you are thinking about the national team then it's a very slim experience.

2089~~~
Well the poster said he has never played under the philosophy before. That in fact is false. And yes I'm referring to the NT.

2090~~~
If we are strict, you are right, but national managers have next to no influence in the players tactical teaching. In reality only Blind and Schweinsteiger knew Van gaal or the philosophy. The only time LVG really had the time to to work with the players was just before the world cup and he "taught" them how to counter attack together, which is not the philosophy.

2091~~~
Played a different system with Holland for the world cup, one based more on counter attacking not on our current  possession domination. So he didn't have it with the NT nor under PSV. So the fact is true It's also taking Schneirdelin a bit to adapt.

2092~~~
the philosophy has alot more to do than formation and whether or not we counter attack (btw we also counterattack in this side but thats for another debate) . Fact still remains Depay is not new to LVG's style of management, methods etc, and its not true to say he has not played under the philosophy. Is he still finding his feet? definitely

2093~~~
It is true. End of.

2094~~~
He is totally new to LVG style of management, a national manager isn't a club manager they don't have the same job and don't act the same way. Depay has next to no experience with LVG and he isn't familiar with possession football, he played 13 games, world cup included, that represents around 2 months with LVG, 75% of that time have been played in a philosophy totally different to what we do.

2095~~~
ok <span style="color: #ffffff"> i think we have vastly different views on exactly what LVG means by philosophy  </span>

2096~~~
Pereira has played 1 senior game. Memphis has played 2 full seasons for PSV and is a full starter for his national team where he is a regular source of creativity. He is in a new league which is at least 2-3 levels above the Dutch league and playing here he has been decent and hasn't disappointed. His inexperience in the league is the only reason  he isn't getting better end products. 

Right now playing Memphis is definitely better than playing pereira

2097~~~
He's so laid back in everything he does, and its really starting to irritate me. Have some conviction in what you're doing lad.

2098~~~
His finishing is indeed too nonchalant at times. Hopefully he'll get better at it.

Thought he played well though.

2099~~~
Good half for him yet again in the UCL.

2100~~~
Thought he was a constant thread along with martial

Maybe a little too selfish at times though

2101~~~
He's playing well, stick he's getting in the match thread is idiotic.

2102~~~
He gets in fantastic scoring situations but is generally pretty gash with his finishing, just too relaxed it seems. It's really frustrating.

2103~~~
I don't know if it's fair to criticise his style too much. He was laid back last year but tore sides apart.

I reckon he's overthinking things a little. Just trying a bit too hard and gets in his own head when the chances fall to him. He's so young and it's all so new for him but you can see in the way he finds space and the attacking lines he runs that he's going to be top class.

Another thing that struck me in that half is that maybe with all the fuss that's made of the "physicality of the premier league", I hope he hasn't spent the summer focusing too much on building himself up and not enough on his touch and final ball. Either way, I have total faith in his quality. It was similar in the beginning with Ronaldo - people got frustrated at him while he developed.

2104~~~
If anything he seems too stressed. It will click for him eventually. Can't forget how Ronaldo would miss chance after chance before eventually scoring. Atleast he is able to get into those positions - often with world class play.

2105~~~
Good half from him. A few losses of the ball of course but he's been a big threat and getting in behind. Probably should've scored though. His heading could use some work.

2106~~~
He was a physical beast from a very young age, he's gotten a bit bigger at PSV as he got older but he said he hasn't bulked up in a while. He's very conscious about his body (and the risks of gaining mass) and works with professionals, I doubt he's done stupid things by himself.

2107~~~
Despite looking bigger than Martial, he doesn't seem to be able to shrug off opponents like his younger teammate can.

2108~~~
I disagree. Think he's been very poor. Getting in good positions and squandering it either with bad execution or bad decision making. Also gave the ball away very cheaply a few times in the opening minutes.

Hopefully he'll have me eating my words by the end.

2109~~~
With respect, you can afford to be laid back in the Dutch league...in the PL and against top European opposition, you just don't get that luxury.

2110~~~
I like him. The only thing that really annoys me is that if and when he beats a man, he seems to almost feel obliged to then take a shot as if it's his right. Too predictable - needs to work on it.

2111~~~
Yeah. He's fluffed a few chances, sure, but done good work to get himself there. Plus his two best ones have been a ball played slightly behind him, and a header - which I don't think anyone thinks is his forte

2112~~~
Young is better. Memphis should be an impact sub instead of certain starter

2113~~~
Gives the ball away far too much

2114~~~
That's good to hear. He'll be alright. Once he gets a few more goals under his belt and starts to feel comfortable within the system, we'll start to see some real fireworks from the guy.

2115~~~
Yeah I get that. The issue at the moment is that he is getting that space and time because he has the quality to make it for himself, even at this level. I just think when he gets the ball and has a second, he's just overthinking it a little.

2116~~~
Playing well.  Just wait until this guy puts it all together and learns how to play in this team, league and system.  He will be an absolute star.  I honestly feel he's got potential to be a top echelon player (Ballon D'or nominee).

2117~~~
Not remotely surprised to see him go off. Very poor tonight. Baffled so many here praising him.

2118~~~
Very poor, reminded me of Nani at his worst.

2119~~~
He needs to bulk down

2120~~~
He can very frustrating, but that's what you get with players like him.

2121~~~
Memphis needs to learn that this isn't the Dutch league and he isn't going to keep besting players. When he can't, he has to learn to make a yard and put the ball in to use his good crossing ability or play a good pass. Wastes the ball again and again. Has to learn. 

Young should take his spot soon if this carries on. Gotta earn your spot.

2122~~~
I just wonder if it would be doing the lad a favour just to leave him out for a few games. Play Young instead and give him a bit of a breather.

2123~~~
He wasn't as bad as other times although that's not saying much. Like the way he swiveled and hit that Mata pass on his left.

2124~~~
Erratic again. But still not concerned, will take a season for it to all click.

2125~~~
Hit and miss but he was a threat and I would have kept him on, Rooney was much worse and we lost our ability to counter once depay was taken off.

2126~~~
rooney should have gone off not Memphis.

2127~~~
I thought Rooney was marginally the better of them, but that's not saying much. They were both pretty poor. Rooney at least gives a bit more of a defensive work rate, he was dropping into midfield quite a bit towards the end, which was important.

2128~~~
Surprised so many were impressed with him. Thought he didn't look good tonight, our worst attacker.

2129~~~
Feel like we've replaced Nani with a Dutch  Nani. Memphis needs to get his shit together and stop trying to do everything by himself

2130~~~
Bit hit and miss today. Could do with a game or two on the bench, coming on as a sub.

2131~~~
Patchy again, he has good moments in most games but lots of frustrating ones as well.

2132~~~
Were still much better when he was on the pitch. Taking off BFS was most of the reason but we lacked an outlet on the left hand side, makes a mockery of the calls to bring in Pereira for him, he is <i>not</i> a winger.

2133~~~
He did alright but he and Rooney should be rested for Herrera and Young for a couple of games.

2134~~~
This. We lost alot of focus and experience when Bastian went off. I think Memphis looked more promising tonight though and offered more than Rooney did.

2135~~~
If his name was Wayne Rooney or Valencia, he'd be criticized a lot more. All 3 of them were absolutely rubbish tonight.

2136~~~
Whoever starts on the left will be up against Bellerin - one of the quickest around.

Depay has surprised me in that he doesn't try to beat his man. He prefers to run in the space but overdoes it which comes with his youth. He has quality but needs to steady himself. It's not all about you. Maybe Martial's start is putting more pressure on himself since he sets really high standards and drops his head after a miss or tough tackle. He also has no interest tracking back so Bellerin gets a free run.

Young has to start on Sunday.

2137~~~
I wish somebody at the club made a powerpoint presentation about how useful a fullback can be.

2138~~~
Trying too hard at the moment but his positioning is very good. Will come good

2139~~~
Think he needs to be subbed for a few games, bring him off the bench for a few games.

2140~~~
Burn out (mentally). He should not be starting every single match imo. This is something SAF was really good at with Ronaldo and Giggs earlier in their career. We have Young who is really unlucky not to be starting at the moment. Memphis would really benefit from not starting every single match

2141~~~
Ridiculous criticism after a solid performance.

2142~~~
If he was called Memphis Depay, their age, had been playing for us as long as them them, and had played as badly as either of them, then he'd be criticised a lot more.

2143~~~
I thought he was solid today, I do however think he could do with a rest and that goes for a lot of players.

2144~~~
He's a bit sloppy sometimes but he's also a big goal threat so it's not like we're getting nothing for starting him. I'm sure he'll improve his decision making. I don't think it would hurt to rest him now and then, though.

2145~~~
meh

2146~~~
He is the least 'philosophy' player in the team. I can only reason that his nationality is why he continues to get picked.

He has potential but Ashley Young is a much better team player currently.

2147~~~
Where are the people that said it's a "common sense" to stick him on the line-up every match?I have high expectation for him long-term but at the moment him being undroppable won't do him or us any good.

2148~~~
I expected him to start well and Martial to struggle. Been the complete opposite

2149~~~
He looks shit ... Ralph Milne was better

2150~~~
Thought he was good today. I think people are expecting 2 goals and an assist every other game.

2151~~~
You've got to be joking, he gets ripped apart on here after every match<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2152~~~
You've got a weird definition of shit.  He's still hit and miss, and I'm certainly not averse to him getting rotated / rested, but he's carried a huge amount of threat in nearly every game he's played.  Once again today he was always keen to run at people and got 3 or 4 decent crosses in.  Does make wrong decisions / give it a way a bit too often though.

2153~~~
The end product isn't great. Needs to get his head up more when he's beaten his man. That will come in time.

2154~~~
Like Ralph Milne (you're probably too young)

2155~~~
He'd look far better in a 433 than a 4231. There's a #10 in the spaces he likes to drift infield and play in.

2156~~~
Had a good game. A constant threat that drags defenders all over the place and makes space for Rooney and Martial.

2157~~~
If we are to be a good side, we need Memphis to score a fair number of goals. The way our attack is constructed, I don't see Ashley Young offering us more, even if he was performing much better than Memphis. We simply don't have the aerial threat that would benefit from lots of crosses. If Fellaini was in the team then it would make sense to select Young ahead of Memphis.

Memphis is ridiculously greedy, makes some poor choices, but ultimately I think he will get goals due to the sheer number of shots he takes from decent positions; the question for me is whether they will prove to be important goals that win us games or the 4th goal in a 4-0 win.

2158~~~
He's the type of direct risk taking player everyone was begging for last season but was also incredibly obvious as soon as that type of player arrived he'd be butchered for taking risks and trying things.

2159~~~
I'd stick him on the right for a bit to round up his game. He's way too predictable at the moment, will need to learn a few more tricks if he's on the right.

2160~~~
Hilariously predicable wasn't it?

2161~~~
Its the complete opposite for me, I'd like to see him take a few more risks. His play is very predictable atm.

2162~~~
Confidence is down and you can see that by his head not being up when in attacking positions. Hell come good it'll just take time.

2163~~~
He definitely needs to expand his repertoire, I don't think that's as much risk aversion (although he's clearly lacking confidence which probably is an issue) as it is he simply doesn't have it in his locker at the moment. To be fair he did go down the outside and put in a decent cross today so hopefully it's something he's working on.

2164~~~
Completely warranted criticism after a very below par performance.

2165~~~
I don't think anyone is butchering him for taking risks and trying things. People are, correctly in my opinion, pointing out that he didn't have a good game. He's far too selfish at times, and tends to make wrong decisions quite regularly. But he is young, and those things will come with time. 

I haven't seen anyone complaining about him trying things or taking risks at all.

2166~~~
Yeah I'd agree. He has the tools to get there but he needs to knows what to use and when i.e trying to force dribble past 2 players in a tight area is a bad idea. He should think more about link up play and use his agility and ability to be coming <span style="text-decoration: underline">onto</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">off</span> the ball more. That's not to say for him to simply control it and pass safely ala Rooney but looking for quick one-twos, settling yourself, dropping the shoulder to create those moments of lull where you can skip past players and/or wait an overlap, more penetrative pass.

He's actually very reminscent of early Ronaldo for me and I hope when/if he finds his feet and reportoire and starts becoming really effective he doesn't become an 'everything must come through me' type of player. I really hated the Ronaldo that was a lot of 'I'm gonna finish every chance, I'm gonna wait for the ball for me, I'm gonna dribble and force the shot for myself' thing. Ok I'm being very harsh but it took so much away from our team game. Rant over.

2167~~~
He is so careless with balls at times. As if he is playing the game at a slightly slower pace than everyone else.

2168~~~
He was decent. He was frustrating but he takes responsibility to make things happen even when things aren't going his way. 

Refreshing after the last few years of of uninspired buildup play with slow passing and very little dribbling. 

He will get better and is already a very dangerous player in a new league and a new team trying to gel. Have some patience. Better days ahead.

2169~~~
I don't understand how you can be involved in 8 goals directly in 12 games played for your club in a new league and system and people still moan. Yes there is more to consider but he is doing the hardest bits right. The rest will come.

2170~~~
Like I said, he has one of the hardest jobs in football. Regularly turning unpromising situations into promising ones. That kind of thing is going to have a high failure rate, the fact he's contributed so much despite everything stacked against him speaks volumes.

2171~~~
Unfortunately we won't be playing Bruges and Ipswich all season.

2172~~~
His lack of strength on the ball is baffling considering his physique.

2173~~~
I still like the guy a lot, but I can't shake the nagging feeling we've sold Nani and then just bought Nani instead.

Which isn't a bad thing, because I always quite liked Nani. But still....Nani.

2174~~~
I think it's too early to make any real judgements on him. I will wait until next season before giving a definitive view. However so far he hasn't been overly impressive. You can see there is something there though.

2175~~~
Just missing that final bit right now and it's so frustrating because he is doing most of the hard work. Can just imagine if both him and Rooney pick up their game, we'd have a scary good front line but, both right now are letting us down when it counts in the final phases.

2176~~~
Frustrating but exciting to watch at the same time. Unpredictable when he is on the ball and will come good if he keeps working on training ground.

2177~~~
Does he have a habit of not looking up when playing a pass or a cross? The commentators mentioned it in consecutive games now.

2178~~~
Exactly what Young used to do 2 seasons ago..

2179~~~
Hopefully Memphis hits some kind of form and puts in more decent efforts than wasted ones.. 
He is inconsistent. And there has been no major progress from the first match to now..

2180~~~
Martial is well ahead of him in the composure on the ball stakes.

2181~~~
Its early days but there is a chance we have signed an upcoming superstar in Martial

2182~~~
Needs taking out of the team.
First couple of matches I was disappointed as I was expecting a quick, powerful direct player who can beat a man.
Next few games he should glimpses of really good end product (albeit against poor opposition) despite the rest of his all round game being quite poor.
Last few games, especially last night.....awful.  Really really poor.  Hopefully Valencia / Rojo is fit for Arsenal and id play young wide left in his place as he has the ability to actually complete a pass and beat a man.

2183~~~
Young player in new league is inconsistent shocker.

2184~~~
I thought Memphis was good but again faded badly in second half. He really needs to work on his stamina. But I found it encouraging that he caused a lot of damage in the first half with excellent direct dribbling and beating defenders for fun. 
Hope <a class="username" data-user="77194, @Borys" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77194/">@Borys</a> is more satisfied now? And do you still want Periera to start over Memphis? He showed that he is 1-2 levels below Memphis right now (no shame in that, he is younger too). Perhaps the current arrangement works best in that he comes on for the last few minutes of the game, when Memphis anyway doesn't do anything.

2185~~~
Was he better than against Sunderland? I guess so. He found himself in a couple of good occasions and missed all of them. But his movement is something we already know is very good, it's a shame he isn't showing anything else. 

Was he good? Definitely not. His worst game in Europe came against first decent team (although I thought Wolfsburg were better going forward than defending). I still maintain he needs a rest. 

Pereira did nothing, but I’d still give him some time. Him getting a few minutes at the end of a game is a good start at least.

2186~~~
Martial is ahead of most 19 year olds in that regard. How Memphis is playing is more what I'd expect from a young player moving to a big club and new league.

2187~~~
Yes, because Young has the stats to back up such a high level of end product.<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Same story with every young player we sign. This is De Gea all over again.

2188~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> can we have a gif of where Memphis held the ball up with the defender tight behind him, won the free kick and then sent the defender flying <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> his upper body strength is very impressive

2189~~~
Fair point.

2190~~~
When did this happen?

2191~~~
It's a real worry for me that this kid is Nani in disguise. For all his muscles, he doesn't employ them at all. Easily bundled off the ball, predictable, slow to react when he receives the ball... Seems to think he has all the time in the world... Not in the PL you don't Memphis. More worrying than all this, is his lack of application. He loses the ball and seems petulant instead of getting back on his bike and chasing it down again... I'm surprised LVG has stuck with him this long, although he does love all things Dutch!
Alarm bells have been ringing for a few weeks, especially when replaced with Young several times and Young changes the game with sheer determination and aggression... Something that Memphis seems to lack. 
Maybe he is just adjusting to the PL, but for me, he needs to show up in some of these games. A few goals against Bruges won't cut the mustard!

2192~~~
Feck off with the Nani comparisons please.. Nani at his worst was in his latter 20's but at a point in his career among the very best in his field, Memphis is 21 and just made a massive step up in his career. We're winning and he's contributing, I don't get the impatience. Young is doing well as an impact sub aswell so let him keep at it, better to bring on a guy with experience and routine than a kid with everything to prove when you need a boost. As seen in recent years with Januzaj, Zaha etc.

2193~~~
Been seen 'dating' Chris Brown's ex girlfriend Kaureche Tran, Hope it isn't a sign of him not being focused because he has certainly struggled the last few games.

2194~~~
Inconsistent is a bit flattering description of his performances so far. Doesn't show much signs of "footballing brain" whatsoever. Nani had an outstanding technique, and seemed really lively. Memphis's touch and decisionmaking seems really sloppy and naive. I just don't think he's nearly as talented as people make him out to be.

2195~~~
The caf is funny. Last season it was crying about the lack of pace, creativity and someone who can open a defence. 

Now we have someone who is a kid, running at defenders, trying to be creative and lets be honest he succeeds just as much as he fails and the lad is receiving criticism. 

Mind blowing. 

His potential is sky high and he has shown more than enough in nearly every game he plays with his skills, goals, work ethic, delivery that he has what it takes. Yes he is raw and is hit and miss but get off the lad's back.

2196~~~
These players that people cry out for are always inconsistent by nature and when we do have them, people moan. It's always the same. You just wait till they turn on Martial, because it'll happen.

2197~~~
I think you are kidding yourself a bit if you think that based on the games he's played his potential is "sky high".

He's young and come from a league where it's comparitively easy to shine. He's too raw for the PL at the moment and he generally flatters to deceive although there are moments when he does something which give you encouragement. He's got potential and will undoubtedly improve - his decision making and final execution needs to improve enormously (and I am sure it will). He has potential, of that there is no doubt, but "sky high" is not what I see his ceiling as - then we are comparing him to a Ronaldo and he'll not come close to that level.

2198~~~
Borderline.  He's going to be better than Ralphy.

2199~~~
He has barely played 10 games...Been thrown into a new system, new players, complete new league, playing at one of the biggest clubs in the world. He is one of the players that has slightly more license to be creative and LvG clearly wants him to make things happen. He has shown enough in these very few games that he is a very exciting young talent and he will only get better. To start flaming him after barely 10 games is beyond me.

2200~~~
I swear this thread is mostly people defending him from criticism that doesn't exist.

Like, yeah there's a few weirdos calling him Nani and stuff but most of the posts in here go

'I can't understand all the criticism' and then a completely over the top defence against largely imagined criticism.

2201~~~
He's built like a tank. Has he put more muscle on since joining United?

2202~~~
Few will, which is why its a poor comparison to make to begin with. In fact I'd hazard a guess that if a young Ronaldo joined us now you'd see post after post of 'he'll not come close to that level' if people said he was going to be in the discussion when it comes to best players ever to play the game so its a silly stick to beat him with. 

It's a difficult one, really, anyone that comes into this thread and says anything along the lines of 'he is playing well' is talking nonsense. He's been pretty disappointing so far. Which isn't completely unexpected. But anyone using that to form the opinion 'he's clearly not very good' is not worth listening to.

He seems a bit over-eager at times (which probably has been exasperated by the ease with which Martial has made an impact) you criticise his decision making which is fair game, I guess, but I wouldn't say we've actually seen any evidence of decision making at all. Whenever he's had the opportunity to shoot or try and set someone up he's always shot not, I would say, because he's greedy but he's clearly desperate to get himself settled in and up and running. Compare that to Martial who hasn't really tried to hard, he's not snatched at his chances or taking on things which he shouldn't. He's just gone about his business in exactly the same way he would as if he's been here for years. 

But its an interesting comparison, I wonder if you'd argue if Martial's potential is 'sky-high', I suspect you probably would, but its obviously an erroneous comparison because you're basing it on such a small sample size where Martial's been inarguably brilliant and Memphis has been pretty poor. They'll both go through patches where this form will reverse, Memphis will play better and Martial will struggle. Only then, really can we make definitive predictions on either potential.

2203~~~
Nani

2204~~~
The one reason for me why Martial might achieve more than Memphis is speed. Martial has genuine pace whereas Memphis really doesn't. Ronaldo has that too and in time has added so much more to his game. Messi on the other hand sort of drifts by defenders but has so much skill it's untrue. Those two represent sky high for me (a term I did not introduce to the conversation, but commented on after another poster did).

Martial has quick feet and speed and with those two basic attributes I think his ceiling is higher than Memphis'. All depends on how hard they work to improve other areas of their game of course though.

2205~~~
It's weird, he's not looked great overall but then he has 4 goals and 4 assists in 12 games. 

What I will say is I honestly prefer seeing him on the pitch to Di Maria.

Also remember most of us said at the start that he will be frustrating and not to expect an immediate impact.

2206~~~
Yes, Ronaldo struggled initially but at 21 he was a much more developed player than Memphis. At the age of 22 Ronaldo started the 07/08 season in which he scored 42 goals. Can you see Memphis scoring 42 goals next season? Memphis will be a very good player, I have zero doubt about that. I think he'll reach the level of Sanchez and that's a very high level.

2207~~~
I don't really understand why Nani is a criticism. A younger version of Nani isn't a horrible prospect. I mean, Nani was actually quite good, wasn't he?

2208~~~
He was very good - better at that point in his career/life than Memphis is if you ask me.

2209~~~
Really? At 21 Nani had come off scoring 6 goals in 40 games in Portugal, whereas Depay scored 28 in 40 in Holland, including 6 in Europe. I think your opinion is a little premature.

2210~~~
It's not all about goals though is it? Nani was never a big goalscorer, more a creator. He dribbled and had pace. I think perhaps the comparison is indeed a little flawed though insomuch as at 21 Nani indeed hadn't done more than Memphis, on that point I stand corrected. What I was really getting at was that I agreed that Nani isn't a criticism.

2211~~~
I agree that Nani isn't a criticism. If Depay can reach Nani's top level which was IIRC about 2010 ish, and be consistent, he'll be an excellent asset.

2212~~~
I'll be delighted if he turns out as good as Nani at his best was for us, and even more delighted if he can sustain that type of form for a few seasons.

2213~~~
de gea was taken out of the team!  it helped him progress

Memphis is struggling at the moment, a spell out of the limelight might damage his confidence slightly short term but less so than if he's allowed to continue to put In woefull performances.

if its tiredness, form or a combination it wont do him any harm to come off the bench after an hour on sunday

allowing young players to struggles hinders progress not helps it

2214~~~
I said that.  he's the opposite of most young wingers, nani included.  Typically they beat 3 or 4 players and then sky the cross / shot.

Memphis has barley beat a man since he has arrived but his goals and assists have shown very high qaulity

2215~~~
First part. I do to. He tries and really plays for the club and I like what I saw so far.

Second part. It is classic caf thread this. I am laughing at how so many posters tried to be not to excited about this signing with saying 'he will need time', 'we have to be patient', 'i hope LVG will have patience with him' - all trying to look like knowledgeable people with patience for young players.
Fast forward one month or so the same people are questioning about his qualities, about his composure, want him to be dropped and questioning LVG why he give him so much minutes.
And all that has been said in a period when he scored 4 and assisted 4 in 12 games and when he showed glimpses of his potential in every game.

2216~~~
That's because he isn't really a winger (in traditional sense). He barely dribbles past defenders as you said, but he gets into a lot of goalscoring situations. He has striker instincts rather a wide man.

He does remind me of current Ronaldo in terms of style- his mind is set on finding some space to shoot, whether in or outside the box.

2217~~~
Not sure why you feel that people who suggested LVG be patient with him later saying he should be rested/dropped/played for fewer minutes are contradicting themselves when in fact they are all maintaining their original view - namely that he needs time, perhaps he should be brought along slowly i.e. not played in every nearly every match.

2218~~~
When he's faced by 2 or 3 defenders, he always seems to decide it's a good idea to run directly at them. That might have worked in Holland, but it won't work at the highest level. 

It's only going to take a small change in his instincts to fix but, once he figures out he's not invincible, he'll be a much better player. A simple pass or a knock-and-run is often the best option. If he did that once in a while, it'd put doubts in his opponents' minds and give him more space.

2219~~~
Not very similar to Nani. That's a lazy comparison. Nani was a much better dribbler,more agile and faster. Depay is stronger and more direct,ultimately much more of a goal threat.

2220~~~
Looks a clumsy braindead cnut.

2221~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3252567/Memphis-Depay-spends-time-Karrueche-Tran-hits-shops-Manchester-Chris-Brown-s-ex-girlfriend.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...s-Manchester-Chris-Brown-s-ex-girlfriend.html</a>

Quite concerning to me, I know he is enjoying his life but don't like the fact he seems so distracted this soon into his United career.

2222~~~
Oh wow.

2223~~~
He does though,  doing some dumb amateurish shit at the moment.

2224~~~
You don't like that he went shopping with his girlfriend?

2225~~~
Your wording is strong to say the least.

2226~~~
It's annoying me,  constantly coughing the ball up.

2227~~~
It's not just that if you look at the full situation. He was seen in a nightclub with her over the weekend wearing a Gold Grill being all flashy and now he is all over the papers with her (Chris Brown's ex, a girl who will do anything for attention). It's just not great that when he should be knuckling down on his football, he seems to be a bit distracted.

2228~~~
The amount of assuming and jumping to conclusions...

2229~~~
Got to try justify his poor form some how <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2230~~~
Yeah, on second thoughts, lets blame the chick <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2231~~~
Players are allowed to go out and enjoy themselves you know. Who cares who he is dating or what he wears? There is no doubt in my mind that he's working hard to improve on the pitch and he's working hard during games as well. What do you think players do after they're done training for the day? Just live in the gym? 

Really never got this obsession people have with worrying about what players do with their own time. All that matters is him on the pitch, off of it, it really doesn't matter what he does. Van Gaal definitely wouldn't be picking him if he wasn't working hard anyway.

2232~~~
Ronaldo had also been in the league for three years at the age of 21. It makes a huge difference.

2233~~~
I'd prefer it if he was allowed to stay out wide.

2234~~~
I don't get the frustration from the fans, whoever compared him to Bebe need to be banned from society. 

He's obviously a big personality, you can see him getting mad out there, his celebrations strike me more as someone sticking our their chests saying, "I told you so" than the simple easy joy on James Wilson's face when he scores. 

But I like that in a football player, you need to hate to lose. Lots of players thrive on a desire to prove themselves, to break records, rather than just the plain enjoyment of playing.

I'm not worried about him, I hope he just keeps up the good work.

2235~~~
found it

2236~~~
this kid has the raw materials....I'm not worried in the slightest

patience will pay off - for every Martial - a player who hits the ground running - I'd say there are a few who struggle initially with a new club, new country, new manager, new tactics, new expectations, new team mates etc...

2237~~~
He was shit. Horrible. Really really poor. Gash. And a clumsy brain dead cnut. 

Wow, just wow. I don't have an issue with anyone saying that he needs to improve (he does) but some of these over the top exaggerations people use to try and make their case sounds more like desperation to get noticed on the forum than an analysis of his performance. While I think some of this is trolling, I think some of you may actually believe this and I just don't see the same thing (needs to improve but far from a shitty, horrible, clumsy brain dead cnut). 

Yesterday he had an average game imo, but was a little better than the last game. He did some things well but shot a couple times when he should have passed and I think his last bit of business on the pitch he passed when I would have liked to have seen him shoot. Personally I think swapping with AY right now would be premature, I have always thought the best way to get to the next level is to play. And while obviously a lot disagree on how his play has been, we are not losing games because of him. In fact, I think we are doing well all around and the players are still getting to know each other.

I haven't been to the Pereira thread today, can't imagine what vile things he is being called!!

2238~~~
The people saying he played awful yesterday seem way over the top to me.  Simply put if he had finished the two goal scoring opportunities he had instead of getting stopped by the keeper I'd almost guarantee everybody would be singing his praises.  Obviously not finishing is worth some criticism, but I thought he actually played fairly well yesterday despite losing the ball a couple of times which is always going to happen to a player as direct as him.

I agree with those saying he needs to pick his head up a bit more, diversify his game (which he did a bit yesterday putting in a couple of very nice crosses) and keep it a bit more simple at times.  I'd probably give him a 6/10 yesterday and overall for the season, which is about what I expected from him to start off.

2239~~~
He is though.

2240~~~
impressive there, but many more times he seems to lose it a bit flimsy.

Yesterday he didn't half give someone a forearm smash though! If it was Fellaini, the guy wouldn't have got back up!

2241~~~
And he had the chance to work under one of the best managers ever.

2242~~~
A Tran you mean?! 

I like the fact that he/she is willing to embrace his/her ambiguity..... unlike the cowardly Iranians, hiding behind the head-wear/scarf.

2243~~~
He's 21..he will be inconsistent. No point in getting too excited or too upset about his performances right now. I would be more interested in seeing to what degree he can improve when he plays in his second season. That will be indicative of how good he can be in the future.

2244~~~
true, but i hope we at least can admit he has been shit recently. As you said his second season will be a good indication of his talent and potential.

2245~~~
His level has dropped off a fair bit since the Brugge match. He puts in a lot of running and effort in every game, and I'm guessing fatigue might have something to do with it. Hopefully LvG will give Pereira some game time, and let him catch his breath a bit.

2246~~~
So far, it doesn't look like it was wise to sign him and loan Januzaj. Both are pretty much at the same level, around the same stage of development, and while both are very talented, both are as inconsistent as they can be and their decision making is absolutely horrible. Like, really horrible when 4 out of 5 times they choose the completely wrong option.

To be fair, I was expecting an upgrade on Adnan, but it hasn't been the case at all. What we have seen so far is a stronger version of Adnan with significantly worse passing.

Anyway, it is still too early in his career and while I wasn't expecting a world beater, I thought that he'll do better. His true worth will be shown next season. But, I think that benching him for a few games is the right solution. It is already difficult playing with a passenger in the team (that would be our captain), but with two it really becomes very difficult.

2247~~~
Half the people in here are the same idiots that wrote Chris Smalling off about 2 years ago. Funny how things change quickly. His talent isn't in doubt, he just needs to fully adjust and get used too the tighter marking. 

Once that happens he will be back to his flying best, clearly LVG doesn't mind as he keeps starting him every match.

2248~~~
Speaking of parallels between Smalling and Memphis, Memphis can learn from Smalling on how to use his strength to his advantage. Smalling used to infuriate me when he would be too respectful to opponents or get bullied off too easily even when it was clear that he had the "raw" strength.

2249~~~
I think he'll eventually be great for us, but at the minute I just wish one of the coaches or manager would tell him that sometimes he needs to be a little selfish and look for a pass rather than shooting. I can't profess to have seen him much at PSV, but it seems to me like he thinks he has to score goals in every match rather than being a part of something bigger.

2250~~~
Even if he's not playing well just the threat of the pace and goal threat he has keeps the opposition on the back foot.
No surprise when he was subbed that Wolfsburg pushed up on his side and every cross and threat came from the right.

2251~~~
I think a bit more rotation with Young would do him some good so he doesn't have to start every game.

2252~~~
I wont say hes been shit but yeah I agree things are not exactly going his way. A lot of people have knee jerk reactions here -one day he's the next ronaldo anothet day he's back to being the next nani. I think we just need to be patient. We can be critical without reducing him to 'the next' whoever tag.

2253~~~
I don't get why LVG starts him every game.

2254~~~
Agree with this. I don't think he should be starting every game but I imagine he is for now because he is seen as a better goal threat than Ashley Young and we don't really have many of those. Saying he has been shit is also a huge exaggeration as well.

2255~~~
Don't think he should be dropped, unless he begins to offer nothing.

Doesn't deserve 90 mins though.

2256~~~
His movement is some of the most outstanding you'll ever see from a wide forward. That he's 21 makes it all the more impressive.

2257~~~
Why doesn't he take our set pieces?

2258~~~
He does, he regularly takes freekicks on the left side of the pitch and corners. He's not great at penalties as he can be overconfident.

2259~~~
Expected him to be our designated choice, but I guess given the pressure.

2260~~~
He's not even played 10 games for United, let alone in a foreign league, foreign country and our fans are going at him already. So much for giving youth a chance hey. He has loads of talent and he will come good, but he needs to given the confidence, and dropping him will set him back. The comparisons to Smalling has nothing to do with ability but the trust that the manager has placed in him week in and week out.

2261~~~
So you're essentially expecting the criticism levels of a 21 year old who hasn't even played 10 PL games for us to be similar to that of two experienced players who have been playing in the Premier League for a long time?

2262~~~
I dont understand how hes continously starting. I dont want to lay into him, as hes still young, but he doesnt even deserve to be on the bench. We just cannot carry so many passengers.

2263~~~
He needs a break, he's played almost every minute since he joined.

2264~~~
He's absolutely awful at the minute. Give him a few games off.

2265~~~
feck it take both him and Rooney off for Schneiderlin and Jones.

2266~~~
"Still young."

Gimme a break. He's 21, not a fecking child. He should be more than capable of handling criticism, of which there should be plenty because he's been fecking garbage since he came here, bar one game against Brugge.

2267~~~
His work rate is appalling... Times like this i do question selling Nani (and i never thought i'd say that!)

2268~~~
Questions should be asked about his workrate because he doesn't look like he gives a feck.

2269~~~
I agree. But many on here find it offensive if you criticise him.

Double standards from our manager.

2270~~~
Let's be honest, he's been utter crap for United.

2271~~~
I haven't seen anything remotely close to him being a United player meterial..  Worst player on the pitch goes to Rooney but he is always close second.

2272~~~
He's not hiding. When he gets the ball he drives at the defense.

Decision making absolutely awful today though.

2273~~~
He has been utter want for his last few games. If Shaw didn't get his injury, he would have had competition for his position in Young but currently doesn't

2274~~~
Pretty much this. Disgusting performance at times. Plus he doesnt offer anything going forwards.

2275~~~
It's all like playing every game in 10

2276~~~
He constantly tries to run at players and virtually never actually beats a man. Young is better at taking players on than Memphis has been. If Shaw hadn't got injured I think Memphis would have lost his place to Young.

2277~~~
He really shouldn't be playing so often. He has been awful and shouldn't be on the pitch.

2278~~~
I agree with this. I haven't bought the Memphis hype like many here have done. And so far today, he's been absolutely disgraceful.

2279~~~
He's got a Kagawa-like cult following though.

2280~~~
He's a luxury player right now. Until he learns to track back and iron out his decision making he shouldn't play in the big games.

He needs games to develop, but not this many. He's not consistent enough to have them.

2281~~~
Then you look at Martial who looks like hes from another planet. Think him bullying the Dutch league has slightly skewed his current abilities. Still a lot for him to do. Luckily he has time on his side.

2282~~~
He's far too wasteful.  Been horrible today.

2283~~~
I can accept how erratic he is in attack but the lack of workrate is unacceptable.

2284~~~
For a player whose pace is meant to be his primary asset, I can't think of many occasions when he has used it. Always seems to be playing like he's Berbatov. He doesn't run at defenders at pace, nor use his pace to recover. His work rate off the ball is shocking.

Young is getting his pants pulled down, but I don't know what else he's meant to do when he's had Ballerin and Ramsey coming at him in tandem.

2285~~~
I agree it's good that he runs at defenders, but the problem is he seems to be really crap at it. It's rare that he convincingly beats his man, and he loses the ball the majority of the time. Don't know what to make of him at the moment, but he really needs to improve soon or he deserves to be dropped.

2286~~~
He's young and rather inexperienced, we have to keep that in mind. With that said, he has to work on his decision-making and utilise his pace far better that he has today.

2287~~~
Annoying, shit attitude of his is the most annoying thing about him. Doesn't track back, he should be fecking flying around the pitch with tackles hassling Arsenal all over it with the amount of times he's lost the ball and he's being lazy, not tracking back and leaving Young 1v2 and sometimes 1v3 all the time. It's fecking annoying and has been since day 1.

I don't mind him being shit up front, failing when he dribbles whatsoever, fine, but stop with all that fancy shit and work your ass off.

2288~~~
His performances are identical to the guy in my username.

2289~~~
Agreed. I think Shaw's injury gave him a stay of execution in the first eleven to be honest, because he's been utter wank the past couple of weeks. Arsenal (and millions of people around the world watching) know exactly what he's gonna do when he gets the ball. All they have to do is wait for him to come inside and surround him.

2290~~~
Needs dropping after this. He needs to learn you can't cruise in the PL.

2291~~~
I'm wondering if he's premier league standard. He's lazy, greedy and has almost zero end product.
He might look good against the shit in the Dutch league and Brugge but he just keeps putting in terrible performances every week in the league.

2292~~~
Playing with 9 actually, Rooney is there as well.

2293~~~
Wants too much to be the hero. Very frustrating.

2294~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

True.

2295~~~
Don't forget his ceiling. It's really high. Let's ignore his performance and his appalling work rate.

2296~~~
Haven't liked what I've seen from him at all

2297~~~
He is so cool. Meh..

2298~~~
It'd be nice if he stopped running directly into defenders all the time.

2299~~~
He frustrates me more than Nani ever did.

2300~~~
The thing with Nani (and di Maria last season) was that they always offered something going forward. Depay hasnt at all. Needs to come off for Schneiderlin.

2301~~~
Because Nani still got you goals and assists when playing poorly. He worked hard too.

2302~~~
I wouldn't mind the performance so much going forwards if he actually put some fecking effort in. 

How hard is it to contribute defensively?

2303~~~
I thought it's common sense to stick him in the line-up every match?Don't need to care about performance guys,lad has potential.

On a more serious note it's so obvious that he's going to struggle against Arsenal's defence.Need a lot of time before we can see his take on successful rate and final product improves.The problem with him in this match is his lack of hungriness to prove his name and show why he's not been dropped so far.Poor management from Van Gaal.

2304~~~
Not even that good to be honest.

2305~~~
Yeah, there was always that chance they'd do something magical. This man's too limited... sadly.

2306~~~
He needs to start going on the outside. Middle is too congested.

2307~~~
He's dribbling is very very bad. But his attitude gets me more than anything.

2308~~~
Jamie Vardy looked more of a danger to Arsenal than Memphis. Let that sink in.

2309~~~
He's shown no desire.

Look, I'm surprised he looks so slow and not agile at all. The reviews here made me think he was a Sanchez type dribbler. Direct and with purpose. Okay so maybe that's wrong.

But what's his strengths? He plays like Valencia without the speed. So not even as useful as Valencia.

2310~~~
Sad thing is his only competition are Valencia and Young at the moment.

2311~~~
Always take what a player does in the dutch league with a tiny pinch of salt.

Although Memphis is only 21 and has plenty of time to improve.

2312~~~
As I said, he should have been as the player who will fight for the place in the team as a young supertalent who won't be automatic starter, this is coming costly now when we found out he's far from being ready.. again Januzaj wouldn't do worse in his favourite position

2313~~~
If Nani was playing like this game after game I swear someone would shoot him from the crowd. 

I like him, and I think he will improve, but pretty much the only thing he is good at since he came to United is his movement because he is getting into good positions all the time, everything else is just terrible.

2314~~~
Dragged off again. Think it'll be a while until we see him again.

2315~~~
He's like Nani but without the pace, dribbling and occasional bits of quality on the ball.

2316~~~
Didn't think he would start today. He's been extremely underwhelming since he arrived.

2317~~~
Same here. I do wonder if he's good enough for the Premier League. Rooney and Ronaldo certainly did when they were 21.

2318~~~
Feck me that was disappointing. Unless he was instructed to show that little desire in defence, it was appalling from hm. Jogging back. 

Obviously he's been pulled half time.

2319~~~
Especially when you see the best attacking player on the pitch Alexis Sanchez work his balls off.

2320~~~
Hope he gets to play in the u21, would have a hard working Lingard 10x over him.

2321~~~
He's not good enought at the moment. Harsh but true. He's not adjusted the this level at all.

2322~~~
Nani looked a better player when he was 21 tbf.

2323~~~
Shite today and looked like he couldn't give a feck. Very disappointing.

2324~~~
I agree, he was a much better player at 20-21 in his first season. I'm a big Nani fan, and Memphis would do well to ever match Nani's 10-11 contributions.

2325~~~
I don't mind the poor attacking performance so much, that happens when you get blown out in the first 5 minutes. But his refusal to track obvious runs today or make any defensive effort was disgraceful and he really should be fined for it.

2326~~~
Not good enough yet to start every week.

2327~~~
He really hasn't done enough to justify being in the starting line-up. He needs to be benched and just let him prove himself in sub appearances like anybody else.

2328~~~
We need an acomplished winger/attacker. Send 70m for Griezmann in January, he could cover all three attacking poitions..

2329~~~
Worried about his attitude. Supposed to be the next CR7 but couldn't give a feck at all today and it's not the first time he's went missing in a big game, was hauled off after 45mins vs Liverpool as well.

2330~~~
This. I'd rather have Blind at left back, Jones centre back and Young on the left wing. But main point is, he needs to be dropped.

2331~~~
Absolute shithouse of a performance.

2332~~~
Regardless of what he may become in the future he's not as good a winger as Ashley Young is now. 

If Shaw had never gotten injured I'd have preferred Young to play there but we have a lack of options out wide now unfortunately.

2333~~~
Can deal with his inconsistency but he looked like he couldn't be fecked in the first half.

2334~~~
Shows how misleading stats are, 4 goals and 4 assists already but shite performances week in and out recently.

2335~~~
meh

2336~~~
Atrocious performance and not the first time this season.

2337~~~
Been saying it for a while. He isn't ready enough. Thinks he has more time and space than he actually has and thinks he can just run past full backs. This isn't the Eredivisie. 

Young MUST start on the left.

2338~~~
Needs to be on the bench a bit and come on for 20 or so minutes towards the end depending on what's going on. Take him out of the firing line a bit. He's an intense personality and trying to do too much too soon. Putting himself under constant pressure. But he'll improve, I'm sure of it.

2339~~~
Poor today but everyone was on the first half, young should start against everton though, away for home our defence needs more protection.

2340~~~
I've lost patience with him and no longer want him to start every game. It's all well and good at home, against weaker opposition, where maybe he can play himself into form, but away matches or games against the bigger teams we can't afford passengers.

2341~~~
Very poor atm. Feck knows what happened to him.

2342~~~
Really poor today. It's one thing to lose but at least have some attitude. One time, he just run into 3 players without doing anything

2343~~~
I think he has all the attributes, but his attitude stinks. It makes me appreciate even more how mature Martial is even though he's 2 years younger.

2344~~~
CNUT <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2345~~~
Not good enough atm to be a starter for us. Young needs to be at least rotated with this guy, especially for the big games I feel Young needs to start.

2346~~~
He really should be being eased into the league. Unfortunately we don't really have the numbers for that so we're forced to play him more than we should be. 

One things for sure; we definitely need a wide forward in the summer and I'd far rather they replace Memphis in the line-up than Mata.

2347~~~
Needs to perform in the premier league, don't think he's had a single good game yet unfortunately.

2348~~~
Keep saying this after every game, he needs to be benched for a few games. Play Young at lw and move Blind to lb or Rojo.

2349~~~
Don't rate him particularly if I'm honest.

When the going gets tough, he's not interested. Young was getting destroyed down that side and not once did Depay look to help him.

2350~~~
His free pass must have expired a little earlier than Rooney's today. Surprised we hooked him, van Gaal normally lets him play that way for the whole game.

2351~~~
Not in thise case, he bullied Brugge and PSv and accumalated some decent stats.

2352~~~
Needs dropping for a while. He's walking in to the team. He started the season looking hungry, even if he was a little erratic. He was working hard and looking threatening. He's starting to just potter about effortlessly. He needs a bit of competition and to be shown his position is under threat. He also needs to be told that when we don't have the ball, everyone in the team is a defender. He's just not mucking in.

2353~~~
Seen people compare him to Nani which is a bit harsh.. Nani actually showers moments of brilliance.

Bit harsh, I am surprised though how long it's taking for the lad to settle when you consider how well Anthony Martial has taken to this league.

2354~~~
The lad is a poser. Get out of the gym and on to the training pitch Memphis!

2355~~~
Same and that was even before his signing. I was never excited with us bringing him in. I saw PSV about 7 times last season and even though he scored in most of them, I was never impressed with his general play. He took a ridiculous amount of shots, which could explain the goals.

2356~~~
He will come good. Too early for him to be a regular starter. We cannot carry two passengers in our attack each game, so the youngest one of them will be the one benched.

2357~~~
Needs to be dropped.  LVG has his favorites and he seems unwilling and too stubborn to accept reality.

2358~~~
I wouldn't say he has all the attributes, his lack of dribbling skill has surprised me a fair bit and his one on one finishing has been sorely lacking up to now. Needs to be benched and developed slowly, also showing him that he isn't immune to getting dropped might help him out a bit. He has time to pan out if he gets his head down.

2359~~~
His teamwork is appalling. At least when you have a shit game help your teammates defensively. 
You'd think that's a no brainer. 
Not to Depay though, evidently.

2360~~~
His performances right now are obviously really poor, but even in the long term, in what scenario is he becoming a world class player? He has looked utterly hopeless in the PL so far. Dismal decision making with the ball, inability to beat defenders, unable to cope with getting doubled, not a great finisher, not very quick, physically weaker than he looks, and poor body language/attitude. A lot has to happen for him to even reach Nani level, which is who he is frequently getting compared to here. Nani was frustrating, but he was far better than what Memphis has shown so far, and Nani's peak form here was miles better than Memphis so far.

2361~~~
He looks overwealmed and timid in close possession.  He is not elusive at all with his cut in moves.  He needs a spell on the bench....   OR at least WE need him to find some bench time to allow someone else to give it a go.  He was an absolute waste today, worst on the pitch for me.

2362~~~
For me that is the worrying thing. I'm not even seeing any glimpse of ability with the ball at his feet.

2363~~~
Its time not to drop him and Rooney... And NEVER use Young again as fullback.

2364~~~
It's disappointing to see fans turning on him already. Everyone accepted when we signed him that he'd need time and we'd see inconsistency. It's clear that he's got it in him to be a top class player.

2365~~~
Not ready to be given such an important role.

2366~~~
Same here. He has a very good shot and cross in him but that's about it, really. Some on here keep harping on that he has a very high ceiling but I haven't seen any evidence of that at all. If anything, he is one trick pony personified. A selfish one trick pony with little pace.

I realise different players develop at a different age and at a different speed but I don't even remember Nani being this poor when he was 21.

2367~~~
He's feckin shit. Just runs into 3 players all the time and I actually think I'm quicker than him

2368~~~
He's a very nothing player in all honesty.

2369~~~
I wouldn't say it's clear at all. Martial is an example of a player who clearly has it in him to be top drawer, his qualities are there to see. Memphis could go either way. I'm still supporting him obviously and hoping he will come good in the long run but he shouldn't be an automatic starter at the moment. Bring him on slowly and take him out of the limelight a bit.

2370~~~
He is basically what Nani was like when he first came to the club.

Obviously the fact that we sold a now-matured and more consistent Nani last summer seems a bit odd.

Happy to give Memphis time as his is undoubtedly talented (and I said the same about Nani) but there is no denying that at the moment he isnt doing particularly well. I had hoped he might hit the ground running like Martial, or others in the past such as Hazard.

2371~~~
There's a player in there somewhere but right now he's simply not good enough. I suggested before we signed him and at the start of the season that he wasn't the kind of player we should have been looking at and that his lack of dribbling ability would be a big hindrance. Got some greenies and abuse for saying that but he hasn't done anything to change my mind.

feck know why we loaned away Januzaj or sold Nani. Speaking of Nani, those comparisons should be buried now. He'll do very well to reach anywhere near Nani's level.

2372~~~
Completely shite today.

2373~~~
Really disappointed with him today. I can accept when players have an off day and lose possession or nothing comes off in the attack, but to not track back and help Young when it clear for all to see he needed it was criminal today. It was like he was playing his own game where he's not allowed to cross the half way line and defend. He'll learn from this defeat today though.

2374~~~
Except without the ridiculous amount of skill and ability that Nani had you mean?

He has the inconsistency though, thats for sure.

2375~~~
I don't agree with fans turning on him. But some fans like me, had serious doubts about him even  before he signed. Doubts that have only been reinforced since his signing. In the newbies last season, I kept saying his dribbling was very poor and his not good at making any space for himself. Those are difficiencies that will only be more glaring in a league that offers even less space that the Dutch league. I wouldn't even say he's been inconsistent. Performances like this have been fairly consistent this season with the exception of Bruge.

2376~~~
I don't think it's a case on people turning on him. We as a team cannot afford to carry players, we aren't that good or that superior in most games. Whilst a talent, we can't develop him at the cost of the team. That's not to say we shouldn't play him. It's to say he shouldn't have the left wing spot handed to him for every game. Let him earn it. Young is better atm and should start. Memphis can come on for 30mins and earn the spot for himself like Young did last season.

2377~~~
Next Arjen Robben or next Ryan Babel?

Early days yet, and at least he's shown he can score and create. Bought with the future in mind, as LvG has admitted, so let's just give him a chance.

2378~~~
Yep, I follow the Holland national team quite closely and I wasn't particularly excited when we signed him.

2379~~~
Aye. The nani comparisons are baffling. Nani was a ridiculously talented player. Had it all. Pace, dribbling, shot, the lot. Shame he was too damn inconsistent and couldn't turn it on regularly. Memphis isn't as talented as him.

2380~~~
Inconsistent is being kind. He's mostly been shite.

2381~~~
Spot on. Nani was a much more talented player then Memphis.

2382~~~
Don't think anybody's turning on him, it's just clear that he's been poor for us since he's joined bar those two Brugges matches and probably that one goal against PSV, people are just stating what you can see in front of you. Sure, he might develop into a great player but he's far from being one right now and on top of that his attitude can easily be questioned because he seems like he doesn't give a feck.

You can get into fans' hearts by either playing brilliant football (like Martial is) or working your ass off every game (like Park did). He's doing none at the moment and he needs to get his shit together. Possibly on the bench.

2383~~~
There are a few here that have already written him but i agree with everything you've said.

2384~~~
agree.

2385~~~
Said it before, you can't predict how long a young player coming from a poorer league to make a big step will take to show his best. It's been made worse that him and Martial were the only attacking signings with half the forwards at the club getting sold or loaned. It puts way too much pressure on him and when he doesn't immediately bring his best then this kind of reaction happens.

2386~~~
Memphis was very poor but in fairness this is still him settling in to a far higher level. For me it is on LVGs shoulders for having it so we must rely and two such very young players for goals, as their form will come and go

2387~~~
you beat me to saying this (altho i still said it). I think most fans understand that we should be patient at least, they are just less vocal in here

2388~~~
Been pretty bad the whole time.

2389~~~
People are not turning on him, most here think that Young deserves to start and he should be bedded in slowly.

2390~~~
Ah not everyone but there are definitely some questioning his potential. Still early days yet let's hope we see some additions in January.

2391~~~
Memphis has yet to show his acclaimed high ceiling, though. In a case like this it would be silly to <i>not</i> question his potential. I remember watching Nani when he first burst into the scene and as inconsistent as he is these days, the 21 year-old Nani showed great potential not seen in Memphis.

2392~~~
Things aren't coming off for him. Needs to be benched and introduced against tiring teams at the end of games.

2393~~~
Scoring a brace in the fashion he did on his European debut shows some great potential to me. The goals and assists he's bagged so far have been pretty special.

2394~~~
I wouldn't mind seeing Lingard replace him for a game or two. At least he'll play with some passion.

Or we should have Blind at LB, Jones at CB and play Young on the left. Memphis needs to learn a lot before he can play against defenses that won't give him the space he was used to in the Dutch league or got in the game against Brugge.

2395~~~
True. Got an easy ride from the press and fans so far. He is talented but lets face it...he has been shit so far.

Im not wrting him off until 10 games into next season.

2396~~~
Goals against a very poor team in Club Brugge riddled with injuries. There's a good player in him but I just don't think he's United quality. I'd love it if he proved me wrong in the future but I'll be surprised if he makes it here.

2397~~~
I've mentioned it before after other games, but considering the amount of stick Mata, sometimes Rooney, for their lack of defensive deficiencies, this guy gets away with it. He may be quick, but he often doesn't track back and defensively is just very lazy. If you're banging in the goals, making an impact going forward, I'll accept it but, he's not offering anything at the moment.

2398~~~
He shouldnt be a starter. He has only played good against Brugge but in all other games he was one of the worse players on the field. Young should start.

2399~~~
I remember in the summer when people were predicting our best line-up and I questioned on here a couple of times the idea that Memphis would be in our strongest XI and starting every week. A young player moving to a much stronger league with a lot of expectations on him it's going to take time. Ronaldo was very inconsistent for a couple of seasons, so was Nani (and remained so). He should be starting on the bench more and be coming on with a point to prove.

2400~~~
Too early to give up on Memphis.

2401~~~
He has nothing special in his game at all, average pace, average dribbling skills, average crossing, average strength, Bang on average player. 
The frustrating thing is, he will always lose the ball and never track back to get it, it annoys me. With Nani and ronaldo at the start you could see there was a player there, in memphis its just not visible. All he does is, cut in try a dribble loose the ball and repeat. The worst player on the pitch easily. He needs time out of the team, play wilson on left or young. Hell play rooney there and play herera in 10. I know he scored a lot of goals in holland but so did alfonso alves, he just does not seem to have anything that can possitively contribute to us right now. Its problematic we carry one player in  rooney, now carrying 2 will kill us like today.

2402~~~
I get that he's one for the future and its daft to write him off so early, But he certainly needs to be left out for a few games and be taken out of the limelight a little bit.

He doesn't look good enough (yet!) to be one of 3 players leading our attacking line.

Our captain also needs to 'pick up a knock' and miss a few games I think.

2403~~~
I honestly can't see what he's actually very good at. He's just so 'meh'.

2404~~~
They weren't as bad a side as some were making out and the technical level displaced was pretty impressive, I'm just that wasn't just a flash in the pan.

2405~~~
They were missing about half of their first team players if iirc.

2406~~~
He needs to be benched for a few games, too much too soon.

2407~~~
At the moment. There's a good chance this post will look daft in 12/18 months time.

2408~~~
I thought he was pretty good at dribbling like Hazard is, it appears not to be. At least not yet

2409~~~
I agree. He should earn his place with good performances from the bench and in the League Cup instead of arriving here and being gifted the 7 shirt and a starting place. Let him come on in some games when the opposition is tired and he can get more space.

2410~~~
He's clearly a very talented player, but he's young and naive in many respects. He needs time to settle and develop. Unfortunately, with our thin squad he's found himself in the starting 11 more frequently than his performances have merited. Don't lose sight of the fact that Van Gaal hauled him off at half time. That's important. Yes, he was very poor today, but some perspective is required.

2411~~~
He was awful but I think its because our Zombie play.
He will be asset in fast attacking play but slow Zombie play is not his style.

2412~~~
I bloody well hope so! I'm just struggling to see which are the standout areas of his game atm. As one of the posters above said, he doesn't seem particularity fast or skillful. Nor does he seem to be a very good dribbler, finisher, or crosser.

2413~~~
A lot of people thought he will me similar player for us. Don’t know why to be honest, even if you’ve seen him on some YT clips you could see his strengths are totally different to him.

2414~~~
Performance has dropped quite a bit. Maybe he feels he'll get the left wing spot regardless of how he plays. I mean, despite Young being great when he come on against Liverpool, Depay still played the next game, and continues to do so. Think he needs a few games on the bench.

2415~~~
He's more similar to Lingard than he is to Nani or Hazard...

2416~~~
To be fair to Memphis he does have a solid (at times hit-and-miss) shot and cross in him but that aside, unfortunately, he's close to being more or less a nothing player. I really can't see the reason why some on here keep on harping about his alleged high ceiling. There hasn't been evidence of that whatsoever.

2417~~~
we might as well have kept Nani. 

He's much more effective than Memphis at least Nani could actually go past his man

2418~~~
He and Rooney need to play for their places instead of being guranteed a starting XI spot. Competition for places. If we'd signed Pedro maybe he and Mata wouldn't need to start every game.

2419~~~
He's been poor for a while, and has become even poorer since Shaw's injury.

2420~~~
They aren't Scunthorpe or Doncaster though. It wasn't the goals he got that was impressive, it's how they got them, the finishing and technique.

2421~~~
One swallow does not a summer make. My point being, Macheda took his goal against Villa in 2009 incredibly well and at one point he went on loan to... Doncaster.

2422~~~
Slaughtered in here today then. 

Stats:
0 shots
12/16 passes
75% completion
2/4 lost passes were through balls into the box
1/3 take ons
0/3 crosses
2 ball recoveries
1/1 tackles
1/1 clearances

That tells me he wasn't as bad as people are making out though I agree he didn't have a very good game. He needs to improve his tracking and defensive side but again, there is a caveat to this because it appears to be a clear instruction for him to remain high up the pitch as an outlet ball. That said, his failings today were also part of a unit failure across the attacking midfield zone. Rooney and Mata suffered today (Rooney in particular in that first half) and allowed Arsenal to over run us too easily. 

There also needs to be respect shown to Arsenal themselves, they dominated us and sometimes you're just not going to get a good game in the face of that sort of opening spell and 45 minutes of action.

Also interesting to note that there was not 1 pass between Memphis and Martial. Whether that was a deliberate instruction, knowing that both players are likely to want to be on the end of a move rather than links within a chain.

2423~~~
People are too harsh on him.

2424~~~
He's a big talent but not ready yet, makes plenty of wrong decisions and it always feels that he's lazy or too causal on the pitch, he needs to be benched for a while.

2425~~~
What i see in every game is Memphis being doubled in every game. Everytime he get the bal the RB one more just press him and he have nowhere to go. What he can do is to watch the videos how teams are defending against him and watch where the space opens when they do that because everytime 2 players press him it must be the space to pass somewhere.

2426~~~
And that wasn't an exhaustive list of his accomplishments either, he's show us plenty of moments of genuine quality, he just needs to be a little more consistent with it.

2427~~~
was truly awlful today!!!

offered nothing up front, was selfish, didnt work hard enough, didnt track back at all, reminded me off Nani!

he cant keep giving performaces like that, he isnt good enough to be that much of a passenger!

2428~~~
the most disappointing stat there is his one tackle....

we were slaughtered down that side in the first half and I didn't see him helping Ashley Young, who was clearly struggling....

I'm not overly bothered about goals and assists - they will come - but he needs to work much harder for the team

2429~~~
When he has the ball bellerin and cazorla double teamed him straight away, he was rarely ever free to take him on. The midfield or young never supported him very well either. Defensively though he could definitely do more, I think young should have perhaps started on the wing but because Valencia played badly he obviously wanted to give young a go in defence. 

Either way we massively miss Shaw.

2430~~~
Lingard is more intelligent and better passer and finisher.

2431~~~
Some of the criticism is very over the top. These are growing pains, he has already shown enough glimpses of quality to ge<span style="font-size: 16px">t excited about. I do think Van Gaal should take him out for a spell, he needs to know that he has competition for his place.</span>

2432~~~
He'd look far better in a 433 than this 4231.

He'd have less defensive work and could stay higher up the pitch.

2433~~~
Since joining he's had one good game against Brugge all other games he's been pretty poor.

2434~~~
He'll come good he just needs a break for a bit, but the Shaw injury is making that tough, maybe Rooney on the left for a bit when Herrera gets back .

2435~~~
Basically this. But apparently pointing that out makes you a 'hater'. 

All in all, he's been massively massively disappointing, and hasn't shown even close the quality I was hoping for. Inconsistency is one thing, and we all expected it, its the fact that he's just now showing much basic qualities that is the real worry. In all honesty, he just doesn't look all <i>that </i>talented.

2436~~~
I will give him plenty of time, because he will work hard and he will become great, but you do wonder what the difference is between Martial and Memphis. Martial is 2 years younger, doesn't speak the language, didn't have a preseason but still looks far better than Memphis. Interesting to see how the two develop.

2437~~~
Surprised by the ridicilously low standards by some posters. Giving time is one thing but top 4 is no guarantee for United like in the Ronaldo days. And yes, Ronaldo was given time too but Ronaldo at 21 was much better than Memphis so let's stop using the 'Ronaldo was given time' excuse. It's not just that offensively he doesn't perform good enough, he also has a serious lack of motivation to track back and he looks annoyed all the time. Let's call a spade a spade.

2438~~~
Don't see the talent at all in this guy, what you would expect from a talented youngster is what Martial is doing now or at least what Januzaj was doing in his season with Moyes. Memphis basically reminds me of Nani except that Nani was actually good every now and again

2439~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-IyXxoyyFr8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
This is ronaldo's debut @17, i think people are crazy if they think memphis is something special. 

Memphis does not come close to that at all. He does not have the pace, the skill or the crossing ronaldo had. He has more strength but by the time ronaldo was 21 he had surpassed memphis in that too. Yes its an unfair comparison, but people asking for him not to be dropped and those who think he is an elite talent need to see this and smell the coffee. I think memphis right now does not have much going for him, he is average.

2440~~~
His decision making is virtually non existent in a lot of matches he's played in so far. He doesn't seem to be aware of what is around him, a lot of times today he allowed himself to get boxed in by Arsenal's defenders when the better option clearly would've been to lay the ball off to a team mate.

It's a bit premature of posters to compare him to Nani so early on in his United career, the lad clearly has talent but will take time to develop.

2441~~~
Replace harsh with clueless. I guarantee in a new look side with no Rooney, Mata and Carrick. . He'd come good long term.  He is definitely better than Nani but obviously no Ronaldo.  

He needs freedom to play his game and needs a quick side around him so he can have more space to work with.  I also think Martial taking the limelight must be a shock for him too. . He'll adjust to it and become the star we need him to be. 

The focus should be on Rooney not Depay.

2442~~~
Does he? He <i>looks</i> big but when actually forced into a physical battle, he's weak as piss.

2443~~~
But he doesn't. van Gaal loaned his competition away.

2444~~~
Wasn't PSV mainly a counter-attacking side? Not making excuses for him, but it could be him adapting to how we play, although he did play under LvG for Holland.

2445~~~
my issue is no matter what formation we play, he isn't good enough to feel he never has to track back, today young was getting ripped apart and he didnt support him at all!
you need to be a very speical talent to get away with that, and Memphis isn't at the moment!

2446~~~
Even one of the best winger in the world "Eden Hazard" Has not done much more than Memphis this season and many here says Memphis is shit... What the hell is Hazard then?? He is supposed to be World Class player..

2447~~~
Thats not a certainty at all. In fact, I'd say its the complete opposite at this stage.

Nani looked like a much more talented player at Memphis' age. He just couldn't put it all together properly. Memphis, quite frankly, doesn't look like he's got many tools in his locker at all. 

As for 'needing more space to work with', well if he needs that to do well, then he's not that good is he?

2448~~~
Not good today and a somewhat underwhelming start to his United career but opposition teams clearly see him as a threat otherwise they wouldn't bother to double up on him so consistently as already noted in this thread.

He looks short of ideas on how to deal with this at the minute and maybe this is only exacerbated by the teams slow build up and generally having to receive the ball whilst static and facing set defences sitting deep. Some time as an impact sub might give him a little time to reflect on this new challenge and adjust accordingly.

He is young so needs time but isn't putting in performances worthy of a starting role right now and should be used accordingly.

2449~~~
We shall see whose proven right in the end but I think people are way too premature with Depay. He has plenty of tools,  he's getting double marked and that isn't the issue its the fact we don't have enough threats in the team other than Martial and we move the ball around too slowly. It makes him look poorer than he is. 

Everyone needs to get a grip.  Taking out one of the few quick braver players we have with some decent technical quality is brainless. . Lets get rid of the old men who have no future here and have no improvement in their game.

2450~~~
I think he's due a spell on the bench but I'm not sure if LvG will move Young out of LB just yet.

He should get a recording of Sanchez performance and see how it's done, talent doesn't exclude the need to work, even Hazard had to learn that.

2451~~~
Tbf you're arguing with a guy who's gone from this..



To this...

In just over a month. He doesn't seem to do shades of grey.

2452~~~
Yeah, we can always give Pereira some minutes as well.

2453~~~
That would be a good idea, at least for home games, Pereira has been brought up with the work ethic at the club.

2454~~~
Al those quotes are from pre-season, where he looked really exciting.

2455~~~
Yeah, I'm sure LvG will sort it out with Memphis. Rooney is a bigger problem atm.

2456~~~
I still believe he needs time to adjust to a new league, but at the same time, I am dissapointed, I thought hed have a much bigger impact  in our team, very underwhelmed by him tbh, but as I said he has time on his side, some players improve when theyre 24-25, they hit their prime, but at the moment he is pretty shit

2457~~~
This is where lack of depth is hurting. He doesn't look anywhere near ready for the role he's being expected to play. 

If only we had some young wide players on the books who could challenge for the place...

2458~~~
He's been pathetic bar 1-2 games. Extremely sluggish on the ball and thinks he has all the time in the world before being robbed time and time again by average opposition players.

It's quite concerning when all the tabloids on him are about his night club antics, hanging around celebrity females and not performances on the pitch.

2459~~~
Drives me up the wall that.

2460~~~
Drives me up the wall that.

2461~~~
Were killing him tbh. Were mentally burning him out and today was clearly a game he should not have started.

2462~~~
Not impressed, don't think he is STAR quality. He can go on to become a good level player. But he has a lot of work to do. Not the smartest, not tenacious enough. Can't really beat players 1 on 1. I think he's too big, too much muscle. I think it may be affecting his agility.

2463~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2464~~~
How many times has he been hooked off at half time now? Awful start for him so far. Maybe this proves the dutch league is as awful as everyone says it is?

2465~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

@Raess point still stands though, there are far more worrying players in the team.

2466~~~
He's a young lad who needs time to develop his game. I think we probably won't see what he can offer us until next season, or perhaps even longer. 

The real problem is that we basically bet the house on him hitting the ground running, which he hasn't been able to do. And he's not the type to keep it simply to get his confidence up.

2467~~~
but im not sure their was a more troubling performance then Memphis's today, lots of players where struggling today, but the lack of willingness by Memphis to track back and support young when he was getting torn apart, is very worrying, you have to be a very special player to get away with that, and Memphis isn't yet.

<a class="username" data-user="43572, @Raees" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/43572/">@Raees</a> talks about the emphasis should be on Rooney, not Memphis, and thier is no doubt Rooney is way off form and probably on form also deserves to be dropped, but he is still trying and working for the team, and frankly did a better job both attackingly and defensively on the left wing then Memphis did today.

Im not saying those writing Memphis of at this early stage arn't daft, but it was a very troubling performance, and he needs a massive kick up the arse for that display and probably a spell on the bench.

2468~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> caught out there <a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a>

2469~~~
As I said, those 3 posts were all from pre-season where he looked really exciting.

He's been very poor since the real stuff has started though, and he's been very easy to nullify. Its been a massive disappointment so far.

2470~~~
A stint of a few matches to the bench for Memphis while Pereira gets the nod wouldn't hurt one bit.

2471~~~
And then if Pereira comes in, doesn't make too much of an impact he'll be shite too.

 It's terrible management to let so many go and bring in only 2 attackers. To be relying so heavily on a young lad, who has just come from a poorer league and will need time to adjust has done absolutely nothing to help him settle and just puts much more pressure on him. There's no way she should've been starting every game but apart from Young, who is now covering at full back there isn't another option. Memphis should be doing better but he's been done no favours.

2472~~~
He's not at all ready. Step up from Eridivise to PL proved too much for him. I guess we'll see best of him in 12-18 months time.

As for this thread it's been a typical Caf with people hyping him up ten folds before the season to complete polar opposite right now.

2473~~~
I think he just needs a time out. A break. Drop him against Everton and CSKA and bring him back on for the City game. He is again going to play in the international break. He looks knackered. 

There is potential but he isn't getting any help with Shaw out for the season. Shaw draws so much attention and that would have helped him immensely settle in and find his feet these first couple of months. Now with no proper fullback every team doesn't have to worry about Young overlapping him and just double team Memphis.

2474~~~
So what? Memphis is stuck playing with Holland and he has been utter shite for a while now. We cannot afford to have a young and complacent player piling up shit performances in our squad.

You want to talk about man management, I don't think it would be bad man management if the manager creates the internal competition with someone of the same age bracket, especially someone who has been raised in the system. The truth is that Memphis hasn't felt a genuine threat for his spot as of yet since Ashley Young went back down to his "normal" levels. I read about the days when Giggs and Sharpe fought each other for that left wing spot, and I believe that avenue should be taken once again with our 2 young wide players, Memphis and Pereira, fighting for a spot down that left side until one of them takes a full grasp of it to be the regular guy.

2475~~~
He's like a bad version of Nani.

2476~~~
Depth is an issue. He would have competition if we still had Rafael and weren't forced to move Young back to fullback. He still could with Perreira hopefully. We are woefully thin and that's not beneficial to the younger players we have. Martial is going to play damn near every game this season at this rate. That is going to lead to burn out. Our only other option is Rooney and we have seen how he has looked this season. Memphis is suffering at the moment and needs to be dropped due to form alone. The bigger issue was his level of effort. Fergie would have been screaming at him after 5 minutes and hauled him off after 30.  That type of display is how you get a boot kicked at your face. There was no tracking back today. I'd be curious to see a heat map because before Martial arrived he was routinely our furthest player forward. That type of display today is shambolic and not representative of Manchester United.

2477~~~
He genuinely needs to bulk down. He's not agile enough to be playing on the wing at the minute.

2478~~~
Would agree with this. He's too bulky and makes it harder for him to get around people quickly and change directions. Not worried about him long term, but he needs to improve his decision making if he'll be starting every game.

2479~~~
Again, he needs to lose some mass. He's clearly not got the flexibility to accommodate all of that mass. If he wants to be a winger he has to be agile

2480~~~
Everyone saw this coming. He is a player we need to get used to, extremely frustrating but we need to stick with him and hope. Don't see an issue with resting him for a bit but we're going to have to wait a while before Depay can shine.

2481~~~
He needs a break. Needs to train some other tricks. Needs to find out a way to deal with 2 opposition players. 
He needs to go to bench.

2482~~~
Hazard being out of form, does not make Memphis any better. The whole Chelsea team is a mess. I dont know why we are even comparing our mess with theirs.

2483~~~
Think its time he losses his starting place, hes a brilliant player but he has a lot to learn and is far too immature to be starting every game.

2484~~~
Feck me Raees it's you that is coming across as clueless here. You cannot at this moment say he is better than Nani or has ever been better at Nani at any stage of their careers so far. Martial taking the limelight should be a blessing for Depay and your other point we are discussing Depay not Rooney in this thread.

2485~~~
All of this. It's good to be positive, but Memphis doesn't show to much promise. I just don't think he has the talent to make it here. We currently really need attacking players with speed and great technique. Memphis doesn't show much signs of having these attributes. I hope I'll be proved wrong, but I don't have much faith.

2486~~~
One thing is adjusting to the league but another, bigger issue is this:
I said it at the beginning, he looks like a player whose assets let him thrive in counter attacking system where he could find much more space to cut in and shoot. It was obvious that it’ll be difficult for him to adjust, so level of current performances isn’t really unexpected. I am more surprised how much van Gaal is playing him.

But I wonder what is so special about him that we send Januzaj on loan and made him our starter. Don’t see it, and I still maintain that both Januzaj and Pereira have much more potential than Depay. 

He might turn out good but I actually have my doubts over him, at the moment he doesn’t possess any winger attributes, and if he is to play as a striker then we already have one who is a couple of levels above him.

2487~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Calls people clueless and then proceeds to say Depay is <i>definitely</i> better than Nani! Give your head a fecking wobble. Depay will do very well to reach the heights Young and Valencia have in their careers nevermind Nani.

True. No idea where this myth of him being a very good dribbler came from. I think he has some good tricks and turns in his locker ((See the PSV game) but as a dribbler he's not very good in general. His strengths lie elsewhere.

2488~~~
I think his decision making is poor. He doesn't have a clue when it makes sense to dribble and when it is pointless to do it.

2489~~~
His work rate was pathetic esp when the sh!t hit the fan and we needed him to work harder.

He wants to strut around on the left wing like he is Ronaldo, sorry Memphis you have to earn that right by producing like Ronaldo, until then get your head down and work.

2490~~~
So much for giving the lad time then, Utd fans on here will never change

2491~~~
course the kid needs time, but he does need a massive kick up the arse after yesterday, its one thing to take time to adapt to the higher quality of the premiership, its quite another not to support your team mates at all, which he didn't yesterday.

2492~~~
I agree with giving him time, i think we need to give him a fair go before passing final judgement, LVG warned us at the start of the season not to expect too much in his first season.

I think people are also expecting too much after seeing the way Martial has started.

What is frustrating the fans is despite him being so poor he's still starting, he needs to be benched.

2493~~~
Of course he needs to get playing time. But that doesnt mean every PL,CL and Cup match.

2494~~~
He should be a bench player for the moment.

Thing is, we don't really have that many other options.

Unless LVG decides to give Wilson a run and perhaps move Martial to LW, then Depay will probably continue to start.

2495~~~
Young should play there.

2496~~~
Well, I agree, but apparently LVG sees Young more as a replacement LB at the moment - a move I predicted in another thread would see us come undone. Unbelievable. Young was slaughtered forever on this forum, and frankly, he's still a very average player who's had a few decent games when our star of the future as failed and been hauled off. Young is a bit of a false dawn if you ask me, but is definitely a winger, one who should replace Depay at the moment, rather than a full back.

2497~~~
He has got talent but I do not see the huge potential like some others. I also do not see him reaching the level of the often slated Nani at his peak. The direct comparison to Martial does not do him any good either.

With our limited options I would still keep him in the starting 11 and hope he proves his doubters wrong.
In the worst case we might need at least 2 attacking players next summer.

2498~~~
Agree Young is average but he was one of our better players last year and is rediculous how Memphis is starting over him despite hoe poor he has been. I agree Young is not the long term solution but in our current pool of players he is the best option available.

It's also stupid playing him at LB when we have Jones fit, Blind or Darmian can play LB, i don't think that excuse cuts that playing him LB is our only option. Overall Shaw getting injured is one of the worst things to happen to the team.

2499~~~
His big problem is that he has the work ethic of Ronaldo however, he just isn't providing anything down the other end of the pitch to warrant the lack of work rate. If Memphis was performing to his abilities upfront, I'm not sure anyone would be that bothered by his lack of defensive work.

2500~~~
Agree, pretty much what i said earlier.

2501~~~
He's only looked good when he's been afforded enough space to make it easy for him.

Looking back on his PSV highlights from last season, he looks fantastic on the break, when he he defenders running back towards their goal. Shame this hardly ever happens to us due to the snail paced build up play we employ.

What's the point of having players like Depay and Martial if you're not going to play to their strengths? fecking madness.

2502~~~
I think his attitude so far has told me everything I need to know about him. He doesn't have that mentality and work rate needed to be one of the best IMO.

I've been really disappointed by him, and must say I agree in some of the posts questioning what he brings to us, Because apart from being a winger that occasionally chips in with a goal, I also struggle to see it.

2503~~~
His bad form coincides with Luke Shaw's absence from the squad. Luke helped him a lot in the attacking third of the pitch, taking defenders away with his speed and providing another point of attack.
He's been poorer since Luke's injury. Also, Memphis is not as quick as I thought he would be. Playing the wing or inside forward well you need to be quick. It's a big part of playing in that position. Before the injury, Luke provided that pace and gave more room for Memphis to operate.

2504~~~
Is he really an upgrade on Nani?. I believe Nani at his age was better and had a terrific first season with us.

2505~~~
I think Nani was better than Memphis is now when he arrived. Nani was good though to be fair, he just never developed the consistency.

2506~~~
Nani was less frustrating in my opinion because he was always trying to provide for teammates in matches. Sure he got it wrong plenty of times, but he was trying to make that killer pass or cross to set up a teammate. 

Depay seems like he's going to make very average passes (often misplaced) and weak crosses and only really come alive when he can shoot himself and perhaps get on the scoresheet. He doesnt track back more than Nani either. It definitely looks like a mistake not to keep Nani to compete for his place

2507~~~
He's lacking confidence, and he's the type of player SAF could make feel 10 ft tall. I don't know if LvG will be able to do the same.

2508~~~
Give him time to do what? He's started 12 of our 13 games this season, and been very poor in 8 or 9 of them. Consistently playing him, every week, doesn't send the right message to him or the rest of the team. He's, essentially, being told that he'll start no matter his performances. At his age, he needs to be taken away from the first team and relegated to the bench, for a while. The lack of effort yesterday was appalling and he MUST learn from his mistakes. However, this cannot achieved by starting him again next time round.

I'm not the biggest Young fan, and haven't always been impressed by him, however, Memphis can learn so much from him. Whilst Memphis was being a lazy sh*t, yesterday, Young was working his arse off to track Bellerin and Ramsey as well trying to get forward to instigate some sort of comeback. We desperately needed Memphis to give everything he had, but he failed woefully, and that cannot be excused. And please don't try the "he's Young" excuse. His performance, or lack of, wasn't acceptable. He needs to be dropped, and if he doesn't, then something is wrong behind the scenes. 

I'm all for starting him, even if he's playing poorly, but not after yesterdays effort.

2509~~~
i dont think he is lacking in confidence, the kid has bags of confidence, every time he gets it he feels like he can do it all himself, he needs to learn at the moment he can't.

also needs to learn he isnt good enough not to track back, think right now over confidence maybe one of the kids problems

2510~~~
Sorry but <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2511~~~
He probably should sit out a while. Taking a youngster out of the firing line sounds good to me.

2512~~~
He needs to get his act together, hes missing Shaw badly though at the moment and Schewinsteger was all over the pitch so Depay was getting double teamed constantly.
Even with that though he wasnt giving any cover to the defense which is a worry.

2513~~~
Maybe the problem with that is our lack of quality options on the wings? It's not his fault, that most of the fans and seemingly LVG put too much hopes/pressure on him to be a hit straight away. We should have added at least one more good player on the flanks to avoid that scenario. 

The lazy as sh*t part applies to Mata on the other side too and most others didn't exactly covered themselves in glory yesterday either, so why single out Memphis?

Don't know why most people are surprised that he didn't take the league by storm, because it is just natural for a player with his skillset and style to struggle first. Someone who plays it safe, like Darmian for example, is more likely to make a smooth transition to another league. Memphis is a risk taker, a dribbler and someone who is willing to make things happen every time he receives the ball. That style of play, especially for a young player who just joined the club from a lower league, is predestined to be frustrating at first. 

He has all the attributes to become a really good player and what surprised me most was his attitude. He comes across as someone who demands a lot from himself, which is a good thing in the long run, but right now it seems to hamper him in some way. You can see it after every misplaced attempt, that he quarrels with himself. He just needs to calm down a bit, enjoy his football and the rest will come with time. If he once starts going, he won't look back. 

But in the meantime the best thing the fans can do, is to support and be patient with him.

2514~~~
1 - why single him out? Well it's the Depay thread - did I miss something?

2 - all the attributes? I see a lack of pace, bad decision making i.e. he's not an instinctive player and a work rate that leaves something to be desired. 

So far he has not shown me that he has anything that matches the hype.

English football is so different to european football and with LVGs tactics of boring other teams to death somehow you feel that Depay's chances of being a big success are diminishing rapidly.

2515~~~
Right.. sure. Well we shall see, the battle lines have been drawn clearly when it comes to peoples perception of Depay. I look forward to reading your thoughts on Depay in a few more years.

2516~~~
Makes loaning out Januzaj such a stupid decision.

2517~~~
He needs to be benched. Let's be honest, he came into the team and was gifted a starting spot despite Young being solid last season. Memphis looks as if he thinks he has already made the Ronaldo level. He doesn't track back at all, and that was fine when Luke Shaw was at LB but without Shaw Memphis has to work. If he doesn't want to work then he's gotta go. Some cameo appearances will be good for him, give him a chance to rest too. I still think there is a player there. Just needs some time.

2518~~~
No problem mate, people see different level of potential in players. I have not seen anything from Depay to make me think he will be a better player than Januzaj (who has shown more promising signs for me) and Pereira (who's got all the tools, which in my opinion Memphis lacks). 

He would be behind both of them if I got to choose who gets playing time.

2519~~~
He was top scorer for PSV in a title winning season and has been very good for Netherlands at the World Cup. That's far more than Januzaj and especially Pereira have ever done.

Having him behind Pereira who's barely played 30 minutes for United is bonkers and reminds me of times when people hyped up <insert random United youngster who now plays for Wolves/Chester/Wigan>.

Unless he become another Pogba in which case I'll be eating my words. In 2012 I saw more in Pogba though than I've seen in Pereira or Januzaj.

2520~~~
I think we all knew it was a stupid decision from the begining

2521~~~
I can understand why people are pissed off with his lack of effort but as I said earlier in the thread people would not be complaining about his lack of tracking back if he was carrying a bigger threat upfront, in that Arsenal game among others he hasn't been cutting and that's why people get pissed off. At the end of the day Memphis is a wide forward not a winger, he's never going to have that defensive side to his game. In my opinion LVG should compensate for this by playing a 4-3-3 where the midfield can do more of the defensive side of the game.

My original comment was aimed at those posters in this forum that are already saying they can't see a future for him and that he has no talent. Memphis showed last season that when on his game he is an elite level talent and we have seen glimpses of that in a Utd shirt as well. I do agree that he has been poor in a lot of our games, particularly in the league and I have to admit that I did expect a lot more from him from the off. That's not to say tho that he can't still become a massive player for us in the future. I think for the next few games it would be wise to take him out the spotlight and let young have a run, but I doubt it will have that great an effect on our overall performance like people are making it out.

2522~~~
Did you deliberately misspell Januzaj?

2523~~~
It's looking like it. Not because Januzaj is a bad loan but because Memphis doesn't anywhere good enough to make impact in the league.

2524~~~
Officially worried now about Memphis.

It's still really early days and I think he will come good, but he was woeful on Sunday and he's not been much better all season. Might take him a while to get going.

2525~~~
Memphis is nowhere near the level of talent of Pogba as well.There're a lot of top scorers in the Dutch league that turned out to be average/shit in England (not saying he will as I have high expectation for him long-term).And if you're comparing Pereira and Januzaj to <insert random United youngster who now plays for Wolves/Chester/Wigan> then you're the clueless one here.People should judge young players on which attributes they possess that can make a difference for them at top level, not these "what have they done" bollocks.

2526~~~
Pretty sickening the fair weather support some of our players get.

2527~~~
It makes for grim reading, sure, but at the end of the day, the players don't see us bitching and moaning on the Caf. One would hope we're not like the eejits who bombard their twitter pages after an abject performance.

2528~~~
It just highlights the scourge of instant gratification muppets that scamper into these threads like a swarm of locusts every time a player mis kicks a ball. Everything that's wrong with football in the social media age imo.

2529~~~
True.

2530~~~
That's not really the case is it? No player should be beyond criticism, he's been rightly called out for playing poorly for about 10 out of 13 games. Most people want him to be benched, which is a fair argument for an underperforming player,  there's only a minority saying he's rubbish.

2531~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Are you calling a press conference?

2532~~~
You cannot possibly know the degree of talent Depay has by looking at his progress at United so far because he's clearly been nowhere near his best. He might not be on Pogba's level but he's certainly got significant potential and I'd say more players who did as well as him in Holland went on to be good elsewhere than not. You had the odd Kezman or Afonso Alves but they were limited players who managed to rack up great numbers thanks to good support cast at their teams compared to other Eredivisie sides, Depay didn't really rely on support to similar extent.

Pereira and Januzaj are yet to prove themselves at any level. Januzaj has shown glimpses of true talent but Pereira has not played any amount of professional football that would make it possible to assess his level. Let's wait until he makes a breakthrough before we start comparing him with Dutch international with over 100 senior games. Depay has been poor so far here but it's 10 games into the season, the amount of stick he's receiving is absurd.

2533~~~
Who said players should not be criticized ? BTW, the fact that anyone has counted the amount of games he has "underperformed" in is a bit creepy and depressing, and just underscores my point.

2534~~~
Looking at these threads it's like a players are immune to having bad games.

2535~~~
Not really, he's been that bad you can count the number of good performances in one hand and minus that from the total games he played which is conveniently found on the top of the page, it's not rocket science and not creepy at all. 

If he continues to play poorly he will be criticised, just like any other underperforming player.

2536~~~
This isn't about criticism - it's about the instant gratification psychology that underpins how we discuss player performances.

2537~~~
People asking for him to be benched is a reasonable assessment, it's nothing to do with being fair weathered.

2538~~~
I agree it's madness to expect things from him straight away, there's only a minority of posters who have written him off. Most posters have agreed he needs time to prove himself, but should be dropped.

2539~~~
That's a fair criticism imo. Writing him off isn't.

2540~~~
Which I agree with. Players like Memphis, Martial, Perreira, Januzaj, McNair etc are still very young and can't be expected to consistently perform like they're in the prime of their respective careers. They will blow hot and cold and we have to be patient with that process.

2541~~~
There's no patience with fans these days cause everyone's looking for instant gratification. You can't expect a young player to have consistent games week in week out, not blow hot then cold and at the same time call for them to be benched. How does a club grow if it's own fans can't get behind the young players who are coming through from the academy or a 19 or 20 year old who wants to succeed at the club?

2542~~~
But he's barely even done that, so what's your point really? He hasn't been blowing hot and cold, he's been mostly just cold, besides like 2 games.

2543~~~
That's not the point - the point is young players are not going to be consistent. They will have poor performances to compliment good ones and we should be looking at their long term development instead of kneejerking into these threads with ridiculous negativity each time they make a mistake.

2544~~~
No i'm retarded but thanks for noticing <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2545~~~
Yeh I couldnt agree more, of course everyone would have wanted more from the off because of his talent but that's still not an excuse to seemingly want to hang him.

2546~~~
Absolutely nobody should be surprised by his play of late. He's a youngster in his first season with us, playing regularly at that.

He's had some good matches but even though overall he hasn't been great, people need to understand that this will take time. As in years. At the beginning of the year if you had told me we'd have had the results we've had, I would have taken them (minus Arsenal). We're in a good position, and it's a great opportunity for Memphis to kick on and learn.

It's not his fault that Januzaj/any other competition doesn't exist. It's clear to me that he needs to be protected, which he isn't and as a result could suffer from burnout. Nevertheless, I expect him to receive more support than he has.

2547~~~
With Adnan you can see what he excels at he's just not quite there yet but with Depay it's hard to see what he excels at. Time will tell but he's not blowing hot and cold more cold and cold. He's young and in his first season so patience is the key but going on what we have seen so far I've yet to be impressed with his potential.

2548~~~
He is young and adapting to a new league but right now he should not be starting games for us. Other than Brugge, he has been terrible.

I have seen glimpses from him that give me faith in him but at the moment every time he has the ball he just seems to give it away.

For the time being I think Young should ahead of him in the pecking order.

2549~~~
He is a bit of Nani and a bit of Balotelli.

2550~~~
Said it before we signed him and got slated for it. He is the most overrated, over hyped young player around and is now being found out. He is average in every aspect. Cant ever see him becoming a great player like many people expected.

2551~~~
He's nothing like either of those players whatsoever.

2552~~~
The Cafe is strange at times. Unanimously think Mourinho should be given time yet have written off a young player in a new league after a couple of poor performances. It was obviously going to be a difficult transition for him and he has shown enough flashes in his performances to suggest he can live up to his potential. Just give him some time.

2553~~~
Exactly!

2554~~~
Yeah, I mentioned this a couple of weeks back. He just looks far to bulky atm, he's really struggling to get round defenders.

He seems to have gone the 'Ronaldo route' of trying to bulk up as much as possible, maybe to adjust to the physical nature of the PL, but his agility and flexibility have taken a hit as a result. He certainly looks a lot bigger then he did last season.

2555~~~
Hes not struggling to get round them because of his bulk, infact when he takes players on and goes down the left he more than often beats the man.
Problem is, he is clearly seriously heavily one footed, which makes playing LW in the PL as a right footer, quite an issue, as we all know he is going to cut back onto his right and attempt to pass or cross instead of taking his man down the line and skining him.

Apart from the confidence and poor first touch and other silly stuff. His main issue atm is that when he gets the ball down the left wing he is far too predictable

2556~~~
In an interview on his physique:

'I do everything to keep my body in a topcondition, I don't want to become too big because I still need to be agile and keep my flexibility. I'm not in the gym everyday, I just maintain it (my muscles) and some of it is genetics.' (the latter is true)

The guy has been a physical beast ahead of his age group since his childhood, I don't think bulking down now when he's 21 would dramatically improve his performances somehow. He never was a dribbler like Nani/Hazard and bulking down won't make him into that. He also has professional coaches at the club and in his private life, I'm pretty sure we can trust their advice to him.

2557~~~
I wonder if the bulkiness was why LvG was hoping to make him fit as a #10, the physique in that role would be more useful.

2558~~~
I do believe his future role will be striker (not necessarily "number 9").Seems his attributes are more fitting with that role than on the wing.The nearer he is to the goal the more dangerous he can be.Not for this season though.

2559~~~
One is proven and one isn't.

2560~~~
That's bloody hilarious coming from a Nani fan you was arguably one of the most frustrating players we have ever had. I would like to know how you can call his last season at PSV average considering the amount and versatility of goals he scored. Like many on here you were probably expecting someone with excellent dribbling like hazard or sterling but he's nothing like that kind of player. Instead he will develop into a pacy,strong and brilliant wide forward of that I'm sure.

2561~~~
Fair enough, you – as many others – base your opinion on what he did for PSV in last two seasons. There’s no doubt he’s achieved more than Januzaj and Pereira, nobody would question that. However, I like rating players potential when I see them play - I feel like Januzaj and Pereira have all the tools to become very good players, but they need some playing time to put it all together, improve decision making etc. From what I’ve seen, Memphis needs to improve significantly a lot of aspects of his game to become good player for us- right now he has too many weak spots. I know he was fantastic last season, but he was playing a) for counter attacking team and b) in much weaker league.

Since day one he is struggling in the Premier League. Is it that unrealistic to say that either of Januzaj/Pereira, given so much playing time as Memphis did, would get at least the same number of goals and assists in the Premier League? With one goal (tap in) and one assist (rebound after hitting the post- squawka and whoscored say 0 but lets give him that) in 8 games, the bar is not very high.

2562~~~
I'll leave Pereira out of this, as he's just not been tested at this level, and for all we know could be better than the other two.

But how do Memphis's stats, that you are focussing on, compare to Adnan's goals and assists?  Both are players with amazing potential, but a whle lot to learn to turn it into end product.  I cannot say that Adnan has proved any more ready right now than Memphis does.

Edit:  Goals wise, it's 5 from 60 vs 4 from 13 in their United careers.  You can fill in the assists.

2563~~~
Well I’m not focusing on stats actually, I just pointed out that Memphis has done pretty much nothing considering how much time he got.

I remember when Januzaj played really well for us, he was very good (in a short period of time). Then he went to being meh, in and out of the team. Depay has been playing bad in the league, but is still getting picked.

I don’t need tables with numbers to tell me which player has higher potential. Where’s fun in that? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2564~~~
Surprised at how many have made up their mind and want to get rid of him for not being United quality, after what, 13 games? Tough crowd!

So, should we try and sell him in January? Sounds like a bag of peanuts is enough for some to agree to that. Too bad you can't bring guys in on a loan and "rent" them like that for 10 games since that is all it takes to know whether someone is United quality.

2565~~~
I think people are just saying he should be introduced a bit more slowly given that young can be more of a creative threat out wide more consistently. Memphis obviously has huge potential, he just needs time.

2566~~~
I think the criticism is hard to take for some because they were convinced he would be amazing. The hype surrounding him was quite a bit OTT to begin with.

2567~~~
Kids are almost always inconsistent. Memphis has definitely got talent to make it at United.

2568~~~
He needs to play out of this form. Sitting on the bench isnt going to help him.

2569~~~
Yeah, honestly I let the forums get the better of me at times and when I read post after post exaggerating the situation to try and prove a point (or get a response) the cynic in me is all that is left once I start my retort. I am arguably his biggest fan, based on what I see here, and I am not going to say I haven't seen some of what people are pointing out. 

I'll give my two bits since the thought of Young has come up multiple times. Going into the game I am guessing that we are going to try and sit back and counter attack. Thus, Darmian is my second selection (right after DDG) and is up against his biggest test so far (a fit Alexis). So, Smalling is next to get written down. Jones hasn't played a full match for a long time, and I (LVG) prefer him on the right with Smalling, Blind and Mike have been playing great, write down Blind. At least that is the way I think it went and the alternate was going into the game against a top team with multiple changes. Once you have those four you are kind of stuck with AY at LB, right?

We can use hindsight to say it was a bad idea (game plan/lineup) but I think it was just executed poorly. The guys looked lost playing that style which is pretty much opposite of everything we have tried to do in every other game this year. Memphis "had" to play, we went in confident thinking we would impose our will and just got punched in the mouth. And "you" want to blame that all on Memphis? 

The question is, after getting punched in the mouth, how do we react? I am NOT saying we should leave Memphis in no matter what he does, but I truly hate seeing the fans using him as a scapegoat. Yes he needs to track back better, yes he needs to have his head up and take a pass into equal consideration. But this was a game that every United player on the pitch looked a bit unsure as to what they should be doing. Including bfs ( yeah, I said it).

Everton away is not exactly the game/place to get the ship righted. Maybe Jones will be good to go and we can have the option to play the back four that will allow the AY/Memphis swap to happen. I would be thrilled if that was all that it takes. GGMU

2570~~~
Van Gaal's not doing him any favours by starting him and then subbing him out at half time while his form has been so bad. He should be used the other way round, coming on in the later parts of the game when defences are tired.

2571~~~
It's unreasonable to say us Memphis sceptics have made our minds up and want to get rid of him. Me personally, of course I'd want him to be given the time needed to settle in and prove his worth at United. But the evidence so far doesn't add up with the claims of many here on him being a world class talent. Aside from shooting and crossing technique, his set of skills looks painfully average to my eyes and has no pace to boot. My apologies to bring up the Nani comparison again, and I know that different players develop at a different age, but a 21 year-old Nani looked a world-beater compared to him.

I hope he proves me wrong and go on to become a world beater himself, I really do, but I just can't see it happen unfortunately.

2572~~~
The discussion on this thread transcends well beyond the Arsenal game. Apart from one game against a very poor (not to mention, crocked) Club Brugge side, Memphis has been poor all season; which is completely fine for a young player but worryingly for me he doesn't seem to have the talent at his disposal to turn things around. Fortunately I'm not all that surprised.

2573~~~
The worrying bit for me isn't his poor performances, but really his lack of ideas when he has the ball.   It seems like he has totally lost the belief to run at his man,  or to try and make something happen.  Neither is he moving around to make space to receive the ball.   I don't think its full fledged hiding on the pitch -  but there is a massive confidence issue there.

2574~~~
He has a much higher ceiling than what he has shown so far. Not too encouraged yet, but at only 21 I really hope he can unleash his potential and become a class player here.

2575~~~
Said it before, he needs a few games off the bench for a while and then eased back in again.

That being said, I agree with the person who said he was hyped way too much; wasn't there an "expectations" thread on him before the season started, as to how many he'd score and assist? I personally went for 7 goals and 7-10 assists (I think) but I recall reading figures double that. He's still young, inconsistent, new league. Will need time to settle in proper and a few games from the bench is how a 21 year old should be handled, instead of starting every game. 

Think the same for Martial as well but we have no decent alternative for him. Memphis has Young, Wilson, Pereira and even Rooney can have a crack.

2576~~~
Dont understand the over the top comments here. Sure he looks off the pace at the moment, but it was expected. Being very good in the Eredivisie doesnt make you an instant hit in the BPL automatically. He isnt a typical winger either, i dont expect him to go past players with ease, like Douglas Costa or Sanchez, when he gets doubled up all the time. He needs to improve his decision making and finishing. He reminds of Ronaldo without the output and speed/agility/class. Our thin squad and slow football dont do him any favours at the moment, but he will come good eventually. He is a work in progress and his talent is obvious, as frustrating as he is right now, i feel excited to see how he will turn out to be.

2577~~~
The only thing that vexes me is that he shows no hunger. He tries almost the same things and loses the ball in almost same way and then next match the same thing. His hunger levels are horribly low. Either he is like that or he is dead tired to come up with creativity or put more effort in training to find a solution.

2578~~~
Yeah, and those reviews were really wrong. He's a right-footed Hulk. Not Sanchez at all.

2579~~~
i am not surprised he's struggling. Haven watched him last season, I never considered him the world class talent everyone here seemed to believe. If you don't believe me, you can check his thread in the newbies before we signed him. The reason for that, was I thought he was a poor dribbler and maybe I was disappointed with the sheer number of shots he was having each game in Holland. I didn't see him as particularly creative. So for some here the reaction isn't knee jerk. 
What he now needs to do is learn to create enough space for him to cross the ball, which is something he's good at or get his shot away. Coming on instead of starting might help him cause he would have a bit more space but I'm not sure how he would handle not starting games.

2580~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2581~~~
How does he remind you of Ronaldo without all those things?

2582~~~
He has a bit of it, but nowhere near that level. He doesnt offer much if he doesnt score.

2583~~~
There a quite a few people here who keep calling out others for calling him a complete right off, but that's hardly the case.

Most appreciate that he needs time, however, with the situation we find ourselves in, we can't keep allowing him to play like a passenger game after game. Some will say that we don't have many other choices, which is true to some extent, although Ashley Young has been more impressive than Memphis and, had he played left wing on Sunday, we may not have lost so harshly. 

Sometimes I get the feeling that Memphis already considers himself a superstar (could just be me) which results in performances such as the one against Arsenal, where he seems to think he's above tracking back and defending. That's why I think it's necessary for him to spend some time on the bench and almost be punished for his poor outings. Only then can he learn from his mistakes.

2584~~~
I sorta see the comparison.

If you forget that a young Ronaldo was quick, skilful, a great crosser, could beat a man inside and out, a brilliant dribbler and had a bag of tricks and assume that a young Ronaldo was just a shitter version of his current self then yes Memphis looks a lot like a young Ronaldo.

2585~~~
The people claiming others are writing him off are throwning nonsense accusations against people that have concerns or doubts about him to discredit their argument. No one is writing him off. And he's nothing like a young Ronaldo. Don't know where that came from.

2586~~~
His freekicks have been disappointing. He came in with the big reputation but so far they've all been blasted well over the bar or meekly hit to the 'keeper (unless I am forgetting one).

2587~~~
He's refusing to talk to the writing media right now... he is such a wannabe Ronaldo without the Ronaldo amount of talent <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2588~~~
Is it something like he will talk only after he puts a curling freekick to the top corner?

2589~~~
That's a little harsh. It could be that he knows the media are going to be full of criticism and he doesn't want to deal with it. Lots of players don't like to talk to the media, especially when the grass isn't green. I've posted in agreement that he has been underwhelming so far and that it's fair to question his potential, but I hope people don't go overboard in scapegoating him.

2590~~~
I agree. He has no obligation to speak to the media. It'd be nice of him to do a little lip service to shed light on his current poor form and that he will make things right in the future, but I guess coping mechanisms are different for everyone.

Re the bolded part: as a huge Memphis doubter myself, it's all fine and dandy criticising him and doubting his potential but to turn everything he does into an agenda against him is a bit too much.

2591~~~
Tbf i think talking to the media is a part of your job as a footballer. It is also a responsibility to his fans. 

I am Dutch myself and i saw Memphis play in the Eredivisie and despite him scoring a lot of goals he also made a lot of mistakes. He has always been a selfish player, not because he wants to do everything himself but he just doesnt see it. 

He is strong, fast and has some skills but i dont think he is extremely talented as a footballer player. For example his dribbeling and first touch are not really that special.

2592~~~
They may not be saying the words but if you look at a few comments from the first page of quotes after the Arsenal game one could say that they are the ones throwing out nonsense accusations. Or at least they are exaggerating the situation to try and enhance their argument. 






If you want to say that you feel he needs to improve, that we should explore other options or give other suggestions on how to make things better for the team AND the player then I am all for it. But for people to come on and say that he has been such an absolute disgraceful, fecking garbage, utter crap player that we are basically playing with 10 men so he shouldn't be on the pitch because he is not United quality? Nothing constructive in those kind of posts unless your goal is to pile on and try to look cool.

Look, I don't have the answer, I wish I did. There are a couple main schools of thought... keep putting him in and let him try to play through it or spoon feed him into easy situations where he can (hopefully) run riot and gain confidence that way. There is probably a happy medium there in certain cases too ("easy" opponents start him, sub him late if possible in the rest). Guess we shall see what the manager does here in a couple weeks, hopefully injuries will not dictate who plays.

I sure would like to hear what LVG and the rest of the coaches are telling him right now. Hopefully they are not getting their inspiration of what to say to him off the Caf.

2593~~~
He's paying the price for the general lack of options up front. I'm all for buying young talent but I'd rather see them gradually introduced, rather than thrown in at the deep end and played in every game. We just don't have the depth to allow him to slowly adapt. And he's struggling as a result.

2594~~~
He's got talent, but seriously learn to control the fecking ball and stop running into defenders when dribbling them.

2595~~~
Outta curiosity, what's your opinion been on Memphis so far here? I know you raved about him before he came.

2596~~~
Mainly underwhelming so far, but I am still sure he will turn out good as he has shown flashes and gets in good positions. 

He's had alot of terrible performances even at PSV, the difference is that he would score in alot of those matches in the ED as he would get more chances. I know he's much better already than he's showing, he has <i>alot</i> of tools in his box but it's not coming off yet. Last year he showed he could do much more than just cutting in, he had freedom to contribute all over the pitch. Now he's being asked to play out wide more again (for the benefit of the team) and in a possesion based team, not a counter attacking team. The injury to Shaw didn't help him either as he needs to form a new partnership now. I think it's all about adapting for him and I personally am glad van Gaal is giving him that chance, although I never disagreed when he was taken off.

I do think some of the criticism in this thread is ott though, especially those questioning his mentality. If I were to name his weaknesses now it'd be his decision making and backtracking, even though the latter is something he's already improving on as he rarely had to do that.

2597~~~
Another worrying thing for me was that picture of him out clubbing with Chris Browns ex, wearing a grill. As someone else just said, he seems to think he's a superstar already. Who the feck goes out in Manchester wearing a grill?

2598~~~
Nani wasn't relevant to this conversation seeing that I didn't mention him Mr Januzaj but as you bought him into it.......I didn't say Memphis last season at PSV was average, I just said he is average and as a premiership player that's what I think he is, average. But if you were to ask me I would swap Nani for Memphis right now. Memphis is consistently poor however frustrating or inconsistent people say Nani was, go check his assists and see how consistent he actually was. Even when having a bad game Nani would assist or could sometimes pull a goal out of nowhere, I don't feel like Memphis can do that, maybe im judging him to early but other than the champions league games hes been pretty useless. This isn't just bigging up Nani either because I actually think Memphis is about Stuart Downing level currently.

2599~~~
My biggest worry with Memphis is whether he's driven enough by football or more so the glamour of being a celeb. 

That's why when I seen him go missing against Swansea and then Arsenal at weekend it worried me a little. He's a really talented lad, we've just gotta hope he follows the right path and fulfills his potential.

2600~~~
i d rather play herrera on the left right now. Memphis needs some rest, just like ronaldo used to be taken away from the team. I do think most overrate hos ability though. He does not have skill to beat a man, you have that from when you are young, The trick young uses he would have used since he was 12, same with martial, valencia, ronaldo, robben,ribery, verratti etc. Memphis just doesnt seem to have the ability to skin his fullback. His lack of tracking back kills the team even more . i say start rooney or young or herrera on left.Maybe even give wilson a chance from there but take memphis out, its too easy for opposition right now, everyone knows he will step inside and hit a shot . its not like he is valencia who sets up an opponent to go outside him and it works most if the time to give him space to cross, for memphis his trick is easily seen and thwarted away and he has nothing else to offer. Nani was better because he went in and out, full backs never knew where he will go, memphiz they are sure about. I think if memphis has to play, play him on right, play mata as 10 and rooney on the left. I hope he can show some good form as we cant afford to carry another player, but i think this season will be a tough one for him.

2601~~~
Pictures please... Surely not?

2602~~~
It's true  <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3250868/Memphis-Depay-celebrates-Manchester-United-success-Chris-Brown-s-ex-Karrueche-Tran.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...-success-Chris-Brown-s-ex-Karrueche-Tran.html</a>

What a cnut he looks.

2603~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What a knobber.

I thought he had a terrific attitude and was grounded? I could have sworn I had read that prior to him signing this summer.

Having said that Karrueche Tran is ridiculously hot and if I had to dress like a knobber to get in there then I would literally wear a dick.

2604~~~
I stand by my comments. He was awful and has been for a while. Shouldn't be picked. Doesn't mean I don't think he'll ever be any good or that he is useless. He is just out of form.

2605~~~
He has talent; just needs to be guided on how to best utilise that talent. Right now he is predictable and keeps on doing the same thing and then losing the ball. Take him out of the firing line and then reintegrate him off the bench.  

And 21 year old goes out to a club with a pretty girl shocker. Its like Ronaldo - another footballer with a terrific attitude towards training and self development and the one who's name keeps cropping up - never did these things when he was the same age <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2606~~~
Ronaldo at 21 was much better...

2607~~~
The first comment is amazing, football players are role model for children now.

Other than that, I see a lot of good things in his game but he almost always touches the ball one too many time, it's obviously a problem but he is young, Robben had the same problem at the same age, Memphis can fix that with experience and more maturity in his game.
Personally I think that he should start every games because he puts himself in the right positions and if he is serious, it's only a matter of time before he exploits his talent.

2608~~~
Ronaldo never wore shit golden griil if I'm not mistaken though.

2609~~~
Sarcastic?

2610~~~
It was supposed to be a question but I forgot a crucial element.

2611~~~
No doubt about that; I'm just talking in regards to Memphis's so called attitude problem which he supposedly has because he's seen out at a night club with a stupid grill on his teeth. As for Ronaldo being better, he already had 3/4 years in the Premier League at 21. Give this boy at least a year to settle in. Don't think he'd ever reach the standards Ronaldo rose to but I think he has the potential to be in the rung below at least.

They didn't have shit like that back in the day. Pretty sure Ronaldo was quite the ladies man. Remember him, Ando and Nani getting up to some shenanigans and so on and so forth.

2612~~~
Sorry, Im asking if you disagree or agree with your statement "football players are role model for children now." I thought you were being sarcastic saying they weren't.. :S

2613~~~
It's not my statement the exact statement by a reader of the article is that footballers are role models but rappers aren't. Since when footballers are definite role models and why artists can't be role models?

2614~~~
He needs proper managing.... it looks as if no one from the club has sat him down and watched his performances back. 
Coaches should be pointing out how much time he thinks he has on the ball Vs how much time he actually has in the PL, showing him that when he loses the ball (more often than not) his lack of tracking back is not the way Man Utd wingers play. If they <i>have</i> done this, then they need to ask serious questions about his application. To be blunt, he's drastically underperformed this season. If Martial wasn't the unexpected godsend he currently is, Memphis would be getting a much tougher time. It's not like the pricetag is weighing him down, Martial is taking all that slack away from him too, it's literally almost the perfect time to be introduced to the club & in short, he's blowing it. 
Yes yes... he has bags of talent, potential in abundance and is flying fit... BUT, he never fully utilises his upper body strength (see Martial for how it's executed perfectly) he never tracks back EVER (see Ashley Young for how it's executed perfectly) and more worrying than anything... he's becoming more and more like Nani in disguise. 
He needs to be dropped for the Everton game and Young deserves a start ahead of him... problem is, this won't happen because LVG needs.. NEEDS to execute his full back substitution in every game (that's another rant for another thread!) and with the current injury list, Young is forced to play out of position. 
Memphis was one of the players I was most excited about coming in this summer, but so far I'm totally, totally underwhelmed.

2615~~~
Hopefully we don't treat him like ADM... else this could end badly

2616~~~
Because having a terrible taste in fashion equals having a bad attitude? He enjoys the rich lifestyle as he grew up in poverty but that can go hand-in-hand with being a professional, he has hired people on his own accord to limit his spending. He used to have some attitude problems when he was younger (pre-WC he sometimes showed off his money too much), but hasn't had problems since he got to work with van Gaal at the NT.

So to answer he indeed does have a terrific attitude and he's grounded in the sense that he's very aware of his own shortcomings on the pitch and actively works on improving this. He has the hunger to become the best player in the world and has never been caught smoking/drinking or anything that could really harm his carreer.

2617~~~
What is a grill?

2618~~~
I'll agree that he's been underwhelming so far but if you're seriously claiming that he never ever uses his upper body strenght or tracks back the you really need to take your own advice and rewatch a few of his games because those two poitns that you just made are actually the least of his problems. Admittadly he didn't track back enough vs Arsenal but he's done it in every other game I've watched this season, if you disagree then you can just go back and watch the compilations. Couldn't watch the Sunderland game so I'll exclude that one.

2619~~~
At which point though? Apart from his prime years where he was among the very best wingers in europe I'm very sceptical as to how true this is in general. And if that's that the standard that we're expecting from Memphis right now then we're always going to be disappointed. I'm not content with Memphis performances right now but I find your final argument that he doesn't affect games enough a really strange one to use against him when he's always getting into positions to score and affect the game. His main problem is that he's just not put those chances to bed. With a bit more quality he'd put two past Sunderland. Against Wolfsburg with a bit of luck he assists Mata or Mata doesn't fluff the pass when he's open in the penalty area, putting it behind him. He made the third against Southampton.

In terms of decision making and numbers produced he seems about similar to Nani in his first seasons with us, while Nani is and was a better player on the ball I'd argue that Memphis is a better player off it. The main issue though is that we didn't have to rely on Nani actually being a ready product as much as we do right now with Memphis.

Sorry to continue with the Nani vs Memphis discussions, I realise that you didn't start it.

2620~~~
I was and still am a Nani fan so rather than bore you with opinion will leave it largely to stats.

07-08
Playing 2203 minutes he contributed 3 goals and 11 assists (I had to exclude his three assists in domestic cups from this as I couldn't find his minutes played in those respective comps). This equates to a contribution every 157.4 minutes.

08-09
Playing 1408 minutes he contributed 6 goals and 4 assists. This equates to a contribution every 140.8 minutes.

09-10
Playing 2368 minutes he contributed 7 goals and 14 assists. This equates to a contribution every 112.8 minutes. 

10-11
Playing 3676 minutes he contributed 10 goals and 21 assists. This equates to a contribution every 118.6 minutes.

11-12
Playing 2853 minutes he contributed 10 goals and 15 assists. This equates to a contribution every 114.1 minutes.

12-13
Playing 1338 minutes he contributed 3 goals and 7 assists. This equates to a contribution every 133.8 minutes.

13-14
Playing time is 740 minutes with 1 goal and no assists. A contribution every 740 minutes.

Across his United career it averages out at a contribution every 131 minutes or so.

Always reasonably productive but not always playing a lot, the reasons for which can be speculated upon. The only time he had a run of starts that compares to Memphis would have been as a result of injuries.

I don't actually think Memphis will be too far off Nani's early figures but he does seem to be in a rut of some sort at the minute and it is understandable how fans/critics get bogged down in that which is foremost in the memory. I'd rather not see him compared to Nani at all though as Nani polarizes opinion like very few can.

2621~~~
So because he's got a pair of grills his attitude stinks... okay.

2622~~~
Stupid French instructions

2623~~~
So far Memphis has 8 points from 924 minutes of game-time equal a contribution every 115,5 minutes which by your measurements would mean that he's been as consitent as Nani was at his best. So I don't think this is a good formula for measuring consistency.

2624~~~
Over such a limited period of time stats become less useful and I agree that analysing Memphis in this way so early is reasonably pointless. One game can have an exaggerated effect on results (take away Brugge 3-1 and Memphis is down 3 points but only 90 minutes) because of the small sample size. Over the course of a season and longer they can be a useful indicator of performance (by no means conclusive) and aberrations are somewhat levelled out.
If Memphis continues to play regularly and ends the season with a contribution every 115.5 minutes then I think we'll all be delighted.

I believe the point I responded to was a question of Nani's consistency, something which I feel the stats indicate was actually quite impressive for a winger (at least in terms of productivity).

2631~~~
I'm afraid the key word is one that no football fan, let alone the type of people who write on forums, wants  to hear...

patience.

2632~~~
Sorry I've just read pages of complaints about him being extremely lazy and not putting in any effort to help teammates - which is why I asked.

2633~~~
He seems exhausted, I think that he is badly struggling with the rhythm of the league, which is affecting is work rate and his decision making.

2634~~~
I'm taking my stats from transfermarkt and it at times differ alot from yours, for example according to them he played around 600 minutes more in the 08-09 season with the same goal/assist stats. Only minor differences in other seasons though. Nani would have also benefited from playing in a team that alot more dominant than todays United. Featuring players such as prime Rooney, Scholes, Tevez, Ronaldo and Berbatov to assist and be supplied by. I can easily see Memphis doing better than Nani productivity wise when comparing their early seasons and therefore I think it's way premature and misleading to say that Nani had an ability to consistently produce and that Memphis lacks that same ability. It's not a fair comparison by any means.

2635~~~
You don't score the type of gaols he does without been a very good player, he will come good I have no doubt at all. People just need to expect a little less than maybe they thought for the moment. 

It's easy to forget that Ronaldo was very in and out for while before he really found his form, not saying Memphis will be this level, but he could certainly be just below it given time.

I really like the guy, attitude is spot on.

2636~~~
That is ghastly.

2637~~~
I'm just stating my views by what I see from the Stretford end... Perfect example was when he got replaced with Young against Liverpool at half time, different attitude and application changed the game for us entirely
I don't think for a second he was a bad buy, but the kid needs managing and some direction...

2638~~~
anyone think he was thrown at the deep end too early?

2639~~~
She seems to have all sorts of dodgy baggage though. Memphis ought to get rid.

2640~~~
I was under the impression that he would be slowly introduced as a substitute and based on performances would start mostly in the cup games and maybe some lower team premier league fixtures. However after his first couple of performances he was very exciting and fully deserved to be in the starting line up in my opinion - his slump in form/work rate since then has been really disappointing.

2641~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/memphis-depay-manchester-united-winger-10221277" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Admits he's knackered </a>. Obvious and I guess it's understandable.

2642~~~
Early days .But i did expect to see something that makes him stand out.

2643~~~
He has scored 4 goals for us already, and was the 1st leg catalyst in the ultra important Brugee game, I would also argue that 3 of the goals he has scored couldn't have been scored by any other member of our current squad, Maybe Young aside for the second Brugee goal.

It mustn't be forgotten also that he has lost his partner on the left with the Shaw injury, which can't have helped, and he maybe hasn't been helped by playing so much so quickly.

You've just got to take a look at Firmino for Liverpool to see a real disappointment (so far) , and Sterling hasn't been doing much as yet, if Memphis keeps up his current score rate, and maybe improves it as he settles, then we're looking at 15 + goals from him in his first season, which would be fantastic.

2644~~~
Good post.

2645~~~

2646~~~
Well said.

Maybe LvG should rotate him with Young more so that he's only playing one game per week for a while as he gets used to the intensity. Then he can be eased into playing more. People forget he's still young and playing at a new level.

2647~~~
He still isn't having enough impact in games, I'll take your point on goals scored so far but he's losing the ball too much and running himself into too many corners I hope I'm wrong but I really don't see an upgrade on Nani so far in fact I'd say I'd rather Nani at this moment in time..He's been a real disappointment so far.

2648~~~
Like many people here I have thus far been unimpressed, but I'm sure he has the talent to be a star here. We need to bring him off the bench in the last 15 min in the next few games so he gets to run at tired defenders and build his confidence a bit.

2649~~~
a player like Memphis in years gone by would have been introduced slowly.....

we don't have that option these days with such a small squad

2650~~~
Well you're a hard man to please then, this is his first two months at a completely new level of competition, other than Martial, and Mata he has done more than any other attacker we have, yes he is very in and out but the ability is there, it's easy to forget how long it took Ronaldo to settle and start playing consistently.

He just needs to rotate a bit more with Young, watching from the bench could help him a lot if he's that sort of player, for me he's been getting knackered towards the end of games, so coming on as sub for the last 20-30 mins could be perfect for him for a while.

2651~~~
That's so true, Sir Alex would have taken him out of the firing line by now as well.

2652~~~
Young switching to left back has scuppered that, it's strange thing to say but him playing every game could mean he takes longer to adjust to things than if he was introduced a bit slower, confidence is a big factor for players like him and his will be lower than it should right now, hence he should be rotated more to take the pressure off.  

Maybe sticking Rooney out on the left for while is the way to go.

2653~~~
I'd favour that suggestion

Rooney on the left would allow Mata inside and offers protection for Young at LB

as I type its unbelievable that we have spent so much money and we're talking about the merits of playing a left winger at left back and an out of form striker on left wing

2654~~~
As I said before CMC you make some good points and are a great poster on these forums I'm not doubting Memphis' ability or skill set at all..far from it..I rarely did to Nani either, but I am seeing the same patterns developing beating his man once then going back and trying to beat him again (we have had to endure this shite with McGeady over the years) there really is no need, so many times he beats a man and should stick it in the box but he chooses to stem the attack by going back and trying to make an arse out of his opponent again and again..if he cuts this out he will be fine and develop well, but if he keeps at it then we just have another Nani on our books...

2655~~~
Excellent post.

2656~~~

2657~~~
He needs a bit of a bollocking. I know people like to cut slack to young lads for having fun and whatnot but it is a bit jarring to hear he went out on to the town after that terrible Arsenal game.

2658~~~
I didn't get this after reading the article either. What does it mean? He was out in town doing what?

2659~~~
Means he went out to a club or something. Who gives a feck what he does in his free time? Its not like he's out getting drunk or getting caught with drugs or anything like that. Never understood why people are so obsessed with what players do after a game. Its not like they have to be miserable for the entire week after they lose a game.

2660~~~
I'd imagine they'd all be quite down after the battering we got. Especially him who had a shocker. If the guy went out to relax, I really dont see a big deal. I'm assuming he wasn't out partying or something which would be ridiculous.

2661~~~
That's exactly what 'out on the town' implies, though. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2662~~~
It implies he's going out to clubs and stuff, sure. Doesn't mean he's out drinking. Big difference. Pretty sure NL Max on here said that he's never been seen partying or drinking really and he just doesn't really do it much. He's a 21 year old with loads of money... I highly doubt he's just going to sit at home every night crying about having a poor performance or the team losing. It happens, but he doesn't have to be miserable about it all day. You just move on to the next one. Giggs used to go out all the time as a youngster and so does virtually every single player.

2663~~~
Please. What the feck is a young boy with shit loads of money doing in clubs? And if you actually read the article it's clear he's 'out on the town' (not drinking!) way more than any other player, not just the young ones like you assert, and as a result has had a talking to.

2664~~~
I think he went out partying. After the match he had, the club have the right to take issue with it if it's true.

2665~~~
He definitely needed a talking to for not putting in the required effort when we played the Arse. In fact, he needs to concentrate on what he's doing wrong and correcting it.

My only problem with this is why are sources telling the media about this?? Why can't he get a talking to without 'sources' telling the media? Are staff/players so hard up that they need to run to the media with everything going on behind closed doors? That's pissing me off.

With Memphis' background, you have to handle him carefully or he can go off the rails. A firm talk coupled with a little sensitivity is the way to go with someone who must be feeling insecure right now. You don't leak things like this to the media - how is that going to help the lad?

2666~~~
Having fun? De Gea went to clubs all the time in his first couple of seasons here didn't he? Giggs would sneak out to clubs all the time when he was a youngster. It's something that players do. I really don't see why it matters what players do to have fun off the pitch. He still works hard in training most likely? He's in perfect physical shape pretty much isn't he? Him going out to clubs now and then isn't going to make him any better or worse in games... The only thing that'll change that is him getting used to the league and simply improving his performances on the pitch.

And I just read the article. Seems like it's more saying that Giggs told him to just stay out of the limelight a bit until he gets used to the league more. Probably so that when he has a bad performance, it doesn't get noticed as much as he wouldn't be in the limelight much. Pretty much all there is to it. If he's confident he can handle the pressure from the media then that's his decision.

2667~~~
What should he be doing instead? Sitting at home quietly contemplating his performance? Doing extra training? Fecking hell, lads.

2668~~~
Sure showed that against Arsenal didn't he? He got hooked after 45 minutes because it was clear he couldn't give a feck. I don't know why you keep mentioning Giggs. I have no clue as I was only a child when he was young but if you can prove Giggs was doing it to the extent Memphis seems to be doing it, then sure, I'll cede your point.

If this was just a case of him 'having fun' Giggs wouldn't be talking to him, and Bates (who has been very reliable with club news over the last year or so) wouldn't be writing small articles about it.

2669~~~
People on here seem obsessed with getting every player to do nothing with their lives but think about their performance on the pitch and if they lose, then they aren't allowed to do anything but sulk about it. That "talking to" seems a lot more like a suggestion to stay out of the limelight more then telling him to buckle up or something like that.

2670~~~
He shouldn't be doing it to the point where he's getting spoken to about it, obviously, lad.

2671~~~
Shouldn't he? How many of our great players do you think haven't had a talking to when they were young? I think you'd really struggle to list a handful. I can easily list a handful who have been given a talking to: Giggs, Beckham, Scholes, Keane, Rooney, among many, many others.

2672~~~
Did you not watch the class of 92 documentary? Giggs even talked about it how he'd go out to clubs, and Fergie would be able to tell the next day in training because Giggs would shave the night before, so he simply stopped shaving when he'd go out. 

Darmian also got hooked after 45 minutes. Players have shit games. It's not a big deal really. And Giggs talking to him, as I've said, looks a lot more like Giggs just recommending to him to stay out of the media's spotlight while he's adapting to the league, as if he's in the spotlight, everyone criticizes him heavily for having a bad game while you hardly get a mention if not. Both Darmian and Memphis got subbed off at half time for having shit games. Who has been talked about more on here? That's pretty much all there is to it.

2673~~~
Are you actually suggesting it's right for him to be doing it to the extent where he needs to be spoken to about it? Madness. Just because you can list players who have done so doesn't mean Memphis should be doing this.
I didn't, no. If the talking to is just to keep him out of the spotlight, then sure, that's fine. But if it's because of the fact that he's been partying too much, then that shouldn't be something that's acceptable.

2674~~~
He should learn from Martial, home to the wife, nice pot pie for tea and a night in front of the box.

Memphis biggest flaw right now is his lack of tracking back, in attack I think he's struggling to cope with being double marked and isn't helped by the fact teams know we only have one flank with pace and a #10 that doesn't do anything, so they can focus on him. However the lack of tracking back is pure laziness and he needs to get it sorted out as it has nothing to do with talent.

2675~~~
Seems a lot more like a suggestion to stay out of the spotlight, no? It's best to ignore headlines and actually look for the relevant bits of information.

2676~~~
The big difference is back then footballers were not the "stars" they are today and attracted a lot less attention when doing these things and on top of that the players today should have learned from the mistakes of the past generations and be treating their good fortune to be a pro athlete with more care IMO.

2677~~~
21 year olds are idiots. 21 year olds with a shitload of money in a country with a huge drinking culture are going to get drunk. That's inevitable. The staff will then have to reign them in a bit every now and again - that's inevitable too. It's not an issue in any way. It's completely normal. This is just the media trying to get a story and a bit of drama out of nothing.

2678~~~
Yeah I agree with this bit. And everyone knows what the British media is like. This is exactly why the 'source' should not be opening their big mouths to the press about these things. Especially with such a wound up young man like Memphis.

2679~~~
Yep, that's the only "issue" here if there is one at all. It's perfectly normal for players to get talked to by the staff, get suggestions, criticized and all that. It's to be expected. It shouldn't be leaked to the media though, because there will always be irrational people who take it for a lot more then it is and start thinking it's some serious issue when it's really nothing that isn't normal.

2680~~~
Absolutely. That the person who did this didn't even think of the consequences makes me despair slightly about the state of so called players/staff close to the dressing room. I thought 'leaks' had gone with the Moyes era but apparently not. Why on earth the club doesn't give these people a good talking to is beyond my comprehension.

Worries me too because Memphis has a tricky personality from what I've read, and I wonder if any one on staff is equipped to deal with him or able to even recognise when he needs some mental support. Seems he had someone helping him with that side of things in Holland, and it seems to have been quite successful. I therefore wonder if anyone has thought about encouraging him to fly that guy in, just to calm him down a bit. That would be one way of trying to get him going on the right path - but going to the press just adds more pressure. Honestly, I despair<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2681~~~
That article looks like was dictated to bates by ryan giggs. I wonder what "senior sources" mean though. If he is tired already, then he will probably sulk at christmas time. Why i wonder would a 21 year old get tired of  playing football? He is young, fit and he is getting paid to play, i think he needs a kick to the arse. Some players loved to play every game and do not complain of tiredness, i like them. This attitude that you are tired after 8 games is bullshit, if you are tired you stay at home and try and recover every second. I dont like his attitude, it seems he has "mini balotelli" syndrome. For people saying sir alex would have taken him out of the firing line, a <b> 17 year old ronaldo made 40 appearances in his first season. </b>We were knocked out of the league cup and europe early that season if my memory is right.

2682~~~
40 appearances doesn't mean 40 starts though. And you can't compare every young player to cristiano ronaldo. He's one of the best players ever and up there with the most dedicated athletes ever.

2683~~~
If that was Giggs' doing - then it shows a terrible lack of judgment. I agree he shouldn't be tired and that he needs to be taken firmly in hand. But going to the press won't help him. He doesn't have Martial's calm equilibrium, plus he's from an abusive background - you have to be careful with him and handle things behind closed doors imo.

2684~~~
The fact that Darmian has made an impressive start (at least up until the last couple of weeks) to his United career, while Memphis hasn't, plays a massive part in that.

2685~~~
Should i compare him to rooney? Messi? arjen robben (40 appearances for chelsea at 21),ribery (37), douglas costa (40),nani (41),pedro (at 22, 52 appearances, he broke through at 21) , bojan (48 at 17yrs), mata (51 <a class="username" data-user="50837, @Valencia" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/50837/">@Valencia</a>)

I think people are trying to mask his bad games, he has been terrible apart from a game against brugge. I think i have put in many players level that he might want to reach, This is not 2001 when players hit form and consistency at 25-28 this is 2015 players are almost made/broken by the time they are 25. I think this tiredness is just an excuse for not working hard enough.

2686~~~
Darmian has faced two of the fastest and skillful players in the league in Mane and sanchez so you can excuse him for not settling in and he has shown in other games that he is doing most things right. Depay apart from one game has looked one level below everyone on that pitch. People are calling for young to be picked ahead of him and young is probably one of the most disliked player for united fans.

2687~~~
I'm sure he's working hard enough. And he hasn't been terrible. A few shit games, a few average games and a few good games. Decent overall (unless you expected messi or ronaldo..). And besides, he'll definitely play over 40 games for us this season. Doesn't mean that after playing 3 times a week for the first time in his career that he won't be tired and in need of a break now and then. Like all young players going to new leagues, he's going to be inconsistent. Martial is a huge exception, as he looks world class from the start. Other players take time and that's all we can do. Give him time and not be pissed at him when he tries to create something from nothing as the rest of the team isn't doing much going forward.

2688~~~
Louis van Gaal himself, the 2 have a good relationship. Memphis had some personal issues in his early years at PSV, but really started to make big steps on the pitch and off it once he got a call for the NT. After that he cut all connections with people who could be a bad influence on him (he was a streetkid when he was younger) and van Gaal is great with young players and can help Memphis. He cares about his players emotional state, he's always open for conversations about things which are on the players' their mind- wether it's about football or not. I think Memphis will have sufficient support at the club and if not I rate him high enough to get that himself, he's conscious about his own flaws. He has had several coaches at PSV like Erik ten Hag (now works for Bayern's youth) and Joost Leenders to guide him off the pitch, they both praised him highly when he left PSV as Memphis at that time looked completely changed and was no longer a problem. I believe he still has contact with Joost Leenders as they got along very well, not sure how much though.

About the article posted a page back, he probably just got a warning for being spotted in public after a loss. That's not the best timing to go out especially if he played badly and was subbed at HT. Or, as van Gaal himself would say: 'I cannot go to Wings now'.

2689~~~
Young players will always need to controlled and guided because with the money they earn, the temptation to go crazy and show themselves off is high. I really hate it when something like this goes public though.

2690~~~
Apparently had a bust up with Van Persie. On SSN now.

2691~~~
Apparently his shirt is the third most selled in the world this season, judging by this shit source I am even lazy to paste. Is this possible?

2692~~~
Memphis or RVP?<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2693~~~
No.

2694~~~
Memphis. Might've found the article, it states that according to "football shirt experts" <i>Kitbag</i> he's sold the 3rd highest amount of replica shirts, only Messi and Ronaldo have sold more. Supposedly, Schweinsteiger's at nr 4 and Rooney's in 6th.

2695~~~
Mmmm... not sure about their 'analysis'...... seems weird he'd be behind Ronnie and Messi....

2696~~~
Doesn't seem very likely. Although he has got a cool name. Maybe Elvis fans are a big, untapped Market?

2697~~~
Are you sure it didn't mean third most sold <b>United </b>shirt in the world? That would make a lot more sense. Perhaps behind Rooney and Schweinsteiger/Mata.

2698~~~
According tot the article I saw it was across all clubs, Messi 1, Ronaldo 2, Memphis 3, Schweinstegier 4, Hazard  5 , Rooney 6.

2699~~~
United are the biggest club in the world in terms of number of fans. Our revenue is off the charts and this plays a part in it.
Why wouldn't one of our players be up there?
In terms of appeal and name, he was our 'sexiest' signing last summer before the Martial explosion, he came with the hype and a YouTube compilation of fantastic goals and being the 'next Ronaldo'
Sometimes people forget how big we are. We've matched madrids shirt sales year on year despite Madrid signing Ronaldo and Bale v Fellani and Young.

2700~~~
I'd imagine being No7 helps a heap too.

2701~~~
I could believe it.

We sell shit tonnes of shirts and he was basically the only attacking player we signed till Martial.

2702~~~
It's only on Kitbag and he's 3rd after Messi and Ronaldo, Bastian 4th, Rooney 6th: <a class="externalLink" href="http://blog.kitbag.com/top-selling-player-shirts-201415/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://blog.kitbag.com/top-selling-player-shirts-201415/</a>

2703~~~
He was hyped up like we were signing a young Ronaldo. 

People got caught up in the hype I suppose. It's surprising, but not at the same time.

2704~~~
Only reason players shouldn't be out enjoying themselves is if it will affect their recovery. Otherwise it's their business.

2705~~~
Plenty of time for him to become a world beater. He's barely had time to adjust to the league. People have short memories with Ronaldo, his first two seasons were incredibly inconsistent. A forum I was on back in 05/06ish had a thread about 100 pages long debating if they'd accept a £20m bid for him. If you just consider that for a minute you'll realise why patience should be shown.

2706~~~
Agreed. He needs time and games.

2707~~~
Ronaldo is a once in a a generation ( okay, two in a generation) player..very few players will ever reach that level or even get close..We may not see another player like him at United for another 50 years..he was that good..However the equivalent and most prevalent situation is that we have seen many players with similar skill levels to Memphis fail to reach such world-beating level. People's concern is genuine, there is simply no guarantee that he will reach that, patience or not. 

What people are worried about now is his current performance levels. Him and Rooney are mere passengers in a front 4 that isn't the greatest, and we cant really afford that many passengers. Its his performance thread, surely his poor performances can be discussed. Writing him off and claiming he will become a world beater are both equally as ridiculous, we simply don't know. That is why we are discussing his current performances instead, because that is something that we do know.

2708~~~
He has the talent you can see that in flashes. But of course he's still young, there's always going to be inconsistencies in his game play. He needs competition for his place in the side. It's too easy at the moment. I was wondering who the caf think has the highest potential... Martial, memphis or januzaj?

2709~~~
Tough to judge Martial after he played a few games, but he's been quality in each one. Right now for me it's Martial > Januzaj > Memphis.

2710~~~
I don't think people know the difference between discussing a players performance and writing him off. Anyway, how has he been for Holland?

2711~~~
Same.

2712~~~
Martial for me. He has it all, intelligent player, quick feet, technical ability and cool as a cucumber. Naturally it might also be that he has just developed faster than the other two but so far he seems like our biggest prospect since Ronaldo and Rooney imo.

2713~~~
Interesting. Martial has made a good impression hopefully he keeps it up. Personally I think it's Januzaj- fantastic technical ability has the confidence to be a top players it's a shame he doesn't fit in to our current system.

2714~~~
He actually does.

2715~~~
Maybe some of the disappointment comes because, for some reason, many seemed to think he was some sort of Hazard-esque dribbling wizard.
He's going to need to really adapt his game, because he doesn't show the skills set of a wide man in a possession team. And I have to say, it's very unusual for players to drastically change in style. By the time a player is 20 ish, you can usually see what their future style/capabilities will be. 

I really don't think he'll become a true world beater. Just my opinion, but apparently this will count as me 'writing him off'. However there's never a problem with people saying they think he <i>will </i>be a world beater. You're allowed to say what you feel about a young player... as long as it's positive.

I don't think he'll reach Nani's level, and he reminds he me of Hulk so much that I see him being a similar level of player.

2716~~~
Shit. Not even involved in a goal during the whole qualification. Was shit last match too. Hopefully he has a "Brugge"like match tonight since we need to win to even have a chance of getting into the playoffs.

Please lose Turkey, Go Iceland defeat Turkey!

Edit : to answer the question someonweasked. Martial >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Januzaj >> Memphis. I also think Memphis is going to be the next Hulk, not a bad player but not a player for a European topteam.

2717~~~
Yep agree but more Martial >>>>>>>

2718~~~
i've always found it fascinating how quick people are to change judgement on a player, be it a young up and coming one like Martial / Memphis or a legend like Giggs / Schweinsteiger

They have a good game or two and Martial is the next Henry / Memphis is going to turn into Ronaldo - they have a few bad games or get some bad press and we've wasted £20m or whatever on the next bebe.  

Same for legends who have done it. Schweinsteiger dominates midfield in one match and it's the best signing for the last few years, he has a mediocre game against Arsenal and we've bought and washed-up-has-been who's here for the money

I'm all for analysing and criticising performance when they're bad but not to the extend where so many on here just write the guy's career at United off etc.

2719~~~
Martial is the best for me.

Memphis ahead of Januzaj as well.  

I rate them all highly though, and with Shaw and Periera the future looks bright.

2720~~~
best post ive read in a while

2721~~~
This is very harsh on a lad that is only 8 weeks into his united career, & is still adjusting to rigours of new league/system, people underestimate how tough a transition it can be.

Let's compare him against Firmino instead , a guy who was fantastic in Germany last year yet has been dreadful so far, or Sterling £50 m & accustomed to the Premiership yet hasn't been great, or even one of your own Pedro, very disappointing, & there could be the point, Pedro in a Barca system looked fantastic at times but he now needs adjust his game to a new system, could also be the same issue with Firmino and Sterling, they haven't just turned into bad players or aren't working hard enough,  they just need a bit of patience as does Memphis.

Personally I'd like to see him come off the bench in the next few games when the opposition in tired, it could work wonders on getting his confidence up again, but lack of planning on the left  potentially scuppers that for now.

2722~~~
Shaw is in the same bracket as Martial talent wise. People seem to ignore it because he is a defender but he is excellent and incredibly consistent for his age. I would be disappointed if he did not end up being the best left back in the world in the next 3 years, that's how highly I rate him.

2723~~~
I think he was already one of the best in Europe so hard to disagree El-Manos

2724~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eEe2g9H3U1O/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2725~~~
I'd be severely disappointed if he plays against Everton with the form he's in at the minute. Awful.

2726~~~
Definitely needs a breather. Time to re-acqaint himself with the bench to get back some focus.

2727~~~
A little over the top I think, espcaily when you consider Young will probably play at LB.

The only thing we couid do is play Rooney there which would mean no pace either side, or play Martial there which would mean we don't have a viable striker.

2728~~~
We've got Jones back, play Blind at LB. Young at LW.

2729~~~
I've only seen the last half hour of this Holland match but he's done nothing. Was he any better in the first hour?

2730~~~
Try telling LVG to play a non left footed CB, it'll be Rojo if not Blind, rather we kept Blind there personally.

2731~~~
He's offering absolutely nothing. This is not the same guy running at people and scoring for fun at PSV. He looks devoid of ideas, scared to take on his man & looks generally clueless. He's young & all but so is Martial.

2732~~~
He's been bad all the way through, although did get a player sent off with his pace.

It's not a stick to beat him with though, he is just having a sticky patch right now, it happens to the best, have all the faith in the world in him still personally.

2733~~~
this is the real issue. He was running and using his pace a it in the first two games. He's just stopped.

2734~~~
Made a great run to get the player sent off, shame though as he could have done with a goal to boost his confidence. He worked hard as usual and made plenty of good runs, but some were timed just a little off. His crossing wasn't the best tonight, some on the mark and some way wide. Either way he's in a little bit of a sticky patch, but class is permanent.

2735~~~
Thought he was poor.

2736~~~
That's a fair assessment. He'll be fine, just needs to be taken out of the firing line a bit....

2737~~~
Messi was brilliant as a teenager too. Not sure what your point is? That all teenagers should be as good as Messi/Martial?

2738~~~
Had the odd sparkle, but was generally anonymous tonight.

Agree with the general consensus, definitely doesn't deserve to start for us any time soon.

2739~~~
You're being very kind to him, he was more than poor.

2740~~~
My point is that being young is not an excuse that should be made for him ALL the time & he's 21. I don't think his poor play has much to do with his age, that's what my point is.

2741~~~
He was poor, it was also his man who scored the 1-0. 

Just continued his club form in the last two games for the NT. He also wasnt even involved (goal/assist) in one of the (few) goals scored during the qualification. 

I always thought he was being hugely overrated at this forum like he was the next Ronaldo or our answer to Hazard. People are starting to see he just isnt that talented. He is strong, quick and has some special tricks but his first touch, dribbeling and vision is not really that great. He also lacks any form of intelligence....

Maybe he reaches the level Hulk is at. A good player but not a player for a top club. I just hope he proves me wrong.

2742~~~
His age is either a valid excuse or it's not. For a 21 year old, going through the turmoil settling into a new club in a new league, in a new country then it's clearly a valid excuse for a few months poor form. The fact that some young footballers adjust and develop better/quicker than others is neither here nor there. 

Anyway, chances are Martial will have a dip some time soon and the knives will be out for him too.

2743~~~
Never said it's not a valid excuse, I just don't agree with it as the ONLY excuse. Martial will have a dip, every player does actually.

2744~~~
Thought he was faster than this.

2745~~~
Yup, I assumed he was better at taking players on too. His dribbling abilities/close control in tight scenarios is way lower than what I assumed.

2746~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2015/10/13/16290992/man-utd-fed-up-with-arrogant-memphis-mulder?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/pr...-mulder?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a>
Ex Dutch players sure love criticising ing him. 
Never thought he was particularly quick. Runs wiha lot of power, which can deceive people.

2747~~~
I don't want to be harsh on the guy. He's a young man after all and sometimes you need to have a better understanding but, all summer I was told, by United fans and other rival fans that he is;

-Fast
-Amazing on the ball
-Best winger in Europe
-Future best player in the world
-Would tear the league apart
-Would be United's player of the season.

I have seen nothing to suggest any of those statements are true.

2748~~~
Bit of a knee-jerk claiming he's not as talented or whatever as you thought. He started the season very well and showed he can be in the top tier of players his age. He's just lost a lot of form, why that is, I don't know. Possibly his party lifestyle has caused him to lose interest/focus?

I'm sure LVG will sort it out.

2749~~~
What did Michael Owen do to that jersey?

2750~~~
Did he really? He had one really good game against an injury stricken Brugge side, but everything else has ranged from satisfactory-to-downright terrible.

2751~~~
They're bitter about their NT performances and he's an easy target right now, as he's having a tough season.

The way people completely turn on him is ridiculous though. Hype him all summer, even to extents that aren't justified and now trash him because a 21 year old has had a tough start at one of the largest clubs in the world. It's retarded really. I'm happy at least Martial has had a good start so he's saved from the non-sense that people say when new transfers don't perform well right away.

2752~~~
He's had flashes of brilliance, his directness in some games can't be disputed. A dip in form and inconsistency at his age is common. Ronaldo at his age was very hot and cold too and look how he turned out. Martial is a very unique player in that not many, if any, players his age can sustain such a high standard of performances at such a young age. That being said he hasn't been good enough recently and I think he needs to be benched or sorted out by Giggsy or LVG etc

2753~~~
Ronaldo very hot and cold at the age of 21? He was a fully established top player at that age. At 22 he started the 07/08 season in which he scored 42 goals.

2754~~~
My bad - mixed up ages with another player I was thinking of. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Was trying to say that in his first season here, granted he was 18 at the time it still took him time to settle. Not every player can make the step-up a few games into their first season in a completely different league, take ADM for example who still looks very average after leaving Spain.

Memphis is imo still as good as everyone first thought, or can be* but you'd be silly to expect him to instantly become a sensation. Also some players just never become as good as they can be, doesn't mean they're average or whatever as some on here are suggesting, just that they could never make the step-up, take Nani for a prime example.

2755~~~
Ronaldo at the ame age was on the short list for Ballon D' or.
Edit: just seen your post

2756~~~
He's better off the ball, then he actually is when he's on it.

2757~~~
I definitely don't think LVG's system/game time (but then who exactly is playing to the best of their abilities currently-attacking wise?) managing is helping but what about at the national level with Blind?

Are the Netherlands going through a really bad patch and needing that inspiration for a new cycle of mentality/playing style/next generation of players?

2758~~~
Memphis is also on the 59 players shortlist <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2759~~~
He's probably better on the bench than he is on the pitch too

2760~~~
Maybe he can wear his golden teeth while being on the bench

2761~~~
More entertaining than what's on the pitch at times <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2762~~~
To reiterate what I said earlier in this thread: I'll honestly be surprised if he makes it here at United. Off-field antics aside, I don't think he's a world class player in the making. He just isn't talented enough.

2763~~~
I think he will make it but people have to revise their opinion about what they think he will achieve. I am not saying this in hindsight. I said it before we signed him and why I wasn't enthusiastic about him coming. I never saw him as this world class talent/ game changer that everyone was talking about because I though he was ordinary on the ball, apart from his shooting. 
I think a lot of the disappointment is coming from people who thought we were signing a flying winger who could put players on their backside and other stuff. Essentially a Hazard or Sanchez MkII. 
I still think he will have a good career with us once he adapts but I don't expect him to be one of the worlds best players. Not even close.

2764~~~
I don't know if this was meant negatively, but yeah, his movement at times is very good. He's just mucking things up when he receives the ball.

2765~~~
Depay was hyped to hell and back before he arrived, and now he's been written off just as quickly... Fans in 2015, I guess.

The kid is 21 years old having just moved to one of the biggest clubs in world football. Things haven't been going great so far, but he'll find his legs & some form eventually - Just like Firmino will with us. A lot of foreign signings don't hit the ground running, but that doesn't mean they're not good enough to make it at United, Liverpool, Aston Villa, or wherever the feck.

At one point during the season, Depay will be going through a good patch while Martial struggles. I wonder what the Martial thread will look like when that happens.

2766~~~
This. 

<span style="color: #ffffff">And from a Liverpool fan. The Klopp effect seems to be working already.</span>

2767~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_v5EMFcak5Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Just look from 32 seconds in to the minute mark and tell me he doesn't have this ability. Its true he hasn't shown much of this at United but he has it in him

2768~~~
Not sure how you can write off a 21 year old when he has showed the flashes of quality he has. 3 of his goals have been unreal, so have some of his assists. Embarrassing this place at times.

2769~~~
I think he's suffering from some expecting him to be a Hazard/Reus level talent, as well as the steep step up from a weak league like the Ererdivise. He needs to do is up his workrate in helping his fullback, he'll find most will have more patience with other aspects of his game then.

2770~~~
I don't think there's anything wrong with fans criticising his input so far whether he is 21 years old or not. Almost every game in the league he has been ineffectual as far as I have seen. 

As for totally writing him off, that's stupid. It's quite likely he'll play a part for years to come and he's only 21 and in a new league.

2771~~~
Amazing how it takes a Liverpool fan to provide some much needed perspective. Depay has struggled, but how anyone can write him off as not good enough after only 3 months, I'll never understand.

2772~~~
He's quite bulky and I think it'll just take him time. The reason people are hard on him is because he's first choice. We don't have great wing options so rightly or wrongly, Depay plays most weeks. He'll be a better player for it, and it's not his fault. He plays in a key position. We don't have great width from full back so the emphasis falls on Depay and young to get us playing - because if our width struggles, we struggle. He has to produce the goods, because who we going to replace him with? Only Young, Depay, Martial and on his day Wilson can give us penetration behind the full back

2773~~~
My opinion on Memphis is no less embarrassing than those who hyped him up to no ends.

2774~~~
Are the Netherlands definitely out of the Euros now? I think a proper rest during the summer will do Memphis good, he's already played a lot of football and looked a bit tired at times and there is still plenty to go.

2775~~~
In that case, I'll back him to embarrass you again, it may not happen this season but I'm damn sure it will in the coming seasons. I guess IYO Januzaj a bag of shite too.

2776~~~
Can you believe it's only october lol ? Fecking October and he came in August <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Player analysis is so sensational now it is embarrassing, even non united fans have too much to say about depay at this point, the no.7 shirt really does attract attention.

2777~~~
It's amazing, in my opinion, that people on here resort to crying "how can you write him off?" when there are (perhaps valid) questions as to why a certain player is automatic first choice.

However, having said that, I'm pretty sure that, had we not entered our now, traditional, seasonal, pre-xmas defensive crisis mode, maybe Young would have got a couple of starts in that position in place of MD by now. However, as Young is more versatile it has made sense to utilise our assets the way they have been to date.

The bust-up with RvP might be the first signs of cracks appearing … watch this space!

2778~~~
You haven't seen much then.

2779~~~
That doesn't make you any less embarrassing though does it.

2780~~~
This sentence makes no sense. Non at all.

2781~~~
sure he's been inconsistent but I'm still firm in my belief he'll eventually be some player for us. 
Might take a season or two but he'll get there

2782~~~
How about you give me their numbers after their first 2 months playing for their clubs? Makes sense right since we're comparing them to depay, who has been at his new club for just over 2 months though.

2783~~~
I don't see how one saying that they <span style="text-decoration: underline">think</span> he wont ever become one of the best players in the world (or whatever) counts as writing him off?
Are we not allowed to think this about a youngster?

2784~~~
Memphis was a very skilled dribbler in his teenage days, he was dribbling defenders crazy. He seems to have lost that close control of the ball if he doesn't get the time.

2785~~~
What is the meaning of writing a player off? Because I'm seeing very little of it here.

2786~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2787~~~
That's an example.

2788~~~
We are going against Lukaku who is in red-hot form, Id feel much safer with Jones and Smalling that can match him physically at least. We will need their defending much more than we will need playing from the back.Everton will have a real go at us.

2789~~~
Yes, he'll have the summer off. Lukaku and Pogba wont be keeping him company this time though.

2790~~~
Actually I've seen a lot. If you think Memphis has been great then excellent - I hope all United fans' standards have slipped as much as yours have.

2791~~~
Sure. As a matter of fact, I'll be more than happy to eat my words, hold my hands up and say 'I was wrong about Memphis' if he turns out to be the top talent many here convinced he will become. But unfortunately for you and me, I just can't see it happening.

My opinion on Januzaj in relation to Memphis is summed up in this post: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/memphis-depay-2015-16-performances.406638/page-64#post-18238613">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/memphis-depay-2015-16-performances.406638/page-64#post-18238613</a> - that is correct, I do think Januzaj has a higher ceiling than Memphis.

I can live with that. If having an unpopular opinion makes me embarrassing in any way, shape or form then so be it. All opinions are embarrassing anyway if you don't agree with them.

2792~~~
Give him time and he will come good, not even the greatest Ronnie C hit it off season 1

2793~~~
Good.

2794~~~
I think he's been neither but it is way to early to make a call after two months, He looks like someone who is having difficutly with being doubled up on and dealing with less space and time, things we all knew would happen. He hasn't been amazing but again to suggest he's been highly ineffectual in every game he's played it's just the opposite extreme.

There is a middle ground, I like to put myself there. Maybe some people should try it.

2795~~~
<span style="color: #ffffff">REALLY … it makes no sense … "<i>NON</i> at all"?</span>
To explain my sentence, that seems to have you confused, I was simply saying that some people on here seem to think it's an "all or nothing" situation. In their enthusiasm and love for the player himself they misread debate about him perhaps being rested as demands for him to be moved on like some sort of experiment that has not worked after 9 games <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> Go back and read it again, I think what i wrote makes sense and if it doesn't to you … then I really think you could have let it go!

<b>The long version of what I was trying to say in just a few words:</b>

Posters on here get a bit hysterical sometimes and seem to equate an honest questioning of someone's consistent inclusion with a call for that players head on a stick and resort to writing overly-dramatic replies saying "how dare you write him off altogether, he's only 21" when no-one is saying that (or very few are anyway)! 

There are <i>tactical football experts</i> here who write that they see him playing at a higher level than most others can understand or contemplate. There are naturally others who contribute here that see him falling short of his reputed standards (for one reason or another) but I doubt anyone in the latter camp is saying "get rid".

It's exactly what this place is here for … it's a debate. 

I think that he'll come good eventually once he realises he's gone from being "the most important part of a smaller machine" to just a <i>part</i> of a much bigger machine. I personally think he would maybe benefit from some time on the bench to reflect on where he's really at now, it might be a knock to his ego but it'll do him good in the long run. 

The pressure on him must be immense and perhaps he needs to step back a bit and take in the big step up he's had to make to get to where he is right now. I'm sure that it'll work eventually and while I'm not trying to second-guess the plans of the manager and his training team I wouldn't object to seeing him rested and brought on from the bench for a few of the less important games coming up!

2796~~~
He doesn't have to be world class to make it at United.

2797~~~
I'd start Young for this next few games and see how it goes. Memphis may be the more talented player but I think Young offers the team more overall for the following reasons:
- This would allow us to play Blind as lb, and him and Young formed a fantastic partnership last season. The reason that worked is because they complement each other so well. Blind is a defender but with brilliant attacking side to his game, while Young puts in a shift defensively thus allowing Blind the opportunity to push forward regularly.  I feel that Memphis doesnt really offer that, just like ADM didnt. With the tough run of games we are facing, we need every little bit of incremental improvement that we can get. 

- For motivational purposes too. If we start selecting the best performers that will push the players to improve themselves imo. One of the reasons that Young did so well last season especially in the run in was because he knew that he had to play very well each week to keep the club record signing and one of the best players in the world(Well, when signed anyway) out of the team. If he feels he can get a fair shot, I really think that would drive both of them to improve. I am not a fan of guaranteed starting positions, especially when the player in question is struggling with a capable deputy on the sidelines.  

- Will allow us to be more defensively compact. Everton away is a game that if you can nick a goal, and stay compact, you may just sneek out with a win. Its something that we used to do so well in the past.

2798~~~
I think that Memphis owns Martial big time for taking the media light away from him. If it wasn't for Martial and his price tag frenzy, Memphis would have it from the media a lot worse than he has. Some of it would be probably justified because he has not been that good.

He will be better.

2799~~~
Completely agree. Jones next to Smalling, Blind at LB and Young on the wing.

2800~~~
Will be interesting to see if he starts against Everton. It would be a testament to how much more we need to do in the market if we have to keep playing two players out of form cause there's no one else.

2801~~~
Young might play at left back. If Shaw hadn't got injured then I think Memphis would have been benched already with Young on the left wing. Instead Young has been earmarked as a potential stop gap at left back.

2802~~~
Yeah, definitely this.

It's massively unfortunate that our one major injury this season is one of few positions we have no depth in. We just don't have another left back, so Shaw's injury has had a major effect on the squad, having to pull players from the wings and centre back to fill in. If it was Darmian who got injured, we'd play Valencia there instead, and we'd carry on. Shaw's injury has been huge, and that's without even taking into consideration that he was our best and most consistent player up until that point.

2803~~~
I wouldn't actually mind seeing Memphis on the right wing for a few games. He's quite predictable when playing on the left in a sense that he always wants to cut inside, but on the right he could play a little bit more like a traditional winger, while also having the license to cut inside. He had a few moments like that for Holland and he looked good.

2804~~~
Interesting thought. He definitely needs a lot of improvement still. But bearing in mind that he is 21, and playing in a whole different environment, I still think he'll turn out to be a good player. Definitely not Hazard or Sanchez's league though.

2805~~~
Dutch media and sportspeople are heavily criticizing him today.

2806~~~
The Netherlands are an extremely poor side, he's just the easiest target as he comes across as flashy. 

But for United, he needs to be taken out if the firing line.

2807~~~
He was complete garbage in that Czech game.

He's a kid though so his inconsistency is expected, what is concerning me is his body language, he kind of struts around like he's made it, like he's doing everyone around him a favour by being on the pitch, now being an egomaniac is fine........ once you've actually made it (see Cantona, Ronaldo). 
Takes to the pitch all bulky looking with his arms greased up, tape around his wrists, fresh shape ups etc, its all very 'showey' tone it down a bit ffs, concentrate on your football.

2808~~~
Whats his haircut got to do with his ability? Hes a human being, he can have any hair he likes

2809~~~
I dont think its cockiness..in  a sense, I think its a defensive mechanism..the kid hasnt had the easiest upbringing ..the flashy stuff is almost a shield for him.

However I agree. he has to work harder defensively.

2810~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11931530/Manchester-United-fed-up-with-Memphis-Depay-attitude.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...nited-fed-up-with-Memphis-Depay-attitude.html</a>

Ouch

2811~~~
I was about to say the same thing. 

Feel for the kid tbh. It's a lot of pressure to play for United. Even the more 'experienced' players in our team struggle at times with the expectations from everywhere and everyone.

People need to realise SAF isn't here anymore. Youngsters are not able to be inconsistent anymore without it being a problem for the team as the media and some fans start getting on their case. For eg. Ronnie could make his mistakes whilst learning the ropes, but we had a solid team and SAF to pull us through and still get the results. There's no such luxury at the moment whilst we're trying to get back on top, and most of our players are still trying to find their feet in the premier league - so the pressure is intense. Can you imagine a youngster in that environment? They are bound to lose some confidence if their form drops off.

Martial is an exception at the moment - but he simply has a different temperament, so can't really compare them imo.

2812~~~
Just remind me of Nani a lot. Nani was a very good player but underachieved drastically. I hope the same doesn't happen to Memphis. He's only 21 though so I'm sure he'll get better.

2813~~~
How would this guy know if people at the club are already fed up? His claims seem to based on nothing<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Kid doesn't need this at the moment.

2814~~~
Was going to Google who he was but, I figured someone on here would know <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2815~~~
whereas martial looks extremely lively already, this lad needs fast forwarding for when he's actually ready.

2816~~~
Because a fan twitted something negative.

2817~~~
People need to remember that Martial comes from a league with good defenses and athletic players, the adaptation is a lot harder for Memphis.

2818~~~
I said it at the time that giving him the no. 7 was not a good idea..too much too soon..the pressure at United is out of this world. That's why I would ease him out of the side for a while. Fergie perfected this whereby he would take someone out of the firing line for their own good.Not every player can be played back into form. Giving him a rest would be best imo. 

Martial has helped him and Rooney tremendously.Just imagine if we didn't have him , the media would have a field day. Especially with Memphis.

2819~~~
Yeah. Definitely need to be taken out of the spotlight for a bit. And agreed he shouldn't have been given the No.7 yet - I think I did say they should have left it dangling there just to have it as an 'incentive'...make him work for it.

Ah well, hope someone at the club has the good sense to make the right decisions concerning him.

2820~~~
I am not so sure about that. I think its just a case of Martial being more talented. Anyway doesn't bother me. I think Depay has the basic tools and the hunger / desire. Lacking in confidence now. Unfortunately we don't have too many options to take him out of the limelight a bit. In the long term he will be better off if he can get thru this struggle. Giggsy can guide him.

2821~~~
Martial is more talented but the adaptation is also easier for him because of where he comes from.

2822~~~
Given Memphis' words about struggling to adapt to the demand of playing twice a week so far, it's almost as if he is wishing to be dropped/rested. I think LvG would be dumb not to. He started brightly, and even in the first 2 or 3 PL games where he didn't score or assist, he looked lively and threatening, used his pace well, made good runs behind and at the defenders. Since then, he looks shot. Jogs around aimlessly and his work rate has deteriorated with each passing game. He could do with a week or two off.

2823~~~
The pressure is a big ask. The last holder of the 7 shirt had to give it back remember? 

Playing him constantly then hooking him off at half-time does his morale no favours. Rather "rest"him for a couple of games.  Hopefully they will deal with this better.

2824~~~
I'm not worried yet about memphis, i expected a mixed season from him, but i do agree that he has this casual and lazy attitude on the pitch, and it doesn't help that he's always starting regardless to his form.

As frustrating as ronaldo was in his early years, fergie had faith him because he used to train harder than anyone else, he wanted to be the best and worked hard for it. I hope players like memphis, martial and adnan are aware that to be a top player it's not enough to show up at training and do your job, the fire needs to come from within, it'd be tragic if memphis think he's already made it.

2825~~~
His lack of form (which is not something to be too concerned about yet) makes the Januzaj loan look even more questionable.

2826~~~
In what way? He doesn't even speak the language.

2827~~~
Martial played in a better league against physically strong player while Memphis played in our Dutch Eredivisie against very poor defenders. Premier league has physically strong defenders so its quite new to Memphis while Martial was already used to it. In the Eredivisie Memphis could outmuscle everyone but he cant do that in the premier league so he has to find a new way... and hasnt found one so far.

Martial also played in the CL while Memphis only played EL. Those few minutes Memphis got at the WC dont really matter.

Really though, Martial is also just way more talented. If Martial came from the Eredivisie he would still be better than Memphis.

2828~~~
Come on mate, there are a bunch of valid criticisms one can throw at him without resorting to talking about the shape ups. A man can't get fresh no more?

In all seriousness, I and others can forgive poor form if you actually put a shift in. Cover for your full back. Make yourself available for passes. Keep on driving at the opponent. I remember Ronaldo had ruts of poor form but he never shied away from the ball. The showey flashy stuff doesn't come into it, he's gonna be young only once. There is a problem if he isn't applying himself on the pitch and in training.

2829~~~
I agree he should be free to express himself any way he sees fit, but his fashion choices (hair, the grill, the jacket etc) are like a Ballotelli sized target on his back currently and perhaps he'd best be advised to dial it down a touch to take some of that unnecessary pressure off of himself. 

The whole fashion thing and his choices "<i>should be</i>" directly proportional to his performances and at the moment he's making it too easy anyone wishing to turn a professional scathing critique into a personal one.

If he's backing it up on the pitch then no-one will question it, if he doesn't then he's making himself an easier target – because he's going to be a target anyway, even if he turns in an <i>average</i> performance at a club like ours.

2830~~~
He seems to lack determination and some fighting spirit. With him, it looks like the mental state is very important when he wants to reach top form

2831~~~
Needs to be dropped for a few games. I think he is physically and metanlly exausted currently and it is showing in his performances. He also struggles with the league a lot and needs to adapt his game.

2832~~~
That's how I see him at the moment .

2833~~~
Haha, apparently he even wore the wrong shirt to a game. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/memphis-depay-manchester-united-star-completes-miserable-week-by-wearing-wrong-netherlands-shirt-in-a6695231.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...ring-wrong-netherlands-shirt-in-a6695231.html</a>
He's not in a good spot mentally right now.

2834~~~
Love the excuses given to Memphis here.He has only himself to blame for his form so far, despite arguably LVG should have introduced him more slowly.

2835~~~
What does that mean? His fashion sense has got nothing to do with his ability. As for balotelli comparison, the difference is that he doesn't do shit like not training well, playing whenever he pleases, getting himself sent off, doing stuff like bursting crackers and almost burning down his house. As against this all Memphis has done is wear weird looking clothes and put on golden teeth. To say that he should dress up how he wants only if he plays well is preposterous. As long as he doesn't miss training, gives his all in games and training sessions, he could dress up like Justin bieber for all I care. Not to mention he has contributed 8 goals for us. You may say it's only Brugge where he got 2 goals and 2 assists against but that was arguably our most important game for the season and got us CL qualification. For someone who hasn't completed 15 games over the season let alone at this level, that's a decent return. 

What is surprising is people saying he doesn't have talent when he has plenty of that. What he lacks is experience to know how to act in situations, which cannot be learnt without playing. 

(Not all directed at you by the way <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>)

2836~~~
Young injured. Think this is his last chance to prove he should be in the starting 11.

2837~~~
I don't think so really. He will be getting plenty of chances, I am sure van Gaal will be consequent in that. 

That said, he's lucky to stay in the side. Should be rested, two 90' games for Holland probably won't help him.

2838~~~
Not as if he does much better tbf.

2839~~~
He was much better

2840~~~
No he wasn't.

2841~~~
He's going to have to work his ass off chasing Coleman down the wing, we have seen he has been a little lazy in that aspect before, hopefully the manager briefs him that he must do his best to track the runs. 

Fingers crossed though we are pushing them back instead.

2842~~~
Lol.

2843~~~
You may laugh, however in the few games he played (even though he was bullied off the ball alot) he created most of our chances.
Memphis has been poor, extremely poor (apart from in the UCL qualies).

2844~~~
Memphis in 10 matches has the same productivity as Januzaj in all his time here, Januzaj is an all fart no poo player and is even a different type of player than Memphis who is more of an wide attacker. Januzaj more of a creator. And I think you've forgotten our first few matches this season as well, he was our most dangerous player time and time.

2845~~~
I think that people are going overboard, Memphis decision making has been poor and his defensive contribution is none existent but he always puts himself in good positions, he hasn't been great but he is okay, to me he seemed tired in August and is too muscular.

2846~~~
What is your point, still fact remains he was better before he left. Thats is all.
I haven't forgotten anything, because Januzaj was actually our most dangerous, hence why he created most of our chances.
Memphis is obviously a good player, and he is dangerous, but that doesn't mean someone else wasn't doing better. No need to get so defensive and bring up irrelavant stats about peoples whole careers.

2847~~~
He certainly is more suited to the way we play under van Gaal than Memphis, who has been brought up in counter attacking system. He might of course change his style of play, but IMO it's rather unlikely and will be a long process. 
I'd take Januzaj on the left without a doubt.

2848~~~
So, deep breath …

I think what I wrote was pretty clear but I'll try to outline what I was thinking when I wrote it … <i>although, as a qualifier, I'd like to point out that this is a debate so you do understand there is no right or wrong, just personal opinions, yes?</i>

Exactly, couldn't agree more! I even stated in my post that he should be "free to express himself in any way he sees fit", be that: dumbass jacket, glasses, haircut, tats, grill etc. I just put forward the thought that, as he seems to be struggling with the step up at the mo it makes him an easy target and, as the press seem to be moving from professional to personal criticism it might be an idea to dial the crazy back a bit until he's proved himself on the pitch.

I didn't directly "compare" him to Balotelli for one second, go back and read it! I said he's making it too easy for the press in a similar way that Balotelli always did … no-one ever gave a toss about all the things you mentioned when Balotelli was hitching up his shirt at OT to reveal "Why always me?" on his undershirt … but the minute his on-pitch performances took a backseat to the bling and glitz he was doomed in this country. Beckham was run out of this club for concentrating on aspects of his life outside of football and he contributed (and still contributes) a hell of a lot more than Memphis has done … so far! <b><span style="color: #ffffff">Note the so far please lads!</span></b>

I take it that this is the bit you say is "not directed at me" as I never even touched on this but I will say, seeing as you bring it up, that the talk about the strength of the opposition that night has some value when assigning him credit for this. I know you can't pick and choose when to turn it on … but I'd have much rather seen a world class performance out of him when he played his first game back at PSV than at OT that night. The guy just needs time <i>and space</i> to concentrate on what he's obviously good at … which I will say again, he is not giving himself by making himself such an easy target for the press off the field.

Agree, and, although I never said that I will repeat what I've said earlier and before as I personally believe it to be true: he needs to give <i>himself</i> time and space to accrue that experience as well as asking patience from us … it's a two way street.

TFFT! A guy can get paranoid you know that was already written defending an earlier similar accusation! But good intercourse is what this forum is all about … <i>I'm going to regret writing I just know I am! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/><img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/></i>

Lool, what exactly did Januzaj do last season then? Absolute nothing under van Gaal, 0 goals and 1 assist from a rebound in dozens of matches. He just offers so little, is at United, Dortmund (besides meaningless friendlies), Belgium. I dont think Januzaj suits van Gaal either, the best form he showed was under counter attacking football under Moyes as well.

2850~~~
If you think that's irrelevant I wonder what you think is relevant, nor do I agree that Januzaj was any better at the start of the season. His general play is better than Depay's, but even last season we saw that he is even so frustrating the most of the time.

2851~~~
Probably the fact that my post you replied to was talking about this season.... but I digress.

2852~~~
Is memphis starting tomorrow? Talkshite were saying key United staff were getting abit pissed off with him?

2853~~~
Young is out so unless LvG wants to start Pereira there, Memphis gets that start by default.

2854~~~
I hope going out of the Euros he comes out with a fighting spirit and scores today, puts in a solid preforming and shuts his doubters wrong. The same for Januzaj too (the next time he plays).

2855~~~
I've taken him out of my fantasy team today, I hope he proves me wrong if he does play.

2856~~~
Dani Alves dress sense > Memphis

2857~~~
Been below average at best since joining in the league. One good game vs Brugge he needs taking out the starting 11, benched and has to work hard to get back in the team. Been disappointed with him as heard the hype but hadn't seen him but what I have seen he has yet to impress. I can't work out what he's good at. He seems to have a shot on him but doesn't have the option to go on the outside and cross with his left to mix it up a bit. Hopefully he starts to settle and we see his potential soon enough.

2858~~~
He'll come good I reckon.

2859~~~
Is Coleman fit? Could be a huge problem with Memphis his lack of tracking back..

2860~~~
Played the full 90 for Ireland against Poland, motm contender as well -- did an excellent defensive job against Lewandowski.

2861~~~
Will destroy Everton today.

2862~~~
Even he doesn't have the nerve to put in another lazy performance.

2863~~~
So not only fit but also in form? That could become a huge problem.

Memphis is not likely to get past Coleman that often since Coleman is a good player who is also quick and strong while Memphis might not track back when Coleman attacks. I dont expect much from Memphis today <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Rooney is also useless against Everton and in his current form he would be useless anyway. Martial to the rescue!

2864~~~
I'd maybe play Martial on the left, Memphis on the right. I think Martial would fare better against Coleman tbh, but it leaves the prospect of Rooney up front which could be disastrous. I'm hoping he'll have a good game, lots of points to prove today.

2865~~~
Hopefully he'll be on the bench today. He needs the rest and we can't afford to carry two donkeys in important games like this.

2866~~~
This could be the beginning of the end for him at United. I called it with di Maria and I have a similar feeling here, although he's obviously much younger and has a lot more time to find himself at the club and in the league. Performance wise, Martial, Young and even Mata clearly belong ahead of him on the wings. Once Januzaj returns the air is only gonna get thinner and since Lingard was solid today as well, Depay is gonna be in for a tough ride not only this year, but in the next few seasons. 

The only hope he has is that van Gaal trusts him a lot and plays him even when he performs poorly.

2867~~~
He needed the break to be honest. The step up in physicality between the NL and here is pretty big. Martial has adapted better as the French league might be even more physical than here. 

Hopefully he comes back a little bit more energised.

2868~~~
A lot of players have had long spells on the bench but when given their chance, they seized it and gained Van Gaal's trust. Mata, Fellaini, Herrera and Young last season ended up as our key players.

Januzaj, Di Maria, Falcao, and to a lesser extent Wilson didn't hence they failed to earn spot in the starting line up.

If Depay is going to go through a phase on the sidelines then he needs to keep motivated and ready to make an impact. Not half-arse it on the field because you may get a tap in and then you think you're safe. Di Maria admitted this was a problem. He'd get an assist and think his poor general play is excused but not in Van Gaal's eyes.

2869~~~
Ffs. He's a 21 year old going from the Eredivisie to the premier league. He shouldn't have been an automatic starter from the off, but he's still shown his quality in spurts. He's going to become a top player for us, Van Gaal benching him after a poor spell of form after playing 3 times a week for probably the first time in his life in a tough league is nothing surprising. What young players need is time to get things right, and he'll get that. He's not going to start every game, but to say it's the beginning of the end of him after 2 months here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Pull it together.

2870~~~
I'm pretty calm, just making a rational observation based on the fact that he has yet to have a good performance in the BPL, is at a big club with massive expectations and has plenty of players performing well ahead of him. People said I was overreacting in di Maria's case when I called it early and see how that turned out. If he had at least had some decent games in the Premier League and had just hit a poor run of form, I would disagree, but outside of that Brugge game and some preseason games, he's been garbage. 

I'm not saying it's gonna happen right away, but it feels like a process of him failing here has started.

2871~~~
He has had plenty of decent games. He played well against Southampton and was unlucky not to score, he was probably our best player against Newcastle and our only threat in that game, was decent in our first few league games when we weren't scoring. Played well in the champions league games as well. It's just his recent form has been poor, more or less coinciding with Shaw getting that injury. It's nothing to worry about. Happens to everyone. Just because you guessed Di Maria was unhappy and wanted to go somewhere else doesn't mean that it's the same case with Memphis. Once he adapts to the league, he'll become a top player for us, really have no doubt about that. Van Gaal will give him time to develop, sometime put him out of the spotlight like today. All players need that, especially young players. I'm sure Martial will go through a bad run of form some time this season as well. It's just something that happens.

Anyway, he's got 4 goals and 4 assists for us already. Pretty decent productivity for a 21 year old going to a new league.

2872~~~
I have a different memory of him in the BPL to be honest, especially reflecting on it now. He was perhaps the best player on a very poor team, but that still doesn't mean he did well himself. He played well against Brugge and I forgot the Eindhoven game, but he didn't do well against Wolfsburg.

2873~~~
It's like when a player is entering a rough patch of form, sometimes they're decent, sometimes poor, but then everyone just blurs the decent performances with the bad ones and just say he's been bad altogether. Even if he had a pretty good game. Sometimes players who are in a slump need a genuinely very good game to get out of a slump and have people notice it.

2874~~~
Hope he realizes you have to work hard at this club. Arsenal game was unacceptable.

2875~~~
Harsh on him to say this but replacing him with Herrera and moved Martial wide has give us a breath of fresh air.I have a same feeling with <a class="username" data-user="82503, @Wade3" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82503/">@Wade3</a> but obviously it's way to soon to write him off in any form.

2876~~~
Surprised to see a few people writing him off. New league, big move to big club. Give him some time. Its not like he has been abysmal either. Has shown glimpses even if it is against Brugge. Nowhere near worried.

2877~~~
Needs to stop going to the gym and do more work on the field and the tactical board.

2878~~~
This. The way people have been writing him off is pathetic. I remember similar performances from a young Ronaldo. In fact remember fans calling for Ronaldo's head after the World Cup incident. Good job you fans aren't the manager. Clueless.

2879~~~
The gym is not a problem at all, he's young and has plenty of time to improve.

2880~~~
I'm not saying we should sell him or cut him. I'm projecting a path that could happen. I don't deny his talents, I'm high on him myself, but given that he's been performing poorly for a while, that multiple players ahead of him are clearly better options right now and that we are still a big club that can't give him forever to become a consistent performer, this could be the start of the end for him. 

Ronaldo was 18 when he joined this club, Memphis is 21. In the 06/07 season, when Ronaldo was 21, he had 23 goals and 23 assists to his name. While that's not the telling statistic, it goes to show how far ahead Ronaldo was at that age. The year after, Ronaldo was in the discussion for best player in the world already. 

I was trying hard to see the performances in a positive light, as I obviously want him to succeed, but they simply weren't that good. Look at Martial today for example. He was struggling at times, he had two or three guys thrown at him, but he still had a big impact on that left side simply by playing smart football. He moved well without the ball, made good decisions and found many ways to impact the game. He wasn't the massive force he was on previous nights, but still gave us a lot.

2881~~~
Steady on.

2882~~~
Hazard went from scoring just under 1 in 2 in France to 1 in 5 in his first season at Chelsea. It's his first season in the UK not his 4th. That comparison isn't fair even if you discount the fact that <i>it's Ronaldo</i>.

2883~~~
I didn't bring it up, the guy I quoted did. I don't wanna compare to one of the best players of all time, as that's not fair to him.

2884~~~
You did bring up the age comparison though, which isn't fair not just because it's Ronaldo but because it also wasn't his first season.

2885~~~
Best to leave Ronaldo out of this thread. Anyone who gets compared to him or Messi are usually destined to disappoint, obviously. 

Its also bizarre that some are already writing him off - just highlights the disgusting, instant gratification culture of fans these days.

2886~~~
He needs time. He's always needed time. The expectation that he'd be at the level we need - and, going on our transfer business, were expecting - was always really optimistic. There's loads of talent there. In a more cohesive attacking side he might have shown more by now. I think by this time next season we'll be seeing a better player who will have nailed down his spot in the side.

2887~~~
It would be just great if we could not throw our young player under a bus just because the team played well without him.

It's a long season, with four competitions, each of which we'll be trying to win, so he's going to have a huge part to play.

2888~~~

2889~~~
People writing him off are clueless. He's played like what, 10 games.

He's a similar age to De Gea when he first came, and Memphis first ten games weren't as bad as Daves and look how he turned out.

He's 21 ffs.

2890~~~
De Gea is a GK, so this is not really a good comparison. Him having good games early on was completely forgotten because of his mistakes on the other games.

Memphis hasn't really shown anything to suggest that he's even nearly as talented as people say. He was Eredivisie topscorer at 21, but still the price tag and the expectations (#7) went really overboard. I'm quite concerned by his lack of footballing intelligence but to overcome that he could of course become that "goal-scoring winger" everyone was raving about. I just don't see the ability.

2891~~~
I would put him on the right wing for a change, since Martial showed yesterday he can easily play off the left.

Playing on the left is his comfort zone, playing on the right could give him new perspective of which LVG asks from him since he couldn't cut in on the right foot as an easy option like he can while playing left.

He's young and learning, talent is there, it's just matter of how LVG and staff handles him and his reaction to it.

2892~~~
From LVG's comments, sounds like he has lost his place for now.

2893~~~
Quality young player. Martial has done him no favours though cause he's everything he's not in the right way on and off the pitch. Maybe that number 7 shirt was a little premature and should have earned the right to wear it......

2894~~~
Probably the right decision resting him this weekend, he's only young and we should give him time off where we can. Also he's played far better in the CL for us up to now so he should be fresh for the CSKA match.

2895~~~
We don' have to go back as far as the Daves and the Ronaldos.. Shaw was getting the same treatment just last year when he was "fat" "ovetpriced" "overrated" etc.

2896~~~
Yeah, I'd like to see him on the right. Just tell him to beat his man and get a decent ball in. I know it's basic but I think it would benefit him to try something other than cutting inside and looking to shoot.

2897~~~
I don't think anybody's surprised he's dropped. His performances were not good enough even for the bench of a club like ours. He was given enough chances but simply couldn't get on. Right now it's time to give chance to Lingard/Pereira/Young. SUb appearance for Memphis here and there. You'll see he will try harder..

Anyway I told you since the day one, he's far from complete player and shouldn't be automatic no1 choice. Right now it's our weekest point in the squad. If we want to win anything this year we need world class winger in January..

2898~~~
You don't see the ability? His goals against Brugge were amazing. He dictated both our Play off games, arguably our most important games. He had bad games of course but ability and talent is clear. Once he gets experience, he will be good.

2899~~~
It's good that he gets a rest. Hopefully, it also gives him a push to work harder and get back into form

2900~~~
Have I really just read someone say this could be the beginning of the end for him here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2901~~~
Great to have a player of his quality fighting for his place. Will be a great option from the bench when he isn't starting.

We looked infinitely better with Herrera in the side so Memphis needs to either force his way past Rooney/Martial or learn to play on the right.

2902~~~
Getting rested for a match means he is done now? Whatever the outcome, making such a statement at this point in time is at least an overreaction.

2903~~~
Some people saying he should be taken out of the firing line, others think he is finished? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

LVG has given Memphis a little reminder that he hasn't made it just yet, especially by bringing lingard on instead. 

He is still class though, he just needs to up his game and work that little bit harder.

2904~~~
Reckon he'l start vs CSKA. He's done alright in the CL/qualifiers.

2905~~~
What an amazing thread. I am laughing and getting dissapointed at some of our fans at the same time..

2906~~~
<a class="username" data-user="92231, @iammemphis" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/92231/">@iammemphis</a> your username is a curse. Change it to something normal FFS! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2907~~~
This.

2908~~~
God, i know. Maybe someone shit already like iamrooney or iamrojo haha.

2909~~~
I don't like how he keeps getting criticized publicly like that. Maybe it's because they all see his enormous talent and want him to really "wake up".

2910~~~
Sorry for the rudeness but what are people smoking here saying he should play on the right?His strength has always been cutting inside and shoot and he hasn't done anything much in the league playing by his strength now you want him to play in a way that wasn't his game?Mata,Young and Lingard are all more viable options there.Even him as a number 10 would be a better suggestion.

2911~~~
Let's not be too hard on Memphis.  Inconsistency in form is the norm for young players.  We've seen enough in him to know he can make a fantastic contribution to United.  I can't comment on his personal life but what I'd like to see in his game is more variation in his 1v1 moves on defenders and greater reliance on his left foot.

2912~~~
How about something like mufc99. Don't curse any of our players lol.

Then again, iamrooney may have the opposite effect and he might turn good.

2913~~~
Surely you don't want me to curse to the whole United team <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2914~~~
I think it's good that he sits out a fair bit because he has frankly not been good enough thus far. Maybe this time out will give him a bit of perspective and force him to knuckle down and offer the team more.

2915~~~
He's alright.  He just need to accept that he's not messi and stop trying to be one (yet) 

Keep it simple and when the times comes do the unexpected. He's very predictable he made it easy to anticipate

2916~~~
You are stretching it a bit are you not? Brugge are amongst the weakest opposition we have faced this season. He played well in one of the games although his overall showing this season have been very underwhelming. This doesn't mean anybody is writing him off just factual that he's been mediocre at best in the premier league games since joining.

2917~~~
The finishes were brilliant even against such opposition. He has ability just not experienced enough at the big stage. The post I replied to said they didn't see his ability

2918~~~
He is getting the Ashley Young treatment from his full backs who know he will go on the inside regardless of them guiding him there. Unlike Ashley he has the pace to be able to keep it simple and beat them on the outside and provide a pass/cross in or to turn again. Maybe playing off the right would be easier for him as beating someone on the outside is way more difficult than cutting inside and having his stronger foot to do it doesn't seem like a bad idea. 

All that pace he has goes pretty unnoticed the way he is playing now, so he's far from using his abilities the best way he can.

2919~~~
He's getting the same shit almost every signing we make gets and it's getting ridiculous. Darmian had 1 bad game against Sanchez which I believe no fullback is able to contain 1 vs 1 and suddenly quite a few were suggesting he's average, doesn't bring anything to the team and the rest of it.

2920~~~
Think people seen to forget that he's a 21 year old straight from Holland. He's not been electric every game but he has managed to bang in 4 goals so far which is brilliant. Give him time and he will flourish.

2921~~~
One of the greatest comments I've ever seen on an article. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2922~~~

2923~~~
I know he was brought on with only 10 minutes to play but his body language was atrocious.

2924~~~
He didn't even look interested tonight and should be nowhere near the first eleven right now.

2925~~~
Body language experts are in again... Had one decent move, besides that nothing again. See more potential in Lingard atm.

2926~~~
Put in a decent cross. 10 mins is too short of a sample to rate but he was at times too individualistic in some phases. The team needed him to fizz the crosses in or keep the ball moving, not be a Hazard style ball hogg and pace changer (reducer) but in his defence that also requires Fellaini to drift off him as crossing to Rooney is pointless.

2927~~~
Agreed but we both know it's down to LvG that we play at a slow pace.

2928~~~
How did you possibly come to that conclusion?

Madness.

2929~~~
I would have brought him on sooner(as soon as we scored, CSKA were tiring a bit).

But meh cameo.

2930~~~
Does he always have to shift it onto his right? Looks a bit predictable. Also needed to use Blind on the overlap abit more.

2931~~~
Looked like he had played the previous 80 minutes

2932~~~
Thought he had one good cross and looked decent when he got the ball.Shouldn't judge a player on a 10 min cameo mind.

2933~~~
His close control is atrocious. The ball bounces away from him so easily.

2934~~~
Average player, short in confidence. You can't possibly expect more.

2935~~~
He never looks "up for it" for me. Like everything is played at such a slow pace with him. 

He needs to think and play a lot quicker than he is doing now.

2936~~~
10 mins of meh. it's a change of the 90 mins of meh.

2937~~~
While it's ridiculous to judge a player on a 10 minute cameo when we'd settled for a point already, I will ask this:

1.
-------------Rooney
Martial-----Herrera-----Mata

2.
-------------Martial
Memphis---Herrera----Mata

What is going to give more immediate results and better football and which one of those will benefit us most in the long term?

2938~~~
You would expect he was eager to inject energy and make something happen.

2939~~~
Both options include 3 good players and 1 at current form very average so they are both equal in my opinion.
I now you can't judge a player on 10 minutes but Memphis has been very poor for a long time now and today was just more of the same so in my opinion he should no start right now.

2940~~~
Memphis shouldn't even be playing games at all for us, let alone a cameo. But seriously. This guy, Memphis, I honestly don't know what some people see in him. He's got a decent cross and shot but that's about it; no pace, no first touch, no upper body strength despite his built, a poor dribbler of the ball and the list goes on and on.

Again, I'd love it if one day he proves me wrong, but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic.

2941~~~
Put one good ball in but looked like he was struggling to get the ball under control most of the time.

2942~~~
I think part of the reason he was poor in his previous outings was having Rooney playing number 10. It would be interesting to see if he looks better with Herrera playing number 10.

2943~~~
Don't have to be an expert to see that he's lazy and uninterested.

2944~~~
I knew he wasn't that good with the ball at his feet from PSV but It's much worse than I thought.

2945~~~
This.

The caf have it in for Depay and I'm not sure why. Reminds me of how we treated Nani.

Comparitively I'd much prefer Depay to Lingard who provided nothing but short safe passes. We practically had two right backs on in my opinion. At least Depay has cutting edge.

Let him express himself. I feel he will come good. Does he not have 4 goals and 4 assists this season? Not bad.

2946~~~
So are we writing him off after two months?
They're right. Things do move faster as you get older.

2947~~~
I wouldn't write him off but he doesn't seem to want to do a lot when he gets on. You'd expect him to come on full of energy and ready to show what he can do but he's slow to react, gives up on chasing balls and usually just listlessly runs into opposition players when he has the ball. Looking rather Di Maria-esque right now and I'm wondering if it's a similar issue.

2948~~~
Looked shocking when he came on. He needs to get his shit together.

2949~~~
Like how he ran into the referee. Not once did he look up to see where he was running to or if he could see a pass.

2950~~~
don't know about the "already writing him off" or "it was only minutes" - he just hasn't played well and that 10 minutes looked like his 90 minute displays so far. must improve his game or get used to 10 minutes off the bench.

2951~~~
if where talking long term, i think we should be playing Herrera in center midfield with schneiderlin, and if where talking long term whose to say a spell on the bench won't do Memphis some good? he certainly needs to learn that he has to be more of a team player then he has so far.

2952~~~
I bet Zaha wouldn't play worse if he was given as many chances as Depay. Sometimes it's all about confidence and it's very low now with Memphis.. he will come good eventually but I am a bit worried with how we'd started the seasons in terms of quality on wings.. At least Jesse and Andreas will get their chances but Memphis shouldn't have been an automatic starter but one for the future. We'll see how it turns out..

2953~~~
He was barely on today, he played 10 min and we played the ball to the left 4 times? How on earth could you see that he was lazy/ uninterested?

2954~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2955~~~
Thought I was in the Rooney thread for a moment.

2956~~~
One thing I've noticed is that he doesn't use his fullback enough. There were a couple of times today when he ran into trouble and could have used Blind to get out and try again, but he just doesn't want to do it. It was the same story before when you'd see Shaw bombing off down the flank and Memphis ignoring him. I think he's trying a bit too hard to prove himself at the moment.

2957~~~
Stop talking sense Sammyjunn or you'll get locked from the thread!!! Lol

2958~~~
Quite!

Earlier in the season, the same body language was being praised. But now the worm has turned, it's suddenly indicative of all that's wrong with him.

2959~~~
How people have lost patience so quickly astounds me. We are mostly static and pedestrian, yet we are so quick to get on the backs of those who try something a little bit different. He is obviously struggling and what he is trying isn't coming off but the potential is there.

2960~~~
This thread is a joke

2961~~~
I think LvG made him a key player and gave him the #7 too early. A false sense of security and let his cockiness shine through a little.

He'll come good, just not as fast as we hoped he would.

2962~~~
If we start to build the tempo up a bit, we will really see him benefit. He was also looking absolutely knackered before LVG benched him. 

We knew it would take time for him to adapt, but his performances vs Brugge made people think that he would be putting 8-9/10 performances every week. He'll come good.

2963~~~
I thought he was good, he made beautiful cross to Martial who should make better pass to Fellaini. It could be a winning goal.

Other than that he tried to do the same 2-3 times but he was doubled all the time and when he managed to get himself in good position a fecking referee decided that he want to play also.

We all saw with beloved Martial that it is not easy to play on the wing especially yesterday when CSKA was very good in defense and they constantly doubled our wingers.

2964~~~
Tosic and Fernandes were doing a very good job closing off the wing and not giving us any space, so you have to give them credit really, Memphis wasn't really on the pitch long enough to properly effect the game, but as the post above says he could easily have created a goal with the cross to the back post.

2965~~~
Both of you know feck all about body language.

They doubled up on our wingers and he only had 10 mins, he put in a cross that could of lead to a goal had martial got a better touch, if it did his job would of been done.

2966~~~
Every one is making excuses for him, the thing is he is shit right now, if he was playing this way for city/liverpool we would be laughing our ass off. I was sure he would come good, right now i am not even sure he will be an important player here. Lingard had a better game than him, which speaks volumes about him. I think the problem here might not be talent but attitude. Adel taraabt comes to mind, he looks moody devoid of any idea or skill to beat a man, even tosic looked better than him.

2967~~~
Lot slower than i expected, maybe carrying an injury? or maybe he wan't that fast in the first place?

2968~~~
Memphis played for 10 minutes...

F*ck me. He put in the cross that probably should of lead to a goal.

2969~~~
Basically this. He is shit at the moment but I still think he is too talented not to make it here, time will tell though!

2970~~~
Why "Should" it have led to a goal? martial made it look like a chance, a player of shorter height wont have got there. Yes he played for 10 mins but he also has played 5 other games where he has looked equally shit. Calling shit a shit in these parts seem to be out of fashion. 

Here is his 10 mins performance. 2 bad touches, one cross, looses the ball 3 times and thats it.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xL8q0JY4Reg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2971~~~
He made 1 mistake (at 1:10 when he should pass to Blind) Again 1 mistake. FFS people.

2972~~~
Do you Completely ignore 3 bad touches and fecking always cutting back in when he should try and take one man on the outside? He did one good thing in that video. Are you blind? cause if you were you would probably give memphis a mouthful for ignoring him 2 times.

2973~~~
This situation isn't exactly new. A player comes in from a weaker league, finds it difficult and loses confidence. It'll take time to adapt. Tearing it up in Holland means next to feck all.

2974~~~
There is 1 bad touch when he was pushed and i think one when a defender kicked a ball in out and the ball was again ours. When he cut back he would have a great chance if the fecking ref wouldn't decided that he want to defend also.

It is becoming laughable how some of you criticize Memphis for every little mistake.

2975~~~
I kind of agree but I will say this. It makes it awfully easy to defend against you when EVERYONE knows you are going to just cut back onto your right foot and come inside. Why does he not add some more varieaty to him game, its really baffling.

2976~~~
Agree with the sentiment he cuts back to often, he needs to take on the full back more , that's why i have questioned his pace maybe he's not that quick.

2977~~~
He doesn't really deserve to start games any time soon. I would move Lingard ahead of him in pecking order and see what he has to offer. Lingard uses the ball much better, and I think he can be goal threat when played on the left.

2978~~~
You don't even need to be that quick, and the silly thing is the couple of times I have seen him do it, he has suceeded in beating his man. 
Problem is that he seems hell bent on coming inside and getting a goal for himself

2979~~~
Agree with this esp with Young out. Ideally Mata would come back into the right, Lingard on the left and Martial upfront.

2980~~~
I agree with this but don't forget, he cut back 2 times and was succesfull 2 times. But yes defenders know what he will do and in next game maybe he will lose the ball everytime he will try to cut back.

I think he "can only cut back" because he didn't really play at PSV like a natural winger the way he is playing at United. He usually played like a wide forward in a free role like Mata have in our team and he was usually running at defenders with speed. He must improve on the wing but i think he is strugling because he is adapting to new role which is kind of alien to him and he must develop tools to be successful in that role.
Our setup it pretty clear, left winger is always on the wing and try to make pitch wide and right winger has a free role. Not only because Mata is playing on the right side but also yesterday Lingard had a really free role when Martial was very disciplined in staying wide and he also often strugled when he was doubled and lacked ideas what to do.

2981~~~
Good point, i think he may struggle against the quicker full backs. Maybe he is instructed to cut in by the manager?

2982~~~
Hes been doing it his whole career.

2983~~~
We can hope so, and I am not a big fan of judging a player in his first season. Saying that, I think that he has been shocking (not average) for us bar in a couple of games. Looks completely dumb in the pitch by trying to dribble every time he has the ball and failing always at it, doesn't offer much threat and doesn't contribute defensively. I haven't watched much of him before he came here, so cannot comment how talented is him, but really Januzaj in Moyes season was twice the player Memphis has been for us so far.

2984~~~
He's not really a quick player but he's a powerful runner which could be deceptive.

2985~~~
I think this would be my biggest criticism of him.
He's kind of predictable atm. 

Theres a good player in there though imo. 4 goals is a great start

2986~~~
Plus 4 assists... he was righly dropped after his lack of effort vs Arsenal though

2987~~~
He needs to step it up because he's looking at long spells on the bench when Young gets back. Rooney isn't going to be dropped. That leaves him behind both Martial and Young in that position.

2988~~~
He hasn't been playing well, its hard to argue that he deserves to start atm.
But start bringing him on later in the game maybe?

2989~~~
The funny thing is, he is having exactly the same issues as ADM <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2990~~~
he would have seen him if he had his head up. 10 mins or 90 mins the performances look the same. not saying he won't come good but for now the bench looks the place for him.

2991~~~
Do you want to say that Memphis should try to avoid the ref. I always thought that it is other way around, probably Memphis thought the ref will move from his path but he just didn't do it.

2992~~~
Its a bit odd to critisise him for the ref getting in his way. He is playing poorly, but that is just being silly

2993~~~
I don't agree, ADM showed moments of brilliance and it at this stage looked generally good. Memphis hasn't looked good at all apart from 2 games in truth.

2994~~~
I'm talking about in they way they struggled, not in the amount of games they were good.

2995~~~
Hope he will come good. He's a talented player but something just dosnt look right at the moment.

<a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a>, whats your take on whats going on?

2996~~~
Yep.  I think Dirk Kuyt scored a Hatrick this weekend for Feyenord! 

He is young, give him time.

2997~~~
Some Dutch journo said he's the kind of character that could sulk if he wasn't starting games. That might exhaust the patience of LVG and his staff faster than any poor performances.

2998~~~
Obviously ten minutes isn't enough to really say much, but keeping in mind the rest of his recent performances and just the "look" of him on the pitch. I don't feel confident at all with him in the team right now. I'm not asking him to be sold, he just needs to improve a lot more before I can trust him as a united player. Should be starting the CC games to gain match experience but nothing more right now.

2999~~~
He's never going to play well or have an impact in games where teams sit behind the ball and stay compact. 

Though he still made some braindead decisions and passes on a couple of occasions, so there's really no excuse for that.

3000~~~
If that's the case, we might as well sell him in January. 90% of the teams we face fall into that category.

3001~~~
PSV is his level

3002~~~
We don't know that yet. It's quite silly to write him off this early.

I agree that the recent benching was needed to give him a wake up call. I do think, however, that with so much football still to be played, Louis needs to play him through long periods of frustration and not drop him for spells at a time every time he doesn't deliver. He's a very raw talent who needs consistency in game time in order to reach maturity. If we play him inconsistently we'rr most likely going to end up with another Nani on our hands because we stymied his development.

We need to show patience and belief that he will improve because he will once he matures like Ronny did. He clearly has a lot of growing up still to do, and it helps that we brought in a player like Bastian who's a leader with plenty of experience.

3003~~~
I was joking.

3004~~~
Would absolutely hate that attitude, especially in a younger player that hasn't particularly played well. 

Fans will get behind a player that we realize is struggling but giving it their all.

3005~~~
We already have one passenger that we cant drop in the team..that negatively disadvantages us...If Young gets back to the side, I struggle to see Memphis getting back his spot. Not because Young is more talented, but LVG usually rewards those that follow his instructions and are playing well. Young has done that very well for LVG.

3006~~~
If you'd never seen or heard of him before, you'd be struggling to work out what things he's actually good at.

And that's whats worrying me most atm. Poor/inconsistent performances aren't a big deal, yet. He's still young. Its the lack of evidence of actual ability that is the worrying thing. So far, he's not shown that he's particularly good at anything.

3007~~~
I get what you mean but Memphis has not played even half a season for us. He deserves patience if we want to build for the future. He's only 21. We need to do this right and not waste his talent.

3008~~~
True, but LVG will have considered that too, but he's still dropped him.

I actually think this is better, it forces to fight for his place and is a measure of his mental strength. He'll never survive here without that.

3009~~~
Looks like Van Gaal is trying to teach him a lesson.

3010~~~
Leaving him out is the right thing to do. Hopefully he will come back more determined, if he sulks then he isn't good enough for United.

3011~~~
If the rumours of an attitude problem are true, then he should be benched even more. 

I'd rather have Young who is back in training too.

3012~~~
He's now behind Lingard in the pecking order, hopefully he responds the right way.

3013~~~
Worst thing is I don't think he would have injected any urgency if he came on.

3014~~~
The thing with Memphis is he's played poorly so far this season yet has still scored 4 goals and got 4 assists in all competitions. He could quite easily end up double figures for each if he actually gets on the pitch which would be a very good return. He seems to make something happen, just not to the extent Martial does.

3015~~~
He deserves to be out of the team he was playing very poorly until he got benched. We will now see what he is made of either he starts working twice as hard in training to win his place back or he starts sulking and his United career could end a lot sooner than we and he expected.

3016~~~
Maybe Rooney could get some of that treatment.

3017~~~
Didn't the Brugge qualifiers massively boost his stats? Don't have the figures on me, but I'm fairly sure he got a few goals/assists over both games. They still count, of course, but it was mostly a very easy win for us, so I'm not sure I'd put too much into the 4/4 figures right now.

I'm sure he'll be fine. He'll probably be annoyed to be out of the team, but I'm sure he'll know that he'll still get plenty of chances to work his way back into the side.

3018~~~
Yep, 2 of each across the 2 games.

I just get the impression he wants to become more of what Ronaldo is now I.e pure goal output, rather than developing his all round play.

3019~~~
I belive he will be fine to but coming from the Eredivision to the PL is a big step up and he still has a lot of learning to do. I think a lot of people me included had way to big expectations on him to instantly deliver but the fact is he is a young lad getting used to a new country and a new league so he will need to be given time to settle in.

3020~~~
Will be a real test for his character considering Lingard, despite being older, isn't exactly more developed than him and has never played at PL level before this season also if you discount 20 min against Swansea.Lucky for him that Januzaj has already been sent out on loan so we surely will still need him at some points.

3021~~~
We've heard a lot about his confidence and fitness dedication, but this is the mental test as he's been used to golden boy status, not bench boy bit part. Hopefully he rises to the challenge and ups his level rather than sulking.

3022~~~
I know he's not exactly set the world alight but I can't help feel we'd look better with him him off the left and Martial up top rather than accommodating Rooney by shoving our biggest goal threat out wide.

3023~~~
I'm not confident at all about him rising up to the challenge but obviously it just my personal feeling, not writing him off by any mean.

3024~~~
I get that concern, his lifestyle and personality seem volatile.

3025~~~
It's no coincidence his form has dropped since shaws injury.

3026~~~
Nah I don't think he was particularly good before that.

3027~~~
Hoping he will start against Middlesborough and show the form he showed against Brugge. With Rooney in such poor form he needs to show LVG he can trust him on the left, and let Martial stay upfront.

3028~~~
I agree. For one we would look amazing on the counter attack <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>.

3029~~~
Why does he need to change his game to suit us? If that's the case then why did we buy him, just so we can do a Di Maria with him?
This is just stupid from the manager and club, to hinder the development of yet another outstanding talent while we rather give time to players who at best will only ever be squad players.
What was so wrong about what he was doing at PSV last year, expressing himself, being the main man and playing his game what was so wrong about it that now he has to sacrifice all of that to be apart of team philosophy etc, etc. Memphis is what he is, a counter attacking footballer who like to be in attacking position to get the best out of him. We allowed Ronaldo to roam free and express why have we stop doing this now, even under Moyes we allowed Januzaj to express himself and he was great but under LVG again that's all changed. It's depressing to see what we have done and are doing to some of our players under LVG, I don't want to see Depay change the way he played his game at PSV in fact I want him to continue to do the same at UTD, I want a player to be confident in his ability and express himself and we should try and solutions to fit these players into the system like we have done for Fellaini etc.
Before anyone point out Martial performance this season he wasn't the main man at Monaco and he hadn't shown the type of player he could be, now we are seeing him develop into a player he could be under LVG.
I'd rather have LVG say the he made a mistake in buying Memphis than treat him this way. The other aspect that really annoys me is the other talented player we have at the club like Wilson, Pereira and Goss won't get a look in unless first the apply themselves in a certain way rather then express the players they can be. It's all well to and good to develop players a certain way but allow them to express themselves too rather than to pass sideway and backwards all the time just to be a part of team philosophy.

3030~~~
Maybe it's more about his attitude than his game? Young players get challenged like this a lot, forced to work their way back into the team. He has the talent to make that happen and I hope he does.

3031~~~
No, I agree. I would rather see LVG live and die with the young guns rather than keep on wasting time, space, and energy in accommodating Rooney.

The problem, however, is that the punishment is getting closer and closer to being disproportionate while there is one other guy who should have received the same kind of punishment out there and regardless of past reputation.

3032~~~
Just play him. Rooney's form is rotten, so give the centre forward slot to Martial. 

The open left wing slot should be there for Memphis, Lingard and Pereira to fight over, and also Young when he's fit again. Why persevere with a perennially underperforming 30 year old when we have young players who are only going to improve by getting game time? Why are we putting our best centre forward out wide so we can shoehorn in our most impotent attacking player in that position?

Any United related thread can be turned into a Drop-Rooney discussion without going off-topic. It's having that big of an effect.

3033~~~
Agree with that

3034~~~
Was hoping Januzaj and Depay would be instrumental for us this year, with perhaps both playing or providing competition/cover for each other. 

Nevertheless hopefully both will turn it around and take Martial's example. Not too digress too much further, but it cant be stated too emphatically just how fantastic the Frenchman has been thus far.

3035~~~
He's having the sort of season i expected Martial to be having. when you grab a player around the 20 year age mark, its nieve to think they will instantly hit the ground running. but what frustrates me about him though is he doesn't utilise his strengths at all, he's a strong, quick athlete yet never attempts to take a man on, i think i expected a little more from his dribbling as well. 

Everything he does screams Style over substance, he will hit the byline only to cut back and play a pass back to shove the actual responsibility of making a play on somebody else.

Has all the potential though, have high hopes for him when he pulls his finger out.

3036~~~
If he's anything like his idol Ronaldo this will force him to train and work harder than ever before to achieve greatness.

Over to you Memphis.

3037~~~
this. he certainly got the talent, now is all about his will and character.

should get a start against boro next. hopefully he'll take his chance.

3038~~~
He needs to work harder. 

Martial has worked harder on the left more than him. Depay seems to think he's Ronaldo. Rio said a few days ago that the players allowed Ronaldo to cheat because he scored so many goals and there's no need for him to track back.

3039~~~
Our front three should be Memphis, Martial & Mata.

Memphis and Martial would kill teams on the break. If we could get a pacey wide option we could move Mata infield.

I don't think the current formation suits Memphis either, he sits far wide in the 4-2-3-1 than he would a true 4-3-3.

3040~~~
Hopefully he gets a chance again soon, at least some time off the bench. He was in some very bad form so the drop is deserved but we could really use someone like him out wide right now. If he can fulfill some of the promise we know he has we'll look a much better team.

3041~~~
I'm in the minority here, but I would prefer Young to be given a chance..he didnt really do anything to lose his place.

3042~~~
Well, they are not working for the same spot. Right now, he's being benched by Martial on the wing, because of Rooney as striker. Lingard is backing up Mata. 

We could really try Memphis on the wing again with Martial upfront. But that means the captain is out.

3043~~~
Is he fit yet? Been out injured, right?

3044~~~
Back in training according to LVG, might have to play with the youth team to gain match fitness as is LVG protocol.

3045~~~
When it suits.

3046~~~
Didn't apply to Rooney

3047~~~
Special privileges . <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>..different rules for him.

3048~~~
He always looked a talented player, but I voiced reservations in the summer that he was not a player who runs with the ball and takes players on, which we needed. I would have prefered Douglas Costa or Lucas Moura if possible for this reason, although they will likely have inferior output, at st for a while.

I think he has more 'second striker' qualities in his skill-set than that of a top winger.

3049~~~
Yeah him and Mata on the flanks together doesn't really work, for those reasons and a lack of penetration from either wing. Everything comes inside and gets crowded and easy to defend against.

3050~~~
I mostly agree it's just Young is already 30, he's clearly not the future. I'd rather see Memphis given time now which will hopefully have us better off in seasons to come rather than persist with someone who will likely be gone in a year two.

But yeah, Young has been good for LVG and is probably the best option for us on current form.

3051~~~
I understand where you are coming from..but without Shaw, I feel that we are more defensively solid with Young, especially if we do end up playing Blind as LB. 

Memphis needs to be eased in with a start here and there, help him acclimatize. He can push on from next season, when hopefully we will be better too. Him and Rooney in the same side severely weakens us imo at present. 

It'll be a good challenge for him, and hopefully he doesnt pull a Di Maria.

3052~~~
Let them fight for one single spot I say. They alternate starting positions and never start together, and this process is repeated and repeated until one definitely shoots himself in the foot big time.

3053~~~
That would be something, but then we'd have a problem if Perreira or Young outperforms them when given the chance..but I love good old fashioned competition.

3054~~~
I would like to see him given another shot in the 10 with martial as the 9. I think they would both work really well, especially against the weaker teams. They've already shown they link up nicely and I think their constant movement would cause chaos. Yes he's been a bit predictable on the wing, but I actually didn't mind what I saw when he started the beginning of the season, it's just that when he got switched wide against Brugge it seemed silly to put him back there again.

3055~~~
No it means Herrera is out

3056~~~
It's a bad idea of you ask me, he does not possess any attributes to play effectively the No 10 role. Not to mention there's even less space in the middle than out wide. 

We have enough players who can play there anyway.

3057~~~
He'd be ok if we had a pacy ball career on the other wing since he can score goals and you can never argue against goals. The problem, though, is that we lack that other player hence our struggles to get the ball in the box often enough, I would drop Mata and Rooney and give the trio of Depay/Lingard -Herrera - Young a few games behind Martial. Going forward we really need a top class ball career in the side.
I also want to see more from him in defensive/work rate sense.

3058~~~
I think he's an even worse 10 than Rooney and I'm glad Van Gaal abandoned that plan very very quickly.

3059~~~
Yeah, I forgot to say that the hypothesis was that we stay with the midfield three that has been working out very well. Herrera and Schmidfield.

3060~~~
I had a dream last night that we sold him to Crystal Palace. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3061~~~
Zaha-syndrome.

3062~~~
Needs to make the most of this opportunity today.

3063~~~
Hope he does well and gives the boss something to consider for upcoming matches

3064~~~
Very big night for him. I hope he keeps it simple and not try force it too much though.

3065~~~
Looks like he's starting upfront tonight

3066~~~
Bit of a thankless task tonight. Play well and score and it's more evidence he can only do it at a lower level. Playing badly obviously brings its own criticisms.

3067~~~
What suggests that?

3068~~~
I don't think LvG sees it that way though and that's what matters <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3069~~~
Anybody jumping to that conclusion this early in his United career needs to have their head checked. A strong performance tonight would do wonders for his confidence, I believe.

3070~~~
Confidence is what he needs right now.

3071~~~
He's been pretty poor so far.

3072~~~
He needs to be playing in a side that is allowed to express themselves, which isnt the order of the day at Old Trafford these days.. His confidence must be on its arse right now. Nothing seems to be going right for him.

3073~~~
DepayMaria

3074~~~
Eh, not allowed to express himself ? He's cocking up pretty much every ball he gets, it's not about not being allowed to express himself, it's feck all confidence at this stage

3075~~~
I'd draw more similarities with Nani.

3076~~~
He seems to be expressing himself quite freely...just not very well. I don't think shooting from the half way line is part of some conservative managerial plan.

3077~~~
Doesnt have the right head on him.

3078~~~
Please tell me you're joking.

3079~~~
That he's more similar to Nani than Di Maria? No, not joking at all.

3080~~~
You're having a laugh.....Nani was much better than this

3081~~~
At what stage? You mean coming in to the side in a league cup game against a Championship side after being dropped for several games? I'd say his confidence is pretty shit at the minute.

3082~~~
True that..

3083~~~
In all seriousness, what does he excel at? He's really not fast, his close control is fairly average, and he cannot beat his man with skill. His whole game plan is reliant on cutting onto his right foot, but his finishing is erratic at best. He doesn't seem very strong for someone built like a brick house either.

3084~~~
I don't understand how anyone that watched Nani play can think he's anything like Depay. 

I honestly can't think of a United winger less comparable to Depay than Nani. They're nothing alike and Nani was about 10x the player.

3085~~~
Isn't that exactly what he's saying...

3086~~~
He looked good when he joined but has seemingly regressed. He's not showing anywhere near his potential, I really believe he's better than this.

3087~~~
Looks shite at the moment. What's more worrying is that he doesn't look particularly bothered about it.

3088~~~
God awful. Looks like he doesn't give a feck at all. What a disappointment. To think we gave Nani away and got this instead is disturbing.

3089~~~
First season syndrome. Hopefully. Feel sorry for him as the tslent is there.

3090~~~
He is fast tho and he can beat defenders with skill as he showed earlier in the season, not because he's shot of confidence and completely out of form means he's absolutely shite. He's overtrying and it isnt working out at all. He has a good shot on him, causes danger, has a good cross and dont question his strength, seems silly. His close control and decision making is quite average tho.

3091~~~
Both wingers? Check
Both with bags of ability? Check
Both incredibly frustrating? Check
Both very inconsistent? Check

Jeez, some of you lot will literally argue about anything.

3092~~~
In a world where Neymar is worth £100m, we didn't get a bargain with this guy.

3093~~~
Lost some confidence, but man he's been awful today.

3094~~~
If he keeps this up we'd be better off keeping Nani

3095~~~
what a shocker he'shaving! srsly this performance is edging one of the worst what diMaria showed us last season. I really hope he's just in terrible form and on  lowest of confidence. This is completely unacceptable. Lingard not being anything special showed more than this so called superstar for who we paid 30fecking million. Get a grip man!

This no7 looks like cursed now..

3096~~~
Lets hope it isn't followed by the second season syndrome.

3097~~~
Annoyed me when their keeper was dithering on the ball at one stage and he just jogged at best to close him down.

3098~~~
Poor man's Taarabt. In his head, he probably thinks he's amazing but everyone else can see, or should see, that he's a lazy arse who beats his man once every ten times.

Absolutely infuriating to watch.

3099~~~
Is it though? Or is the Dutch league genuinely shite?

3100~~~
Nani was incredibly gifted, pacy, a quality dribbler and was frustrating because his end product was as often brilliant as it was god awful.

I'm not quite sure what Memphis is, but he's none of those things. He's more Valencia without the pace than Nani so far.

3101~~~
Clearly very low on confidence. Its disappointing since he had a full week off to get his act together presumably.

3102~~~
Hopefully he'll improve by the end of season but this is really really shit. In this form he doesn't deserve to start these kind of games, let alone PL games.

3103~~~
He's 21. You guys need to give him time. He should be starting games like these for now.

This is my biggest worry. Reading this forum (when he signed) you'd think he was fast, strong, a good dribbler and had great close control as well as a good finish. I genuinely haven't seen any of these qualities at all apart from 2 great finishes when given acres of room.

If I was seeing flashes of quality mixed in with pieces of poor play as a result of naivety and a lack of confidence I'd be upbeat. Truth is I'm seriously concerned that he'll be in Turkey in a few years. Hopefully something will click into place with him.

3105~~~
He's 21 and plays in a United side that seems allergic to creating chances. I'd like to see Memphis in the United side Nani was in when he joined us.

3106~~~
Dutch Zaha seems a pretty good description these days.

How is he going to get his dream move to Real by playing this shit?

3107~~~
Apart from Brugge he's been awful pretty much every time he's played

3108~~~
He looks bloody horrible at the moment.

3109~~~
He needs to spend more time on the training pitch after/before hours.

3110~~~
No one is using that excuse for Rooney

3111~~~
Well in our defence one of the players tasked with creating chances is Memphis and given how shit he's been its no surprise we've struggled to create them.

3112~~~
Wow he's really shite at the moment. Come on Memphis you can do a lot better.

3113~~~
He seems devoid of confidence at the moment, although he knows it's the wrong decision he's still taking it desperate to try and prove his worth. Once he bags a goal or two he'll relax a bit.

3114~~~
Agree with this, Nani was/is a far superior dribbler to what Memphis has shown so far.

3115~~~
I've based my view on what I've seen of him. Didn't get to see him the Dutch league so don't know much about the quality there. But he has shown glimpses of real talent. What I do fear is that he will not develop his decision making. Then again C.Ronaldo did look hopeless in that department early on. Not that I compare their talents but Memphis does have the potential to, let's say, be a Hazard for us.

And don't forget that it was easier for us to blood talents in under Sir Alex. Now we kinda expected Memphis to be our main source of inspiration from the get go. Says all about the lack of main players (bar Martial) up front.

3116~~~
He doesn't really play like he's lost confidence though. He's tried to take on a ridiculous number of men a few times. It just looks like he's completely out of form.

3117~~~
His runs in behind are excellent for a winger and he's a good finisher. Great crosser from deep, average from closer in. 

We don't play on the counter much and try to keep our wingers on the touchline to ensure we can keep possession, so he hasn't gotten to show much of the former, but he should be able to get more crosses in. 

As for this first half, I am a bit disheartened by his lack of effort at times. Seems to be reacting to being frustrated in the wrong way.

I'm a definite believer in him. Has so many of the qualities a goalscoring wide player needs, is so young and has, for his age, accomplished a fair bit. Might be under the next manager, though.

3118~~~
Can't believe the ones on here writing him off already.

I see a 21-year old who's under immense pressure to prove a point. He's trying too hard. This is a player who has 'successful' tattooed on his lip, he clearly thinks very highly of himself, and wants to be a great footballer. To deal with being dropped out of the starting XI, must be hard - he must be thinking he can surely do better, and he is desperate to prove it here - too desperate evidently. Wants to take on multiple defenders even the better pass is available, is getting too excited when he gets a chance to break, and too disappointed when he misses it. He is scared he might not do well. 

LVG needs to calm him down, and give him some confidence. The talent is clearly there - this kid is special. He needs to keep his head, though.

3119~~~
Wow, kinda surprised at his performances cause I rate him highly. I am curious how long he's going to be like this.

3120~~~
Not been the same since his bestie Shaw got injured

3121~~~
His crosses were never anything special at PSV and many Dutch fans will tell you it was case of many chances being needed per goal, he's not a clinical, good finisher. I don't see his movement as a plus either. For the most part he looks lethargic and lifeless.

3122~~~
How many times can he lose the ball FFS!

3123~~~
If anything, he looks too confident!

3124~~~
Makes sense why van Gaal tried to play him centrally to begin with. Doesn't appear to have the skill to beat a man. Sadly doesn't have the intelligence to play as a #10 either.

He does have a good understanding with Rooney though. At least there's that.

3125~~~
Right, I don't feel sorry for him at all, 4 on 2 and he is shooting from 25 meters. What an idiot.

3126~~~
He's really, really unlikeable.

3127~~~
His performance level is lower than Rooney' right now.

3128~~~
Actually successfully took on the full back wish he would do that more often.

3129~~~
He's only really got one move hasn't he? A drop of the shoulder on to his right foot.

3130~~~
Scary to think that if we hadn't bought Martial both Memphis and Rooney would be our first choice attackers.

3131~~~
Really don't like his attitude, that cross field pass that went to the defender. He looks like he's given up

3132~~~
A right-footed Hulk.
It's disrespectful to compare Memphis to Ronaldo or even Nani.

3133~~~
He's awful

3134~~~
He'll be a quality player, but he isn't the Ronaldo he believes himself to be! If he drops the tricks and flashy play and becomes a team member he'll be very good.

3135~~~
He is bad.

3136~~~
Its barely November!

3137~~~
He's been watching tapes of Rooney.

3138~~~
What's worrying is that I don't know if you are serious or sarcastic.

3139~~~
Very unintelligent footballer.

3140~~~
Regardless of how well he ends up doing here even Bebe would have been embarrassed with that performance

3141~~~
I understand confidence plays a big part, but that was dreadful. Wouldn't have said this for his previous games but he just didn't seem interested

3142~~~
Yes. Great athelete but an average football player in terms of intelligence and technique compared to other players at topclubs.

3143~~~
Not to pile on him too much but he hasn't really looked like a super athlete by English football standards either to be honest. Plenty of faster players about and he's been shrugged off more than you'd think given his frame. I'm still hoping he'll turn things around but it could be a long first season for him.

3144~~~
He's obviously better than he's showing right now but I was expecting somebody who could go past players a bit easier. He's clearly struggling for confidence but I haven't seen anything to suggest he can regularly beat a man.

3145~~~
Get him on the u21 bus..  No need to have him anywhere near the first team.

3146~~~
Considering how much hype there was in these forums when we first signed him  and how poorly he has played since we got him for me he would be one of the more disappointing signings in recent years. Hope he can get himself steadied and show us what he is capable of.

3147~~~
Should've saved a load of money and just kept Nani. They are the same player.

3148~~~
Nani could always beat a player. Memphis?

3149~~~
Did the exact same stuff as Martial did when he came on.

3150~~~
true we have 7 more months of this. ffs he's sunday league at the moment.

3151~~~
Lay off him ffs

It was a bad game and a bad spell, but I've still seen enough early on to suggest he can make it at Utd

3152~~~
I'm starting to think he hasn't got the right attitude to succeed here to be honest. He looks completely devoid of confidence and doesn't work his arse off whenever he loses the ball. Add to that that almost every single time he gets the ball he waits a couple of seconds for the opposition to get back in position before he does anything with it. Lingard today would get the ball and run at his man right away if it wanted to take him on. Otherwise he would play it to someone else. Memphis waits a bit then takes his man on, or passes it. I'm not sure whether it's some sort of complacency or something.

3153~~~
Strikes me as the type that thinks he's made it as soon as he signed for United when actually that's when the hard work starts. Needs longer on the sidelines and a few games for the reserves, when another chance comes around he'll have to take it. Might need an entire season or two before we see what he can really do.q

3154~~~
Nani is better at this point.

3155~~~
He's always been better? The hope is that Memphis might develop into a player as good or better one day. They are also nothing alike in the way they play or what they can do. Valencia seems a much closer comparison.

3156~~~
I actually feel sorry for him. Not because he doesn't deserve the criticism, he absolutely does, he's been dire recently and he has shown selfishness and a poor attitude. But because he shouldn't be under so much pressure and scrutiny, because he should not be a first team regular. He's simply not ready. 

It seemed evident that we needed another winger for this season, particularly with Young filling in at full-back, but we failed to bring anyone in. Now we have a badly out-of-form 21 (?) year old and barely any alternatives.

3157~~~
What ever happened to giving young players a break when they're struggling, Memphis is just going through a bad spell, he is not a bad player, it could be weeks, or months before we start to see the type of player we all think/thought he is going to be.

If he's still crap this time next year then I'll be questioning his ability, but in the mean time the boy needs support.

3158~~~
Genuinely awful tonight, needs to buck his ideas up.

3159~~~
We have 2 good options in Young and Perreira, Martial can also fill in there. No idea why lvg brought on young to play him at left back.

3160~~~
Nani when he first joined was better than Depay and he's still better now.

3161~~~
Lingard is currently a better option on the wing than Memphis despite not in the first team picture of some posters.Pereira is better too if he's used properly as shown today.Martial is by far the best of the lot.

3162~~~
Same people griping on him are the same people who don't see the talent AdM had when he was here.

Memphis has all the talent, whether it's a mental thing, or confidence or whatever, it's just not happening for him yet.

3163~~~
Lingard will be playing for a lower prem/championship in a year or two. He is not better than Memphis.

3164~~~
Pereira looks a more accomplished player.

3165~~~
I feel sorry for him because he seems to believe in his own hype when in reality he isn't even good enough to play for us in the first place. Average squad player at best.

3166~~~
Talent is nothing if you dont perform. He clearly has the talent to be a fairly good player, that isnt the issue. He needs to work a lot harder

3167~~~
Neither of them are good enough at the moment to be honest.

3168~~~
All comedy aside that was very worrying from Memphis, his attitude seems extremely poor also which will turn the fans on him quickly.

3169~~~
Some of you will be proved wrong. That being said, for the time being he is not great at all.

3170~~~
I don't know.Memphis obviously has more raw talents but his current self isn't better than the current Lingard and that's all matter at the moment (my original post didn't say anything about their future).

3171~~~
I've got to agree, he looks like he could make the step up. Unless LVG coaches it out of him of course.

3172~~~
Memphis looks like he lacks self belief. That kid needs a hand around the shoulder rather than a kick up the arse!

3173~~~
He needs a experienced head in front of him or somebody shouting at him. 

Rooney can't do that because he himself is not good enough. But other players need to get on his back about decision making.

He's much better than he is showing. I think people are being harsh and writing him off too easily. He needs a kick up the bum.

3174~~~
It wouldn't surprise me if he went out on loan next season if he doesn't improve. He is still young after all.

3175~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CP7PkrTWEAAnBWv.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CP7PkrTWEAAnBWv.jpg"/>

3176~~~
Still has a lot to learn about the team aspect of the game. Doesn't work back enough and isn't contributing as a forward either. Still plenty of time, but he needs to start showing signs of commitment and a few signs of improvement soon.

3177~~~
great post.

3178~~~
Needs to realize he's not in the Ererdivisie anymore where he had ages to dwell on the ball, and he also needs to get his working boots on, he should take a look at Pereira and Lingard when it comes to the latter.

3179~~~
Confidence? He was trying to lob the keeper from 50yards. He's not the brightest footballer. That is just how he is.

3180~~~
It's down to him, he's obviously got talent, it's just a question of if he wants to reach his potential or be the next Nani.

3181~~~
i have never looked at memphis and thought he lacked self belief, i look at him and think he needs a taking down a peg or two, cos if he actually tracked back and played for the team a bit more, then considering our lack of options in the final third, fans would get off his back and give him the time he needs to adapt and improve

he just needs to try a little harder, and by that i dont mean try a little harder to do something spectacular every time he gets the ball, just protect his full back when he needs it, and occasionally play the simple pass that might allow someone else shine, thats all im asking at this stage.

3182~~~
I really wish people would stop with this shite. You'd think Nani was fecking Obertan and not a former player of the year in a title winning season the way some go on.

3183~~~
valencia tracks back, and is happy to play the simple pass if thats whats best for the team.

Memphis at this stage utterly refuses to defend, and tries to do the spectacular every time he gets the ball, because he could pull it off in the dutch league, but just isnt good enough to pull it off against even championship defenders in this country.

3184~~~
True he isn't a good comparison by any means either now that I think about it. Still he at least has somewhat of a powerhouse build in the same way as Valencia. I don't see any comparison whatsoever between him and Nani so I'm not sure why he keeps being brought up.

3185~~~
he's even worse than black Ronaldo a coupl seasons back...

his posts on fb and twitter are fecking irritating, comparing to what he showed us on the pitch, look how modest Martial is and you will know what I'm talking about...

3186~~~
Low on confidence and struggling to settle in, still believe he will come good, just needs more time. Might have wait until next season for that. 

But, he's not the player I expected. I thought we would see him taking on more players, a bit more pace. He's fast, but just lacks that raw pace. Needs to keep it more simple too. I feel sorry for him though, LVG put a lot of pressure on him and he's struggling with that. If we had a good winger then this wouldn't be an issue, but we don't and we need him and Martial to be on top form.

3187~~~
He probably thought he'd be an instant hit and certainly carries himself like he's made it. And he's now had an almighty reality check which has slapped him hard in the face and taken him down a lot of pegs.

3188~~~
Thats very true. Memphis has a long way to go to reach Nani's level at the moment. He's more in danger of becoming the next Bebi.

3189~~~
the comparison, is both players go for the spectacular all the time, and steadfastly refuse to track back and work for the team.

course nani did go through spells where he could pull of great plays, and some fans still remember those moments very fondly and have an affection for Nani becuase of it, Others remember the the inconstancy the sulking, the ball hogging and the injuries. people will never agree on Nani cos at times he was great and other times he was utterly $hite!!!!!

but so far in the league at least (he has had his momnets in the CL) Memphis has just been all the bad bits of nani, without any of the good

3190~~~
This. 
How he reacts to the reality of not being as good as he assumed he would be will decide his future here.

3191~~~
15 appearances already, 4 goals, 4 assists, average caf rating 5.9. It's not that bad for a new young player. He needs to put his head down now and get back to some semblance of form.

3192~~~
Go for the spectacular a lot, yes. But Nani always, always tracked back. He was shite at defending to be sure but he always got back and at least tried to help.

3193~~~
I don't know what to make of him, I don't think he's lacking in confidence, neither is he lacking in talent but he's not very smart, which means he dwells a lot on the ball. In the Eredivise, that might not be a problem, but at this level, it is and I think that's why he's struggling. Look at Martial, even Lingard & Perreira, they have that speed of thought, before the ball comes to them, they know what they want to do, once the ball gets to them they go ahead with it, sometimes it works, other times it doesn't, but you can see what they wanted to do, their intention. With Memphis, I get the feeling that he's always caught in two minds, he lacks that speed of thought & he generally over thinks the whole thing. And one thing i noticed, his footwork is not impressive, the ball is always stuck under his feet, or something like that, he's never really in control of the ball.

3194~~~
Disclaimer: I am not saying he's shit, but there's a lot he can improve upon, and he has the talent & time on his side.

3195~~~
Which is my point, Nani had potential but not the attitude to back it up.

3196~~~
What <a class="username" data-user="78241, @legball" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78241/">@legball</a> said, he needs to learn to decide what he wants to do before it happens.

3197~~~
“I’ve seen enough talent before to know he will come good” seems to be a common expression on here. What is it exactly that people see in him? I’m genuinely curious as I’ve not seen anything that makes him more talented than, lets say, Lingard. Not to mention Pereira (or Januzaj).

Second cliché is “he’s inconsistent”. Well that’s not true, because if he was inconsistent he would do some positive things from time to time, but unfortunately he doesn’t.

The third is “he’s shot on confidence”. I don’t think that’s the case either, otherwise he wouldn’t be attempting those ridiculous long range shots or dribbling past 3 defenders. But that might be because he moves with his head down.

Also, the comparisons to Nani are a bit weird. I believe Nani had all the tools- great both feet, close touch, dribbling- but it never came into one piece, and he was truly inconsistent and frustrating. I never thought he had the brain to make it at top level. In that regard I agree there are some similarities to Memphis, although Depay doesn’t have the tools at the moment.

I just hope we give his playing time to better youngsters like Pereira for example.

3198~~~
I don't think it's a lack of confidence, it seems more like he's incredibly frustrated and trying to force it. He also needs to improve his decission making, as he got too used to clowning poor defenders in the Dutch league, and keeps trying to do the same stuff here. That obviously isn't working, and it could probably take a while for him to unlearn some of that.

In the meantime, people really need to learn to have some fecking patience. A lot of cringeworthy shite being written here. He's 21, trying to adapt to playing in a much stronger league and he's off form at the moment.

3199~~~
I think part of the problem is the level of expectation which he's had from coming in. With most young players, we expect them to show some potential, get some game time, and then eventually work their way into a permanent first team place as they hit their primes. Martial's an example. Despite the fee, when he first came many of us didn't expect him to be an instant starter, because we didn't realise how good he'd be. Youngsters like Phil Jones and Chris Smalling when the first came are also examples. No one expected them to be instant hits, yet they got game time, and we hoped that in time they'd develop into top players. Smalling's doing that now. Jones still has a lot more to prove.

With Depay though, he's still young, but we expected him to be <i>very </i>good from the start, before eventually getting even better as time went on. He's undoubtedly one of the most hyped up youngsters we've had in recent years, with whispering's that he had Ronaldo level potential back when he came, and the fact that he's far from the finished article and is very frustrating to watch at times isn't helping at all. Hopefully he'll still come good for us, but I think we need to adjust our expectations slightly. It may be the case that he's a player who is still developing more than we thought, as opposed to being developed already, and that's probably why his end product and ability in dangerous areas has been found lacking more than we'd hoped.

3200~~~
thats not the nani i remember, the nani i remember was the player who either pulled somthing great off and was doing back flips, or sat on the floor sulking that it didnt come of while his team mates tried to win the ball back.

3201~~~
Yep

3202~~~
2 of those goals and apparently 3 assists (whoscored has him down for 1 assist in all other matches) came in the UCL qualifiers against a crippled Brugge side. 

It should really read 13 matches, 2 goals and 1 assist.

3203~~~
Indeed. Nani was incredible for 2 seasons. Huge number of assists and goals. He always used to dick over Arsenal.

3204~~~
I agree mostly with this. In NL he stood out with his pace and strength, but in England all defenders are equally quick and strong. He needs to improve the other areas of his game to succeed.

He is beginning to worry me a bit tbh. It was clear from his social media he thought he'd made it just by being here, and he needs to start showing signs he's knuckling down and progressing.

3205~~~
This is very true imo. Hopefully he isn,t too old to learn ball sense and speed of thought (21 is young for a baller but his psyche has basically been set already as an adult). Usually in a country like Holland you expect players to have this ingrained in them as they start playing from in their nappies but... he did have a very troubled period as a young player stemming from his family situation before he went to PSV and it might have stunted his development there.

Also he does seem to have think he made it 9despite his media utterances - actions speak louder than interviews) and does need a reality check.

3206~~~
He needs to adapt to PL. People at the club must see that in training, he is showing something new. There is no point in playing him week in and week out if he does not show any signs of doing something new to tackle defenders.

3207~~~
Got an assist against Ipswich, whoscored don't do league cup stats.

3208~~~
On this form he is the worst player we have bought in post fergie era. I think the waste of money headline might have  suited him more. 
Just does not know what to do with the ball, no decision making ability.  He thinks like 5 seconds later than most players on the pitch and that includes the boro players. Same one trick pony if cutting in and trying to shoot which he completely messed up 3 times. Also messed up a counter and that air shot 10 yards from goal. I think he already thinks he has made it. Poor poor showing, i was thinking about our poorest of poor wingers and couldnt find many, nani would be above him, even kagawa on left was better than he is, maybe obertan would be a better choice than him in this form. Hope he improves otherwise we are looking at  a loss of 10 -15million + on his resale in the future.

3209~~~
I don't know if anybody has, but I am with you if you have called him the 'Dutch Zaha'.

3210~~~
Most apt comparison to be honest.

Memphis is nothing like Nani.

3211~~~
Being in terrible form is one thing, being young and still adapting is also perfectly understandable. I personally don't expect much in terms of offensive contribution from Memphis (maybe I'm too cynical) but one thing that cannot be forgiven is the apathy and lack of energy display. Like when he gets dispossessed and nothing much to retrieve the ball, Martial came on and lost the ball but really the effort he put in just to chase back his opponent (even if it allow him to get the ball) shows you the big difference in mindset between the two.

3212~~~
Still got time to adapt but doesn't even look like a footballer at the moment, his spacial awareness is awful.

3213~~~
He shows no hunger. Perhaps he thinks he is already a star.

3214~~~
Over the last few years, we have displayed a miraculous ability to take exciting and effective attackers and turn them into nervous, lazy and ineffective wasters. 

Now we could say they were overrated when they got here, or that their previous leagues were weak. But when those same players look great at the beginning, only to deteriorate the longer they spend with us, when do we stop criticising the players so much and start looking at what the club are doing to them?

A lack of hunger isn't something anyone would have accused Memphis of last year or at the beginning of this season. It was never a label thrown at Di Maria before last year. We've never seen Rooney look so cautious and reluctant to have a go. What are we doing to these types of players to leave them looking so flat?

3215~~~
Please stop with this nonsense. It's way, WAY too early to start with this shite. He's 21, and everyone has been expecting great things from him. Then there's the fact that the Dutch media has been dogpiling him on the back of Holland's poor showing in the Euro 2016-qualifiers, basically making him a scapegoat. That's an ungodly amount of pressure to put on a 21 year old struggling for form while trying to adapt to a new league.

Yes, his attitude also needs improving, but shit takes time. If you'd read anything about him before he came here, you'd have known that he had a reputation of being kind of cocky and arrogant. It's something he's been working on, and hopefully he'll get it sorted. Right now, though, people need to cut him some slack. It's not his fault we're lacking in the attacking department, that's on LvG for failing to realize that Rooney's turned to shite and really shouldn't be starting games anymore, and that relying on two new youngsters for depth is really risky.

Don't get me wrong, I'm disappointed with his poor start, as I'd really hoped he'd have more of an impact, but it'll take a lot more for me to just write him off the way some seem to be doing. Di Maria showed last year that even the best can seemingly forget how to actually play football, so it's not like playing poorly is some sign that he lacks what is needed to make it.

3216~~~
His lack of pace and mobility is worrying.

3217~~~
Embarrassing performance, no effort whatsoever.

3218~~~
Na, he's Hulk.

Bulky (maybe 'too bulky') frame.
Loves shooting, and basically just cuts onto his strong foot all the time.
Completely one-footed.
Can't really beat a man.
Isn't THAT quick, but is powerful and hard to stop once momentum is gained.
Pretty useless from stand-still positions
Free kicks.
Tries random flicks.
And, like Hulk, he may end up being one of those players who people always say "Every time I watch him, he's crap"

Zaha's not great, but at least he's actually a winger. Memphis is an inside forward. Their styles/approaches are not very similar.

3219~~~
Now that Young is back, I'd love for him to play on the left and Martial at cf(Yes, I know I am asking for quite a lot).

Memphis should get cameos here and there and it should be a pick between him, Lingard and Perreira for the cover spot, based solely on form.

3220~~~
It's his technique or lack of that's doing my head in. Runs into players every fecking time.

3221~~~
I thought Memphis was one of our most exciting acquisitions, but I'm being proven wrong in a big way! The boy looks absolutely lost on the football field these days, can't seem to get past anybody, is shrugged off the ball far too easily and his confidence is so shot he has resorted to crossing the ball from nearer the half-way line.

It's too early to say he's done for - he is only 21 after all - but he needs something to happen for him, and quick. Every time it goes wrong you can see him slump in disappointment. He desperately needs a good game, but I do wonder if he'll ever recover if he spends large spells warming the bench.

Nobody has too much talent not to fall off the cliff - Di Maria and Falcao are recent proof of that - yet Memphis has age on his side. Here's hoping he can rediscover the spark that saw him net 22 in 30 last season.

3222~~~
I don’t think that’s true to be honest. He looked poor since day one (I didn’t feel the hype BTW), with a few exceptions in games against Brugge and PSV. In the league he always struggled.

I actually think that when it comes to him and Di Maria, the league adapted to them faster than them adapted to the EPL standards. It might sound a little ridiculous but as far as Memphis is concerned, he seems pretty easy to defend against if you watched 3 games of him running from the left.

3223~~~
See, This is what's angering me the most about him, It's the lazy work ethic he is showing, There is really no excuse for it. It's like the Zaha situation in which his attitude is 'he has made it'. People had a go at me when I expressed concern when I seen those photos of him partying with Chris Brown's Ex GF but it seems I had a right to be concerned as his attitude is shocking so far.

3224~~~
Someone said that young players brought in at high price have some sort of advantage over home grown players. I wouldn't hold my breath. Lingard has done more than Mephis and hes still behind in pecking order.

3225~~~
I would believe that too..but Van Gaal kept Young in the team ahead of the British record signing. Except for Rooney and maybe Herrera, he's been rather fair on picking players on merit. 

I really hope that players are chosen solely on merit, its good for team morale.

3226~~~
Was terrible again last night, but I'm not buying this 'lack of effort' thing. His biggest issue is his inability to go past a player, and I'm not sure he will learn that dramatically. He also often makes poor decisions, and executes his passes poorly etc, but those are things he can improve.

I was concerned when he was linked that he may not be good enough, and that he doesn't have the skill-set we need on the wing. He is fast, despite people questioning this - his issue is that he is not fast with the ball. He is a productive player by nature, but given the over methodical nature of our game, I was desperate for us to add a wide man who can open up the game in an instant, by taking a couple of men out at speed perhaps. Memphis has a trick in him, but he is not this man.

3227~~~
I agree he doesn't look very good at going past his man. 

He's an excellent counter attacking player though, because he's almost always the first man to run in behind when we win the ball high up the pitch. Sadly, we prefer playing a backwards pass to attacking at pace, which doesn't play to his strengths.

I'm uncertain what to make of him overall after his start here. He's bereft of confidence now that's for sure.

3228~~~
I think it's his decision making that's his biggest flaw. He should get back to basics for a while. Get his head up, pass it to the nearest teammate, move forward and look for the return. Instead, he gets the ball, gets his head down, charges at defenders, gets easily dispossessed, then repeats that for the rest of the game. Once his confidence returns and he's doing the simple things well, he'll be much better.

3229~~~
What footballers do off the field has never had much importance in my eyes. He could be having orgies with pornstars every night for all I care. I just expect him to do the basics right.

3230~~~
Looks completely devoid of any confidence to me, and also like he's trying a little too hard. 

A bit of game time with the reserves probably wouldn't be the worst thing for him. 

He's 21 and has made a massive move, he needs time to adjust and develop his game. While Martial has been excellent so far I think too much is being expected of him and fully expect him to hit a similar run of bad form at some stage, it's just what happens with young players.

3231~~~
One could tell that Depay was playing feeling the pressure. He knows he has underperformed and his confident isn't there right now. Still very early days(it's truly early), one ought to way and see how things roll as the season progresses. 

I think Van Gaal has to figure a way to get Memphis playing w/o feeling the pressure(people are very demanding for him to perform, even in the stadium it seemed like the supporters lost a bit of patience with him yesterday which looked to have worsened his play as the game went on)

3232~~~
The second coming of ADM

3233~~~
Wow, are people really writing him off this early?

3234~~~
He needs to improve two aspects of his game quickly if he wants to get his place in the team back:

1- Stop running into trouble. It is so annoying how he sees 2-3 defenders in front of him and tries to magically run through them, inevitably failing 99% of the time

2- When he loses the ball, he needs to show some interest in getting it back. As Kouroux mentioned, Martial was trying to win the ball back every time he lost it. Memphis would just stand there frustrated that whatever he just tried didn't come off.

3235~~~
Give it a few weeks, they'll be doing the same with Martial.

3236~~~
Doubt it as Martial has shown more in 2-3 matches than Memphis has since he got here.

I've got to completly agree with <a class="username" data-user="26211, @kouroux" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26211/">@kouroux</a> 's point, he can have all the talent in the world if he wishes but unless he fixes his attitude he won't achieve shit.

Abysmal display yesterday, yet again. No effort whatsoever. If the distance covered was registered somewhere he'd be fecked, especially yesterday.

3237~~~
Shall we proceed with the roasting of a 21 year old 3 months into his Manchester United career?

3238~~~
His lack of effort was not great to see, but he really is struggling with form and confidence. However, I'd rather he start over Young and Rooney, as he's go to get over this bad patch. van Gaal needs to give him a free run and role and allow him to simply express himself. Do away with the bullshit philosophy.

3239~~~
Maybe he needs, you know, a bit of time. Plenty were fully of criticism for signing Martial before they'd seen him kick a ball.

Martial will hit a patch of rough form at one point or another. Some of our fans aren't particularly realistic with their expectations of young players.

3240~~~
I'm still confident Memphis will become a good player. Yong and lernin and all that. Thought United fans would have learned by now not to write off a young player in his first months, in a new and more competitive league and getting settled to a new country. A bit of patience will help.

3241~~~
What has Young done to lose his place though? He should be starting, he kept ADM out of the team last season, and with a chance to go to Euro2016, he'll be motivated enough to keep Memphis out of the team too. 

Players should be played on merit. We are carrying too many passengers in our team. Its far too easy to blame Lvg for his poor form as he has been abysmal for the Netherlands too. I'd bench him , and with our upcoming games , try and get as many points as possible, to keep us in touch for a title challenge by Jnauary, when we can supplement our frontline with more depth and quality.

3242~~~
But you know, there's a difference between waiting for somebody to hit a form where he'll beat players with dribbling, assist or score goals <b>and</b> actually giving a feck effort wise. Memphis is just not doing enough on the pitch with chasing back the ball, defending and putting effort in so it's not down to bad form or needing to bed in but it's an attitude problem. 

I'm not even getting into the fact that Martial had about 10 times bigger burden on his shoulders when coming here yet he coped perfectly well with it, despite being 2 years younger, not speaking English and all that, one player will adapt quicker, one will take more time, fine enough. But show some desire, effort, whatever. If needed, play safe but be precise. Memphis couldn't do even that yesterday.

3243~~~
Only very few. Most people are just saying what they are seeing from him.

3244~~~
I'm not arguing that he was poor in pretty much all departments last night, and recently. I do disagree somewhat that he isn't under as much pressure to perform as Martial. Before we signed him no one really knew much about Martial whereas Depay was seen as somewhat as a marquee signing, which for a 21 year old who has only ever played in Holland is a bit silly in itself.

My point is that he needs time, and also that I can see Martial having a tougher and tougher time as the season goes on and the opposition get more used to what to expect from him and defend against it.

I also think Depay is suffering from a lack of support from the LB position. If I were LvG I'd stick him in the reserves for a few games to take the pressure off him and let him get some confidence back.

3245~~~
Almost everyone agrees on this. The only question is does he get a guaranteed start in first team regardless of his adaptability, as part of giving him time

3246~~~
Fair and square but as I've said, most people don't blame Memphis for not scoring not assisting or failing to dribble past people. Most people slate him because he looks like he couldn't give a feck on the pitch. You can't say the same about Martial so even when Martial hits some down, he won't get half the criticism due to his work ethic on the pitch.

3247~~~
As I've said, I think the best thing would be to stick him in the reserves for a while to get some mojo back.

3248~~~
Nah, Martial will soon be slated. It will happen gradually, first people will start nitpicking at his gameplay (it's already started with some saying that his link up play is not great etc.), then we will analyze his goal drought and then full blown hatred will commence shortly.

3249~~~
Personally I think thats a confidence thing. 

Comparisons with Di Maria are very harsh IMO. ADM clearly never wanted to be here whereas Memphis was obviously delighted to get a move to Utd, right now it's not going well for him, but people need to cut him some slack while he learns what he needs to do to be successful at this level.

3250~~~
Yep, you can see it coming a mile off, starting with the totally overblown expectations.

3251~~~
Yea I never compared and never would compare him to ADM, two different cases, it's not the same type of 'not giving a feck' if you will. Memphis just needs to learn that you need to do much more off-ball here because he's not a sacred cow that's exempted from defensive duties.

3252~~~
He lacks paces at the top level. Maybe it is because he is too muscular, he obviously lifts and it affects his agility, get close to him and he going no where.

He arrogant and greedy and wants to be the star attraction. He loses the ball as much as any player I can remember and cost us the game last night with that stupid shot when we had a 4 on 2.

3253~~~
Sorry for this being my first post since Jesus died for our sins but I learned in 5th grade English that you say "is" after he/she/it. What happened to that?

3254~~~
Lifting doesn't mean he lacks pace. Most sprinters are physically impressive.

3255~~~
That's true, but I wouldn't mind betting sprinters have, relatively speaking, slower acceleration than they might have in favour of a higher top speed. In football you rarely, if ever, have to run 100m in a straight line; acceleration, change of pace and agility and all more important to a 'pacy' player than straight line speed.

3256~~~
You make a good point but the way I see it is that it really depends on the training the athlete has. Would it be better in terms of agility and acceleration if he had a slimmer frame, definitely yes. However I think most of his issues aren't even related to physical traits but more like footballing intelligence (knowing when to dribble, pass and shoot). Depay seems to be a stupid footballer at times.

3257~~~
I don't think sticking him in the reservs is an option. It would kill him.

3258~~~
You're underrating sprinters. Acceleration is about the most important thing in 100m, unless you are Bolt. The start and then up to 40m is the most critical part of the race.

3259~~~
The lack of effort is what concerns me, I think most of us said we needed to keep expectations in check given how poor the league he is coming from is. I expected the fact he knows LvG has no issue dropping anyone bar Rooney would see him take a look at the work Lingard and Pereira put in off the ball and try to match it, but it was more hands on hips style attitude.

3260~~~
Struggling to work out what's up with him. He's had moments of pure gold for us, like against Brugge and PSV - and yet majority of the time he's actually useless. I won't even dare writing him off yet as I'm sure his desire will shine through soon, but I just don't understand what's up with him. He's barely taking players on and his head just isn't working sometimes. He had two or three chances yesterday to do something significant, and yet he goes in slow motion and thinks he has more time than he actually does. 

Clearly still settling in to the difficulty of the league.

3261~~~
Im, actually shocked at how bad he is at beating players. He never lifts his head up to see what's around. The worrying thing for me is that those things take  an awfully long time to learn if at all. I don't know how long his and Van Gaal's patience will last.

3262~~~
He's a very frustrating player. He's got some skills, yeah, but it's hard to predict whether he can get the most out of these skills in the future. We'll see. At this point he's just a worse copy of Nani really.

3263~~~
I dunno where these Nani comparisons come from, but he's nothing like Nani.

3264~~~
Inconsistent wingers arrived at roughly the same age.

3265~~~
Nani's biggest strength was dribbling, while Memphis can't/doesn't, but the weaknesses of early Nani and this Memphis are the same - bad decision making, too much shooting.

3266~~~
He's such a nothing player. Can anyone actually say what he's good at? He has half the talent that a 22 year old Nani did, its not even close. So I really don't get those comparisons.

Lingard is a better player as it stands. Comfortably at that too.

3267~~~
Your tagline is so fitting.

3268~~~
What about that post do you disagree with then?

3269~~~
I'm not saying he has performed all of this for us but for PSV he has shown he has pace, strength, trickery, skill, crossing technique, free-kick tekkers and clearly good finishing/shooting to end up top scorer in the league. Those 2 goals against Brugge were a tiny glimpse of what he can offer.

The lad is 21 and just moved to a monster club. Give him a chance.

3270~~~
Not everyone adapts to the PL as fast as Martial, give him another season or two before you say he is a nothing player.

3271~~~
He was shocking last night but I'm not going to write him off yet, like <a class="username" data-user="44274, @NoLogo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44274/">@NoLogo</a> above me has said give him a couple of seasons before dismissing him completely.

3272~~~
He should be rightfully criticised at the moment but not written off completely. I'm willing to give him a season to settle in and improve. His attitude needs working on though.

3273~~~
Anyone got a gif of that 4vs2 counter moment?

3274~~~
He's been very disappointing by our early season expectations, but I still reckon I've seen enough to think he can turn it around in time. Whether or not he can be a world beater is another matter, but I do think he can be a very good player. I don't think he's remotely like Nani - shot power aside - but if he can reach a similar peak, I'll be relatively happy.

Statistically he's been fairly good as a 21 year old replacement for supposedly one of the best players in the world. He has more goals, and near enough as many assists as Di Maria did at this stage. And in an age where we constantly argue about the validity of stats, it's worth noting how most of his have been genuinely inspired moments of class, rather than statistical notches (the PSV & Southampton moments were as good, if not better than his flat track bullying of Brugge)

I don't completely buy the <i>"confidence/tactical limitation"</i> arguments for his form though. Neither can explain his continued willingness to take people on, or shoot widly from the halfway line, but his form is definitely in the red for whatever reason, and it'll take some very good man management to pull him out of it.

3275~~~
So if he plays crap in first team and you dont play him in reserves. What do we do with him?

3276~~~
Dont know whats going on in his life,think he has all he needs to be a good player,up to him at the end,believe he will turn good for us,just needs time.

3277~~~
Make him captain.

3278~~~
We already have an in-form captain. Don't want another exactly similar to him <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/><img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3279~~~
This. 

Plus his body language when he's dispossessed, whether you're 21, or 41, if you lose a ball, you better bust a gut tracking back to win it, not just throwing your arms in the air in disgust that the rules of the game allow tackling!

Also, I'm not 100% sure of this 'giving people time' ethos. Granted there should be a bedding in period, but if we gave average players 'a few years' then by law of average we would have a few players bedding in at any one time, therefore a few below-par players every season. Is it too much to ask for XI good footballers at any one time instead of an allowance for the 'giving time' bracket and the 'almost-leading-goalscorer-of-all-time-stealing-a-living-and-being-crap' brigade! By that rationale we should have 5/6 quality players on the go at once! Not good enough.

3280~~~
For some reason I found myself watching an old Evra video;

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ET9wVHuj7uA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe> 

and I caught myself wondering how good Memphis could be if he attempted half the shite that Evra attempted in that video.

3281~~~
He has had very poor couple of months but this is ridiculous. We are in a rebuilding stage, and have acquired a couple of promising youngsters. We have no option to nurture them, and wait patiently till they become, hopefully, world class or somewhat. Its not like we have any established world class talent in the team already!

3282~~~
Over compensating. 

His aim is to be a superstar, so is doing everything he can to be that number 7 superstar. Instead he should just play football with whatever gifts he's been born with and the stardom will either come or won't. 

Ronaldo wanted to be the worlds best, but he worked and worked at it. I feel ol Memphis just believes it'll come to him naturally.

3283~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5wBUTqBlXyc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Not a gif, but are you talking about 5:20 in this vid?

3284~~~
I see this said a lot about Ronaldo,  about him working and working at it. I think he's explosively quick, lithe,  and athletic, with fantastic timing and technique. I'd say natural talents,  rather than gained.
Memphis needs to work at it, to gain more skills, get lighter,  lither, and improve his off the mark running technique, much more than Ronaldo ever had to.

3285~~~
Just a couple of typos from a quick message at work. Thanks for being a turd though.

3286~~~
I haven't watched the match but I guess it's that moment. Why the hell would he shoot there?

3287~~~
Doesn't look good for him, sounds like he's being left out of the weekend's game completely.

3288~~~
Doesnt deserve to be in it. The problem is that United are in a spot where we really require results now, if he doesnt step up, he'll find himself behind a long queue of attackers..Id consider bringing in a world class winger that can play either side if the opportunity presents itself.

3289~~~
Happy he's dropped. He doesn't bring anything to the team anyway, and now we have Young, Lingard and Pereira who can play in his position, and all 3 are better than him. He should be taken out of the spotlight for a while.

3290~~~
I know it's unpopular,but I don't think he's good enough. It's not knee jerk, I said it before we signed him. If you don't believe me check his thread in the newbies from the summer. Apart from his shooting and his movement, I didn't see anything to convince me he would be a star for us, while watching PSV last season. 
I hope he turns it round.

3291~~~
If he's not injured i'm disappointed he's been dropped from the squad all together, we should try to slowly play him back into form from the bench, he would also be a good player to bring on at the end of games against tired legs.

3292~~~
Some of the stuff in this thread is as laughable as it gets. He's 21 and it's October of his first season. He's obviously got stacks of ability. Wind your fecking necks in.

3293~~~
Indeed.  Far too early to make a judgement on the lad, he does need to show us something at some point though.

3294~~~
Some people weren't convinced before his poor form. For everyone saying he is a nothing player, they are those saying he will definitely make it and all he needs is time. To be fair, based on the past history of players coming from the Dutch league, the latter group cannot be too sure either.

I'm in the "I dont know group". that is the safest bet here. Either side of that is  too quick a judgement imo.

3295~~~
He comes with a big reputation, self generated to some degree, but he isn't ready to be a starter week in week out. He obviously believes in himself but needs to remain humble and hardworking as he still has a massive amount to learn. I cant really understand why we didn't keep Nani, who is a lot better than him at this stage, but he could have also provided some experience to Depay, as well as someone to offer a challenge to the left wing spot. We are too reliant on him as we dont have the depth and his role in the team has been forced, he has essentially become a crucial first team member. 

I would like to see him try and go on both sides of the defender as he is becoming too predictable and easy to defend against with his drop of the shoulder and shift onto the right foot - Add some variety and he will make it a lot more difficult for the defenders. Not to mention he sometimes crowds the game too much by cutting in, he should know when to stretch the game and use the wing and when to cut in. I guess this comes with experience and developing his footballing intelligence.

3296~~~
Even before he joined the club.

3297~~~
Yes, thats the point I am making. Not all posters not tooting his horn are necessarily being rash. Some weren't convinced before that.

3298~~~
'Injured'

Its not very 'obvious' looking at his performances so far this season.

3299~~~
I thought we needed a dribbler in the summer and I never considered him as one. We still need a skillful player with pace. Although I expect Menphis to improve, people thinking he will start taking players on are in for a shock. His game is to make movements to find space to get his shot away. He's not a creative player or a flair player imo. Never was and I don't think he ever will be.

3300~~~
Maybe he only saw Rooney and thought, "He'll mess it up anyways, might as well go for it myself" - without realizing that he's not very good these days himself, of course <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

3301~~~
Can't believe the amount of stick some are giving this young player. He's not in great form but he is trying. Some saying he can't beat his man? I think he does with ease. But instead of looking for a pass he is trying to beat the 2nd or sometimes even 3rd man! It's decision making that he must improve and he will. Go easy on him guys he needs our support.

3302~~~
He's been awful for the last few months, but we still created far more chances with him in our starting eleven.

3303~~~
Seemed very harsh to leave him out completely today, wonder if he'll be turning up for the U21's some time soon.

3304~~~
Even if he's fit Lingard and Pereira all deserve to be on the bench ahead of him at the moment and we can't have a bench full of attacking players.

Would be a very unpopular opinion but I think we should loan him out to a PL team comes January.He needs to play regularly to adapt to PL football but I don't think he has contributed or will contribute enough to get that here this season.That would leave us short but will benefit us more in the long run if he turns out to be class.

3305~~~
Personally I think he could be one of our best players in the later part of the season, the ability is there it's all just a question of how he pushes out of this bad spell, no way i'd be loaning him.

3306~~~
Lvg doesn't like his attitude.

3307~~~
He's been poor when he's played in the last month but I feel we still looked more threatening with him in the side.

3308~~~
Ther have been a number of articles, claiming LVG and Giggs are working on his attitude. The word being used is "reeducation".

3309~~~
This I find odd, Memphis knew exactly what to expect from LvG yet isn't buying into the philosophy? Of all the players that should have got over that hurdle the quickest from our new signings it was him.

I do wonder if lvG foresore this though, after he banged in those great goals against Brugge all LvG couid say was thing like he's going to struggle soon, or it won't always be so easy etc, maybe he knew he was a way off been ready physically and espcially mentally just yet.

Although the Shaw injury has certainly not helped the situation.

3310~~~
I'm not so fussed about his lack of invention or flair in beating men on the wings. I'm mostly disappointed he isn't extremely quick, strong or clinical. Those were the attributes I thought he'd bring in abundance.

3311~~~
Injured.

3312~~~
Just been looking back at some of his match compilations from earlier in the season, he really has been poor. His early season performances look a lot worse in the cold light of day, with the 'shiny new signing' gloss taken off. 

He just hasn't done anything in the PL. Get the ball, run a bit, either pass it backwards/sideways or lose it. Its like Ashley Young from two years back.

3313~~~
I found his early season performances annoying because he kept on ignoring Shaw who was making brilliant runs from left back and was looking like our biggest threat on the left. Probably gave him a bit more space to cut in though, but defenders would have sussed him out by now anyway.

3314~~~
Not too worried about him. He'll come good.

3315~~~
Ronaldo has 3-4 inches on him and is a bit of a freak athlete in football - same for Bale. There's no point comparing monsters to more normal athletes for football. He was always going to massively fall short there.

3316~~~
Think the step up has shocked him a bit. Next season is the real testing point for him, im not too fussed over his current form. if he was supposed to be the focus of our attack this season, then that's the fault of the club, he was never ready for that.

3317~~~
He's going to have an unbelievable game soon, I can just tell.

3318~~~
Is it me or does his arse look big?

3319~~~
His ass ain't bad but its no Luke Shaw.

3320~~~
Training on his own according to the journos. Weird.

3321~~~
He's injured..or thats what we were told..I hope its not an attitude issue..I cant stand that.

3322~~~
Club never said what injury he had. Stuart from MEN said club was unusually silent when asked about the injury and extent. Now we hear he's trining on his own.

3323~~~
It looks very suspicious..maybe make a thread on it and post the journalist quotes .

3324~~~
He's not in the first selection for internationals either, due to injury.

3325~~~
Danny Blind did not say anything about an injury.

3326~~~

3327~~~
Oh my..make that thread <a class="username" data-user="93460, @Adisa" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93460/">@Adisa</a>

3328~~~
Harsh words. I'd say Daley is feeling a little awkward right now.

3329~~~
Wonder what his laces say now.

3330~~~
I'm still looking for the tweet from last week. It was one of the MEN journos but can't remember who.

3331~~~
Good to see Blind not pulling any punches.

Hodgson could learn from him.

3332~~~
Steve Bates who broke the article about Giggs giving him some hard talk a few weeks ago has been saying the club is concerned about his attitude to bad performances and his unwillingness to learn. He keeps referring people to his story each time he's out of the starting line up. Has been implying the club is punishing him but used the word, re-educate

3333~~~
Bad signs. If he doesn't change his attitude, I don't think he'll make it here.

3334~~~

3335~~~
Absolutely <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3336~~~
Cool..with the club evidently having misled the media and Blind snr blowing their cover, this could garner more attention than it should have.

3337~~~
Considering how "well" Blind has done in charge of Holland, I'm not sure I'd want Hodgson learning anything at all from him...other than maybe how to get sacked quicker.

Not sure what these comments are meant to achieve either. I'm sure he's right but slagging off individual players when you've got the entire national team playing like a pub side is never a wise or productive move.

3338~~~
Depay is an easy scapegoat for blind, he may not have played well recently but who has in that team and blind hasn't been great as a manager either 

Depay clearly has talent he also some issues and work to do but given he is young, adjusting to a new league and trying to fit into an attack which hardly functions at times I am not surprised he is finding it tough. it seems very early to be writing him off and the criticism he receives in the media isn't entirely justified at times.

I think he could be a special player in the right set up, if we can get a right winger who can actually go on the outside of a full back and play martial through the middle I can see depay being much better. Martial drifting out wide and depay cutting in from the left is potentially very exciting. Until we start finding players that compliment each other and building those kind of patterns in attack I think most of out attacking players are going to struggle.

3339~~~
May as well play with ten men.

3340~~~
Has to be said, was poor.

3341~~~
Can't really put much stuck into a short cameo of a player whose confidence is shot. He's been thrown under the bus by pretty much everybody in recent weeks, criticizing him more is not gonna help the cause at this stage.

3342~~~
Think the free kick at the end summed him up at the moment. 

Confidence is shot. A obviously huge talent, just isn't coming off for him atm

3343~~~
Bollocks, watch again and you will see the runs he was making into space yet nobody had the balls to play the ball to him

3344~~~
He's incredibly poor at the moment. He doesn't even make it hard for LVG to not start him.

3345~~~
He looked dangerous when he came on but his final ball was terrible

3346~~~
Thats probably because when he did get the ball he looked like causing more danger to traffic on the M60 than he did their goal.

3347~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3348~~~
Great, no wonder he's lost confidence with fans like you

3349~~~
I doubt he reads the Caf, we're allowed to be honest; it would be a pretty pointless website if we all just posted 'THEY WERE ALL GREAT' after every game out of fear they might read it.

3350~~~
You can make good runs all throughout but they mean sweet FA, though, if he doesn't actually get the ball.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3351~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3352~~~
I thought he was injured. So was he dropped for the Palace game instead ?

3353~~~
I was surprised he came on when there was the option of using Pereira on the left. He is having a tough first season at the club and perhaps could do with a break to clear his head, then hopefully perform better in the 2nd half of the season.

3354~~~
No. LVG said Memphis did his first day of training on Monday and even that was with the physiotherapist rather than with the main group. Only reason he was involved tonight was that Schneiderlin was unwell. LVG had to wait for report from physio to know if Memphis was fit enough to play some mins.

3355~~~
He's lost his swagger, seems anxious when the ball comes to him.

3356~~~
Young player with a serious confidence issue at the minute. Will take time.

3357~~~
Short cameo and he's unfit at the moment.Wrong moment to criticize.

3358~~~
He's looked really poor lately.

That wayward cross he had just sums him up at the moment.

3359~~~
glad he fecked that up at the line so carrick could find Lingard to assist rooney.. actully dunno what to do with him, hopefully we start winning games so here is less pressure when he comes on. he just needs one or two simple passes/touches at the start of his game, make some simple runs and then try to build on it.. he just can't think of doing difficult things when his head says something like "you will fecked it up but you should try anyway"

3360~~~
Whipped in one decent cross but didn't really look like he wanted it to me. Stark contrast with Lingard who was brave and played himself in to the game, despite being so lightweight

3361~~~
His gash attempt at turning his man is what led to Carrick switching play to Lingard for the goal. Sometimes you can have a positive effect by mistake.

He looked decent for the first few minutes and put in a decent cross but as soon as he ballooned the next attempt nothing went right for him from then on.

3362~~~
Get Bebe back to show him how to cross.

3363~~~
To me it looks like he is underestimating his opposition at the moment. He's been using some very obvious and poor dribbling moves to take people on that may have worked in Holland but won't work at the top level.

3364~~~
Bebe-esque cross from him today. I do believe he will come good, though. He's already shown signs of quality this season.

3365~~~
Or it's all he's got in his locker currently.

3366~~~
He needs to go out on the pitch with the same attitude that Lingard has, that way you can excuse his mistakes if he Works his arse of to get the ball back.

3367~~~
The lead up to the goal, where he tried to reverse the ball back onto the outside with a behind-the-leg-instep was so poor. If you're gonna do skills, you got to be in the moment or do it with full conviction. That could have easily led to a counter attack. 

Even if it's a confidence thing i.e he'll be able to use his skillset regularly and effectively there's fundementals that needs to be addressed.

3368~~~

1:45 Explains how the whole Memphis too late for the team bus story was bullshit.

Media is shambles. Morgan was out and Memphis had to come last minute.

3369~~~
To me he isnt sharp enough right now. In the build up to our goal today for example, he lost the ball so easily and cheaply it annoyed.

3370~~~
We have some run of 'easy' games coming up. Might be the best time for him to play his way out of the terrible form he is in. Hopefully he gets chances. There is only so much you can accomplish by dropping him for a while. The only way he is coming out of this dip is by playing.

3371~~~
He's been inconsistent, not consistently horrible.  I'm not too concerned.  He'll come good.

3372~~~
He got to "show " some commitment/effort. Get the fans behind him.

3373~~~
If like him to show a bit more direct running like Lingard I love that kind of play, if defenders sit deep run toward them at pace and it forces them to make a decision otherwise they will just face you up all day and squeeze the space. 

He clearly has pace and strength I wish he'd use it instead of trying to showboat and do little turns that aren't working.

3374~~~
I have noticed this as well. If he wants to be a dribbler he should work on his skills.

3375~~~
The fact that he can't beat his man is really worrying.

Even at their worst, Nani and Valencia could always beat their man (it's what they did after that that was the problem). Hell, even Young is pretty good at beating his man (and then falling). Memphis has neither the dribbling skills of Nani nor the pace of Valencia which really worries me. Beating your man is more about natural ability than something you pick up with age, after all.

3376~~~
Does he have pace though? He's looked pretty slow whenever I've watched him, and he doesn't seem very strong either. 
I can't figure out what his strengths are at all, if he has any.

3377~~~
It was a bit of a shit performance but that free-kick he won (and fecked up spectacularly) came from a tidy bit of dribbling through a crowd of defenders. That's what he offers at his best, nimble footwork, balance and close control. He's not a speed merchant, so won't be able to kick and rush past players but he has proven himself more than capable of beating players in tight areas with great pieces of skill. Another example being the way he created space for himself to shoot (and hit the post) in our 40 pass goal, as well as his goal in the defeat against PSV. He's also shown that he has a great shot and cross on him, as well as being a very good finisher when he was in Holland. The attributes of a quality player are there, even if he hasn't shown them nearly enough so far.

3378~~~
That whole segment is very funny. "<i>It ish un... believable!</i>"

3379~~~
Yeah i think he has the skill to make it here, but he needs to improve his decision making. Its good that he wants the ball, but he can be quite selfish and not make the simple pass when he had nowhere to go.

3380~~~
Aye, he has shown glimpses of his dribbling ability, esp in that game against Newcastle where he got past their LB several times, if I'm not wrong.

Likewise, as you've stated, this was a great piece of skill to score against PSV

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J3Gb_XxKFEw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Obviously they haven't been happening enough and he has been dispossessed plenty of times but I think he has it in him to be a good dribbler and a good player, once he gets through this patch of poor form and acclimatises to the league.

He has been woeful for most parts of the season and looks to be overwhelmed, both mentally and physically, by the demands of playing in a more competitive league - something that he himself admitted. Unfortunately he also seems to be suffering from a severe loss in confidence as well - seems more dejected nowadays rather than the more enthusiastic player that we saw in the early stages of the season. Hopefully, he gets past this rut and develops into a good player.

3381~~~
Nice bit of play in that video. But it's nothing new. We know he's a good runner once he's gathered momentum. It's from a standing start where he looks unable to beat a man consistently.

And when you look at the best teams for possession play over the past few years, the wingers have all had the ability to skin a man from stand still. When the team is as dominant as van Gaal sets his team up to be, there aren't going to be loads of opportunities to move with pace onto a pass like that.

I don't believe that ability to dribble like that just pops out of nowhere, so I doubt he'll ever be great at it. But he can get better at what it is that he already does well. And maybe the system will change over the years, to one that plays into space more than this current team. This current system is pretty unsuited to his strengths, unfortunately. 

We're seeing with Douglas Costa exactly the type of winger that thrives in a possession team.

3382~~~
I think the key is acceleration, pace over 5-10 yards. I don't think he's quick. The problem is the type of winger you described is very rare.

3383~~~
That's fair enough, but even possession oriented teams are heavily reliant on movement in the final third to create spaces for forwards - something which we are severely lacking in at the moment, which results in forwards being asked to do too much on their own. Being required to repeatedly beat a player from stand-still is quite something and only the best dribblers possess it (Robben, Messi, Hazard etc).

Tbf to Memphis, he was never really a jinxing dribbling type of a player but rather a more well-rounded goalscoring inside forward. I agree that the possession based system doesn't quite suit Memphis and it only makes the adaptation process that much harder for him. Still, think he will be a fine player for us once he settles in and gets going for us.

3384~~~
This, this this and this.

I doubt he will become a really good player in a possession based team. It would require a total change of his skillset, and probably a few years work. He might turn into a decent one but I see a bigger chance for Pereira and Januzaj to excel in our setup. Depends on who will be our next manager but I expect him to struggle in van Gaal regime.

3385~~~
He might be a frustrating manager, but he's got to be the best interview out there.

3386~~~
He's amazingly hopeless. I almost feel sorry for him at this point. 

Lingard currently looks miles the better player, and I don't think he's <i>particularity</i> good himself.

3387~~~
Another hypothetical question: if his form doesn't improve much from now till the end of this season, would you consider loan him out to a PL team next season?

No intention to write the lad off here, just seeking for opinion.

3388~~~
Definitely not for me.

3389~~~
I think in hindsight LvG's experiment with him as a #10 during pre-season made sense, he lacks the pace off the mark for the wide role in the PL.

3390~~~
I'd definitely consider strengthening our forward line which may hinder his game time further. I'd make the decision after the preseason to see how he does , seeing as he has the summer off.

3391~~~
I always give young players two seasons of consistent football with us before making a judgement on them. Will do the same with Memphis; he's still young & learnin'

3392~~~
The thing is, we can't give every player such an opportunity. And currently Memphis is the last one who deserves that time. Martial is in another bracket, and I rate both Januzaj and Lingard higher than Depay, who is living off his reputation in Holland. 

Yeah I'd loan him, it's highly probable we'll bring another winger so his chances will be limited.

3393~~~
Hes only played a handfull of games in a new league. You are being extremely harsh.
Any new player you buy from another league is living off their reputation in another country btw

3394~~~
It feels like Memphis might become the next Nani. Flashes of brilliance without ever becoming a long-term regular. Of course, I hope I am completely wrong.

It feels weird reading the recent comments about him as opposed to the comments before he arrived which said that he is one of the hardest working footballers, a bit like CR7 and is a player that does everything for the team.

3395~~~
Becoming the next Nani would be a huge compliment to him at the moment. He's shown nothing so far for us to suggest he can reach that level of quality and productivity.

3396~~~
He seems to lack the eye for the killer pass and the creativity which would be needed on the 10. Rooney has the same issue most of the time.

I would think about turning Depay into a 9.

3397~~~
Every player? Who are the other ones, Lingard and Januzaj haven't achieved what Memphis has so this far in their careers, so I find it strange that you'd find him to be the least deserving of the three. Martial had a brilliant start but has started to drop off a bit in the last few games which is natural as I'd be amazed if he'd be able to uphold the level he showed in his first few matches, I believe he's just as raw as Depay which i'm sure will become evident in due time.

Besides we've a shortage on wingers so he'd get more than enough game-time even if we did bring in another one. Young will be turning 31 next year, Lingard and Januzaj we don't know what their roles will be if they'll be here at all, Valencia won't return to the wing and Mata isn't really a top class winger IMO.

3398~~~
We can’t give unlimited playing time to every young talent, that’s what I had in mind.

Memphis has done nothing since coming here. I know what are Januzaj strengths, the same applies to Pereira and Lingard (who is the least talented of the four of them, yet is currently first XI player). I really don’t know what Depay strengths are. It seems what worked in Holland doesn’t work here (in different system also). Martial definitely isn’t as raw as Memphis, he is just inconsistent.

Young, Lingard, Januzaj + one winger who we’ll probably bring, that’s 4 players better than Memphis. I think there is enough space for him but I think we should consider a loan.

3399~~~
Depay's greatest strength is his movement, that's obvious. He uses space very intelligently and will get into goalscoring positions as a result of that. Against Moscow the other night, he was positioned in behind Rooney in the event Rooney mistimed his header. It's not an obvious strength, but it's a definite one. His finishing is good, too.

His biggest problem at the moment is a lack of confidence and an inclination to prove a point with wild shots, wild crosses and poor decision making. That's why people are comparing him with Nani. Nani would never hide when having a bad game; he would rather try and try the same old trick, pissing people off in the process. I don't mind these players albeit I can understand that some get that bit more annoyed.

The idea we send him on loan is silly, for me. He's a better player than Lingard and Januzaj and offers more in front of goal than Young. He may not be showing that right now, but on the whole that is my belief and with a calmer head I think he's more than capable of showing that over the coming weeks.

3400~~~
And we clearly don't, seeing as Januzaj's off to germany and Memphis is now sidelined. They'll play when they're deemed ready.

I think that to say he's done nothing is an exaggeration but I'll agree he hasn't done enough to earn his spot in the team. Not strange that you're more familiar with the strenghts of players who've been here for several years compared to a player who's only been here a few months, especially if you didn't see him play in and for Holland. But I think his strenghts are pretty obvious; pace, power, movement, decent enough trickery and a wicked right foot. I do think that the system we play don't really cater to his strenghts much, which were my concerns before we bought him. But Van Gaal bought him and must believe that he can adapt to this style of football, but it might take time for him, time which he has.

I don't know what makes you say that Januzaj and Young are better wingers than Memphis, Lingard might appear the better winger RIGHT NOW, I'd argue he hasn't shown enough yet to really base an opinion on though. Januzajs been sent away after a start to the season where he was very inconsistant, Lingard's only made four appearances for us in which he's been ordinary and inconsistant but most recently he was brilliant in the last game vs CSKA (although again, inconsistent) and then pretty ordinary for large parts vs West Bromwich but scored a wonderfully taken goal. 

I think that Memphis has produced enough for us to be persist with, and I really don't trust loan-moves and would only consider it as a last resort.

3401~~~
Indeed

3402~~~
Productivity no, he had 4 goals and 4 assists in like his first 10 games and even that could be more easily. His general play will never be good imo but when in form or at his standards he can easily he productive.

3403~~~
Dribbling is a skill that can be learned like all others. You aren't born with a 98 dribbling metric.

Concerning Memphis it's only a matter of time and effort before his skillset that worked in Holland is modified for the Premier League.

3404~~~
To an extent, it is. But I think it's more about natural ability than just 'learning it' like others. Depay won't learn to be faster. I can't really think of many top players who can run past their marker that weren't always able to do it to an extent? It's just that their decision making and end product when they do it is much better than it was when they were young*

<i>*apart from Nani.</i>

3405~~~
That's fair. Even with the cap on his raw physical attributes, I think he has plenty of stuff to add to his arsenal. He needs to learn to create space and use it effectively. The ball will always move faster than the quickest back line.

3406~~~
He's low on confidence. The dribbles don't work and it's affecting him. Firstly he needs to change his attitude when it comes to working for the team. Tracking back to make interceptions and pressing in attack; you'd think such things were obvious but he isn't putting in the work. Then he just needs to start playing simple instead of doing it all on his own. Play the simple passes and make runs to carve up the opposition. Simple things that helps the team. When the simple things work the confidence will come back and the harder dribbles/passes/shots will have a higher success-rate.

3407~~~
But you told us he definitely has the IT <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3408~~~
Given the size of his transfer fee, I find it really strange he's been bombed out so much. At this current time you'd find it hard to see him getting any football, he's literally that much of a liability when he's on the field. Constantly giving the ball away and wasting of play, it's like Di Maria all over again.

3409~~~
Think you're being a bit harsh mate. He has shown flashes of his talent with us already. I'm not looking forward to the thread comments on Martial when he runs into the inevitable inconsistency patch. Just go read Januzaj's thread and Lingard's before the goal he scored. They are young players and they are what we have on our books now. We have no other choice but to give them time to grow into their roles. Agreed that he hasn't done enough to warrant an automatic starting spot but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be patient with him. How many games did Nani play in the league in his first season? Obviously not comparing the two players but I am comparing their respective situation when they first came to United. The only issue here is that we don't have a Ronaldo to help us through the younger, inexperienced player's adaptation and growing period.

So having said that, think the club and Memphis would benefit from a pacy (preferably right) wing acquisition next summer to take some pressure off. It would cut into their game time but if Memphis, Januzaj and Lingard are good enough, they'd make it here. Would definitely not loan them out!

3410~~~
Had quite a good interview with the NOS yesterday/today. The lad is working hard to regain his form and unfortunately for him people are saying he isnt working hard enough or is too busy with fashion and stuff. He said he's on the right track in training at club so he expects to find his form soon.

He's been really bad for us recently but everyone could see how much promise he showed in the start of the season + pre season. Hope he can get to his standards soon enough and kick on, he's still a massive talent. Shame that he's almost written off already.

3411~~~
How does someone 'lose' form by the way? When you're not injured or sick and you don't have any family issues (relative passed away) etc, what could possibly cause someone to do even the basics wrong match after match?

3412~~~
Handled that very well albeit it turned into an interview about a hat half way down the line. Hopefully he can back his words up.

3413~~~
Sometimes it's physical - you're just not in a great shape. You are not as fast, your stamina is not as good and, most importantly, you feet aren't as quicker. Happens to me often when I haven't been playing for a while. I doubt that's his problem, as he trains everyday.

Other times it's purely mental. This has also happened to me when I used to play regularly when I was younger. I'd have fantastic games and also really bad ones, in which nothing comes off. Every mistake you make just makes it worse and harder to concentrate which leads to more mistakes. It's hard to explain and I don't think confidence is the perfect word, because you fully realize then and there that you can play way better than you are right now.

He'll get over it.

3414~~~
Yeah I think you're right. I notice with myself that I sometimes just lose control over a situation because I can't concentrate well and then the basic things go wrong and I'm just like why is this happening. But those are more one-offs, just some moments while some players play like shit for several weeks/months long, is that also because of mental issues?

3415~~~
I presume this is a Dutch aphorism. What does walking next to your shoes mean? Getting too big for your boots?

3416~~~
Correct. That you're pretending to be more than you are.

3417~~~
Walking besides your boots (naast je schoenen gaan lopen) = thinking/acting like you've made it already, being too full of yourself (rating yourself too high?).

Memphis got alot of criticism for his fashion and clothes he wore, even in Holland and I like it that he finally responds to it. Such bollocks articles purely based on how he dresses, usually suggesting he has a bad attitude even though that's not true.

3418~~~
The faster we'll see Shaw on the pitch the better for everyone. Their understanding on the left side may be another future present for next manager to come.

I'm sure Memphis will sort it out. He already got through some difficult times in the past, this is just another step to take.

3419~~~
Maybe he should wear his hat on the pitch

3420~~~
That hat is the final nail in the coffin for me, I want him out of the club.

<span style="color: #ffffff">quote me</span>

3421~~~
It’s true, and I guess we agree that he’s more of a striker than a winger. However, he is too limited currently to become an important player for us in the coming seasons IMO, that’s why I don’t think loaning him is such a bad idea.

I believe Januzaj, Pereira and Lingard have the tools to become good players. They need time to put it all together. At the same time I don’t think Memphis has those tools (movement and shooting is not enough)- he has to improve a lot of aspects of his game to become a regular for us. You’re right, he has the time. But I’d rather give more chances to the other young players I mentioned than him. It’s a question which player is worth investing in.

Only thing he showed is confidence if you ask me. He had a couple of good games against Brugge and PSV, but I struggle to see any other good contribution he had in the League.

It’s okey, because he’s young. I don’t see the “obvious talent” in him though, and I’ve been skeptical before we signed him.  He should get some playing time but to me it seems we have better young players who should be getting playing time ahead of him.

3422~~~
What kind of hat was he wearing?

3423~~~

3425~~~

3426~~~

3427~~~
I remember when watching him in Holland I always thought he reminded me of Zaha with the way the ball never seemed to be under close control. He seemed to get past players with octupus limbs in all directions and miraculously emerge with the ball. He started ok and I thought well it works but now I'm just not sure how good he is once again.

3428~~~
Now that's a hat!

No hint of corniness here .

3429~~~
I like Memphis. His answers had the right amounts of disgust and indifference. Why are the Dutch obsessed with hats ffs?

3430~~~
Nothing wrong with the hat. Footballers wear appalling clobber sometimes. It seems mad that it got so much attention at the time. There's been much, much worse outfits sported by players.

3431~~~
All Dench.

3432~~~
Looks likes he's on I'm A Celebrity...

3433~~~
Dateline: Manchester. The elusive Pie Baron continues to thumb his nose at the authorities. Swaggering about in a garish new hat, he seemed to say, "Look at me, Danny Blind! I have a new hat!"

3434~~~
Of course, it carries on. You have a poor game, really want to prove yourself in the next one and end up forcing a lot more things, which leads to worse results. That just continues to carry on until you can sit back, relax and take a normal approach to the game again. That's easier said than done though because if you're a competitor, you have a certain ego and that often stands in a way of taking a step back to get back into your rhythm.

3435~~~
Likewise the right hand side.  When you look at bayern and barcelona; two teams that incorporates forward/wingers,  part of the beauty is that you can attack from any angle with equal confidence.  Mata drifts inwards much more without the ball than with and it makes the opposition defence lean towards the left hand side automatically.

3436~~~
He's been shocking lately but I still feel he's been slightly over criticised, he's still managed 4 goals and 4 assists from around 11 starts, this playing for a new team who aren't exactly scoring 3+ goals every week.

He's only 21 I have faith he will come good.

3437~~~
Of course he's being over criticised, it's what United fans do on a consistent basis.

Patience is crucial with Depay.

3438~~~
Yup. And, indeed, with all young players.

3439~~~
The problem in football nowadays is fans/people want instant results when it comes to everything. There's so little patience in the game nowadays. 

He's 21 years old, already a very good football player and can potentially go on to be a great player. Some players hit the ground running, some don't. The key with Depay right now is patience and his attitude. If he has the right attitude then he'll eventually turn it around and find his footing at the club. Some fans are jumping on him within a few months of being at the club because he hasn't lit the league on fire. 

In my view he's rightfully been dropped and there's nothing wrong with that. I think he's been poor for the most part but I'm not going to jump on him and shit all over the guy because he hasn't fit straight in right off the bat. As I mentioned above, being dropped will test his mentality and show us if he has the right attitude to now bounce back and work his way back into the team.

3440~~~
I remember a time not that long ago when even your average football fan basically accepted that most foreign players would take an entire season to adapt to the PL and start to show what they were actually capable of. Nowadays they barely get an entire <i>match</i> before people start drawing big conclusions.

3441~~~
Amen

3442~~~
over criticized yes... but at first he was over hyped, hopefully we will find a balance

3443~~~
He looks awful. No intelligence, too stocky, can't beat players one on one, not aggressive enough. I hadn't watched him before he got here so i vowed to judge him on what I've seen and he has been awful. If he was playing better Rooney would be on the bench but he has been just as bad. I expect him to improve because he is a pretty good technically. He needs to lose some muscle so he can be more agile. His decision making needs to improve to. I assume the PSV team was built around him so he is having to adjust but he has been awful.

he certainly seems one of the stockier players around - though you can only imagine the club have put him on a programme to gain the weight so they must feel it will benefit him in the long run?

3445~~~
Didn't Shaw put on a few pounds when he arrived too?

3446~~~
Yes but that wasn't muscle, just pure pork chops

3447~~~
I'm curious to hear what these tools are that you believe they all supposedly have that Memphis doesn't. If anything Memphis is by far the most well rounded of the four, which isn't everything of course or Ronaldo would be a better player than Messi, but I think his strenghts are greater than those of his peers in this example. It's strange to me that you'd find Memphis, the only of the four who's achieved any kind of success, the least worthy of investing in.

3448~~~
Nah he was ripped

3449~~~
In my head I always rate players by natural ability and then by character - the latter of which can be lost and acquired to some extent.

So Ronaldo would be a 9/10. Gazza would be a 10/2. Darren Fletcher would be a 5/10. Ravel Morrison 8/1 etc

Memphis is a 7/5. He needs to be an 7/8 to succeed here. Fair?

3450~~~
What do you find <i>off</i> about his character, just out of curiosity ?

3451~~~
Partly his manner on the pitch suggests he's not working especially hard to find form. Partly rumour mill.

3452~~~
If anything, i'd attribute his poor performances to lack of confidence and being overwhelmed by the physicality of the league, and not laziness.

He's been frustrating to watch this season, and I've called for Ashley Young to replace him a couple of times, in certain games, but i was always under the impression that as a young player in a new league, that is kind of what you should expect. I was wrong. The verdict is out already - he is not good enough, it seems.

3453~~~
If he turns this around, (and there is a good chance that he will) a lot of people will look like fools on here. He is 21 years old, adapting to the toughest and most competitive league in the world. Saying he is not doing well at the moment is only fair but claiming he is already finished at United and will never be good enough is ridiculous.

3454~~~
This forum feels like De Gea all over again.

3455~~~
His manners on the pitch were the same for PSV, he rarely had to track back after losing the ball and he didn't smile alot. He did defensive duties in the big games but he was the main man offensively so he was relieved of tracking back usually as he'd offer more going forward on the break. He will need to improve on this obviously, for now it really is one of his weak points.

I can understand that for people who didn't know much about him before he transferred to Manchester United it's easy to buy into the rumour mill, but I am still convinced his attitude is one of his (if not, <i>the)</i> strong point. I just think he's an easy target to be lauded as having a bad attitude (since he used to have one and also looks like it), the same happened in Holland yet he rarely made the news for doing stupid things. Especially since he made the first team of PSV he progressed on and off the pitch like you expect from a top talent.

I do think that he's a type that needs a boot up the arse every once in a while, but Memphis is very grounded in the fact that he knows he hasn't made it yet. I doubt he's sulking for being benched, I'm sure he knows fully well he hasn't been good enough. He has confidence in himself and he's one of the players that always gives it all in training, I don't think I've ever heard of him slacking during training. He really lives by the motto he has tattoo'd on his chest: Dream Chaser, I doubt his dreams end with a spot in the Manchester United reserves. Memphis has a plan in his head for how he wants his carreer to turn out and so far he's taken every step with relative ease untill his transfer, now he's hit his first big hurdle which he struggled with in his carreer. I doubt he'll give up though, I cannot wait for him to adapt to the PL and show that he's already a better player than he's shown so far.

3456~~~
This is an inaccurate statement. Rooney will always be played since he is the captain and Van Gaal has stated so.

3457~~~
And if he doesn't then there will be as many fools on the other side. Most people here criticising Depay are doing so based on what he's shown so far rather than what he may do in future.

3458~~~
Lots of speculating but he's hardly the first player to come to the PL from another league and have a difficult first season. I think the 2 key issues are reaction time and workrate. 

He's used to having much more time on the ball to decide what he wants to do, in the PL defenders are all over you the minute you get the ball and he hasn't gotten up to speed with that yet. He also needs to realize that whatever special privileges he had at PSV regarding not tracking back don't exist here.

3459~~~
Quite honestly, its too quick for a verdict either way.

Lets be honest, he's performed well in a Dutch league that is quite poor, and there have been more talents than not from that league that have failed to show the same in much better leagues, especially recently with talents like Luuk de Jong, Ryan Babel etc. People with concerns have valid ones based simply on probabilities. 

Alternatively so, he was one of the most sought young talents in European football and has done well for his NT, and one would hope that he goes on to be a big star. 

In simple words, his career here can go either. The problem is that people want to simply make an opinion early on, so that if opinion turns out true , they can "call it". The honest truth is that it can go either, either as a success or not. We all dont really know yet.

3460~~~
Dont really care about the smiling, but they are very few players in  the modern  game with the license to have such a laissez faire to defending, even attackers, especially in this league. Thats not something that really requires above normal skill, its just something you just do .

He might be more talented than his respective rivals for that position, but United has always been more than the some parts. One of our best partnerships last season was Daley Blind as LB and Ashley Young as a LW, and one of the biggest reasons it worked so well was they could cover for each so well, Young is defensively sound and Blind has good attacking qualities. Individually neither is the best in the world in either position, but together they worked really well.

Personally, I'd start Lingard , and like with ADM last season, have Depay prove that he deserves to be in the team, both in an attacking and defensive viewpoint. If he works it, and shows a desire to improve on that, and takes the opportunity when given(Because Lingard like Young last season will not make it easy) , great. If not , then that will be a pity.

3461~~~
Which is why people need to give him time, barely 4 months and he's <i>not good enough</i>?

He wasn't signed because he performed well in the Dutch League - that normally earns you a transfer to a mid table/5th placed team. He was the focal point in that championship winning PSV team. Surely that must count for more? That kind of talent doesn't just disappear after 3-4 months, He's already achieved a lot in his career, and he's only 21.

Don't even get me started on the foolish assumptions based on his appearance,fashion sense and lifestyle. Arrant nonsense. 

I'm all for criticisms aimed at his performances, but that should be it really(after 3-4 months), this thread shouldn't be divided into Pro-Memphis and Anti-Memphis, we shouldn't have people patiently waiting to say "I told you so" or "I called it" if a player fails.

Makes you wonder how Martial would've been treated if he had a slow start as well.

3462~~~
It goes both ways though.

I have seen some call him "Another Dutch Eredivise fraud", and then there is the polar opposite gang, who thinks its just a a matter of time before he is world class. Both are far too soon, I'm firmly in the I dont know camp.

What I feel is fair though is to question his current performances, which this thread is for, but people instead want to use that draw conclusions about his career will pan out.

3463~~~
I think this is very good analysis. I also think it is very difficult to move to the Premier League and retain both flair and reliability. You have to be approaching world class to do that. It will take 2 years for him to achieve that, if he has the character to step up and achieve it at all. That is really the big question for me. I hope he answers it positively but not everyone has what it takes to do so.

3464~~~
I repeat, it is fair to say he hasn't been exceptional by any means. Still, he has shown glimpses of quality and his stats are actually not bad all things considered. I'm not claiming he will be a world class player but the talent is there, no doubt about that. United supporters have always been behind young players, I don't see why we should change that attitude now all of a sudden.

3465~~~
You don't really need to repeat. His stats against some of the worst teams we've played this season don't really ease worries.

3466~~~
He wasn't over hyped. the dude was close to Nazario Ronaldo's record in the dutch league. He came with the hype.

3467~~~
Nah De Gea was getting a lot of shit from the media, but got a lot of support from the fans. 

The Memphis situation is basically in reverse.

3468~~~
Sounds weird but i'm glad Memphis is getting this kind of criticism & pressure. Giving his attitude, it will just make him more focused and to prove the haters wrong that he is a good player. Its just a matter will the pressure turn him into dust or diamond, but i have no doubt for him. Just the attitude alone will stimulate him to push himself to another level. Zaha for example, had the flair & potential to be a decent player but never had the attitude to push himself even further.

3469~~~
Just been reading an interview with him (assuming it's with the dutch national squad) where he talks about how he's put on 5kg since joining united - has now hired a personal chef to make sure he eats right.  He's stated not that he's put on fat or eaten rubbish, but put on muscle

To put this into perspective how big he now is
height = 1.76m or 5'9
weight = 85kg or 187lbs or 13st 4lb

to put this further into perspective
Messi = 1.70m or 5'7 and weighs 67kg or 10st 7
Ronaldo = 1.85cm or 6ft and weights 80kg or 12st 8
Neymar = 1.74m or 5'8 and weighs 68kg or 10st 9
Hazard = 1.73m or 5'8 and weighs 74kg or 11st 9

and lastly Charlie Adam = 1.85m or 6ft and weights 82kg (but yes, i know muscle weighs more than fat)

so Memphis is basically 2 inches taller in height than Messi but weights 2 1/2 stone more, pretty much as tall as Neymar 2 1/2 stone heiver, as tall as Hazard (who i think is a pretty "stocky" player) but still weighs 1 1/2 stone more than him) and weighs 2kg / 8lb more than Ronaldo who is 10cm or 3 inches taller

a few months back, i don't remember which Dutch "legend" said this, said Memphis is build is looking more and more like a boxer / athlete than a footballer and i kinda disagreed with him, but looking at the stats above (and yes i know bone density etc plays a part), perhaps it is time the lad tones done and this is obviously impacting his speed / stamina

3470~~~
He just looks far too slow, yet he tries to play as if he is fast. It isn't working.

3471~~~
Yep, 85 kg sounds heavy for a footballer his height. Nani is listed as 66 kg (not sure how accurate that is though...) -- he's ripped, and the same height as Memphis. It definitely looks like it's affecting his agility.

3472~~~
He's put on 5kgs of muscle in 4 months? Bullshit, at least 2kgs of it is fat. Not even bodybuilders put on that much pure muscle in a year, let alone 4 months. He needs to lose weight IMO, he's too heavy for a footballer.

3473~~~
I think Memphis is stuggling with his stamina, due to the added weight and the quicker pace of the league.

He probably isn't used too tracking back so much either, so it's all been a new learning curve. I know that when you are really tired and lacking breathe your decision making goes out the window, your strength and balance also goes funny. 

To me that's what it seems like, I think he needs to tone down on the muscle as he is already strong, but the extra mass is giving him a negative effect. He definitely is looking slower/heavier than he used too and I really do think thats why.

3474~~~
Yeah that's what I thought, rather unlikely that it's pure muscle. I wonder why would the club allow him to gain so much though.

3475~~~
That's very true, I don't get how they let him go up like that, surely these things are monitored? He really needs to lose about 7 kgs at least, in comparison Smalling is 81kgs at 192cm! and he's massive.

3476~~~
DDG had to step in VDS shoes though, we haven't had a very good winger for a pretty long time.

If the situations are alike then it's a worry as our expectations were pretty huge after VDS being used to him being a world class keeper whereas I don't think we've had any irrational expectations when it comes to wingers.

3477~~~
1kg a month is possible - though typically when people have not trained much before and they start training intensively - you would expect that he was in at least reasonable shape before hand
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ask-the-ripped-dude-how-much-muscle-can-i-put-on-naturally.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ask-the-ripped-dude-how-much-muscle-can-i-put-on-naturally.html</a>
so either he is juicing, is  natural physical freak or he is putting on not as much pure muscle as is claimed would be the most likely conclusions
Of course his training will still be structured around cardio etc as well and one would imagine that if he has gained that much weight under the guidence / direction of the club then part of his training now will be about adjusting to his new physique as he has more weight etc to carry.
Hopefully he is not the new anderson!

3478~~~
Saw somewhere that he will hire personal chef,to help out with his diet. I kinda like that,he has issue with something and will put some effort to fix it.People talked all kinds of stuff about Shaw last season,in summer he hired a personal trainer and before injury we could all see results.

3479~~~
in his interview about gaining 5kg - he already has hired the chef

3480~~~
Problem is it doesn't allways work out. Raptors center Jonas Valanciunas in his second year in the NBA was put on a bulking program to improve his physicality with the intention of making him more dominant in the paint, however the unintentional consequences of his gain in mass was that at 7 ft, he lost some of his natural athleticism which saw a decline in his performances.

3481~~~
Oh,sack a chef then?

3482~~~
Thing with muscle mass is that it's really not very helpful in football, because stamina is king. His height/weight ratio isn't weird at all compared to fast, agile American Football players - in fact he's on the light side - but despite them being faster and stronger than him, it's all short burst, lots of rest. 

I feel like a lot of younger players bulk up, and then thin down again as they realise it hasn't really helped them. 

I think the one exception might be CBs - because they don't actually have to run very often in a match.

3483~~~
He could have experienced a growth spurt maybe? he is 21 after all so it's not that improbable. He needs to do whatever Shaw did during summer. Once he sorts his physique out, he'll be good again IMO. I knew he was a bit too big but 85kgs is heavy.

3484~~~
Who ate all depay? Fat Memphis.

3485~~~
5 kg in 4 months? fecking hell, even if that's not all muscle it's still a lot. He needs to stop going to build muscle, he has too much if anything. Was thinking he definitely looked thinner, quicker and more agile in pre season then he has recently, and that backs it up. Could do with losing all that he gained and a bit more really. Maybe he thought about the needing to bulk up for the premier league thing too much and just over did it.

3486~~~
LOL. Yes I was about to say that, too.
When you first start out bodybuilding, you add muscle fast, then it slows down dramatically.
If you want to add 5KG of lean muscle tissue in 4 months,  you will need to take heavy doses of anabolic steroids. Even then, gaining that much muscle would not be straight forward.

My guess is that after arriving in the EPL and being benched, he now realises that he isn't as good as he previously thought. It hasn't helped that he is playing genuinely badly. This guy has gone to be being the player of the year to being benched.
This has mentally depressed him a little and perhaps he is turning to food. Amongst non athletes, this is quite normal.

3487~~~
Can't disagree with this post to be honest.

3488~~~
Zlatan looks like a brick wall to me how does he compare?

3489~~~
Zlatan is 1.95m and weights 95kg.

3490~~~
So equally a big lad?

Ps Drogba was a unit as well. I think this is all abit much.

3491~~~
Well Zlatan is very tall, which kinda makes up for his mass, he is also a taekwondo specialist so he is extremely agile. It is difficult to compare Zlatan to Memphis because of their difference in leg length. A better comparison to Memphis would be Rooney, or perhaps Drogba as you say (even if he is pretty tall at 187cm, but weights 91kg).

3492~~~
They are both much taller than Memphis. Just look at their bodies, they look strong but still quite lean. Memphis looks noticeably bulging, it's totally different

3493~~~
Rooney in his prime was "bulging" and I dont look at Memphis and see anything but a muscle unit. Bulk up slim down is in vogue right now but a skinny Di Maria did ok for Real and a bulging Rooney had a good career as well. Memphis losing 5kg or whatevs wont be the panacea to a form recovery.

3494~~~
The Media circus surrounding the club is leading afew on I think. Next it will be Martials Missus has said the forward "would only like to play striker" from now on.

3495~~~
I don't mean he looks fat, I mean his muscles are bulging because they're really big, much bigger than Zlatan's or Drogba's or indeed Rooney's

3496~~~
Maybe this 5 kg weight increase helps explain his erratic form, and recent exclusion from the team.

5 kg is quite alot for anyone yet alone an elite athlete, and seems a bit of an odd one to me.

Didn't Luke Shaw have similar issues with his weight last season and his form was all over the place, yet once he got it sorted over the summer he was fantastic, a similar scenario hopefully awaits Depay.

3497~~~
Shaw started off the season simply unfit apparentley. Memphis is different in that he is already built like a tank, and still young.

3498~~~
His extra weight is doing him no favours at all when it comes to football. It looks good for the cameras and the ladies but he has serious trouble beating a man in the PL with pace/skill.

3499~~~
There builds are not too dissimilar, I find it hard to believe Shaw was unfit after the season he had just had at Southampton where he played most games and was up and down the wing all the time, he maybe just bulked up too much and lost his edge, which is maybe what is bothering Depay, he just needs to get the balance right between been muscle bound as he seems to want to be, and agile and fit enough to find his form again.

3500~~~
No one thinks not playing every week and playing every week could account for 5kg over 5 months say........Average player loses half a stone over 90mins I recall reading in summer months I know its cold but still.

3501~~~
People arguing over 5 kg, you would think this is some kind of women's forum <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

I understand him, i am some kind of freak when it comes to weight, i am 188cm tall and usually around 82kg, but i can easily put 8 kilos in 4-5 months and i am looking a lot less "fat" when i start excercising but when i have 2-3 months off (don't have time or i just want some time off to get back motivation) i can lose up to 10+ kg in that time without much of visual effect <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3502~~~
it wasn't bulking up with Shaw, even though he had come back from the World Cup. LVG himself said he returned way off the pace, so he must have been really enjoying himself for a few weeks pigging out. Shaw and Memphis are similar stocky builds, with Shaw being a bit soft and on the tubby side. He still gets shit now for being fat. Memphis is built like a ox though, muscle is heavier than fat so while Memphis has the body to die for its having an effect on what he can do

3503~~~
Way off the pace but thanks to him we are still in the CL? His form has dropped and everyone is looking for reasons.

3504~~~
Has been directly involved in as many goals as Rooney this season with less starts, playing wide left, in a debut campaign and still just 21. 

Context and patience.

3505~~~
85kg for such a midget is simply 20 pounds too much. 

surprised to see Ronaldo is just 80kg, he looks heavier.

3506~~~
Aye, context. Shouldn't Rooney's form be mentioned if you want context?

3507~~~
Rooney is hardly the yardstick to compare players with this season

3508~~~
If Depay was playing at a high level Rooney would be on the bench. Forget what LVG said, Depay hasn't made him have to make a decision in any way shape or form. LVG doesn't  go by reputations this is a manager who benched Rivaldo when he was World Player Of The Year. Martial has taken Depay's position because Depay can't do what is required of him. if he was doing that and it was a choice between Martial and Rooney I think we all know who LVG would play. But then I guess Rooney would just play in the 10. position.

3509~~~
Does this weight gain coincide with Shaw being injured? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3510~~~
Thats a lie, the benching was years later in his second stint as manager.

3511~~~
My observations based on his games for us:
Pereira and Januzaj both have much superior technique, especially close touch. Lingard is ahead of him in that department too, although not so much. Depay is the most one footed of the 4 (Januzaj 2nd). Neither of them is particularly great dribbler, although Depay seems to struggle the most at beating his man (maybe because his pace is ordinary and he always seems to go inside).
My biggest worry is something I noticed very early- his link up play is poor. He very rarely cooperates with the fullback (that was my observation when Shaw was playing), and when pressed he rarely looks for a way to get out of trouble and move forward, he rather passes the ball to the back and stay in the same place. 

Depay is used to running with the ball when defenders are backing too, but he rarely gets that opportunity because of our style of play. He is definitely the best option for counter attacking team, but unfortunately he struggles in our setup because his skillset isn't suited to possession game. 
He also has some tricks in him, but it seems it doesn't work in England (tbh worked only against Brugge and PSV so far). 

Why do you think Depay is the most well rounded? I think people say that because of his record in Holland. Fair enough, he has achieved the most of them all but I've seen very little of his class since he moved here.

3512~~~
How much does his hat weigh?

3513~~~
Add gold teeth aswell

3514~~~
Wish I could put on 5 kilos of muscle in 4 months.

3515~~~
Man the United canteen must be addictive. Depay, Shaw, Anderson... those dinner ladies need to get fired <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3516~~~
Boom <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3517~~~
Looks like we replaced Ando and not Ronaldo. Oh well.

3518~~~
I don't have much knowledge about all this weight, muscle, fat etc. I can only judge on what i am seeing on the pitch and I can"t see how putting on weight, even if its' muscle is going to help him. He already looks slow and heavy. I hope our medical department are't taking the default position that a foreigner must put on weight and bulk up.

3519~~~
How do we know player weights? Surely someone just made them up?

3520~~~
In memphis' case he came out and told us how much he weighs and how much he put on.

3521~~~
High intensity training every day of the week and you gain 5 kilos in less than 4 months? Starting at 80, no less. That's a lot of eating. Either his diet is off or he's forcing himself to get that amount of calories in. Nobody has that kind of appetite, surely?

I'm the same height and have a pretty similar build to him. Currently weigh 78 kilos and I feel a bit heavy when playing football, already.

3522~~~
I think it will be mostly the club dictating his eating and training to get him to get stronger.

3523~~~
They can't control what he eats outside of the club though, and he's said himself he's hiring a personal cook to better balance his diet

3524~~~
Yeah, the context of this post is about 60% of those goals and assists came in the equivalent of what turned out to be a glorified friendly against a heavily injury struck Brugge side.

3525~~~
Shall we apply the same logic to Rooney? 43% of all Rooneys goals this season came in one game against that same side.

3526~~~
Yeah, and Rooney has been shite too. I don't see the point in your post.

3527~~~
I just think it's important to highlight how bad Rooney is at any given opportunity. I almost made a thread about it but I'm not sure if we do Rooney threads on here, I haven't seen any if we do.

3528~~~
Probably for the best, like. The wit wouldn't come close to your post in the Valencia thread.

3529~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

3530~~~
They had at least 8 first team injuries. I'm pretty sure their entire back line was injured - the team was barely second string.

3531~~~
How many 'glorified friendlies' give you the chance to play in the CL?

Criticise him if you must, but don't talk shit.

3532~~~
That one did, so there's at least one.

3533~~~
It's obvious English is not your first language.

3534~~~
Even without injuries it's clear Brugge was a comfortable side for Memphis (and Rooney...) to meet because they are closer in their level and I suppose style to what Memphis was used to playing against in Holland.

3535~~~

3536~~~
I'll give you close Control as of now, the other parts I find very questionable. Memphis is also the fastest of the 4 so to call his pace "ordinary" would seem strange. I don't Think he's any worse than anyone else in that bunch at beating his man, he did it 6-8 times in the Newcastle game alone, both on the inside and outside. I don't Think there's much wrong with his link-up play either, it looked good at the start of the season when he played more centrally, but even Shaw isn't the most brave or creative of fullbacks so I can see why it hasn't quite happened. Those things take time anyway, time which he's had the least of compared to the others. He had a very successful partnership with PSV left-back Willems last year who's a lot more comfortable going forward compared to any of our fullbacks. 

I Think he's the most well-rounded because he's got goals the most goals in him, he can score from near and far. He's physically far superior to any of Lingard, Pereira and Januzaj. He's obviously skillful and his passing is underrated IMO. His ability to pick a pass has been displayed for example with the assists for Rooney and Fellaini vs Brugge, and as he's shown for Holland previously. His movement has consistantly had him in goal-scoring situations for us, which he hasn't executed nearly well enough or it'd be a completely different story to his start here. He's shown he's very capable at set-pieces, and he does chip in more defensively than people like to acknowledge. I think that his game vs Spain earlier this year exemplifies all of his talents and his potential perfectly, only he out of him, Lingard, Januzaj and Pereira could've played that game (if that makes any sense).

You could put on 7kg of muscle in that time... if your diet and training were immaculate.

3538~~~
Teach me.

3539~~~
I'm going off completely trustworthy and legitimate anecdotal evidence I've read on bodybuilding.com... So you know it must be true!

3540~~~
Good enough for me mate! Vegas just been booked for next summer so off I go.

3541~~~
Very interesting. Could have played a part in his general sluggishness. There's no reason for a wideman to put on so much muscle really. I'd rather see the emphasis at his age being more on how to shield the ball, how to find space, how to pick a pass etc than becoming a boxer who plays football.

With regards to what I've read in this thread, again I disagree with those who simple can't see what he's good at. He's clearly a goalscorer. You don't score that many goals in the Dutch league at such a young age without having a talent for goalscoring. He's also shown his skill on the ball, and crossing prowess on numerous occasions, just not as many as we'd like for us. He may not be a natural dribbler but everyone doesn't have to be. Hopefully over the next year he works hard, improves and proves himself at United.

3542~~~
Again I'll repeat, the <b>benching</b> was years later. They didn't get along in his first stint, but he didn't drop him. I don't see the point of that wikipedia paragraph.

3543~~~
Rivaldo was sold in the summer of 2002 before LvG took charge. He didn't manage rivaldo at that time.

In his first stint he did bench him due to poor form in 1998 or so but rivaldo blamed that on playing him out of position even though he had played there the previous season and was their topscorer. Rivaldo was annoyed because he was booed by the fans once for a poor performance and he gave this excuse.

3544~~~
He was gone by 2002. As Prath stated. Rivaldo was there for his first stint.

3545~~~
........its the dutch league

3546~~~
So?

3547~~~
just cos you can score bags loads of goals in the dutch league does not mean you are going to succeed in the premiere league. nor should you be expected too the difference in quality is huge!

3548~~~
The guy obv has talent, not sure why people keep going on about the dutch league, doesn't matter you can see he is talented.

3549~~~
I agree that one should not expect big things from the off given the adaptation required and the time that takes for different players, however his achievements in the Dutch league do showcase that the kid has a gift for goal scoring which comfortably answers the confused souls who feel the need to ask "what is he actually good at?!".

3550~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/why-manchester-united-must-persevere-under-performing-depay#:GsUON97T7oHlpA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features...severe-under-performing-depay#:GsUON97T7oHlpA</a>

Actually a non-bashing fairly decent article.

3551~~~
This bulking up thing is odd, he was well more than bulky enough to begin with.

3552~~~
In the Summer I stated numerous times that Depay was not a ready made, top of the line player. Certainly not in the same class as Di Maria.
And that for this season at least, A.Young would be first choice LW, with Depay playing if Young is injured (or in low key games).

Am I worried for Depay? Nope. I expected this sort of performance and feel that he will need the whole of this season to adapt to this league.
The only thing that could be a worry is attitude. If his attitude (like Di Maria's) becomes a problem, he'll become a fringe player and then get sold in a cut-price deal. Just as we saw with Di Maria.
It really is up to Depay, how this turns out. If he shows a good work ethic in training, he'll eventually get game time and the opportunity to prove himself.

Depay has been terrible (sorry guys, but its true) and as a result has been benched until further notice. He could yet have a stellar 2016. Or he may go in the same direction as Di Maria. Only time will tell.

3553~~~
187 pounds! That would make him a light heavyweight boxer. He isn't even tall. Maybe he is struggling to adjust to the weight gain.

3554~~~
He just looks far to big and stocky. As you say, he looks more like a boxer then a footballer atm. And it looks to be effecting his pace and mobility.

3555~~~
No, I'd honestly rather sell him than pointlessly loan him to Watford or Newcastle.

3556~~~
wasnt saying he wasn't talented, he obviously has talent... i was saying that scoring goals in the dutch league doesnt mean your gonna be a success in the premiere league.

3557~~~
Looks like he'd be a fairly handy Rugby League winger. Those shoulders would put you on your arse if they charged at you.

He has a similar build to Shaqiri, who also seems a little too heavy, and not quite as nimble as you'd want a winger to be, which is arguably what has held him back from his reaching potential. They're both in great shape obviously, but they'd be better if they were a little leaner.

I've always thought the "needs to bulk up" was BS anyway. Players are punished more often than not for out-muscling their opponent these days. Agility is a much more valuable asset.

3558~~~
Remember Obertan? He was never going to be good enough for United, but once we bulked him up, he wasn't anything like what he was when he first came to United, even when playing with the reserves/u21s.

3559~~~
I try not to.

3560~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3561~~~
I said he was too stacked ages ago and got riduculed by cnuts on here.

Cnuts!

3562~~~
Would love a goal and see the U-turn by some fans. He will provide so many knee-jerk reactions in the coming years.

3563~~~
Yeah he looks too much like a bodybuilder. Too front-top heavy. 

Zlatan's a 95kg monster (and so was drogba) but his pecs, shoulders and arms seem fairly lean.

3564~~~
He'll score tomorrow.

3565~~~
That argument does not hold considering the number of players that were successful in the dutch and and experience greater sucess in other top leagues like Spain, England and Italy.

3566~~~
Certainly showed a lot of promise in his first months, not the 'been shit for us since day one', he's hit horrible form and the question is how will he get out of that. <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_o5Byisjio?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3567~~~
I hope he grabs this opportunity with both hands and shows what he is capable of.

3568~~~
I'm taking a punt on him as my fantasy captain today. I need something special after neglecting it for the last couple of months and falling behind. Come on Memphis and surprise us all!

3569~~~
I believe in the boy...

3570~~~
He's currently very slow in everything he does, needs to be much more explosive in his turns and dribbles.

3571~~~
He's too heavy, it's that simple.

3572~~~
This. He needs to lay off the gym work, a Nani physique would suit him better.

3573~~~
Nani got a bit too bulky in his last seasons as well.

3574~~~
Think they all probably want to match the Ronaldo build forgetting he's 6ft1 and can distribute it a bit better.

3575~~~
Today is very important for him to have a good performance (assuming he starts). If he is poor again and ends up being hauled off for a half-fit Wilson, I wonder how long he'll have to wait for another start.

3576~~~
Hope he scores. Has all of the ability, just needs to adjust his game and mature.

3577~~~
Today would be a good day for him to regain some form with a goal or an assist. Won't get a better opportunity.

3578~~~
Needs a good game badly.

3579~~~
Big chance today for him to be the main man, hopefully he can produce a performance.

3580~~~
He's got a great chance today. We really need a big performance.

3581~~~
The sideburns are back. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

3582~~~
Really hope he turns it on today. If we can get him, Martial and Januzaj all to achieve their potential we're in for an absolute treat for years to come.

3583~~~
Defensive work rate seems to be up a notch today.

3584~~~
Very good for him !

3585~~~
Lovely finish <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3586~~~
Well done Memphis lad. Well fecking done!

3587~~~
Viva Memphis. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

3588~~~
Goal number 5 of the season. Well done Memphis.

3589~~~
What a great finish just what he needed, hope he bags another now.

3590~~~
Really good finish.

Always said people are far too harsh on him. Glad he's scored.

3591~~~
... He'll score 3 goals today.

3592~~~
Sage

3593~~~
delighted for him, I hope today will be the making of him. Long way to go yet though...

3594~~~
Really happy for him, the guy has had a rough season so far.

3595~~~
Grew myself a pair of chops this week, similar to Depay's....

Probably what spurred him on tbf

3596~~~
His finishing has been really disappointing so far considering it's supposed to be the strongest aspect of his game, but that was a brilliant finish.

He's mostly disappointed me so far but every now and again shows things like that that makes he think he does have the talent to make it here.

3597~~~
Get in Memphis, chuffed for the lad.

3598~~~
Good half from him!

3599~~~
Good game so far, happy for the guy.

3600~~~
Well done. Looked positive, always looking to try and go forward. Nice finish too.

3601~~~
Early days but that was much better.

3602~~~
He's worked hard.

3603~~~
Delighted for him, good goal. I hope nobody expects that to be a huge turning point though. Confidence doesn't appear to be the problem, so I think its still going to take time for him to adapt, but it's encouraging to see signs.

3604~~~
Going to make life tough for LvG if he keeps this rhythm up.

3605~~~
Probably our best player in the first half, IMO, I like what I am seeing so far.

Really like the looks of him and Lingard up front, their movement is great.

Btw, he should have tried to chip the Gomes, no need for passing there.

3606~~~
Stepped up when we needed him. Like he did to fire us into the Champions league.

Just needs to carry on what he's doing.

3607~~~
Took an unnatural amount of stick which is expected from the Caf in the past month or so. Good for him to score.

3608~~~
Maybe he shouldn't be considered as a wide player, he looks better suited to a striker role.

3609~~~
Im a fan of his, but he was genuinely terrible. The writing off of him was a bit ott tho.

3610~~~
Shouldn't be considered in the position he's played for his whole career so far? Aye, that makes sense.

3611~~~
Well taken goal. His through ball should have been better.

3612~~~
I don't think it's an issue when people criticize a player playing badly, it's when people come out with a "I can't see what he's good at?" stuff that is genuinely confusing. He's a 21 year old who has moved to a vastly higher level, but has also shown that he can score bucketloads of goals.

3613~~~
Should have sent him on loan...

3614~~~
His movement in the box is always a threat. He'll always provide an option, often our problem has been to few players filling the box. He's hungry for goals and we need that, hopefully this first half goal and performance will give him another run in the side.

3615~~~
Hes very inconsistent throughout matches, but the one constant is the quality of his movement. I've argued this all season and I genuinely believe he has some of the best attacking movement anywhere in Europe. 

He was positioned exactly where a top centre forward should be for his goal. Right between the centre halves.

3616~~~
Memphis is having a stormer. He's definitely better through the middle, as opposed to out wide.

3617~~~
I do not particular care about his performance today as he will not be our striker in the long run. The goal should boost his morale, but he needs to remember that playing as a winger/attacking midfield rather than a striker requires different efficacy. I rather have seen Wilson up top and Depay scoring in the attacking midfield role.

3618~~~
Today's performance means a lot, doesn't matter where he plays as long as he gets his confidence back.

3619~~~
He's that cnut in the playground who never passes and everyone hates but you grudgingly still pick first 'cos he's quite good, isn't he?

3620~~~
He's not good enough to be this selfish.

3621~~~
He looked dangerous all game long, that's the least we expect of a United number 7,good times.

3622~~~
I seriously don’t think he played out wide for them. He doesn’t look like winger at all, but as a striker he can be quite good. 

True. 

I seriously doubt confidence is the problem.

3623~~~
It really is.

3624~~~
This thread would be a lot different if we didnt get the late winner. 

Should have picked out Blind who you would fancy to score to make it 2-0.

Still a good performance.

3625~~~
He is a difference maker. Someone who can get a goal/assist out of nothing.

Clear he isn't a striker though.

3626~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Pretty much.

3627~~~
He still makes a lot of silly mistakes but his attitude was far, far better today. When he isn't sulking he's a constant threat in behind. Lingaard is similar but there's an obvious gap in quality between the two.

3628~~~
His ability is greatly increased by the fact that lingard isnt so static on the other side.  Whenever mata plays in the right; defending against memphis is so much more easier.

3629~~~

3630~~~
Too much you mean? Personally I think he is a selfish player. Wants to hold on to the ball far too much and loses it too often, generally this season I mean. Especially when he gets in the penalty area, head down trying to take everyone on so he can score himself. Needs to look up more in the those areas IMO.

Great goal today though, rest of his game was OK.

3631~~~
His interview is pretty funny

3632~~~
When absolved of defensive duties he indeed looks a lot better, fair play to him, took his chance today. Very good taken goal and set up Lingard about 10 minutes later.

3633~~~
I dont think he was good today, but that was expected. He was smarter in his choices, less selfish. Scored a nice goal. 6/10

3634~~~
Selfishness and confidence are two different things though.  He is a selfish player and will try difficult things regardless of how he is playing. when he's confident those risks pay off.

3635~~~
He and Lingard linked up very well, add Martial to mix... and you have pace, pace and pace!

3636~~~
The guy created several chances and you call him selfish? I want him to take his chances in one-on-one situations, that sometimes means being selfish. And him holding on to the ball was often him just trying to pick a good pass, which he more often than not did. He had a great game, finally, there's nothing else to add to it.

3637~~~
The selfish criticism is a bit weird after that game, he laid Lingard in a number of times.

3638~~~
5 goals this season with some worldies in there. Not bad.

3639~~~
I agree, I pointed this out a while ago that he should be relieved of defensive duties and be given a shot upfront, he did play a few games for PSV there and when he played outwide he normally stayed forward and doubled up as the second striker.

In the future, I'd love to see

Martial/Wilson getting forward to support the striker, Januzaj covering the void left behind and Pereira joining the attack.

3640~~~
Great take for the goal. Good first half performance.

He hangs onto the ball too much for the pace of this league though.

3641~~~
His best PL performance for us. His decision making is still pretty bad at times, but hopefully that will improve over time

3642~~~
Very poor other than a great finish for the goal. About the best I expect from him at this point

3643~~~
Good performance. Could have done better in the final third on a few occasions but generally very bright and full of goal threat. Happy for him.

3644~~~
He wasn't very poor. Not a chance.

3645~~~
What even is a good performance anymore?

3646~~~
He was hardly very poor aside from the goal, that's just harsh. He was almost always a threat and went past players, something he's been heavily criticised for.

3647~~~
Did well today overall. Very nice finish for the goal.

3648~~~
Very good performance overall, especially the first half. The second half wasn't quite as good but he still played some very good passes, just sometimes gave the ball away needlessly. Very encouraging though, and more along the lines of what most were expecting from him.

3649~~~
Think we saw a mix of his best and worst today. Some great technique (and a great finish) and some awful decision making in the final third. The latter can be worked on though, which is good.

3650~~~
great finish. rather he not have the time to think and dribble. centrally he was better than playing wider.

3651~~~
I was also surprised how well he handled himself physically against the central defenders.

3652~~~
Created one chance today according to Whoscored. But I was talking in general, not about today specifically. He scored and we won so it doesn't matter.

3653~~~
So glad for him. Definitely needed a goal. Should hopefully boost his confidence. Had a good game today. Very well taken finish.

3654~~~
I'm not. He's a tank!

3655~~~
Nonsense. He was very good. 

Our best player. 

Agree with those who are saying it seems a confidence thing.

3656~~~
I thought he looked very good. Even the so-called bad decision making in the final third is being overstated in my opinion. His shooting radar was a bit off, but I didn't really have any problem with any of the shots he tried. He also slipped a nice pass into Lingard that would have been a goal if not for a smart save from Gomes. I'd be tempted to keep him in the 11 and try to build off this performance.

3657~~~
He consistently wasted our attacks insisting on coming inside onto his right foot. His crosses were also poor

Clearly none of our attackers were our "best player". Watford's were better than ours

3658~~~
A mixed bag from him today, but had more good touches than bad.

Hopefully this will cause his confidence to soar and give us better performances for games to come.

3659~~~
Could have punched him when he dallied on the ball at the end when played in whereas if he cut back and passed it two yards to his right someone had a great position.

Other than that much, much better from him.

3660~~~
Why? Because Deeney smacked a few awful shots straight into De Gea? Watford were awful for the majority of the game and their attackers were a major reason as to why.

3661~~~
I thought he did well after a difficult few weeks for him, he took his goal well, was constantly involved in our attacks and created 2 or 3 good openings for others.

3662~~~
Yeah, that fecked me right off. I think it was Morgan on the edge of the box.

3663~~~
Very well taken goal and a much better all-round performance.

3664~~~
Thought he was very good. I'm glad the lad stepped it up when we needed it the most. Could do wonders for his confidence and should start against PSV as well.

3665~~~
Had plenty of more dangerous and great passes though, hence it was odd to criticize that aspect of his game today. It's not like it hasn't been pointed out a ton of times already.

3666~~~
Weren't able to score in open play, any chance they had have smashed straight at DDG but played better?

3667~~~
Memphis! Good today.

3668~~~
Encouraging stuff, looked dangerous throughout and was definitely an improvement.

3669~~~
Really encouraging performance.

The finish for the goal was superb and that pass to set up Lingard early in the 2nd half was fantastic. 5 goals this season, not bad considering he's been struggling.

Much more like it!

3670~~~
It's not just a confidence thing, it's an adjustment thing. When he played in PSV, especially last season he could bully defenders physically. He was also the number one player in the team, that they tried to get the ball too. He needs to be given time to adjust. It took Evra about 7 months, even Hazard took nearly a season. Once he gets into his rhythm physically then the mentality and confidence will follow and he'll start expressing himself properly on the pitch. All things considered and he's not fully upto speed yet,  he's scored 5 goals. Once he starts dictating play then he'll be fully up to speed.

3671~~~
Hard to say as both Rooney and Martial should be back for then but I'd start him

3672~~~
If they're both back I can see Van Gaal dropping Mata and going with Lingard and Memphis out wide.

3673~~~
Yeah that's what I'd probably do.


Good front six there who can change around.

3674~~~
Played well I wouldn't be against seeing him play as a forward again.

3675~~~
Best performance for us, barring games against shit Belgian teams

3676~~~
Looks good. Mata has been poor and deserves some time on the bench anyway.

Memphis also knows this PSV side inside out and already proved it with his goal against them, so his return to form comes at the right time. Hopefully he keeps it up.

3677~~~
Everton away.

3678~~~
Better than missing the goal or losing the ball because you insisted on coming onto your right foot 90% of the time

8 times Depay lost the ball with poor touches, 4 times he was tackled. Thats a vast amount

3679~~~
He didn't even play in that game.

3680~~~
Redcafe just seem to have it in for him. 

These same fans also complain of our possession football, then when there's a player (Memphis) who tries to do something, they complain. Can't win.

3681~~~
Ffs, lost my bearings completely.

3682~~~
Or Nani

You want players who try something and have a decent amount of success. Thats when you accept the balance that a player is going to lose the ball or mess up your attack a bunch of times, but also be that x factor to open a team up a few times and win you the game.

Depay had no success. He just lost the ball and didnt create. One great cross from Ander putting a chance on a plate for him and Depay did very well to direct the ball into the net. But even that wasn't him "trying something", it was a finish from him being where he should be when playing as a striker. Credit to him for being in the box and finishing well but he could have done that without losing the ball 12 times

3683~~~
Hard to believe that he is getting criticism after that performance, but then nothing on the caf should surprise me anymore.

3684~~~
Terrible analysis of his performance. You'd think he put out a Wayne Rooney 15/16 special going by this which wasn't the case one bit.

3685~~~
Good goal, tried things. But his decision making is terrible at times. Needs to act faster too. But he will improve slowly but steady.

3686~~~
Is it better than scoring and putting your teammate through on goal?

3687~~~
Certain people's agendas on here are worse than some English papers political bias.

3688~~~
Worked hard, tried to be unselfish, scored a goal. Yong and lernin'.

3689~~~
Scoring and playing for the team? Yeah thats obviously better.

If they had as many chances as Depay they'd have likely done more with it. Watford's strikers lost the ball 5 times combined and didnt have any chances from 7 yards unchallenged like Depay had

Yet Ighalo won a penalty against the team with the best recent defensive record in the league and arguably the best CB in the league, Deeney scored and had a couple of half chances

3690~~~
What were the other 6 occasions when Depay was in this glorious situation?

3691~~~
Depay didn't stand still the entire game and by chance the ball fell to his feet. He has these chances because of his movement, you can't refuse to credit someone because there isn't a stat for it. You keep forgetting to mention when he put Lingard through on goal  with a perfectly timed reverse pass too.

3692~~~
Had a very good game imo

3693~~~
Sky gave him man of the match...

3694~~~
First half I thought he was really lively, linked up well with the other forwards and took his goal really, really well. 2nd half he did tire a bit but he held the ball up pretty well and played Lingard in nicely. He does need to be a little more instinctive though when he gets his man 1 v 1, he takes a little too long to shift the ball and make his mind up what he's going to do.

That will come though, hopefully he will play against PSV and get to continue this good run. Unfortunately with Herrera being injured it leaves us with another lack of options.

3695~~~
He's really dangerous in and around the box, definitely looks better in the number 10 area rather as a winger IMO. He still needs to work on his team play, there were a couple of occasions when he'd decided he was gonna go for goal and that was that regardless of what was developing around him.

3696~~~
Was a typical Memphis performance.Dangerous when he got space but decision making a bit effy.After that terrible patch of form it's encouraging.

3697~~~
I thought he showed a lot more good today than poor. That is a real step in the right direction. He was called upon and took his chance pretty well I reckon. He's been got at in the press, not had an easy time. This is not an easy league to join, and perhaps his attitude hasn't been totally right. I think most players underestimate the Premiership. But this was a much better performance and certainly showed his talent is there. He'll learn and I predict will become a brilliant player for us.

3698~~~
Scored first goal, set up Lingard with what should have been second goal, worked his socks off for whole 90min, if that's not good game what is?

3699~~~
Very good performance especially considering he's been frozen out both at club and country level recently. Always nice to see an under-performing player come in and show they want to fight for their place. Think the goal gave him confidence and it showed. Tracked back better too except towards the latter part of the second half where we really started losing control of the game. Hopefully he can keep building on from here.

3700~~~
Played well. Won't suddenly start playing well every game but hopefully finds a bit of form. Saw this stat on BBC as well

"Memphis Depay had 67 touches - Wayne Rooney has had more in only one of his 11 Premier League appearances this season (68 at Arsenal)"

3701~~~
His confidence started returning after the goal. Offered us much more than the current Rooney, in his twin partnership with Lingard. Its a pity Mata slept through most of second half.

3702~~~
Slept through most of the first too tbf. Expect more from the senior forward.

3703~~~
Memphis was decent. Overall it was an encouraging performance with frequent instances of good movement and solid passing (particularly in those windy conditions). When he got the ball in dangerous areas he did mostly look threatening, and the venom/technique in converting those shots into goals should come with confidence, time and match fitness. The concerning parts of his performance (decision-making, chance creation, lack of control) didn't outweigh the positives from him. If he handled those better and didn't look 10 years older compared to Lingard in terms of pressing and defensive efforts, it would have been a fantastic comeback.

3704~~~
I had him MOTM.  He clearly can do more with a pacy winger like Lingard next to him.  Some of his decision-making was still off but his abilities are without question.

3705~~~
He has zero football intelligence. Despite his obvious talent, unless he can learn to release the ball quickly at the appropriate times, he'll never be good enough for us.

3706~~~
You should probably get on the phone to van Gaal and tell him.

3707~~~

3708~~~
How about we just give him a break, he was under a lot of pressure today and scored the all important first goal, not so sure many of our other players would have done if in the same position.

It does seem to me that some fans are ready to pounce on him at the first sign of a mistake, he is clearly talented as you say and has every chance of making it at United.

3709~~~
Yep, he can't win.

3710~~~
Indeed he can't. 

Bizarre conclusion to arrive at after todays game.

But I suppose Memphis bad-decision making is the trending topic these days.

3711~~~
Much better today, looked a lot sharper and less laid back. Bit selfish at times, when others were better placed, but you'd expect that of a player his age. 

Took the goal beautifully well too.

3712~~~
He looks like such an intuitional player, but he seems to overthink his play since coming here. He took every chance he had at PSV, shot from anywhere, which he can't afford doing here (yet at least..). Hopefully he is under a transitional phase under LvG and will come out combining tidiness with impulse.

3713~~~
Louis on today, does he mean striker?

3714~~~
It's funny, most of the talk before he arrived was about how we should be patient with him.

That hasn't happened, heh.

3715~~~
Was kind of like a half striker, half wide player. Had the freedom to roam and move around like Lingard did, with neither really being a striker. Basically we played with two false 9's.

3716~~~
Philosofee!

3717~~~
Goal with a pretty difficult finish, very good pass to set up a chance Lingard should have taken, couple of decent shots. Much better today. Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but I'm not sure why that seems to be the expectation?

3718~~~
For a player who's been widely considered disappointing by all, he still somehow manages to have the same number of goals and more assists than everyone's newfound darling Anthony Martial. At a similar stage of development and PL experience. Without being a striker. 

You can't help but feel that if there hadn't been any hype, or a huge transfer fee, he'd be considered to be doing alright.

3719~~~
Looked much better today especially in the first half, looked a little jaded towards the end but that is to be expected with him mostly sitting on the bench for the last month hopefully he can build on this and become a mainstay in ourstarting eleven.

3720~~~
I think it's more of case of some of his performances being really conspicuously awful. Overall he's probably doing OK and will get better, but when he's bad he really stinks the place out.

3721~~~
I think its mainly that Memphis has had some games where the basics have fallen to bits. Even in the build up to Rooney's goal against CSKA he was tackled and the ball squirmed to Carrick, rather than him actually intending to pass to Carrick.

That's why I was pleased by what I saw from Memphis today. The A's and B's of his game were back. His control looked assured, he was running with the ball rather than over-running the ball, and his shooting was mainly on point (not just for the goal - I remember him taking a shot from distance that bounced just in front of Gomes and could've gone in).

Comparing him to Martial, the main difference seems to be that Memphis is a more sensitive soul. When things haven't gone well for him early in games his confidence has visibly dropped. I hope he can work that out because he has the talent to do really well at United.

3722~~~
I'm not for a second trying to pretend he's been as good as Martial or anything, more that what the Caf currently considers apocalyptically bad isn't <i>actually</i>, objectively,<i> that</i> bad at all. I mean, even if he doesn't improve his game at all this season - which he's bound to do -  and just continues this current rate of return, we're still looking at a 10+ goal debut season, which is fairly decent. Not amazing, but definitely not deserving of the kind of batshit attitude directed at him throughout most of this thread.

3723~~~
As Van Gaal said it's his best position in which he played him for Netherlands, the robben role, I sense the change of formation until one of our strikers is fit to play. It's a bit worrying if it's the case, the interchanging with Lingard was really good to watch though, both players worked hard even though Memphis loked off the steam in the second half, hopefully its the match rhytm. I hope he will now put in as much effort as he did today.

One thing, he just need to work on his shooting which is too hit and miss, there was a good chance he created with his good movement but wasn't able to hit it well..

3724~~~
Some of the so called "fans" here should have a talk with themselves. It's getting embarrassing really.

3725~~~
Today's performance kind of made me wonder what a trio of Martial - Lingard - Depay could do. Everybody is interchangeable and if Depay had one thing, it's a good understand with Martial.

3726~~~
He is Nani 2.0. Will be loved by many, but also hated and used as a scapegoat when things are not going well. Personally, i love him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3727~~~
Judging by Van Gaal's comments it looks as if he'll get a run of games as the no 9. He looks more a striker than a winger to me with his strength and finishing skills so I'd be interested to see it tried. Martial is just as good on the wing where he plays for France as he is as the striker IMO. We all know Rooney will play regardless. I think we might try this if all of them are fit to play against PSV:

Lingard-Rooney-Martial
--------Memphis

3728~~~
Very pleased for him today, lovely finish too.

Hope he keeps his head down and stops wearing shitty clothes and hanging around with daft cnuts.

3729~~~
I think the difference is that he'll score consistently by virtue of his runs into the box and aerial ability. Nani had neither. So, even when he's playing poorly for 5-6 games he might get a couple goals to justify his existence. Sort of like Callejon seems to.

He's struggled a lot this year, but I haven't seen anything to suggest he won't be a 1 in 3 type goalscorer from the wing, which I think only Cristiano, Bale (sort of) Hazard and Pires (and now Sanchez) have done over more than 2 seasons in the Prem's history, unless I'm forgetting someone. He has a real desire to get between the fullback and centerback, he can score from crosses more than his height would suggest and if we countered more or pressed higher he'd get goals on the break, too. 

His overall footballing is a different matter, but I really do think he'll be a serious goalscorer for his position. This year, only Mahrez and Sanchez play the majority of their time out wide and have more than 5 goals. I think if Memphis had started every game he'd be around 4-5 instead of the 2 he has. Not bad for a 21 year old.

Long-term, we'll have Memphis pushed up out left like Cristiano does for Madrid or Neymar for Barca and Martial as the 9. The next big question is who we buy/develop to start on the right wing.

3730~~~
That could work but Van Gaal would have to allow greater movement and interchanging of positions especially between Memphis and Martial. Rooney looked like he was getting into some form and if that continues after illness then it would definitely work because he would thrive with the sort of movement these players can make.

3731~~~
I don't doubt his ability as a footballer. When i meant Nani 2.0 i just mean in terms of popularity and slander on these forums. He is just a kid and has already received lots of criticism on here and is like marmite. Either you love him or hate him. I think every successful club needs a player who has genuine unpredictability and can just blow a team out of the water in the first 10 minutes of a game. Cristiano had it, Nani had it for a while and i think Memphis has it too.

3732~~~
Really happy with his response, you can see that he worked really really hard and is trying to rectify his past laziness.

He's movement was great and he played like a leader out there. He's finish was something too... Not easy to do that

3733~~~
I reckon we might continue with the 4222 and go for:

Mata Rooney
Martial Memphis

Mata got a lot of criticism for his performance but I thought prior to the formation change he was very influential and really enjoying his football. Memphis didn't really play as a #9 and I think he'd struggle if he was that isolated. With Martial up front alongside him I could definitely see him flourish.

3734~~~
That looks really exciting on paper

3735~~~
Well said. Many have taken leave of their senses when it comes to Memphis.. actively wanting a young player with potential to fail or refusing to be patient with him is bizarre.

3736~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-forward-memphis-thanks-10482637" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...hester-united-forward-memphis-thanks-10482637</a>

Typical fickle media.

3737~~~
Mad to think we should keep Martial on the left and give Depay a run up front, but could be the way to go for a while.

Lingard--------Herrera/Mata--------Martial
-------------------Depay--------------------

Would love to see it, plenty of scope for lots of interchanging also.

3738~~~
Fantastic response from him and a well taken goal as well.

3739~~~
Good post.
A new young player coming into the league and getting 10 goals and 10 assists in his debut season, that's not bad at all.

For me the frustration comes from his inability/unwillingness to keep it simple. He is having a bad patch for whatever reason, why does he just not go back to basics? Short passes, using his movement and making runs, keeping possession and tracking back. Maybe its a personality thing for him

3740~~~
Caf being a complete knee jerk once again.

Memphis is a good player with a lot of potential. He'll get plenty of goals and assists, yet people will want him out the team for far less productive players.

Similar to AdM situation of last season.

3741~~~
I think he can become a great player for us, but is anybody else disappointed that he ultimately is a little sluggish for a winger? Nani was much faster and a more accomplished dribbler. He is a very good finisher though and has a good shot on him. Like so many wide players these days, he is not a particularly good out and out winger.

3742~~~
I dont think he's a winger, he's more a wide forward. He was lightening when he first broke into the scene tho, all these muscles have maid him heavier and slower. It would be better for go into a more athletic and slimmer build, to stay strong and fast. His strength has its advantages tho, he wins battles vs even CB's quite easily.

3743~~~
He's been absolutely dreadful. Either play him through the middle or not at all.

3744~~~
Sometimes very clumsy and poor, but some good touches and threat as well.

3745~~~
I don't see how he was good in this PSV counter attack. He's ruined all of ours tonight dawdling on the ball.

3746~~~
I think it's clear now that his physique is holding him back. He's slow in everything he does.

3747~~~
Agreed, our worst player. Again.

3748~~~
Fecking slow.

3749~~~
My mum is quicker than him. And she's slow as far as 68 year old women go.

3750~~~
He needs to bulk down.

3751~~~
Watford is about his level.

3752~~~
hes good in robben role but as a winger he fails to convince me completely, at least he tries this game but we dont have any real options out wide, in fact andy pereiras been decent there as well but id rther sub off rooney/bsti to ply him through the middle

3753~~~
Add to that, he loses the ball all the time by failing the simplest things. Awful one-one player who can hardly pass the ball at all. Not much strenghts in him.

3754~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3755~~~
Struggles more then you would expect to beat a man. 

And he plays too close to the touchline. Theres no need for him to be that wide when Rojo is providing good width. He needs to be moving inside sooner imo.

3756~~~
Well benching him didn't sort his form out, so I guess try to play him back into it. 

He's much better than this.

3757~~~
He hasn't been that bad, some sloppy passes and touches but also doing a great job with his back to goal. Anything bad he does seems to be exaggerated. Not a great game, not as bad as most here are making out either.

3758~~~
Subbed. What a shit game.

3759~~~
How the hell is he so slow? Has he got past the fullback once tonight?

3760~~~
I thought he was good today until this very second when i looked in this thread...

3761~~~
This, he's been involved in quite good moments of play especially hold up play because of his strength.

3762~~~
Aye he's been better than the rest of our attacking players but has come in for far more criticism.

3763~~~
No one going to acknowledge we've lost all movement up top since he's gone off? That Martial has been completely isolated?

3764~~~
It was more to do with who came on than who went off I think. Young did OK on the left but Fellani in midfield and then switch to up top destroyed the attacking 'rhythm' IMO.

Depay was terrible tonight.

3765~~~
Fed up with him and his attitude towards matches.

3766~~~
Was one of our better performers tbh. Was there for the ball to be played at in the first half. The moment he and Schweini went off we fell to pieces.

3767~~~
His lack of acceleration is really strange.

3768~~~
The agenda is clear.

3769~~~
Garbage tonight. 

Tried his hardest to waste any chance he had.

3770~~~
Really poor tonight but no worse than Lingard or Martial

3771~~~
I am lost for words how slow he was whenever he got the ball. Really broke the momentum of the movement as soon as it reached him. And PSV right back had the exact measure of him. I thought he should have been subbed at half time

3772~~~
Yup, typically it's been completely ignored despite being blindingly obvious, if it were Martial that got subbed and this happened this place would be going crazy.

3773~~~
If he keeps this level of performance up he could be looking at the quick departure route from United. Just doesn't look a United player at the moment.

3774~~~
The sad part was whenever he was one on one with a player, I had ZERO confidence he would beat his man.

3775~~~
You won't see the best out of him under this manager, the defenders will improve but any creative player will struggle because you can't be a free spirit under LvG.  We would never have had the pleasure of watching Giggs and CR under this regime.

3776~~~
Absolutely no worse than any of the other forwards.

3777~~~
BS. he can't beat a man one on one in acres of space ffs.

3778~~~
It looks quite clear to me that he needs to be as close to the goal as possible to be effective.If we keep playing him this way for 10 years things won't change imo.

Nah couple of good moments but he's the worst out of them except for Rooney.

3779~~~
They too are getting a deserved kicking.

3780~~~
Really, that's funny cause I watch him play against Spain and he was the best player on the pitch.

3781~~~
Needs to work on beating a man or making himself space as his repeated failure in these areas are overshadowing any of the good work he does. Made a few nice passes and showed decent movement but not many people will remember that whilst he is so easy to dispossess. 

We should probably focus on getting him on the end of through balls if we want to make use of his current strengths as he doesn't seem to have the game to be receiving the ball on the touchline. I'm still not sure what to make of him really.

3782~~~
He's an wing forward and not a winger. If we've bought him to play as a wide winger then it's bizarre because as watching him you can tell that's not his skill set.

We looked less likely to score when he went off imo.

3783~~~
when the feck was that ... I haven't seen him beat a man all season ..

3784~~~
Just needs time, he'll be inconsistent all season I'm sure, and our style under Van Gaal won't help a single one of our attacking players so we just have to be patient.

3785~~~
Had your eyes open, beat players with ease at the start. Went to shit later though.

3786~~~
It's a shame he couldn't push on from a good performance at the weekend but I guess that's what we have to expect from players like him, consistency will be lacking.

3787~~~
Had my eyes open? what king of feckin English is that? Brilliant, he beat someone for 5 minutes then turned to shit .... that's £25 million quids worth right there .....

3788~~~
He doesn't look like he has the acceleration or skill off the mark to play the position at the level he's now being asked to play it at, when he was central at the weekend and just had to concentrate of making runs and being strong he was more effective, when asked to make it happened with the ball at his feet he looks lost.

3789~~~
Dont know which king mate.. might be a queen. Hope you ever discover the word patience. You dont pay 25million for potential only to have made a judgement within 4 months.

3790~~~
What potential is that?

3791~~~
Never mind.

3792~~~
Whatever he may or may not become in the future right now he's nowhere near good enough. Young is comfortably better and has barely played on the wing all season.

3793~~~
When?

3794~~~
Exactly .... night night from a very cold Manchester

3795~~~
Brugge, Newcastle, Ottenham, Villa, not that the end pass or shot was good but he had quite good moments against their full backs. There's a compilation of him by HeilRJ of his season so far.

3796~~~
Has muscles, isn't strong. Loses the ball way too much. Can't take a decent corner.

The boy was terrible tonight and his unfounded ego coupled with his complete absence of tracking back makes it hard for the fans to warm to him.

3797~~~
We could debate his overall contribution which has been minimal but beating players with ease is not something he's capable of. Not even close.

3798~~~
He isn't taking anybody's breath away but the amount of criticism he is receiving is also unfair. He had good moments in the first half but progressively became worse. Its clearly a confidence issue for him as he is not able to do it against his previous team, where he excelled.

3799~~~
He cut inside a couple of times and got a shot off in fairness. Most of the time though he looked like he was playing netball rules when he got the ball.

3800~~~
Netball rules! Spot on that.

3801~~~
Does appear to lack pace. That would probably explain why LVG started his as the #10 in pre-season. He wasn't awful, but can still do a lot better.

3802~~~
Probably our best goal threat in the game...

3803~~~
meh - reverted to form

3804~~~
Felt sorry for the bloke... had a decent game up front, and then got shunted out to the left wing again... the place where he completely lost his form and confidence in the first place. 

All to make way for Martial, who clearly wasn't fully fit anyway.

3805~~~
I feel sorry for the guy because he seems to be trying too hard at times and beats himself up a bit when things go wrong. He's such a confidence player but doesn't seem to have inner belief, so one bad moment sends his game spiralling out of control.

I don't think this environment is good for him right now. The fans are getting fed up with what they're seeing and you can visibly see the groans getting to Memphis when he cocks up.

Having said that, I argued that I wasn't sure he was ever as good as made out when we were linked to him. There were many convinced that I was wrong, so I'd love to hear from them again just for reassurance that he isn't just average, as he currently looks.

3806~~~
I don't think there's any doubt whatsoever that he's better than what we're seeing. I mean he was the best player in Holland, and he can't perform against a Dutch team. That's a pretty good sign his form has fallen off a cliff

3807~~~
He's not really a winger is he? I mean, he can't dribble particularly well, and he's rather average paced.

His best asset seems to be his movement, maybe he'd make a better striker? He certainly looked better on Saturday in that strikers role. And he does have that bit of acceleration, off the ball at least, to get into good positions.

3808~~~
Offers nothing on the wing, just gives it away all the time.  For someone that is fairly stocky he gets bullied off the ball by opposition full backs far too often.

He's a young player, playing in a real league for the first time, in a team that's playing awful football.  If we used him from the bench it'd take some pressure away.  Young was one of our best players last year so its not like we don't have a better option ready to come in.

3809~~~
He can't beat a player to save his life. Disappointing in every game almost.

I don't know if he'll make it here.

3810~~~
I'm reserving judgement on this lad until season ends. But one thing is safe to say, I don't think he's anything special, like Hazard or that caliber, he's another good player, nothing more.

3811~~~
Van Gaal put all his eggs in the Memphis basket this season (foolishly, in my opinion) and it's not worked out. If we have to watch a frustrating developing young player on the wings, I'd rather watch Januzaj. At least he's done more in the Moyes season than Depay has all season.

3812~~~
Januzaj has far better general play and is more fun to watch, only that Depay now has already been as much involved in goals and assists as Januzaj has been in his two seasons here. If Depay were to kick on, and fulfill his potential he'd basically be a Ronaldo of less quality. His general play isnt special, he plays out wide but he doesnt really beat defender or create much but he has a knack of scoring goals and got good movement to get in those positions in the final third. Memphis also had a good finish at PSV, not too sure what happened to that as he should have had at least 2-3 goals more than he currently has.

3813~~~
I'd bring back Januzaj for competition for places, he'd walk into the current side. 

Depay has been a disaster so far, anyone saying any different has been watching someone else. Whether he bulked up too much I do not know but the fast pacey winger from World cup 2014 is gone. I still believe he has the ability, I just don't know if we will get the chance to see it at United.

3814~~~
Ah, Memphis is back to being shite, I see.

3815~~~
The annoying thing about this is that now that Memphis is having a hard time (which was always likely considering his age and him being new), we could use Januzaj out there. I've no issue with Memphis in the squad, but expecting him to be our Robben in his first season (especially after losing Di Maria) is downright idiotic on Van Gaal's part.

3816~~~
Not many are saying that. My issue with him is that Van Gaal is expecting too much out of him. We never relied on Ronaldo in his first season with us, and he looked a far better player back then than Memphis does now.

I have an issue with Van Gaal getting rid of alternatives the first chance he gets.

3817~~~
Yeah Januzaj is the answer, couldn't get in the United side prior to his loan and he can't get in the Dortmund side now.

The problem we are having for our wide men is they have absolutely nothing in front of them, their only means of creating anything is to try to take on a man themselves.  They're essentially having to run at a set up defense, there's nothing happening to get them on the back foot or stretch them and there aren't too many players that can beat a player in those situations. As soon as a defender has to cover for the early cross or the through ball as well as the potential of being taken on it makes their jobs a whole lot harder.

3818~~~
I don't think Van Gaal is relying too much on him. Prior to the Watford game, Memphis had spent a prolonged period on the sidelines.

Memphis is in the standard 'frustrating youngster' stage.

We need to stop using Ronaldo as a benchmark and let young players develop in their own right. Comparing to an all time great is counter productive.

3819~~~
Did you overlooked the competition for places part of my post?

And yeah I do believe he'd walk into our current side, we're lacking creativity, which he could supply. Regarding getting into the Dortmund side, I think there is far greater competition there.

3820~~~
Van Gaal loaned Januzaj out, has seemingly given up on Young at left wing, and persisted with Memphis earlier in the season when other players got dropped for far less prolonged periods of being out of form. It was only the need to play Rooney and Martial's form that saw him get dropped. One goalscoring performance later, he's back in the side, and not playing in the role he played in the previous game.

Read again. I'm not comparing him to Ronaldo. I'm saying we rarely relied on young players in their first seasons at the club, including Ronaldo.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football-oranje.com/man-utd-boss-louis-van-gaal-expecting-more-from-memphis-depay/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Also.</a>

3821~~~
Depay - plays well on Saturday as a striker (goal) = moved to LW
Martial - plays well in internationals on the LW (assist) = moved to ST

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

To be honest during the game, the times that they did briefly switch positions both players looked better and that says it all.

3822~~~
No but I did read the 'walk into our side' part which my post was directed at, and if he is going to walk back into the side it makes your competition for places point a little redundant. He made zero impact when he was at the club before he went out on loan, he's not going to come back twice the player after playing next to no minutes at Dortmund.

3823~~~
What I dont understand is how he can be brushed off the ball so easily looking at his physics

3824~~~
Doesn't seem mentally strong. Weak, slow, full of bad decisions and sloppy technical effort. I've never found much strenghts in him so I'm really doubtful about his future. I really badly hope I'm wrong. To be fair to him, we were even worse without him yesterday.

3825~~~
Being mentally weak doesnt explain why he can be pushed around like a little weak kid

3826~~~
Aye he's dross. I wonder why all the top sides in Europe were looking at him.

Memphis is clearly a very talented player.

3827~~~
He's muscular but not big (rugby player) so his overall body strength is shit unless he works on his legs and stature which he blatantly doesn't.
Maybe this is one for the protein powder thread people.

3828~~~
I can understand him being annoyed about being subbed, but when your time is up and the manager has made the call, get the hell off the pitch. We were already lacking urgency and players taking an age to trudge off when we need a goal really doesn't help.

3829~~~
Lack of balance, being big means nothing on the pitch if you don't have balance

3830~~~
He obviously has upper body strength and is not a lightwight. So I'd expect him to use his body much better

3831~~~
In football you don't need a strong body to win duels, you just gotta be very flexible in your movement and need to think faster than the other guy. Memphis is a little bit too slow in his turns and overall body movement.

3832~~~
I was hoping we'd see him up front again, and still hope he'll be given another crack in that position.

3833~~~
I thought it was completely unfair on him to shunt him back to the left wing again (the position where he has barely played well and lost all his confidence in the first place) - all in favour of Martial who didn't even look fully fit.

3834~~~
I dont know if you have already recorded the latest podcast. But if not, could you please work yourself up into a bit of a frenzy and rant about it for a few minutes? That always brings a smile to my face.

3835~~~
We're doing it after the Leicester game... so I'll probably have calmed down by then (though I suppose it depends what happens at Leicester)

Probably for the best too... If we'd done it as soon as we'd got home last night I'd probably have gone wild a few times.

3836~~~
yes and a lot of players havn't stepped up.

last season pretty much every league game Depay stepped on the pitch knowing he was the best player on it, this season he isn't. some players find it hard to adjust to that.

doesn't mean he isn't talented, just means he has to adapt.

3837~~~
Play him up front, Martial on the left and Herrera in behind. We are so shite that it's worth trying.

3838~~~
I think this is the game for him to shine, I expect him to start with all our injuries, Young most likely as a full back. And Leicester will attack us, he will probably make several good runs into space, we'll see if he gets picked out and if so he needs to take his chance if it's a clean one.

3839~~~
Should be given more chances upfront.

3840~~~
Good cameo from him. Think he can be better up front for us than on the wing. Would also mean to drop Rooney which I'd very much welcome

3841~~~
One of our more dangerous players when he came on.

3842~~~
Decent cameo but he should have been able to control that ball from the Darmian header much better. Martial would have scored imo.

3843~~~
We should try him and Martial up front, he seems much more comfortable there.

3844~~~
His movement made a difference even if he was still sketchy on the ball. Has a decent eye for a pass as well.

3845~~~
Very good development he's taking so far.

3846~~~
He's better than Rooney, so why not?

3847~~~
Looks like LvG might have been on to something playing him through the middle in pre-season. I'd rather persevere with him there than have Rooney on the pitch. At least with Memphis, he's making mistakes due to inexperience, with the end-goal that he will improve as a footballer. With Rooney, you're just hoping he's going to get back to a passable standard, even though he's been gradually declining since 2012.

3848~~~
Definitely looks a lot better up there as part of a striking duo, where he can drift wide, come deep or play up top. On the wing he looked a bit useless, so I'd definitely try to play him with Martial (and the two seem to have a decent understanding with each other).

3849~~~
I thought he did well when he came on, looks to enjoy the free central role.

3850~~~
Looks more comfortable central and near the goal. I'd like to see this tested out more and see if it develops.

3851~~~
Bit shit. Still miles better then Rooney.

3852~~~
Play him up top with Martial until we get an actual striker.

His movement is better than the others. He has a goal scoring instinct.

3853~~~
I'll keep saying it. He'll be very, very good and the future here is something akin to the the lop-sided 4-4-2 Madrid often played with Isco and James as the tucked in wingers:

Memphis---Martial-------
--------AM-----------RAM
---------CM-----CM------

3854~~~
Thought he was pretty decent. We looked better when he was on IMO and I would like him to start ahead of Rooney (but that obviously won't happen).

3855~~~
Put him up front and give him a good few games to get into it. He'll be ten times better than Rooney.... My gran would be on a par with Wazza though.

3856~~~
As far as impact subs go, he did quite well. As expected LVG would criticise him for not taking the chance and he did indeed does have to improve his touch which lets him down a bit too often, but he gives us more pace, goal threat and drive than Rooney. The cross to Mata was nicely worked, as was the little back heel/flick to the left back which but him in behind the defence. Also, unlike some of our players he has a bit of "spark" to his game.

Hopefully we see more of this extra eager mentality to his game than the low on confidence somber one we were seeing a few weeks back.

3857~~~
That was class.

3858~~~
Yep. When people can't see what he's good at, I'd suggest one of those things is innovative pieces of play like that which not all players do/can do, and of course goals, strength, pace etc.

3859~~~
Even if he has 10-15 truly horrible matches in a row, I'm ready to be patient with him because despite the mistakes, there is a great player waiting to develop.

3860~~~
As long as he has the mentality he's had in the last two games. There's been a buzz about him that he looks all the better for. Also, I think early on in the season he and martial seemed to be developing a nice understanding. That's something we should be looking to build on given they look to be the future of our attack.

3861~~~
I believe he should play upfront with Martial on the left.

3862~~~
Memphis has to develop a second move to beat a defender.  

Dropping the left shoulder then going right to set up the right-footed shot from distance is his only move and every defender knows it.

3863~~~
2 problems he had till he was dropped

 - Bad form/understanding of league/technical flaws
 - Lack of hunger/ Not trying hard to overcome any flaws.

We could wait for the 1st thing, not for 2nd.

After comeback, he seems to have got rid of the 2nd part to a good extent. Maybe those talks with Giggs helped him.

3864~~~
The 2nd part is greatly exaggerated though. I think it's him just being very frustrated with himself with things not working out right away, and then during games he loses confidence and it just spirals like that. Also he may have been adjusting to his body gaining quite a bit of mass too quickly (unnecessarily as well I might add).

3865~~~
The reasons might be many. But overall he looked like giving up rather than fighting it out to the plain eye. Anyways, he looks a touch better on that front in teh 2 matches. Hoping to see him rise in both confidence and the game.

3866~~~
He's a young player and he probably didn't realize how much of a step up was needed from him.

3867~~~
Yes, then if the drop has made him try harder, then good for him and us. Hope he comes good finally.

3868~~~
I'd do the same. He can also switch positions with Martial

3869~~~
Doesn't playing both him and Martial up front mean we'd be going in with this dread 3 man defence formation though? Because I don't envisage either of them as a number 10.

Or are we going 4-4-2 on the league? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3870~~~
Me too. Martial has had more impressive games on the wing than as a striker.

3871~~~
Martial' hold up play when the ball is played to feet is quality though even though we haven't used it much of late. Memphis simply doesn't shield defenders off with that ease, which makes this combination slightly flawed.

3872~~~
It's actually one of Memphis major strengths from what I've seen from him so far. And it better is. The guy is an ox

3873~~~
Tbh when I wrote it, I was only focusing on Martial and not really Depay. However Depay has a more developed goalscoring instinct at the moment than Martial so it's not a bad idea, he can develop the rest of his game.

3874~~~
Compared to martial? No chance. Up til the last few weeks where we've stopped playing those passes Martial had the biggest premier league defenders comfortably at bay with back to goal. Memphis is strong, but not got the same strength/quality in shielding the ball and holding defenders of yet. He also lets defenders get a foot in more easily.

3875~~~
Possibly. However, that could come to the fore even if we use Martial holding the ball up and Memphis making runs inside from left. It's worth a go for sure, as I'd fancy martial to skin his man out wide any day. But it'd a trade off.

3876~~~
Even if he is off form and his touch is off his movement alone causes problems for defenses, we looked better when he came on against Leicester and we looked poorer when he went off th3 game before.

3877~~~
Honestly don't know how this guy deserved any play. He didn't hustle at all, lost the ball frequently, and made multiple low IQ dribbles. We looked better when Rooney was on the pitch instead of him.

3878~~~
No.

3879~~~
May I just remind those who like to moan at Memphis that at this time in their Utd career, Memphis has a much better end product than a certain lanky bad hair Portuguese?

3880~~~
That could be true, but the guy has got to show more energy when he comes off the bench. Despite his efforts Rooney still looked slow and for a guy with pace to be coming off the bench, he should be hustling his ass off especially in such a crucial game like that.

3881~~~
The fans love a trier.

I too hope Memphis will improve, because a) he can and b) at the moment, he's not quite the standard of Man Utd first XI attacker yet. But the criticisms aimed at him from some of our fans have been bloody excessive, even downright absurd. When Ronaldo got here, we had a primed RvN leading the line. Now we have a certain 300k per week Sunday League player.

3882~~~
"Fans love a trier" That is true, but honestly you would be a huge liar to say that hustling your ass off in the last moments of the game and using your natural talents wont positively impact the game more than lazy lackluster player that only kicks gears when your play is improving.

He clearly can improve, but his lack of will can limit that.

3883~~~
I see it more as a tactical instruction tbh. Too often now we have been leisurely in our attack at the end of games even when losing/drawing. I think the players are instructed not to risk losing the ball that can lead to counters, which is absurd, mind you. We play with two holding midfielders and have the best CB and keeper in the league, we should risk the odd counters to try scoring.

3884~~~
I definitely agree with you on us on being to cautious in our team play. Our two cdms practically act like defenders and barely have the freedom to move around. However, by lack of will I meant that he should show more energy and more passion, especially when he isn't on his day, which is expected for a kid of his age. It may seem petty, but these are little things that he can pick up which will only benefit him in the long run.

3885~~~
I honestly think if you swapped him and Coman, he would be hailed as the next superstar, while Kingsley would be what Memphis is now for us. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3886~~~
He was superb when he came on, worked his ass of, looked quick, lively, made smart decision and responding the right way to his previous struggles. He has earned himself a start with his good cameos.

3887~~~
If only the others front players played as well as him would have been a easy 3 points, but they were woeful

3888~~~
Coman is a lot lot faster from what I have seen. Koman is more slender a built like a winger should be.

3889~~~
He completely changes the way we play when he's on. He's actually moving when we have the ball and creating space for others, looking like he's got his confidence back.

3890~~~
Good cameo when he came on.

3891~~~
Should have started. No idea what Mata is still doing out there.

3892~~~
Offered the pace and directness we needed on the right flank. A massive improvement from recent showings.

3893~~~
Came on with some fire in his belly and looked dangerous, him and Martial surely have to start up top on Tuesday.

3894~~~
He's willing to take risks. Even if they don't come off, for that alone he deserves to start.

3895~~~
I don't care if he'll be inconsistent. Start him on the left or up top alongside somebody and let him develop. He takes risks, can run with the ball, and look what happens when you actually try to pick out a man instead of aimlessly crossing. He's also got excellent movement and just gets in good positions. When so many others are pretty useless with their final ball, he shouldn't be overly criticized for his.

3896~~~
what a brilliant run.....more of the same please.

3897~~~
Great cameo. Now do that from the start Memphis and we're quids in pal.

3898~~~
Actually showed urgency when he came on, more of that please Memphis!

3899~~~
Fellaini will be dropped for the Wolfsburg game and Menphis will come in. He won't play as well, then he'll be dropped for the following game and Fellaini will return. 

LVG works game by game, which is incredible for someone so versed in the philosophical rigours of the game.

3900~~~
The style of play suited him more than usual. The transitions of play were quicker, less emphasis on absorbing possession, we just got the ball wide and ran at them. That game was tailor made for him to start in. It's no wonder he had such an effect when he came on. It was much more open than we're used to seeing when United play.

He looked fired up too. He worked hard, won the ball back a couple of times, did the dirty work and had a real go at his opposite number. He was a few inches away from having an assist.

3901~~~
A nice glimpse of the player he should eventually become. A bit of added tenacity today which I haven't previously seen and he managed to up the tempo of the entire team.

3902~~~
That's the version of Memphis I want to see every time he takes to the pitch. He gave everything, looked a threat every time he had the ball and should have left with an excellent assist for Martial.

3903~~~
That was one of the few positives today.

Showed real quality, and also hunger which has been somewhat lacking in his game.

He was buzzing around and won the ball back a couple of times. Unlucky not to set up a goal.

3904~~~
Loved what I saw.  Maybe the time on the bench allowed him to get his head straight.

3905~~~
Will start the next game for sure.The concern is whether he can keep the same level of performance when he starts - when he has to deal with fresh legs instead.

3906~~~
Excellent today, pleased for him.

3907~~~
One if his most reassuring performances so far. That dribble was quality. Got stuck in a bit too.

3908~~~
The real Memphis shone out today, we need that side of him regularly and we will look dangerous again. LVG please just play him, he might not excel every week but the more he plays the better he will get IMO.

3909~~~
Very good stuff. If he can do this regularly, I look forward to him, martial and Lingard playing with a high tempo over the next few weeks.

3910~~~
First time I've been positive about Memphis for a while after today's sub appearance. 

Played like someone with something to prove. Hopefully if he gets a start he'll grab his chance and not be so poor again if he gets back in the team. 

Hopefully his stint as a sub will have made him wake up and realise he's not going to get in the team purely on his reputation from last season.

3911~~~
Looked very lively and creative when he came on, hopefully this is just the start of his good performances again

3912~~~
But the amount of run ins behind, the amount of one twos being played across the box, I feel as if Memphis would have absolutely feasted on service like that.

3913~~~
Memphis is a quality youngster, his runs are great and he is always trying something. He struggled in his first months but there is a player in him.

3914~~~
I'd still love to know why - after playing well in a game up front for us, he's not been given a chance there since...

3915~~~
The one positive today, basically. Showed great desire and ability to get past people we've not seen from him for a while.

3916~~~
Looked fantastic. Time to put him back in the starting 11 and see if he can push on.

3917~~~
This, he can be great player for us.
Can't wait for the moment he is back in the first 11 and start playing like i think he can.

3918~~~
I had him in my starting line-up for the game. I thought he'd done enough recently to earn a start and his cameo performance confirmed that again. Was really positive and willing to go forward. Should be ahead of Mata at the moment.

3919~~~
Get him on against Wolfsburg that looked alot more like the Memphis we have been waiting to see was very happy with his wee cameo was the best on the park for that 20 minutes or so.

3920~~~
Hopefully a very good one too. He is the sort of player who deserves a lot of patience from fans because his potential is really high.

3921~~~
Excellent cameo from Memphis. Get him consistently in the side ahead of Mata please.

3922~~~
Of course he deserves loads of patience. It's not easy to find a wide player who is strong, can put in a good cross, is skillful on the ball, and has a natural gift for goalscoring. The kid was top scorer in the Dutch league at such a young age and lead his team to the league title. How many players around the age of 20 are currently doing that? He's obviously got a nose for goal, and some ability to take responsibility.

3923~~~
Agreed. Memphis was the biggest bright spot of the game for me. Just a shame he struggled from the start in his last match. If he can string a run of good games together over Christmas then I reckon he could nail down a starting spot with a bit of allowance for his inevitable inconsistencies.

3924~~~
Very pleasing and positive cameo. Sort of showed me glimpses of the player I thought we had signed!

Hope he kicks on from here.

3925~~~
That dribble when he set up a chance for Martial was exactly what you would expect him to do regulary. Of course, he doesn't have to dribble past three players and put it on plate for our forward in every attack, but creating something out of nothing at least one or two times per game is I think decent expectations from any winger playing for top team. 

I don't expect him to have great final ball yet but I expect him to at least get past players bit easier than he did this season so far, final ball will eventually come with years.

3926~~~
Memphis is back from the start <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

3927~~~
really hope that resting him was good for him and he can put in a shift today. God knows we need it.

3928~~~
Kinda hope he's up top with Martial on the left.

3929~~~
hope he has a great game! Mata in the middle seems also positive to me for both wide players but I believe Jesse might interchange with Juan a lot, we lack a bit of mobility in the middle so would be actually nice to see Jesse in the middle pulling strings

3930~~~
Zero value player.

3931~~~
Invisible, hardly beat a man today.

3932~~~
"Hardly" is a generous descriptor.

3933~~~
Either let him play more centrally/close to goal or bench him.Not a winger.

3934~~~
He's worked hard but really struggles playing wider.

3935~~~
He's absolutely unable to beat a man 1 on 1, which in the position he plays is a pre-requisite. Im concerned to be honest, because we purchased him as a winger/wide forward and its looking like his skillset is as a CF.

3936~~~
I'll say it again: a fraud.

3937~~~
I still think it's way too early to judge him fully. He's had some decent games and does have potential, but is incredibly inconsistent at the moment and is having too many games like this one where he doesn't make much of an impact out wide and looks quite average. Hopefully he'll improve though.

3938~~~
I think we really should count him as either a forward option or a backup winger from now on.No middle ground.He just doesn't have "it" at winger position it's not even the matter of form or adapting to the new football environment.Just not his position really.

3939~~~
Not even as a backup winger, he simply cant play there its bizare.

3940~~~
The problem is non of our current wingers are good enough to be counted as anything more than backup.

3941~~~
Don't think he can play as a winger really. His strengths are his movement and quick interplay and usually his goalscoring, not dribbling past players 1 v 1.

3942~~~
He's easily the worst though so it's just a matter of picking the best option out of what we have and I don't think he's the one.

I think he can cause some havocs from the bench when the defenders are tired but that's it.

3943~~~
His quick interplay is poor. He occasionally flicks it nicely, and that's about it.
He's a right-footed Hulk:

Pretty much looks crap every time you watch him.
Has a hard shot/ free kick.
Can't dribble, other than the very occasional run.
Is too bulky.

He basically needs to be running on the counter attack into yards of space, or striking the ball to be of any use.

3944~~~
Need to try him at full back.

3945~~~
Great play there.

3946~~~
I feel that if we can not fix Depay, their is no need to buy anymore attacking wide players under this management. They seem to become half the player they are when they join us. Di Maria and Depay are two quality wingers before we bought them and when they play for us, they look good for a couple of months, then they become average despite being very talented players.

3947~~~
Great play again.

3948~~~
Been very good this second half.

3949~~~
Yep, not a bad half from him, really. Too bad we couldn't capitalize.

3950~~~
If we give him the space to work with, to take on the defenders at speed, then he works. Our possession close play with the tight spaces being worked by passing is a waste of his skills.

3951~~~
All I'll say is he seems shite. Prove me wrong Memphis.

3952~~~
Good effort

3953~~~
Had a good second half after a bad first.

3954~~~
Not good enough. Doubt he will be.

3955~~~
A lot better in the second half. Far from perfect, but I felt like he certainly offered some sort of threat.

3956~~~
Wonder how he feels about his old club progressing in the CL ahead of us.

3957~~~
Good second half. A bit quiet in the first but he wasn't awful or anything. Some weird posts in here.

3958~~~
Subpar first half, although he was working hard, good second half.

3959~~~
I really fail to see why he was any worse than lingard or Martial today. against West Ham as well.

3960~~~
Doubt he cares much as long as he can get some more fancy grillz for his mouth

3961~~~
He has a very low footballing intelligence, he reminds me of Theo Walcott in this regard (certainly a few years ago), always taking the wrong choice.

Time and time again he cuts inside where it's incredibly congested and he has no room. It works when counter-attacking, but not this way.

Perhaps play him on the right, like a normal human being would.

3962~~~
A rather anonymous first half but was one of our better players in the second.

3963~~~
Aye, thought he was decent.

3964~~~
I think over the past few weeks I've 'got it' with Memphis.

He's trying things, he's working harder, he looks talented. 

No, not everything comes off. But you don't expect it to, but <i>this </i>is at least what I thought we'd get from Memphis and what I expect to see from him.

Hopefully no more of the games from the start of the season where he wasn't trying anything.

3965~~~
Not a great game overall but it is nice to see him showing intensity, desire and intent which were lacking up until Saturday. Not sure he is suited to the left in our system but as long as he remains as committed as today he'll earn himself a lot more patience.

3966~~~
His attitude has picked up on the pitch, as has his workrate and I thought he did well in the 2nd half, him and Martial as the 9 and 10 would be my choice for the next few games as their link-up shows promise.

3967~~~
He's like Nani, very talented and attacking but so frustrating to watch

3968~~~
I really think he needs a run of games, he is very tricky, strong, and can dribble past 2-3 players, shouldnt be punished for losing the ball to much, by being dropped for many matches

I think in 1-2 years we`ll have a very good player if he keeps developing which he will

3969~~~
He has to keep playing, he tries and excites tbh. 

Seems to be slowly getting his confidence back which is important.

3970~~~
My main issues with him before this month was his lack of effort. He was just generally very lethargic, but he has improved there.

3971~~~
I feel quite certain he'll make it at United. He's inconsistent currently, but is obviously really talented. Everything is going to click for him one of these days. Loving his hustle the last two games.

3972~~~
Inconsistent throughout the game, but very hard working and a lot of good moments as well. He'll make it, just needs to be stuck with and keep faith in him. 

Not sure if hes ever going to be a proper winger though. A wide forward is more likely.

3973~~~
He tried his best tonight and was very unfortunate on the free kick, it was a nice attempt considering how close it was to the goal. I hope van Gaal sticks with him now and doesn't drop him.

3974~~~
He wasn't too bad. A bit anonymous in the first but improved in the second.

3975~~~
I just watched the highlights again. LVG will kill him when they review the way we conceded the second goal.

Draxler is next to him when he switches the ball over to Schurle. Draxler then rans past him and Memphis is caught ball watching. The ball is switched back to Draxler, at this moment, Memphis could still have run back and put pressure on him, he doesnt. He runs back a little to have a great view of Draxler gliding past our non tackling defenders.

I know its a seemingly small thing, but its the small details that could win you a game sometimes. He should have tracked Draxler back and put him under pressure.

3976~~~
I'll need to see it again but I thought Darmian looked at fault for that. It looked like he was ball watching.

Edit: I see what you mean. Although I still couldn't blame Memphis for that. Draxler plays that pass from his own half and there were plenty of bodies back, including Darmian, to deal with Draxlers run. You can't expect your winger to track the opposition winger across half the length of the pitch.

3977~~~
I think he needs to play behind Martial if we are going top continue with the 4-2-3-1, he's not a winger and only works as a LWF when playing wide in my view.

3978~~~
Played well in the second half, beat his man, unlucky with the free kick, delightful little flick to put Martial through and was unlucky with his overhead kick.

I got savaged on here for suggesting he was lacking confidence, he seems to be getting that confidence back.

3979~~~
He'll come good.

3980~~~
Wouldn't mind seeing him get a run out on the right hand side of the pitch. Obviously his strengths for PSV were cutting in from the left but would be interesting to see how successful he could be going down the outside of a defender on his stronger foot.

3981~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G4cosK-76fw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Thought he played quite well during the week, hopefully his confidence is return and we will see a little more from the lad, needs to start against Bournemouth for me.

3982~~~
That was a very encouraging performance.

Used the ball intelligently, and was dangerous. The scooped pass setting up Martial was particularly impressive.

3983~~~
Yeah its a shame Martial couldn't have taken it first time. He worked had for the team too, won the ball several times.

3984~~~
He was good last 2 games.
He'll get there

3985~~~
His work rate has been absolutely fantastic lately.

3986~~~
Started really well, his confidence is definitely returning.

3987~~~
Looks like a player with something to prove. Showing a determination  and workrate that wasn't there a few months ago. He's looking promising and dangerous

3988~~~
Strong start for him, good to see.

3989~~~
People complained about him bulking up but it seems to be paying off, he's holding the ball up well and shrugging players off the ball.

3990~~~
encouraging start

3991~~~
He's been doing a lot better recently. This is the Memphis I want to see more of.

3992~~~
Suddenly looks really quick, confidence is everything in football. Seems to be running so much more aggressively and with intent - good to see.

3993~~~
Our best outfield player in the first half, glad to see his form improving.

3994~~~
Good half.

3995~~~
Clear improvements recently.

3996~~~
Looking bright today.

3997~~~
Special player in there. Waiting to burst out.

3998~~~
working hard. Maybe benching does  work after all.

We should try it with a certain no. 10

3999~~~
He will come good for us. Too talented to flop long term.

4000~~~
Been our best player by a distance.

4001~~~
He's been fecking shocking today.  Zero heart, zero character.

Not sure what he needs now, there's a player there but just doesn't seem interested, seems to have no competitive spirit at all.

4002~~~
First half he was very good, well down the list for worst player of the second half too.

4003~~~
His performance today was about the only positive to take away from this game.

4004~~~
Looked lively and occasionally threatening in the 1st half, 2nd half he was probably our worst player. Maddeningly frustrating to watch.

4005~~~
I think he's too heavy. He need to slim down a bit.

4006~~~
This. I called him a fraud at half time against Wolfsburg here but he seems to have found some kind of form since!

4007~~~
Thats a post which should go in the Mata thread.  Depay was trying to make things happen throughout. . Still frustrating but his fire for the game is back.

4008~~~
His second half was up there with one of the worst I have seen from a United player. Saying that, he looked dangerous in the first half but he needs to pick and choose his moments to try take on his man and when to release it. He seems to run down too many blind alleys, the talent is there no doubt however I think he may be better centrally.

4009~~~
He limped through most of the 2nd half. Why wasn't he taken off?

4010~~~
He doesn't have the mentality to take the game by the scruff of its neck when things aren't going well. If the team isn't playing well, his head goes down.

4011~~~
Good first half, picked up a knock pretty clearly in the second and barely had an impact after (like the rest of our team). Excited to see how him and Martial do under a new manager who picks the way the team plays based on the players he has, not forcing players to play a style that they aren't suited to.

4012~~~
Curious as to how he'll do under a new manager. Right now he's a bit shit.

4013~~~
Which is fair enough given he's young and still adjusting, same could easily be said of Martial.

If United were run correctly then Depay could have been taken off when slightly injured, Martial moved out to the left, and a proper centre forward brought on to make something happen, but we just didn't have anybody.

4014~~~
I like him- he's willing to take risks and he'll continue to improve. Let's show him some patience.

4015~~~
Much better performance tonight, but he could be a lot better if he simply did this:

4016~~~
Erratic, I thought he started very well but slipped into over complicating things and then faded, possibly due to the knock.

4017~~~
Gives the ball away a huge amount, doesn't look good isolated on the wing. maybe under too much pressure. 

Looks good in the final phase before a shot, and looks good when teams are a bit stretched. had 2 brilliant moment, 3-4 decent moments, rubbish otherwise

Hard to call this one

4018~~~
Behind Fellaini, he was our most dangerous player by some way. As I've said before, I expect it to be a while before he's up to speed with the Premier League, but I think he'll make it as long as we have patience and he puts in the hard graft.

4019~~~

4020~~~
He also worked his ass off, so I wouldn't call him rubbish in any way.

4021~~~
Not much help from his left back, Mata hiding. So the players around him weren't helping. For me he did well today.  Our team is very much a team that builds from the back and a total collapse in the second half did also starve him on having some time on the ball. His run and touch created a goal. Here's a guy who can actually make a difference, do something different from our dour football, and fans have zero patience with him? I can't understand it.

4022~~~
Best performance in a while, although he was very quiet and quite wasteful in the second half.

4023~~~
He started very well I thought. He faded after he got that knock though, which was disappointing. Is the least of our problems.

4024~~~
He really can't beat players can he?

4025~~~
I think he misses his buddy Shaw making those overlap runs, which is understandable.}

Another one I think were not doing any favours with. This is a season he should be rotating with Young as he finds his feet with us (whilst keeping him hungry to have more minutes).

4026~~~
He has good movement but everything else about his game is shite. Can barely run or beat his man or create anything. Young must be atrocious in training if he can't get ahead of Memphis. That or he's banged LVG's missus

4027~~~
Young lost his place by default. Absolutely undeserved. Not even coming off the bench when we are chasing a game and he could do a much better job than CBJ is just stupid.

4028~~~
Against Wolfsburg he bear 3/4 players.

4029~~~
He's a slower, more egoistic and less interested version of Nani.

4030~~~
Shocked at how bad his dribbling is. I thought he was a rapid inside forward who skinned people but at the moment he just does lazy tricks and gets tackled. 

He will learn though as he does have good technique he simply needs to learn how to apply it.

4031~~~
First step for Memphis is to lose weight.

Pretty simple. Sway the balance of strength training and cardio workout. Reduce calorie intake. 

Once he is lighter, I reckon he will be able to make more use of his pace and dribbling ability.

4032~~~
It's not exactly rocket science, the guy is overbulked. He has little explosiveness and agility.

4033~~~
Said it would be a problem even before we signed him. Shite defenders have no problem defending against him one on one.

4034~~~
Agreed, we need to find a way to make him understand that.

4035~~~
Lock him in a room and starve him.

4036~~~
He wants to look buff for the ladies though.

We have a difficult task at hand.

I reckon we need some lyricists to come up with a meaningful, yet empathetic chant.

4037~~~
He is very hefty indeed, he's almost too bulky which hinders his pace.

4038~~~
He's also a lot less talented then Nani.

4039~~~
His final ball is off most of the time, but at least he has been beating the right back more often than not and has shown genuine pace at times. Bit promising.

4040~~~
Yea he's been good. Exciting and inventive which is what you want from a winger. Need a bit more quality off his end product but I think that will come in time.

4041~~~
Looking much better, I noticed he's going on his left a bit more which makes him more unpredictable.

4042~~~
Better. Didn't fanny about as much, though there was still a little bit of fannying about. But most of the time, he just knocked it on and got the ball in. Some decent deliveries, but we're proper shite at attacking crosses anyway.

4043~~~
Probably our best attacking threat today apart from Young.

4044~~~
Eh? I thought he was one off our worst players. He is so inhibited in his play, despite seeing a lot of the ball... His delivery was poor, and his off the ball movement was completely non-existent.

4045~~~
Was our best attacker today. If he keeps this up he's going to be a very good player for us.

4046~~~
Not one of our worst. But he was so bloody predictable cutting in.

4047~~~
He's been getting better and better as the weeks have gone on, you can tell he's finally settling in. A goal or two in our next few games and he'll perform much better.

4048~~~
Well you have to ask what his instructions are.If he's cutting in all the time then he must be being told that

4049~~~
He has absolutely no help on that side. Blind hardly ever overlaps. Keeping that in mind yeah he's doing a lot better than before.

4050~~~
how about the far best player Martial? but Memphis was alright today..

4051~~~
We are so bad that  I can't even tell, which one of our attackers had a good or bad game.

4052~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I usually find one sticks out a bit but today I couldn't really tell. We may as well have had Bebe out there.

4053~~~
Still isnt making anything happen in the final third.

4054~~~
Produced enough out there on the wing. Not to blame at all.

4055~~~
Except he wasn't because he had the beating of Russel Martin on the outside numerous times. Did you even watch him?

Even when he gets by the player, he always has to cut back to his right, because he's so poor with his left.

Still not impressed. He definitely needs to slim down a bit too.

4058~~~
Was good today - can't believe some of the comments claiming he was predictable, I was sat there amazed at how many times he went on the outside and crossed with his left

4059~~~
Looked quicker, more agile and more likely to beat his man. Lacking end product, but I'm more confident that can eventually improve rather than the first 3 which are the key foundations for a wide man.

4060~~~
He has much much more to offer. He is still raw, but he has the attributes to be a success. Needs to bite himself into the PL and have that Ronaldo-ish desire to develop and maximise his talent.

4061~~~
He linked up well with martial earlier in the season. I still think we should be rotating between him and Young for LW to keep them both fresh and hungry.

4062~~~
He did beat Martin on the outside but he also cut inside just as many times and everytime it was the same thing in terms of our attack pattern.

4063~~~
I'm surprised with the plaudits he's getting, to me it looked like he was creeping back into his lazy ways again.

4064~~~
He's progressing.Still don't think his ceiling is that high like some believe, but he has a future at this club.

4065~~~
Memphis has a lot of potential, and many attributes which suggest he can become a very good player. At times, however, he simply doesn't seem to work hard enough. It's almost like he's expecting it to be easy.  At other times, it seems as though he's just not thinking the game well enough. It's far too early to write him off, of course, but I hope he can consistently find a higher level of play during the second half of the season.

4066~~~
A better performance then some of his earlier outings that's for sure. Sadly, it's overshadowed by the loss I feel.

4067~~~
If we played more direct, the likes of Depay and Martial wouldn't get doubled marked and would make their lives easier

4068~~~
I thought he was decent today, showed attacking threat overtime he received the ball in the final third. 

The stats above don't tell the true picture.

Amazingly, he actually dribbled past the full back a number of times with a trick or two but the following delivery was poor. The last few weeks though he has started to show the potential he has, much more positive and his decision making being miles better.

Still a work in progress though but far better than most yesterday!

4069~~~
This is an excellent point, and the reason Martial should be central. There is no threat in the middle which allows the opposition to flood the wings while they are wide. A threat in the centre would create space. (As well as needing to get forwards quicker)

4070~~~
I think a lot of people here really need to start watching him live since his movement is the best in the team by a mile. The last 3 matches i've been able to get to live, I've watched him pretty closely and he's made so many good runs and never been found. He's been trained brilliantly by Psv as he makes so many double or triple movements to make the half yard. He's made several excellent runs off the shoulder also and he's barely been found. He did well yesterday with regards to his dribbling but he needs to sort out his final ball. Of course, at his age, this is an issue you expect. His work rate off the ball defensively has improved greatly aswell recently to be fair to him. I'm confident in 2-3 years we'll have a brilliant attack if Shaw, Memphis and Martial can link up down that channel. It's just a pity that our #10 and #9 are passengers right now.

4071~~~
Was thinking the same... Last game he was absolutely alone on the edge of the area 3 times just waiting for a pass to be one on one with the keeper but the pass never came... Mata twice and Rooney once absolutely ignored him/ didnt see him at all and went for the terrible side pass instead...

4072~~~
He is still getting used to playing in a 442/4411 formation IMO, it's different than being a wide forward in a 433. He's usually used to running in behind and having shots on goal, rather than acting like a proper winger and staying wide, beating his fullback and whipping in a cross. He's clearly much comfortable making those little runs between the RB/CB and getting a shot with his right foot, it's just taking time to adapt his game. 

I do feel though that with Schweinsteiger returning we should play 433, especially when Shaw is back. It's just a shame we dont have another decent RW option for the front 3, Januzaj could have been that option but Mata/Rooney/Young certainly arent.

4073~~~
Significantly dipped after Shaws injury. That aside I'm sorry I'll excuse every single players performances to date under this idiot. Smalling is the only player that's improved under him. They others were either crap, decent before he got here anyway or gone backwards....

4074~~~
So he's got his car kitted out with his 'M7' logo now. He's not really helping himself dispel the thought that he already thinks he's 'made it'

I mean, this whole 'M7' thing, for a player who's barely done anything in his career, is incredibly cringeworthy in the first place.

4075~~~
Oh dear <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4076~~~
So?

4077~~~
He looks like a massive dick.

4078~~~
He likes flashy things, like many guys his age who've achieved much less in their life. 
I really don't see the issue.

4079~~~
So does endlessly criticising the players of a team you supposedly support but that doesn't seem to stop you.

4080~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Looks like I've touched a nerve here.

4081~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Has there ever been a bigger statement of hypocrisy?

4082~~~
Motherfecker just got rekt

4083~~~
It's like Cleverley with his "TC23" brand.

4084~~~
In tending to agree with others here when they Menton LVG influence on him. Seems odd how a player with massive potential who scored a lot of goals last year albeit in a weaker league has looked very out of sorts this season, obviously the league is alloy harder and we've had injuries but when you have players like Mahrez ripping it up when he doesn't have anywhere near the talent seen in Depay is odd.

4085~~~
Nearly as odd as that comment.

4086~~~
He looks like a striker to me, doesn't have anywhere near the pace required of a winger. May be Van Gaal had the right idea when he tried him out in the #10 role for the entire preseason.

4087~~~
He never had the best acceleration or agility anyway and all that extra weight he's added since we signed him has just made it harder for him to beat defenders imo.

4088~~~
Has anyone watched him whilst he was playing for PSV?  The thing with him is that he does seem to possess the technical skills but you are right, he doesn't seem to have that burst of pace required for separation from a defender.  He can't seem to beat the first defender off the dribble.

4089~~~
I'm so disappointed in him, I think his attitude is all wrong. I made a point of really watching him closely on Saturday, he was dreadful;sloppy in possession, not tracking back, weak in the tackle, slow reactions, poor crosses. I could go on. As I say I think he has the ability but it's his attitude that worries me, his head drops far far too easily.

4090~~~
That's because he is too muscular.

4091~~~
So much genuine material to criticise him yet people have to resort to pulling out logos he uses on his car. Who gives a feck?

4092~~~
He's been far better since he was dropped a few weeks back, but he has an awful habit of starting really well and then dropping off entirely in the second half. Definitely something for him to work on.

4093~~~
Mahrez is 24 and had only just started showing what he's capable of, Memphis has been touted as the player with a high ceiling and has been for a while. Memphis also performed at a very high level at a younger age. This season has been a strange one and I think mahrez will not turn out to have half the career that Memphis will have.

4094~~~
Mahrez has shown what his level <i>can be</i>. He's shown that his ceiling is at least this high - however the question that is asked is whether he can keep this tremendous form up, or will he level out a little?

Once Memphis has shown that he can do what Mahrez is <i>currently</i> doing in this league then your claim can be made.

4095~~~
Memphis needs to realize that this is Manchester United. You can have the talent of a combined Best and Messi, but if your mentality is not fully focussed on football and improving and one will undoubtedly find it difficult to adjust. Still plenty of time to improve.

4096~~~

4097~~~
Great to hear he is working on his speed. He has gone through a huge change in his body composition and is struggling to adapt, however it seems that he recognises what he needs to work on to improve. You can't fault his ambition and mentality

4098~~~
Hope there is, Memphis, hope there is. I've defended him ever since he came here as I don't believe he's as awful and hateul as people on here believe but the worrying thing is that him not being all that great for us so far looks like it's more of a case of lack of certain skills and attributes rather than just poor run of form. I'm not sure lack of pace or dribbling is something he will be able to shake off easily.

4099~~~
His average performances have had a massive affect on the overall play of United this season.

With the defence being so solid, if Memphis had been able to score or assist on any sort of regular basis all these 0:0 would be turned into 1:0 quite easily.

The attracting players have just been collectively so poor this year, it's really disappointing.

4100~~~
He has a big mouth already, sucking up to RvP when he was a noob in Oranje, now suddenly yapping about RvP "do big players play for Fenerbahce?".

4101~~~
Please tell the full story if you want to make a point.

4102~~~
Well when he first broke into the scène, he was pacey enough believe me. He was big already but perfectly in balance, now he's gotten huge and needs to adapt to that and try to improve his speed again. That will certainly come with time, he looked much faster last match for example, I remember a pass to the last defender from Norwich and Memphis chasing it, he showed genuine pace to almost catch it, left the right back behind a few times as well. He'll get his pace/explosivity back, if he keeps working hard.

His dribbling Im not sure, he's never been a Hazard or Ribery but he always had the right tricks, effeciency, explosivity and directness to beat defenders, but with the decline of his explosivity and confidence this season it has looked poor I have to say. I think it can get to a good standard but he will never be some ridiculous dribbler agreed. But to be fair, he has got time on his hands. Due to the lack if competition and his fee, there's already a lot of pressure on him and people expect the finished article. In reality, he's just 21 and has so much time on him to develop into a top or world class player.

4103~~~
I'll defend him and be a fan of him because I know he has the desire and workrate to be the best he can be.

4104~~~
Did he just walk up to RVP and say that, or was he provoked into saying it? 

No grown man is going to let snide comments slide.

4105~~~
They were training and Depay made a good move to beat defenders and then made the wrong pass to Riedewald in stead of van Persie. Van Persie then said to him, do you think that you're a big boy? Depay replied; do big boys play for Fenerbahçe?

4106~~~
RVP is a massive prick though - don't get the level of love for him at times, he had one good season under SAF then downed tools when we needed him under Moyes. 

Do people genuinely think Depay was bad against Norwich? I thought he was probably our best player on the day, looked like he had the beating of the fullback all day long. Can hardly blame our wingers for lack of end product imo because the difference between a good ball and a bad ball is quite often whether or not somebody gets on the end of it (I know it sounds obvious but think about the number of crosses on Saturday that drifted over our one centre forward but into a good area at the back post). With the lack of numbers in the box when we attack compared to opposition defenders it needs to be an unbelievable cross to create a chance

I think since the Watford game Memphis has performed much better and showed a much improved attitude. Some have said it on here already but I think we will see the best of him as a #10 or at least when he has freedom to roam around the front 4. I think given his body shape he is always likely to struggle to beat players from wide positions but his pace, power and directness would make him an ideal option centrally for me

Would love to see Depay #10 and Martial #9 with Mata and Lingard either side and full backs bombing on

4107~~~
That's what I meant, he was provoked by RVP into saying it. Depay isn't a 15 year old, he's a young man and has the right to defend himself when someone's being a dick.

4108~~~
But he really didn't, it was proven numerous times already, it was the injuries that simply struck him that year. 

And yes, he was bad against Norwich. It's fecking ridiculous that he's stealing the place from Martial on the left side (which is, of course, not his fault but LVG's).

4109~~~
Big difference to his time at the WC up until RvP's decline. He was telling the dutch press how much he adores him etc and whenever he put him in his place during training or hung out together he licked his spittle and rolled them arund his teeth savouring them like little nuggets of information to stardom.  

Now he warms the bench at United and thinks hes bigger than RvP. Dutch pundits and ex footballers already criticizing him for that shit when you compare their respective careers.

4110~~~
So? RVP was being a dick and got called out on it. Thats all there is to that story.

4111~~~
Lets see if he tries that with Rooney who thinks hes he big man when he's been playing worse than RvP. Be consistent about it, then you are a big boy.  Little sneaky shit.

Edit: he probably will. After the former finally falls out of grace with a sensible manager.

4112~~~
Not enough context to the story or how it all unfolded. The way it's told here makes them both look like dicks.

4113~~~
I like that interview, glad he acknowledged his pace was an issue. Settling in is not easy and the form of the team has made that harder, unfortunately. Excited to see his development once he's fully settled in and used to the pace of the league.

4114~~~
Okay?

4115~~~
Wonder how he gained 11 pounds of muscle if he wasn't pumping himself up at the gym...

4116~~~
Evidence suggests first impressions with him is correct. Nothing judgmental about <a class="username" data-user="1351, @Dans" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/1351/">@Dans</a> 's thread in the mains about him either with him driving his wagon full of m7 cum splattery signatures. Probably liked himself so much he orgasmed all over those seats. 

The good thing is that he will be as snide and sneaky once Rooney is finally losing his grip on the club when a new mnager comes in. Might fasten the latter's departure.

4117~~~
Easy. He is lying.

4118~~~
He necessarily changed his diet and/or his workout, so he is lying.

4119~~~
Well, exactly. But then you have to wonder whether he's lying about the body fat percentage thing as well. Did he just generally bulk up over the summer or something? I mean, it's quite hard to gain 11 pounds of pure muscle without gaining any fat in, what, 2 months?

4120~~~
He is a kid. Probably showing off and bragging. Take with pinch of salt.

4121~~~
It's a shame the senior players at this club aren't helping him out. When Rooney and Ronaldo were cutting their teeth in this league they had players like Ruud and Giggs around them to pick up the slack and help them through. 

Now players like Rooney are just making it harder for these younger players but heaping more pressure on them to perform.

4122~~~
looks to Rooney and thinks 'that's the level I need to aim for...'

4123~~~
Memphis has been with us a couple of months and was throwing stright into the deep end at such a young age, there was always going to be inconsistency, but I think he is gradually getting there, he is gaining a yard again he just needs to work harder and he will be back at his best

4124~~~
He read the caf and saw people telling him to bulk up, guess that didn't help this time. 

All jokes aside though, I do feel he probably hit the gym hard thinking all he would need is to he physically strong, but speed IMO is more important especially as a wide player. We've ween that with his back to a player/ goal he can handle himself, but he needs to move the ball faster and decide what he wants to do quicker. A lot of the time he loses it when he's just controlled it then looking for a pass/shot. 

Once he gets that though the worlds his oyster. Just depends how much he wants it.

4125~~~
It wasn't a last resort, it was just another thing.

4126~~~
Well said. Nice to hear some people tell it how it REALLY is. 

Mr Writer.

4127~~~
It is possible to gain that kind of muscle if you eat right and have all day every day to train

Remember in pre-season Memphis and Luke Shaw did a lot of gym work together, Shaw spoke about Memphis "being a beast" and helping him get into shape

4128~~~
Hope he posts a photo of something extravagant today so all the whoppers can come in this thread moaning. Shouldn't be buying things should be practicing his shooting!!!!1

4129~~~
Memphis was even worse at 10, there is a reason we tried that throughout the preseason and then quickly abandoned into the season. Even someone like Van Gaal who usually persists with his experiments gave up on that one quickly.

Watch his perfomances there again, you'll see. Terrible experiment ,he's not a good 10 at all and we have much better alternatives there..

He's either on the wing or on the bench.

4130~~~
That was his first assist in some time.

4131~~~
nothing average about that header fo' sho

4132~~~
That was just awful.

4133~~~
Comical.

4134~~~
Can we send him back to wherever he came from in January? On a free.

4135~~~
What an awful first season, I really dislike him as a Manchester United player.

4136~~~
clearly too heavy to fly

4137~~~
De Gea left him out to dry imo. Should be coming to help there. No threat if the keeper gives him an option, and no reason to stay on his line. 

Obviously should just clear it, but DDG deserves some criticism too.

4138~~~
Ditto, looks lazy as hell and doesnt seem to be able to control a ball

4139~~~
Dislikeable and fecking shit. Piss off back to the Eredivisie pub league, you fraud.

Stoke have genuine class like Bojan and Shaqiri and we spend £25 million on this waste of space.

4140~~~
Early days in his career yet. But he reminds me of Ryan Babel at the moment.

4141~~~
He can't dribble or feck all, he never beats his man.

4142~~~
Defensive mistake yes, but he can make up for it.

Knowing the CAF, expect to see the same sort of abuse that Smalling got when he got the red against City.

4143~~~
He really is a poor dribbler.

I thought he was supposed to be a good dribbler.

4144~~~
And here the overemotional people come again.

4145~~~
Looking very likely like another waste of money.

4146~~~
Was hilariously shite from him but the people asking him to be sent back need to give their heads a wobble.

4147~~~
Yeah, he needs to commit a bit more. He seems half hearted in effort.

4148~~~
Should never be in the LB posistion, Blind and LVG need to make sure of it

4149~~~
He's done more harm than good so far in his utd career, atrocious signing so far, I wish we had never bought him.

4150~~~
Glen Johnson is properly doing him in

4151~~~
Second goal partly his fault as well for not closing down quick enough. A massive fraud, a nothing player of mid-table quality. We should demand for a refund.

4152~~~
Needs to cut out the diving from his game.

4153~~~
Someone hasn't taken his medication today.

4154~~~
I am not his fan but that's incredibly harsh.

4155~~~
good assist today

4156~~~
Spot fecking on, an Old Trafford oxygen thief.

4157~~~
Should never be on the fecking pitch more like.

4158~~~
Looked like he tried to jump out of the way rather than block the shot.

4159~~~
Don't rate him

4160~~~
Talented but brainless. And to think we had the muppets on here throwing their toys out of the pram when Lingard was playing instead of him. No way does Lingard screw us with such stupidity.

4161~~~
What is he actually good at?

4162~~~
This is our #7.

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4163~~~
Fecking hell, the amount of people writing him off in here <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
Give the kid some time. He obviously has potential, and needs time adapting, and like every single other attacking player in our squad, needs a different manager. There's a reason that even world class players like Di Maria struggled at United. Even the best players around can look shite under Van Gaal

4164~~~
He has been here 6months and I'm yet to see one outstanding quality. One!

4165~~~
Watch their second goal again and his reluctance to put his body on the line is for the world to see. A talentless coward, that's who he is.

4166~~~
Yeah man because the rest of the team has played with balls. Notice a pattern? The entire team plays like fecking pussies.

4167~~~
Really? Where were all those other brave men charging the ball down with their neck outstretched from that shot then?  He's playing poorly in a poor side, it frankly rather childish the way you react to it.

4168~~~
Missing a header is bad, but it happens, what I can't understand is why the feck did he hesitate, he could have played it way earlier but he waited for their player to press him and then tried to play it back.

4169~~~
Playing on automatic pilot. Not good enough, needs to seriously improve on his decision making and awareness.

4170~~~
The header aside, he's been shit all season. Finding hard to see that he will ever be top class player.

4171~~~
Not sure how you came to that conclusion. I can't see anything in his game that suggests he either has potential or any real quality. I really don't know what our scouting report on him would have said. He isn't quick, he isn't strong, he isn't skillful, he hasn't got good technique, isn't a good passer, he can't cross, he can't beat a man...

4172~~~
but he told us he will be. And that header gets funnier every replay

4173~~~
Agreed.

4174~~~
Depay's next laces - To have a good game.

4175~~~
Should have sliced it out for a corner, or over his head for a throw. Not enough pace on the ball and too far away to even try to header that backwards.

That aside, he's not been our worst player today. That's not really a measure of quality, but I still think he will come good.

4176~~~
Confident is shot, simple as.

4177~~~
Without LVG at the club Memphis might not have the dutch connection to keep him in the squad...he might find himself gone if the next manager doesn't rate him.

4178~~~
I honestly wouldn't mind if for some reason he never plays for us again.

Same goes for Mata, Fellaini, Rooney, Carrick, Bastian, Blind and Jones.

4179~~~
I don't see Mourinho keeping him.

4180~~~
Back to a club that suits his level. Although paradoxically currently that's us.

And he's off. Shocking half from the whole team. Him especially.

4181~~~
Pretty useless player. Doesn't have many redeeming qualities.

4182~~~
But he can do all of that. He's just been very inconsistent with all of those things. Lack of confidence, and worst of all, the shit style that doesn't encourage any player like him. He'll need time to get it all to click, as it always happens with young players, but he has shown those things on occasion, just not consistently or all of it together really.

4183~~~
After making this interview, he had to have a great match.

4184~~~
When Nani or whomever was a bit ropey in their first season, we had others who kept him out, these days we're reliant on 21 year old Depay whos been playing in the dutch league in a do or die game away to Stoke, says a lot.

I actually hate Memphis just now, but I dont want to write him off completely yet.

4185~~~
I disagree. He's consistently shown he hasn't got any of the qualities I mentioned.

4186~~~
I do not believe he is naturally a terrible footballer. He is just being managed poorly, just like Di Maria when he was here at United last season. We need a manager that understand the infrastructure of good attacking football.

4187~~~
We'll learn more about him with the next manager. Not good enough so far.

4188~~~
He is like Balotelli but with even less quality

4189~~~
He was clearly very overrated. Down on confidence doesn't help. He has been shocking though. Horrendous today.

4190~~~
So bad today. So very bad...

4191~~~
Even the second goal he done basically just moved away from the shot the shit house.

4192~~~
Looks like a broke rapper, weighs as much as a a heavy weight boxer and plays like a donkey. Van Gaal probably deserves the sack just for buying him. Even Anderson had a good debut season.

4193~~~
He was shit, just don't see much potential in him.

4194~~~
Right now, it is hard to argue with any of that. He was awful

4195~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4196~~~
So much for his 'confident' interview. Just another crap PR interview. Show it on the pitch.

4197~~~
Get tis cnut out of this football club, he's clueless and as far as I'm concerned has no redeeming features whatsoever.

4198~~~
Bebe-esque today.

4199~~~
Putrid.

4200~~~
Was looking forward to seeing him after his recent interview, he sounded fired up...then his brain farted. 

LVG said his best position was central after his performance against Watford...hasn't played there since. feck up after feck up.

4201~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4202~~~
Been underwhelming but he has youth in his defence so time should be afforded.

4203~~~
Awful performance today.

He's his own biggest critic, I'm sure he knows more than anyone that a performance of that calibre is not acceptable at United. I'm sure he'll improve.

Still think we overpaid a tad for him though.

4204~~~
I recall Giggs in his later days as an out and out winger how it was harder to run up and down the pitch not because of stamina but because of a lack of energy that came with age. Depay looks like that now. He can impress a little with a burst of pace, but after one of those runs, he goes missing for five minutes. He simply doesn't look fit. Out entire team lacks fitness, from the looks of things.

4205~~~
Brainfart aside, to be fair he was no worse than any of Fellaini, Mata or Martial today.

4206~~~
Of course time should be afforded, and he may well turn out to be a world beater, but I just fail to see what attributes he brings to the game... he isn't very fast, quite sluggish for a winger actually, and doesn't shoot all that well either (for us). He is quite strong - I'll give him that, not that that is the most important attribute for a winger.

We would be much better off playing Young on the wing.

4207~~~
Memphis and Martial shouldn't have to start every week, it's going to take them a season or two to get used to the league and achieve some consistency. We shipped out so many attacking players and now we're overeliant on them and they're under so much pressure each week.

4208~~~
Not quite working for him at the moment, however at least he appears to be one of the few players that still has the guts to try things, even if most of the time it isn't coming off.

4209~~~
I'm not seeing enough glimpses of quality from him to suggest he's good enough. Inconsistency is one thing but he genuinely looks incapable of that brilliance we were promised.

4210~~~
he seems completely bemused if he gets tackled or fails to beat a man

4211~~~
He never beats his man. He's really poor at it. It's why I'm baffled as to how he's supposed to be a winger.

4212~~~
Confidence is very low with this kid, he's trying things that arent coming off, and he's trying them half heartedly.

Things like that require a bit of swagger that comes after you've been scoring a few goals and your team has been performing as a whole.

Right now, hes gotta get back to basics, get those right and work from there.

4213~~~
People keep telling me his talent is obvious. I keep asking myself, am I blind? I can't see it.

4214~~~
Currently he's looking better in the centre of the pitch where he can move left or right and not be marked tightly, but as we have no other wingers it hasn't been possible. Either that or fellaini plays the cam position instead of having 2 strikers.

4215~~~
He hasnt been managed well given its his first season. We over played him in the first part of the season which killed his confidence and it hasnt come back since. We should have played him and Young swapping (given Young did well there in our 433 purple patch last season).

We continue to kill his confidence, he makes a mistake, and he gets subbed at half time. He showed glimpses early in the season when his movement was more free. He seems more restricted and less willing to take people on. Such a shame.

4216~~~
All our team has been awful. Wouldn't be fair to judge him now.

4217~~~
he doesnt look any better than Lingard and hes more winger than Jesse, saying this he was bad yes, but Mata/Fellaini/Carrick could as well be subbed off as well, Martial didnt have a good game either

4218~~~
21 year old Nani was a far better player than he'll ever be. He was just far more talented in basically every facet of football.

4219~~~
Reserving judgement on him until we see him under another manager, goes for most of our signings even Mata et al.

4220~~~
I think he has one of the worst heading ability in the league. In fact, I had that opinion before today's match.

4221~~~
When we signed him I really felt that he would become a star player for us, he has been a huge disappointment though. I thought that one of his strength's would be taking a man on and beating them but he doesn't seem very good at doing that. Hopefully he will settle and improve more. I would put him in the Oxlade Chamberlain quality bracket. Our attacking options compared to the other top teams in the league are way behind.

4222~~~
We've seen far more from Ox in this league, although he's been here much longer. He's still young and he still has massive potential. I'm definitely in the 'give him time' camp.

4223~~~
He'll come good hopefully, but he's not that good, I mean, he's nothing special.

4224~~~
That's true. 

At least he is still young, and reading interviews from him he seems hungry to improve so that is a good thing.

4225~~~
Came in here to post something along these lines. When you consider the amount we paid for his supposed talent, I've just not even seen much glimpse of it. A talented but "raw" youngster - you can expect inconsistencies, but with Memphis were getting consistent shit. 

It's actually mind boggling to me imho.

4226~~~
Ox is a crock, but he's a fantastic player.

4227~~~
Harsh on Oxlade-Chamberlain.

4228~~~
I still can't get over that header - what was he thinking?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I would honestly give Pereira the nod ahead of him for Chelsea until he picks up some sort of form.

4229~~~
He's a nothing player in all honesty.

What's 1 thing he's good at?

And he's shown nothing to suggest he could improve and become a key player for us. He's not that talented.

Nani at a similar age was a far far better player than Memphis is and I don't think Memphis will ever approach Nani's level.

4230~~~
He's just not very good at anything is he?

4231~~~
He's a young Hulk isn't he. 

Got the flat track bully in him i.e. Eredivisie, Club Brugge. 
Very "big". Almost too big to be a winger.
Good shot power.

Generally fairly shit but will pull up a vine moment here and there

4232~~~
I said this before.  Because mata plays so inwards even without the ball the defence  is ultimately lop sided towards memphis's and martial's side.  Having an actual winger forward like depay on the right hugging the touchline would spread the defence out with spaces to execute.

4233~~~
Probably better than Fellaini and Mata if you ignore the feck up

4234~~~
Yep, being saying that for while.

Add to the list:
Looks crap basically every time you watch him. 
Supposedly good at free kicks.

4235~~~
He is struggling with confidence massively and today won't help. He seems to run down too many blind alleys and doesn't have the quick feet or dribbling ability to get out of it. 

I'm not 100% sure what you can do with him at the minute as I doubt the situation would be helped by moving him to the other wing or playing him central. He just needs a good run of games where he plays well, but he can't seem to get into a rhythm at the moment. At the start of the season, up until the Newcastle game, he was showing glimpses of brilliance albeit very inconsistent but now it's just mainly mediorce performances.

4236~~~
Today his defensive intervention was ridiculous there is no hidding from it. But I find amazing to see football fans being so harsh on a young player, who joined a mismanaged side where almost all the players have lost every ounce of confidence. Also it was a defensive action from an attacking player, he panicked but at least he was near the ball unlike the two other absolute imbeciles who pretend to be defenders.

4237~~~
Hulk has had a decent career. Better than 1 in 2 in 4 of the last 5 seasons. Portugal and Russia aren't great leagues, but not awful either. 

I think it's often forgotten how few consistent goal scoring wingers are out there. If Memphis can grab 10 in the league and a few assists from good crosses he'll be a useful starter here. 

Looks awful at the moment, but he's not this sluggish normally, and under the next manager he'll be encourage to make runs in behind more (which he does very, very well for a winger) and get on the end of things.

4238~~~
He's had an awful first half to the season despite scoring a few goals, hoping he can improve under another manager.

4239~~~
Atm he can only dream of having the carreer Hulk has had. It just pisses me off. Di Maria were given way less chances. Nani were given way less chances. Those 2 had more talent in their little toes than Memphis has though. Some things really are strange.

4240~~~
He's a scorer, not a creator.

Put a rampaging full back behind him who can make run and create, a creative mobile midfield and we'll see his potential. He's no good dribbling pass people to set up others.

4241~~~
Seems a lot on here are being rash too quickly on his potential. If you saw Hazard on this season alone, would you make the call that he is 100% shit and has never been/will be good? No. His track record at PSV and a couple of games here (Brugge obviously comes to mind as the only real quality game) shows that he has great ability when he has confidence and belief in himself. The whole team is shot, and for someone at 21 years old to play like he does will really be killing him inside, and it takes not only himself, but both team confidence to come back up and a manager to get you back to good form.

He has been unbelievably shit this season, but I am far from writing him off, and I still think he is going to come good here. But the first step he can make towards that is either by learning to beat a man with a ball or start doing fecking one-twos!

4242~~~
Did a lot to create the first goal today.<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

4243~~~
This is utter trash, the answer to every non factor attacker seems to be that there needs to be pace and mobility around him so that he can pick passes. Well, that might be a legit defense when Ozil, Mata or Silva has a bad game because those kind of players play between the lines created by forwards but not this baller on a budget winger.

If a full back creates the space, I'd rather play Mata or Herrera on that wing who have a better eye for a dangerous pass or through ball when afforded time and space on the ball.

He is a winger, he is supposed to create width and either deliver dangerous crosses or create shots for himself on goal, even the bargain bin wingers at Stoke, Everton and Palace do that, Ashley fecking Young who plays as a full back has had more successful take ons than him on the same fecking team. Van Gaal sold Wilf Zaha and he's been doing a much better job at Palace.

Memphis is a shit-house attacker who overmatched the Dutch league full backs physically for a season and wakes up with the attitude of a Cristiano Ronaldo. What kind of winger even weighs 88kg? I mean Rio and Vidic at their peak weighed less than that and both played center backs for a living while being four inches taller than him.

4244~~~
Enjoy the wine and mince pie, Memphis Depay.

4245~~~
Watch any highlights of his. The guy basically decided that he wants to play like Ronaldo. He's not going to create any space for his teammates, just eating them up.

It's not an excuse, just a fact.

4246~~~
He will come good.

4247~~~
His ability on the ball is so, so poor. There were a few moments where he was trying to link up with Martial, but it took him so long to get the ball out of his feet to create an angle for a pass that it repeatedly got blocked. Doesn't even have the awareness to look up to know the pass is off, to then just keep the ball.

4248~~~
Doesn't change the fact that he's a coward for not putting his body on the line for the goal though, does it. He's playing poorly because he's shite, a fraud who needs to bugger off back to the Eredivisie sharpish where he belongs.

4249~~~
Stoke away is generally a difficult game.I don't think the current Memphis is good enough to start these kind of games regardless of the manager and tactics.

4250~~~
What is he actually good at?

4251~~~
Then he's not going to be a very good winger is he?

4252~~~
There isn't much to suggest he's a scorer too. His finishing has been dreadful the few times he's been put through, and if you're really not offering much else you need to at least be ruthless in front of goal.

4253~~~
Predictably cutting inside to his right-foot.

4254~~~
In Gaelic Football terms, I feel like Mata and Memphis are, when on form, two excellent corner forwards in a team crying out for half forwards. The problem is right now they're desperately out of form and confidence.

I'm not sure how to explain that for the non Irish lads. Think of them as the wide points of the last 3 in a 4-3-3 rather than anywhere on the 3 of the 4-2-3-1. Which is (part of) what we need.

4255~~~
He's a wide striker. Noticed as much watching him at the WC. He's useless as a winger.

Think of him as a less skilled, more one dimensional Robben. If we allow him to hone his skill he can perfect the cut inside and shoot stuff, and maybe freekicks.

4256~~~
Robben can dribble fantastically well. Memphis...can't.

4257~~~
He needs to develop a brain.

4258~~~
That's why I said 'even more one dimensional'

4259~~~
The thing is with him, every now and again he would do something magical that makes you think maybe there is something special there.

That goal he scored against PSV away is absolutely magical, seriously go back and watch it again. The two quick footed touches and finish were as perfect as they come.

4260~~~
Same thoughts here. He seems not full on in his game at the moment. I am sure he still getting used to the league, etc. but he is still playing at an effort level where when he doesn't play well he still scores in the Eredevisie but not in EPL. Especially not against Stoke at Brittania.

4261~~~
He has something, still waiting to be unleashed I think. Just need to change the mindset, be stronger. Not just physically. He seems to be easily affected by any negativity happening on the pitch.

4262~~~
Yeah man. You can excuse someone who's struggling with form, but their effort must be 110%.

4263~~~
I ask again, is it worth investing so much time in him when there are other young  players with more potential around? Pereira, Januzaj, even Lingard who I don't rate that high. 

The boy is nothing special, and surely isn't a winger.

4264~~~
Dont even want to read the comments, it's sad to see him play like this when I've followed him from when he was in the PSV academy. I know he's better than this, but he's been actually garbage. All fans who want him out already, fair enough to them because he has shown absolutely nothing here. It's a shame.

4265~~~
Should be at #10 for me

Can't wait for him too come good so all the people on here slamming one of our youngest players can come crawling out of the woodwork pretending that they knew it all along (see Ronaldo - ineffective showpony 2003/4)

4266~~~
Problem I don't even see much talent there atm. Even when Nani had his frustrating moments. You saw an incredibly talented footballer there. Brilliant first touch. Brilliant dribbling ability. I don't see what Memphis is even good at atm. Can't pick out a pass, can't dribble. He is pretty strong that's about it though.

4267~~~
Nobody's slamming Martial to be fair.

And yea, he's probably looked the best when exempted of defensive duties <b>but</b> to get such privilege you have to actually absolutely destroy it up front, do magic, he doesn't do that so why would he get it.

4268~~~
Why? He doesn't seem to be anything close to #10 or a winger to me.

4269~~~
I think a conference defender can mark him. His dribbling is that poor.

4270~~~
Because he isn't skilful in that same way that a tricky winger is, he is fast, powerful and direct. He is too big to be twisting defenders inside out. I also think he has a decent football brain and an eye for a pass

We need a #10 who has the directness to go past people and I think Depay could be that player

4271~~~
Shudder.

4272~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It was a terrible header. The wind was against him and the ball was bouncing high and spinning backwards. Insane thing to attempt.

4273~~~
He looks strong and he's physically built, but the amount of times he's been muscled off the ball has been pretty staggering.

4274~~~
He's arm-wrestle srong, but not football strong. he's the useless kind of strong for football.
In other words: like Carroll, he'd beat Messi or Silva in an arm-wrestle. But ask them to dribble with a football and turn etc. and they're not even near Messi or Silva, in terms of being hard to knock off the ball or to the ground.

4275~~~
you could forgive him for the wind, you can see the ball shift in the air. its how laid back he is seconds before it, as last man that's infuriating

4276~~~
His defensive contribution for the Dutch team has also been disastrous for them and he was heavily criticised for it. By no means are we expecting him to be Maldini but it needs to be better.

4277~~~
To be fair, i expected him to have more impact. The game at home against Brugge for me was the game i thought he would push on and make his mark into the team. Unfortunately with a lot of young talents you have to be patient because they will experience the ups and downs and at the end their mentality will be the deciding factor. Still think he will come good at Old Trafford.

4278~~~
5 goals and 4 assists so far this season isn't really bad at all for him, considering he's 21 and in a new country with a team that is struggling. I reckon there's a good chance he doubles those figures this season, and that would be a good contribution. I don't know if it's just that people's expectations are too high, but some are saying he's as bad as Bebe or Obertan - that's ridiculous.

4279~~~
Considering more than half of that total was against a terrible, injury hit Brugge side and Ipswich Town, it's actually quite poor.

4280~~~
Stats are a very limited way of looking at a player's contribution. Anyone who actually watches the matches will see how poor he has been. The Bebe and Obertan comparisons are a bit much but, to be honest, he's closer to them than he is to Nani.

4281~~~
Really feel for him, some disgusting comments on his Instagram. Sad thing is, half of it is coming from Fenerbahçe fans after that comment Depay made about Van Persie.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/zkkTCC9.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/zkkTCC9.png"/>

4282~~~
Needs to get benched permanently and work hard to regain his place. 

Some of the abuse is horrible.

4283~~~
<a class="username" data-user="93444, @MyOnlySolskjaer" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93444/">@MyOnlySolskjaer</a> what did he say about Van Persie?

4284~~~
RVP lost the rag with him because he wouldn't pass him the ball.
RVP said, "You think you're a big boy?" or something like that. Depay replied, "Do big boys play for Fenabache?" 

Also, "Low Depay" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4285~~~
That is a bit cheeky of him

4286~~~
Especially considering he has been a toilet since he came here.

4287~~~
To be fair Van Persie is better at diving headers

4288~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s11.postimg.org/962iwfjbn/memphis.jpg" src="http://s11.postimg.org/962iwfjbn/memphis.jpg"/>

4289~~~
This looks incredible, taken out of context.

4290~~~
his problem with the header was obvious from the go.  He thought it (the pass)was going to be easy, and moved towards it in slow speed. He
should have moved faster. His slow reaction cost him there

4291~~~
Wall paper material.

4292~~~
Some of that abuse is awful, especially the comment about his dad.

4293~~~
That Glen is a one arm crane.

4294~~~
didn't realise was wearing gloves aswell, the tart.

4295~~~
He is our Ryan Babel. 

I just don't see a stand out feature of him. I thought dribbling wise he didn't stand out in the World Cup. But maybe that was due to Robben and not many players come close to him in terms of dribbling.

Wish we sign Lucas Moura.

4296~~~
An absolute joke of a player.

4297~~~
He's absolutely awful.

4298~~~
That run against Ivanovic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Wouldn't care one little bit if he was sold in January absolute tosh.

4299~~~
Looks like a player lacking confidence, some really poor touches

4300~~~
Can we get rid in the summer?

I understand giving young players time, but has he shown the talent to be given time?

He's honestly not that good.

4301~~~
Wow....Nani at his worst is better than this fraud.

I wonder if Newcastle would give us 6m-7m for him?

4302~~~
He can't run. I mean he looks very very heavy.

4303~~~
It's actually laughable the form that he is in.

4304~~~
U21's permanently, that was horrible, Fellaini'esque run.

4305~~~
He basically has to be running onto the ball in order to do anything worthwhile.
Which is not the makings of a top player at all.

I'll be stunned if he's a regular at United in three years time.

4306~~~
That run....there are no words <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4307~~~
His confidence is shattered

4308~~~
He's terrible. If a young player had been brought into the team from the youth ranks and played this badly, he would be written off very quickly.

4309~~~
Remember much earlier in the season when I said it could be the beginning of the end for us when LvG benched him? People called me crazy, look at this thread now. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I'm not saying the reactions in here are correct, some of them are the makings of poor management, but it's funny nonetheless.

4310~~~
I agree with this.

4311~~~
complete fraud 

When LVG leaves he needs to take Memphis and blind back to Holland with him. 

Both awful players we shouldn't have anywhere near our team

4312~~~
He doesn't look like he knows how to play football, let alone be a professional. The lowest dip of form I've ever seen someone suffer.

4313~~~
Loan move.

4314~~~
He's just not very good, don't even compare him to Nani.

4315~~~
I really hope that we spend money in the summer transfer window for both wing positions, and don't avoid spending in those positions because of believing in Memphis' potential. He's not even a good backup right now, and long way off showing any talent to be worthy of starting.

4316~~~
Didn't affect the game at all when he come on.

4317~~~
That is extremely offensive to Ryan Babel.

4318~~~
The run of a player with no confidence.

4319~~~
Memphis couldn't trap a bag of cement.....

4320~~~
There's not much that can be defended from that 15 minutes, dreadful.

4321~~~
His face really annoys me for some reason. Oh, and he's pretty shit, too.

4322~~~
Hasn't he just bought a convertible rolls royce?

4323~~~
Thought I've seen it all in football until today when I saw a winger who actually can't run, let alone dribble. An absolute disgrace of a player. We need to find a way to terminate his contract and if that's not possible I demand a refund, paid in full, for this impostor.

4324~~~
Not great cameo but what can you do, we've left ourselves so short of attacking options we don't have much choice but to use him.

4325~~~
lol

4326~~~
As I kept on saying well before we signed him, Depay was exactly the kind of player we did not need. So many people deluded themselves on what kind of player he was after reading the bollocks from Max.

As it is I have no idea what we can do with him. We'll have to play him as a striker or #10 to get anything out of him as LVG had realized early on.

4327~~~
He is young.  His confidence is shot.  Based solely on his performances he looks nothing special.  I hope he can build into more in the coming years but he needs a manager who can bring back his belief and he needs to start doing the easy things instead of trying exaggerated back heels and such.

4328~~~
Stick him upfront.

He's exactly what Valencia would be like being played on the left, except Tony has much better acceleration.

4329~~~
<a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> where art thou?

4330~~~
Most fecking annoying this about him is that when he comes on Martial gets thrown on the right. He was grilling Ivanovic all game and Depay couldn't even run next to him.

4331~~~
Both Young and Martial are being unfairly treated because of Memphis. Is he van Gaal darling?

4332~~~
He really is bang average. Even at 21, he can't do a simple thing right.

4333~~~
Put a wild animal on instead of him and I'm sure it'd be as useful. Saddest part is I'm not even joking.

4334~~~
Don't like writing off young players and I really do want this guy to succeed here but I really struggle to see what he brings to the table. He looks and runs so heavy he is incapable of beating even the slowest of defenders (Ivanovic).

4335~~~
Still can't see anything he's actually good at.

4336~~~
guys and gals, maybe this is what he needs - a fecked up season where he gets put back in his place - just like Luke did last season and we all saw the difference in him this season before you know what happened.

Maybe the fact his history is fecked up, he had issues, he conquered them and took the Eredivisie by storm last season should give us hope.

Maybe he'll go away over the summer, gets a manager who believes in him and lets him "see the light" about what football is all about again and we go on to get a brilliant no. 7

i'm not writing him off yet - don't think it's fair.  He's Dutch, living in Manch with no mates at the age of 21 - you tell me you'll do much better.  Maybe he's at home wondering what to do with his money other than drink it away or spend it on prostitutes so he goes and buys a RR that he's been looking at for ages

and i'm one of the worst for his hopes but i just hate the way so many are writing him off as a loss / loser etc after 5 months in the PL

Episode II - a new hope folks

4337~~~
Ryan DeBabel

4338~~~
He'll come good. I can admit though I base this on absolutely no evidence.

4339~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4340~~~
Needs some time out of the limelight 

Hopefully we strengthen the attacking options soon and he can play a bit less and get himself right

4341~~~
He said he's mint in interviews. Good enough for me

4342~~~
For example, Erik Lamela is a young player who came to this league with a huge price tag and struggled a long time but is now finally showing his worth

I'm Memphis with the right coaching and patience will deliver but the teams struggle and the manager isn't helping his cause

4343~~~
Gif of the run?

4344~~~
He must surely have more to offer than this. He must do, otherwise it makes no sense how he's made it this far as a professional footballer. Maybe he should go back on loan to PSV for the second half of the season. Try and restore some of that confidence and talent that he presumably must have.

4345~~~
Yup, I'll hold my hand up. I expected a lot more. even your prediction that he'd be a Dutch Ashley Young was wrong - it's a slant on Young!

4346~~~
I think that the final defense of Memphis apart from being Young and new to the League is the Di maria comparison. They're development since joining United are very similar, the light at the end of the tunnel being that di Maria seems to be doing very well for himself again in his new environment. Özils Arsenal career might be another story for the hopeful to cling on to.

4347~~~
He needs to cut out that rockstar Dwayne Johnson look, shave off those ridiculous sideburns, come to training in a sensible car and really put in the hours on the field.

He's 21, not really achieved or done much and thinks he's already made it as a footballer.

4348~~~
Ozil was never really that bad at Arsenal though, started very well but then struggled with injuries/laziness accusations. In reality he was actually quite good when he played, just this season he's been incredible. We really can never hold out on Memphis turning out like that.

4349~~~
Those YouTube videos are so deceiving.

4350~~~
So bad recently and tbh so bad all season. Give him time he may adapt but he's looking like an expensive mistake so far.

4351~~~
This made me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> imagine LVG makes a sub, and Mata is taken off and replaced with a badger <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4352~~~
He had a forgettable first half of the season. Hasn't really showed glimpses of quality either, Martial and Shaw are miles ahead of him.

Let's hope he just needs time to adapt.

4353~~~
He should be the last player in the pecking order for wingers (for now).Need to restore his hungriness and put him away from the pressure for a while.

4354~~~
Well at least a lion could eat some opposition players or Rooney if we are lucky.

4355~~~
He is emblamatic of the team right now. All the ability is there but he hasnt got the mental drive yet. He needs to stop thinking hes already made it just by being here.

4356~~~
People wanting him sold are being too hasty. He has zero confidence at the moment and just can't do anything right.

4357~~~

4358~~~
At least he has done more than the best player in PL last season <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4359~~~
God I hate 'I told you so' posts.

4360~~~
It's hard to see what we try next with him, he genuinely doesn't look quick enough or mobile enough to play on the wing in the PL and he's not getting the #10 role over Herrera at this point.

4361~~~
Put him upfront and keep Martial on the left. Try it.

4362~~~
Couldn't be much worse than what we've been seeing recently. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4363~~~
He doesn't do anything well, absolutely pointless player.

I audibly groaned today when I saw that he was being subbed on.

4364~~~
I had a hearty chuckle when that happened. 

Just so bad.

4365~~~
The moment he gets the ball you know he is going to cut inside and take a shot with his right foot. He is so predictable. What is more interesting is that there is no overlapping defender coming on the wing to stretch defenses and support him either.

:-(

4366~~~
If he doesn't show himself to be a proper player in the second half of the season, we should consider a loan out to a smaller club.

4367~~~
That is absolutely ridiculous <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4368~~~
Made me laugh too. It's the sort of thing I used to expect from Keiron Richardson, not a 25 million pound signing.

I still feel he has to be given time and patience, but as suggested above,  if he continues to struggling during the second half of the season,  we should consider a loan where he hopefully replicates his psv heroics/does a de bruyne.

4369~~~
How bad is the Dutch league?

4370~~~
PES Wise probably it's easy while EPL is hardest

4371~~~
He needs to get his head down and start slogging it out. IMO he's come into the team and this league extremely complacent thinking he can waltz past whoever he wants and pull off whatever he tries. He needs to start using his head a little bit more.

4372~~~
This also says it all.

4373~~~
He needs putting in the reserves until he improves on every aspect of his game. Comes across as a classic 'too much, too soon' young footballer who thinks he is far better than he is showing. It's very hard not to dislike him at the moment but that is due to the image he gets from the press and social media. That said, his choice of vehicle kind of reflects his personality, so he is making it difficult.
As it stands, another glorious waste of money so far. Good job age is on his side.
Imagine if Roy Keene was still captain of our club? This joker would have been bullied into being a better man by now.

4374~~~
I think Shaw and Memphis have different attitudes and that is why I don't expect Memphis to turn things around as dramatically as Shaw did. I'm disappointed because I heard from many people before he signed that Memphis was very grounded and isn't an arrogant type person but since he has arrived we have seen the complete opposite. Plus he needs to start leaning out because he is getting bulkier by the month it seems.

4375~~~
Has he offered more than Zaha would have?

4376~~~
Honestly if I was 21 and rich like him I'd buy the same cars... minus the crazy sideburns though.

4377~~~
I was groaning when I saw him coming in instead of Pereira.

4378~~~
I think it's just a real lottery when you buy a player from the Dutch league. The defences are so poor that there's no real indication how good they are. For every Suarez or RVN there are several Ryan Babbels.

4379~~~
Better off keeping Januzaj.

4380~~~
Unfair to judge him at the moment, IMO. His confidence is shot and he's playing in a team that has completely broken down. I think in a season or two he will be a good player for us.

4381~~~
Aren't we small enough?

4382~~~
Oh yeah, you support a really small club. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

4383~~~
His confidence is absolutely gone

Not a fan of mocking and laughing at him, as I feel quite sorry for the chap

What we saw early on was a clear talent and very exciting too. But it's all gone for now

If we had a big enough squad he should be left out for a few weeks completely

4384~~~
True. Our team has plenty of deadweight who need to be shown the door as soon as possible, but Depay's still quite young, and only in his first season. Whether he will fulfill his potential remains unseen, but I do think we'll start to see a lot more from him in time...might be into next season though.

4385~~~
He was ok at best when he first signed... now he looks as useful as a traffic cone on a football pitch, probably even less useful than that. He's becoming Bendtner level of joke now.

4386~~~
Thanks. Disappointing that from Memphis.

4387~~~
Still seeing posters saying his talent is clear. I'm not seeing it. This guy can't dribble to save his life. He takes ages to get the ball out of his feet. I'm also seeing posters saying he was good earlier on in the season. He has struggled in virtually every premierleague game. 
He has very poor technique with the ball at his feet. I don't care if people call me knee jerk. You can check my thread history, I have been calling him out for his poor dribbling since he was at PSV. Once we buy more wingers, something I think we will do, he will be in big trouble. 
I don't think his troubles are a confidence issue, I think it's a technical issue and unfortunately, I'm not optimistic.

4388~~~
He is on a big fat contract, earning mega-bucks.
As far as he is concerned, he has already "made it".

Remember, some people are happy to have "made it" by age 21, then effectively retire.
Others (like C.Ronaldo), work their behind off to get even better and attain elite levels of performance.
I think D.Bentley and T.Cleverley also fall into Memphis' level (ie. good initial talent/ability, but then they were content to be at that level).

4389~~~
Yeha, write a 21 year old talent off in his first PL-season. Noone has ever struggled in their first PL-season.

I guess most of you lot should be glad that this forum didnt excist during the emerge of CO92, guess most of you would've wanted us to get rid of those lot as well.. No patience with the fans of this club these days, it's ridiculous.

4390~~~
Well no, because you could clearly see their talent from the start. With Memphis it's been very hard to see what he is good at, especially for the money we paid to get him in. He has played 2 good games in half a season, it isn't good enough for an International calibre player. Add to the fact he has an ego issue and looks overweight \ too bulky for a player who is meant to be a fairly quick winger.

4391~~~
Did you write off Evra and Vidic after the first few months as well? Should've we gotten rid of those guys as well?

The last part is simply ridiculous, but you are entitled to your own opinion not matter how bizzare I find it.

4392~~~
I don't understand why you keep bringing separate players into the argument. Evra and Vidic struggled but you could see the talent was there and they certainly didn't have the ego and entitled attitude that Memphis has where he feels he has 'made it' already. In fact I'd argue Evra and Vidic were 2 of the most grounded players we have had in the last 10 years.

I do think he is too bulky, he couldn't even get passed Ivanovic yesterday so it's not something I've plucked out of thin air.

4393~~~
I bring other players into this, because it's quite obvious that players tend to adjust to the PL in their own tempo. To write him off, calling him names or even wanting him sold (as posters have said in this thread and on this forum) already is, in my opinion, simply nuts. Who cares about the ego? Many of the best players in the world has gotten a ego, and it's not like you know the guy personally. He seems like he possess the kind of ego that'll keep him working harder than most people to reach his goals, rather than the ego of a Berahino. 

If you say that he failed to get passed a player yesterday is 100% proof of him being "too bulky", then I dont really think I can bother with the discussion.

4394~~~
I think it's really ridiculous how fans are quick to write off players just for the sake of it. I for one have watched football long enough to know that any new player coming the PL has a low chance of hitting it off. Most fans have to admit that Martial's first couple of weeks was relatively "abnormal" and was bound to dry out at some point. It's called progressive transition. 

Look at Ozil, KDB, even though they had the potential they struggled to adapt in their first year in England, this in normal. Very normal actually. 

I work with young players and I can see how hard it is to adapt regardless of your ability or how much you earn. Most fans can't even adapt to watching a different league for a whole year how much more new players playing in one.

For me, Memphis, Darmian, to some extent Herrera, Rojo and Blind will always get at least 18months to 2 years grace before I expect them to start to shine. 

To sell him is just silly talk. If we missed  out on him and he went to PSG, we would be moaning on how Woodward messed it up. Let's give the imports the chance to develop and hopefully await their explosion rather than slating them blindly.

The same happened last year when fans were having a go at Herrera, barely 6 months into his first year in England and excuses were made for Fellaini who has almost 10 years of PL experience under his belt (let that sink in). It doesn't make sense at all. This is why Rooney, Fellaini et al will hardly get a 5 from me this season.

Yes, some of the new players are not playing well yet, but let's allow them time before we chop their heads off. If Memphis was at PSG, Herrera at Barca, BS at Dortmund, Darmian at Porto (relatively easier leagues and in teams without the nonsense we are going through) we would be drooling over them.

4395~~~
go read some of his interviews, confidence isnt lacking. The league is just way tougher than he is used to

4396~~~
The moment when he ran the ball out of play while trying to get past his man near the byline reminded me of Obertan. I really believed Memphis would be the kind of wide player who can get us 10 goals a season at least - something which we have lacked since the days of Ronaldo - but he is increasingly looking poorer with each passing game.

4397~~~
People were declaring Memphis better than Nani before the season started. Let that sink in.

4398~~~
Not one of them would start for those teams you mentioned.
Which is basically the biggest issue.

This squad is made up of players that wouldn't get into the first eleven of any serious team.

As for Memphis: he's got very little quality to his game. He can shoot, and that's about it. Unless he's running onto a moving ball or shooting, he's not contributing anything useful.

4399~~~
Not really a controversial statement IMO. Memphis scored 22 goals at the age of 20 to 21 in the Eredivisie, and he scored 2 World Cup goals.

4400~~~
Memphis isn't even close to Nani when he first arrived here. If he goes on to be as good as Nani I'd be pretty happy with that.

4401~~~
The people who do have an ego like a Ronaldo etc. have somewhat justified it with their performances so you can kinda turn the other cheek so to speak. What has Memphis achieved that gives him that attitude already exactly?

The bolded part, it seems like he has been the opposite in truth.

That yesterday was one example as Ivanovic has been skinned by practically everybody this season, can you tell me when was the last time Memphis beat a defender for pace? I certainly cannot remember.

But here, have an e-pint for being a t0p red.

4402~~~
He's not even reached the Ashley Young level never mind Nani. He's closer to Bebe than he's to Nani ffs

4403~~~
Considering some of the shite we held onto for years, binning this lad after a season would be daft.

4404~~~
Why are some people calling him fat and overweight? He's ripped with muscles with extremely low body fat. If anything, he probably uses the gym too much

4405~~~
I watched back the highlights of the brugge game earlier and he looked class, he was turning players easily doing good stuff and scored 2 worldies.

I know brugge are crap but is clear he has talent just needs to not be a cocky prick.

4406~~~
I know a guy I met in Birmingham some years ago. He's Belgian and West Brom were interested in paying £5m for him an U21 (West Brom + £5m a couple of years ago!, for a youth player?!?). So must have been pretty good. After a couple of weeks on trial in England, he said "Football in England is not bad but it is very very hard!" This guy is physically fit and technically good but the levels in England is a massive shock for foreign players, physically, mentally, socially and even emotionally. He is now plying his trade in lower leagues after he cancelled his contract in Belgium. He wants to play in the top flight but he chose to "rinse" off all what he ever knew in Belgium and adapt to English football.

This is just to give a idea of how adaptation is  crucial

4407~~~
Rightly spotted that none would start but would be in less stressful situations, so to speak to bring out the best in them.

His last year at PSV suggests he has more to his game than just shooting but the other attributes require the player to go over and beyond what he is used to to bring them out. I'm totally excusing new player as they must take a major responsibility for their development. But overwhelming pressure doesn't help.

4408~~~
I still think he has something about him underneath all the woeful performances. His attitude does worry me though.

4409~~~
Overweight doesn't necessarily have to be in a negative sense. Not everyone can carry the kind of muscle mass Ronaldo did and keep his speed and agility. Memphis seems to be losing his.

4410~~~
Another manager will get more out of him.

4411~~~
He appears to be getting bulkier by the month, and it seems to of slowed him down to a snails pace. I know myself through playing rugby that when I bulked that the more bulkier I got the less agile I felt and that's exactly what seems to of happened to Memphis. He used to be more than capable of beating defenders before hand.

4412~~~
Memphis Decay

4413~~~
This could go either way really. Martial has shown he will be a good signing, Depay just not enough and I don't see it getting much better any time soon.

4414~~~
I do love how many people on here have become experts in strength and conditioning. 

Memphis has a low body fat percetage, and looking at his frame I'd argue he's probably lb for lb the strongest player in the squad. 

Something isn't right though, because he just isn't showing his talents. PSG, Liverpool and most top sides around Europe wanted him for a reason.

I don't think the current formation suits him, as he isn't really a winger but more of a inside forward. A move to a 433 would suit him better.

4415~~~
He just has 0 confidence. He has flashes of quality in some of the really good goals he has scored. He can still come good.

4416~~~
Play him as striker I guess.

4417~~~
This is probably the best thing to do with him right now but to do it we'd have to drop Herrera.

4418~~~
Play him against Sheffield in the cup if he needs confidence, we've got far too much ground to make up in the league for him to be stinking the place up.

4419~~~
Jozy Altidore was a massive star there, he scored 38 goals in 67 appearances.

In England, he scored 2 goals in 70 appearances.

4420~~~
People need to remember in terms of muscular players in regard to speed... Look at Valencia he has always been an absolute tank but had incredible pace. There are  plenty of players who are in the same boat as well, depays problem isn't muscle it's what's in his head.

4421~~~
Nope, at Wigan and his first year here that's not really true.

4422~~~
He clearly has talent.

You only need to look at the flashes of brilliance he's shown to see that.

I'm not comfortable with the panning he's taking, primarily because he's young and in a new environment. 

Plus, we can't really hammer Memphis when players considerably more experienced are letting the club down.

4423~~~
Loan out Wilson and Januzaj, buys Depay..

VG masterclass....

Not suggesting Depay shouldnt have been bought but he never proved more than Wilson or Januzaj here, perhaps VG underestimated his transition..

4424~~~
Reading some people on caf makes me feel that Januzaj was a mini version of CR7, but was purposefully kept out so that we could play lesser talents.

4425~~~
There is no doubt that with all the hype and a number of clubs allegedly wanting him he has disappointed this season. He needs to humble up a bit and get back to basics for a while to adapt to the demands of the PL. Loan him out to a Championship side for 6 months. It will be an eye opener for him.

4426~~~
He's said himself that he feels slower because of all the weight he's added. And it's obvious just watching him that his acceleration and agility are notably worse than when we signed him. 

I agree with people saying we should try him as a striker for a little bit. He was decent there against Watford.

4427~~~
Ah yes, In that one game against Brugge's reserves.

4428~~~
His finishes against PSV and Watford were fantastic.

4429~~~
More than Wilson without a doubt, what exactly has he proven? Besides they're not even in contention with each other. Januzaj arguably shouldn't have been loaned out, definitely not to Dortmund, but that has nothing to do with Depay who again he doesn't really contend with. Januzaj hasn't exactly been tearing it up in recent times either.

4430~~~
I wonder if his best position might end up being second striker/striker i.e central.

4431~~~
Well you agreed about Januzaj so that makes sense, Wilson you claim isnt in competition with Depay, uet both have played striker and winger for us, i cant prove that Wilson has played better in England as I think its relatively close, but thats my point.. Why let one go and let one stay? We would have had ample space, he needed to drop Rooney IMO but doesnt have the players.. Who do we ever have on the bench recently who is a good attacker? Anyway its the Depay thread, I dont think we shouldnt have bought him, he will come good but it seems he needs to get that desire back, due to lack of personnel, despite being pulled off at half time in a quarter of the PL games this season, in our last match, he was the best option attacking wise and I think he knows he will play regardless, if Wilson and Januzaj (glad Pereira is getting mins) were here, that would be different..

4432~~~
It obviously is which is why LVG started off with him there before being fooled by the Brugge performance.

4433~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KGZE-ujJ8Jk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

10:08, shouldn't we laugh at Martial as well?

4434~~~
No. He does show flashes of real skill and he does work his arse off.

4435~~~
Double standards, mistake is mistake, no matter who made it.

4436~~~
Because it might make a lot of sense given he's strong, quick and potentially a goalscorer based on his title-starring exploits with PSV. 

On face value, players suited to being stuck out wide should be those who are natural dribblers (which Memphis is not), and those with rapid pace playing as out and out wingers (like old Valencia).

4437~~~
Well you're right but Martial has bought himself time with the level of performances he has delivered this season. Their level of ability on the ball is world apart from each other.

4438~~~
There are so many examples of young players taking a while to adapt and show any sort of quality when moving to this league, I don't really understand the need to make sweeping judgements now, or for at least another 6 months for that matter. 
Someone mentioned Lamela - different style of player, but same position, similar cost, and also looked completely useless in his first couple of seasons. Granted, I don't watch Spurs as much as us, but I didn't see too many people claiming they could see the talent in him back then.

4439~~~
I agree with you, there's no doubt who's more talented between the two. 

Just wanted to show that even players with better technique and better ball control still can make silly mistakes so there's no reason to ridicule Depay for trying something while making excuses when Martial fails with his attempt.

4440~~~
Wilson has played on the wing on occasion but never on the right, which is Depays main position, and Van Gaal would've never thought play him there. Also, Depay would've started over Wilson as a striker anyways and rightfully so. Wilson hasn't proven anything anywhere outside of the u21s, he hasn't really made an impact at all in the first team since his debut and just isn't good enough at this time to really push anyone for a spot as poor as they are. Not getting any game time isn't great for kid developing, therefore he was loaned out. The same points also apply to Januzaj although to a lesser extent. I could argue that their role in the squad just aren't valuable enough to justify keeping them from playing and developing elsewhere, I don't think that their absence has played any significant role in our current predicament at all.

4441~~~
I wonder why Wijnaldum didn't have any problems fitting in at Newcastle, he's been one of their best players.

4442~~~
Ouch! There's also Alfonso Alves who scored 34 in 31 there in a league season.

4443~~~
We don't. Memphis up front, Herrera behind and Martial to the left. Martial and Memphis can switch about if needs be.

4444~~~
I don't see Rooney being dropped in order to experiment with Memphis a #9.

4445~~~
Let's not forget that Gigi is vastly more experienced and has the luxury of a manager that trusts him in a variety of positions with freedom. Incomparable.

4446~~~
No he hasn't. I know a few Newcastle fans and they all think he's been pretty anonymous most of their games. He's scored quite a lot of goals, yeah, and they recognise he's got talent. But to say he's not had problems 'fitting in' is just wrong. He's really struggling to make an impact in most of the games he's played for them.

4447~~~
Judge him next season. There's a player in there somewhere, but he has a long way to justify him being here.

4448~~~
The Eredvisie is a really strange league. Some players come over and have similar impact in the PL no problem (RVN, Suarez) while others come over and you wonder how they could even stand out in a pub league.

4449~~~
Definitely. We've seen moments of pure quality from him, he just needs to get his head in order. His decision making has been atrocious this season.

4450~~~
I don't remember much about a young Ruud but with Suarez the physical attributes were there, the pace, high energy and stubborn dedication to win the ball and things that translate to any league. With Memphis with the very first game he played on the wing it became so clear how limited he was in his ability or lack thereof to beat a full back. Its astonishing that LvG spent so much time coaching him with the national team and didn't see that coming.

He has the attributes of a decent striker but as a left winger or even a wide forward, he's hopeless. I'm not sure if the weight is holding back his acceleration or atleast we better hope so, otherwise it might take a while to convert him into a full time striker and if that fails, its a sunk cost. A speculative investment of 15 mil wouldn't have been bad but we paid twice that for him and expected him to be a defacto starter on the left wing.

4451~~~
You could probably say that about any league though to be honest.

4452~~~
What was it, 35 goals in 33 games for Ajax?


<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mhfJ56PgGBA/U0ov_9BujMI/AAAAAAAAHe8/6WSV7rAVwDw/s1600/3.jpg" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mhfJ56PgGBA/U0ov_9BujMI/AAAAAAAAHe8/6WSV7rAVwDw/s1600/3.jpg"/>


Even Ruud had 67 goals in 62 games, coming to the club after a years injury.

To be fair Memphis is coming in a different stage of his career but hard to ignore the Alfonso Alves doubts. There have been glimpses though.

Dream, Believe, Achieve <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4453~~~
He has good movement, I give him that but I don't have much hope for him on the wings. Move him up front.

4454~~~
Needs to lose some muscle and sort his head out, confidence is below zero and mentally he isnt up for the premier league. Needs protection, hope LvG keeps him out of the team for a while before our entire fanbase starts abusing him.

4455~~~
It's interesting, Van Gaal did say <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-boss-louis-van-6877855" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"I think also this role for Memphis is the best one for him. He played it also in the World Cup for me when Van Persie and Robben were injured so I knew he could do it." </a>After he played there against Watford.

Hasn't tried him there since, might be to do with Rooney coming back but still...

We might as well give him a run up there, it's not like we're going to expect goals galore from Rooney anytime soon.

4456~~~
Why is he completely unable to beat a man? his skillset is so uncomplimentary. At this stage we should probably just play him as a striker as he's useless out wide.

4457~~~
I remember at the start of the season I thought he looked promising out wide. He kept making brilliant runs behind his fullback and had a few chances (didn't take all of them of course but I'm thinking of the Brugge game and he also had a few against Villa away) but I really thought it would be a good tactic for us this season. He seems to be useless against defences that sit deep which isn't ideal for this United side !

4458~~~
I said earlier in the season, the entire set up for him is new as well. PSV play in a more counter attacking set up, with fast link up play and as a result of thay, they create the most chances in the league and the attackers get plenty of space. We create the fewest chances in the league and have to create from stand still when surroundes by 3 players easily with no pace whatsoever in our play. Depay is more a Fergie signing than LvG, I find it strange. LvG knows which type of football he plays, why does he continuously buy players that dont fit that style of football?

4459~~~
Your tag line is very appropriate.

4460~~~
I try.

4461~~~
Its quite crap.

It says a lot about us that we couldnt beat the eredivisie champions over 2 games

4462~~~
I agree, at first I looked at him and thought no his amount of muscle is fine but I've been watching videos of him from last season and he looks a lot lighter. 

I have faith he will make it here, look at last season he was incredible, even this season the goal he scored against PSV was brilliant, coming in from the wing good little foot switch to beat 2 then megged the keeper, crap players don't do that sort of stuff.

4463~~~
You just summed up our attacking style in a simple sentence.

4464~~~
Dude, you cannot hail a player based on 1 goal. Are you serious?
Rooney scored a hat-track against Brugg, maybe we should make him our player of the season.
Seriously though, Depay has been terrible. No ifs or buts. Rooney and Depay are our worst first teamers.

4465~~~
I see you fail to notice I mention his form last season as well?? He was tearing people to shreds last year and he's only 21 years old playing in the toughest league in the world. 

You suggest we write of all promising young players after a few months of poor performances?

4466~~~
His confidence is low. Give the lad time. He will be a lot stronger next season and you can quote me on that.

4467~~~
as atrocious as he's been for large parts of the season I'm not ready to write him off just yet as he's just 21 years old and adopting to a new week. he's also shown flashes of brilliance, albeit few and far between.

4468~~~
He is nothing more than potential and is more likely nothing.

4469~~~
Was he really though? He scored a few goals was strong and direct in a piss poor league. He was hardly Hazard in his Lille days, in terms of silky movements etc.

4470~~~
He is young and playing for a new team that isnt functioning and is under huge pressure.
He hasnt been great, but there are plenty of other things we need to look at before we get to him.

4471~~~
Yeah, if you want to.

4472~~~
The seasons Ozil and Lamela are having show that we really need to persist with Memphis and give him the best chance to make it here.

4473~~~

4474~~~
He chats shit but this time he's right

4475~~~
And like any good pro there had to be a positive response …

4476~~~
I think given him a start against Sheff united and see if he can make an impact get his confidence going again, I have faith in the lad.

4477~~~
We usually always play our strongest side in the cup.

He's not part of that. 

With our recent run, we need to build up momentum.

4478~~~
<a class="username" data-user="12627, @Gambit" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/12627/">@Gambit</a>  still sure he will be a superstar (on the football pitch)?

4479~~~
Yes.

4480~~~
I'd keep giving him a chance personally, he's hardly been the only player under-performing, and it is what you expect from a young player moving to a new league.  He's shown he has skill a few times, just not often enough, seems crazy to throw him in the failure pile already, sure Fergie would have given him more chances.

4481~~~
What does him buying Rolls Royce's or dressing in shit rapper clothes have to do with his performances or his supposedly bad attitude?

4482~~~
You're not allowed to enjoy the trappings of your wealth if you're not playing well on the pitch. It's the unwritten rule of football.

He's supposed to be at home in a darkened room, dressed in a burlap sack and concentrating on getting his form back. Preferably on a diet of dust and self flagellation.

4483~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4484~~~
120.000 a week salary. The 21 year olds of the 70 and 80's got a silk cut cigarette and a jordache jeans. How times have changed.

4485~~~
Better than Mata.

4486~~~
Wish Roy Keane was still a player here just for the explosion when Memphis turned up in new Roller after bad performance and loss.

4487~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Quality.

4488~~~
Not a thing, it's just things people bring it up when players are not performing well.

4489~~~
Is that Quincy Promes?

4490~~~
Could mean that he has gotten too comfortable. Now that he is earning that kinda money he thinks he has 'made it' and thus isn't training as hard or showing the desire to perform. Or that he has distractions off the pitch which means he isn't as focused as he could be and that is impacting upon his performance.

Of course that is just what 'could' have happened. Not saying I agree with it necessarily.

4491~~~
Eh, no!

4492~~~
Could get away with cheating and having affairs if he plays well though.

4493~~~
He can't dress half as good as Mata nevermind play football.

4494~~~
It's been less than half a year since this thread was created. Looking at the first page, how the fans have turned on him so quick.

4495~~~
Yep, very fickle. He's not been good enough so far, but it's way too soon to be giving up on him or turning against him. Even if he was a mature, finished-product player it would be too soon, and he's still a fairly raw kid. Two years younger than Lingard, remember.

You're allowed to not want someone to start games at the moment whilst also believing that he can be an important player for the team in the future.

4496~~~
We paid £19.25m with add ons of only a few million, the figure of £30m was incorrect because it's actually 30m euros that the fee could rise to which isn't much when you consider how well he did last season not just in the dutch league but Europa too.

He has the potential, he needs to improve on a few things but that's expected, it's much too early to write him off especially when you look at the overall performance of the team.

4497~~~
Good cameo


Gonna give him my motm for that 20 min.

4498~~~
I've been his biggest critic, but the only player with any substance today.

4499~~~
MOTM (for us) comfortably.

4500~~~
Man of the match for me. Hopefully he'll do it against Premier League opposition as well.

4501~~~
Came on and changed the look of the game. The only one to actually try and do something.

4502~~~
Absolute cretins on BBC are calling it a dive. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

One of the most stonewall penalties you'll ever see.

4503~~~
Seems at this moment he's a better impact sub than a starter.

4504~~~
Just seemed the only player willing to commit a player and take someone on, ignore the nonsense some have spouted here that he's too big, can't dribble or take a player on. Encouraging stuff.

4505~~~
looked very lively today, hopefully he can keep on improving on this performance because he is exactly the kind of player our attack is screaming for.

4506~~~
He got spiked in the left shin pretty clearly. Not a dive for me.

4507~~~
Seriously? fecktards. You could actually see the stud mark when he pulled his sock down!

4508~~~
Will be a star for us if he can get his act together.

4509~~~
Crazy, few people said it in the match thread too. He got a full set of studs to his left shin, absolutely stone wall penalty.

4510~~~
Didn't even appeal ffs, was too busy trying to pry the studs back out of his shinbone. Dive my arse.

4511~~~
Looked lively when he came on. Win us the game as well

4512~~~
Plays 15 minutes. Takes two shots, both crap. Wins a penalty and the man of the match by a mile... That's Manchester United of 2016.

4513~~~
A positive performance from him eventually, won us the game.

4514~~~
I wouldn't say the shots were crap. They were off target, but at least he attempted something.

Did really well to win the penalty. Good performance from him.

4515~~~
Depay should be our 4th choice winger but the problem we have is Mata and Lindergard are so far away from the standard we need. Hopefully we buy Mane and Moura what a boost that would be for us. Darmain looks wanting as well.

4516~~~
Really lively today. Caused all sorts of problems in those 20 mins. Lingard was good too. Direct Running with Pace. It's the simplest formula for creating chaos. In the first replay I saw, I thought it was a dive too (Just the way he was falling down), but the second replay showed it was a clear Pen.

4517~~~
I'm not trying to take anything away from a half decent cameo. Just using that to highlight how pathetic we are.

4518~~~
Ahh, fair enough. We really are dire.

4519~~~
They weren't crap. Plenty of Power on those shots, Had the keeper scrambling.

4520~~~
Perky cameo.  Hope it's fills his confidence abit

4521~~~
I can see why people are calling it a dive - as he did quite deliberately throw himself to he ground. However, I think it's also reasonably clear that he does so in a failed attempt to avoid having his leg planted at the point the guy's studs crash in to it.

Obvious penalty.

4522~~~
Enjoyed his positivity today, we need more of that in our team

4523~~~
You see what a bit of positivity does Louis?

That run he did to win the penalty was great and he showed a real determination to make an attacking contribution as soon as he came on.

4524~~~
Read what you've posted. He had the keeper scrambling... I guess it's progress.

4525~~~
Under Fergie you'd bank on him becoming a genuine star.

4526~~~
Was decent when he come on. Tried to force the issue and got his reward. Good cameo.

4527~~~
He showed some fight today, though it was Sheffield and they were tiring. The same can't be said for some of the more senior players.

4528~~~
sometimes he feels like Sanchez a bit strongly built little palyer who has brst of pace if he wants but he looks half the Chilean energy, he did good today but far from convincing, wonder what's his next game will be, is he gonna try too hard next game or will he paly more freely and look like he doesn't give a feck which almost felt like it today, despite that he was able to release a couple of shits and winning the penalty so I guess there is plenty of space for improvement

4529~~~
I know what I posted. Would you much rather prefer the shot being aimed directly at the keeper ? Or skied into the top tier ? I'm no expert, but those kind of shots are what I would normally label as 'Crap'.

4530~~~
Neither was on target. Who cares if he had the keeper scrambling? And yes, what's the difference between him shooting wide and shooting into row Z? Don't get me wrong, I thought he was quite decent, but those shots weren't great.

4531~~~
Best of an atrocious lot. Won us the game.

4532~~~
I felt they were decent attempts, he really put his laces through it and for just a small millisecond, I thought it might just go in of the post.

4533~~~
Looked lively when he came on. Actually tried to make things happen.

Was encouraging to see.

4534~~~
It was a dive and a foul apparently...



Football journalism is the biggest joke. Clueless twats getting paid to go to games and write nonsense.

4535~~~
I think the overall shitness of the entire team makes those shots actually look like rays of positivity.

4536~~~
What a couple of tossers <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4537~~~
I just realized he is a shit version of Hulk. Still saved our skin today though, MOTM.

4538~~~
Maybe, I'm just glad we avoided a replay.

4539~~~
Good on him, did nothing great but was still the difference in the end.

LvG might have something to say about his speculative shots from range though...

4540~~~
He has the ability to beat a man yet he chooses to cut in almost all the time. He needs to improve on these aspects to get better

4541~~~
Still not convinced his attitude is right. He even came across as too cool to warm up.

4542~~~
Looks a little leaner than before and a bit quicker off the mark. Seems more likely to win one on ones at the minute, and he did well to win the penalty.

4543~~~
I think that's more to do with the fact that he had space to run into. In the PL, whenever he gets the ball, its from a standing position.

4544~~~
Hope he gains some confidence from that.

4545~~~
Even before the run which earned penalty, he was my MoM. Tells a lot about overall display that but it was nice to see that he at least had intention to create/do something. Won't be a bad idea to give him a start next game.

4546~~~
What did he do?<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

4547~~~
He didn't really have the space through. No more than he gets in a PL game. They sat so deep, and whenever the ball went out wide, 3 of them would push towards him or Martial. There was no room to run behind. No PL team will defend as deep as that. He should be getting more space in regular league games. even when he did pick the ball up in standing positions, he was looking a little more agile when cutting in or going around the outside. I don't think he looks as big as he did a few months ago.

4548~~~
Actually, in the PL games, whenever he gets the ball, he is almost immediately double teamed. I didn't see that here. Neither him nor Memphis were given that level of attention. I remember in the first half Martial just kept taking the ball forward and forward from the left wing and the defenders just kept taking a step back and back and were standing off him. Same thing happened with Memphis on 1 or two ocassions.

4549~~~
I agree with them to be honest, it was a penalty but he obviously made a meal of it, very overly dramatic. 

He did well when he came on though, only one that looked a threat and good work for the penalty.

4550~~~
His best 20 minutes for some time, he was strong and direct and in the end won us the game.

4551~~~
There was numerous occasions where 3 men would smother both Martial and Memphis when they were on the left. The two long range shots he took were the cause of 2 or 3 coming at Memphis quickly and not letting him go down the wing, and he had to make a large pivot to cut inside. Martial as well was rarely given space to make those direct runs into the box he so often does. Numerous times he was blocked off outside the box or right on the touchline, and quite rightly. Those runs are when Martial makes mincemeat of his opposite number. They'd have been daft to let him do that.

4552~~~
Fairly obvious those two never played football then and don't know that sort of tackle is actually painful even if you wear shin guards.

4553~~~
yeah, the Memphis shots were when he was marked by 2-3 players. on that left side. But he was pretty much direct with his running the other times. He was  always quickly released by either CBJ or BFS with some space to make use of. Let's see if you are right, we'll find out soon enough anyway. I just have a feeling it will be more of the same if he starts the game.

4554~~~
It possibly will be more of the same, as his decision making is hot and cold. I do think he looks a little more nimble recently though. Earlier in the season, he looked like he was about to burst out of his shirt.

4555~~~
Did well. Looks dangerous and actually took shots on goal. Won us the match. Hopefully he gains confidence from this.

4556~~~
He did over exaggerate slightly but every footballer on the planet would have reacted the same. Hardly criticism worthy from the twitter twats. It was clearly a foul.

4557~~~
Looked quick today, which was promising

4558~~~
He has been playing quite tense since arriving so I imagine that'll go some way to seeing some more relaxed performances from him in the future.

4559~~~
His first season (only just half way) in a new country for a new club that hardly has movement. As ive said before, some of the criticism for him has been harsh especially as hes still young. Theres no way he should have played as much as he did early in the season (and it drained him mentally and physically).

He should be rotating with Young tbh on the left hand side (and Maybe Martial in tough away matches of European matches).

He will probably be frustrating the next match, but at least he continues to try stuff. Glad he was positive today, what pace and urgency on a wing can do.

4560~~~
Was decent today.  I really want to see him play more.

He's young and he will have games where he is utterly awful... but I'd like to see us persevere with him and give him the chance to learn because he has such huge potential.

He shouldn't have to worry that he will be confined to the bench if he has an off day... let him and the other young players express themselves without fear.

4561~~~
How did he make a meal out of it?! These journos talk utter shite. The only player out there who looked like he actually wanted to score a goal, he probably deserved to take the penalty for his efforts.

4562~~~
Very good when he came on today. Almost definitely pissed off Van Gaal because he took the ball and ran at defenders with it and tried to make things happen, or had a shot from range. He's unlucky with the circumstances that he came here I think. Normally, he would have came here like how Nani came back in 2007. Potential, at a decent level, but won't be starting every week, and have a world class player to look up to and take the pressure off you so you can develop normally. We don't have that and worst of all, the style doesn't help any of our players, especially not one like him.

4563~~~
He needed this.

4564~~~
I think he should be playing all the time, he is frustrating and his attitude is questionable at times but he can make things happen and he actually has attempts at goal. 

Passing the ball side to side all the time is pointless, everyone knows how to play against us, everyone knows how to stop it and if LVG persists with all these similar players nothing is going to change.

4565~~~
He gets plenty of stick when things don't come off for him, so let's give him credit when they do. He was the only one to bring a bit of energy to the play, and something for the crowd to feed off.

4566~~~
Impressive cameo. Hopefully he can maintain that now.

4567~~~
Did very well when he came on. Was very positive in his play (which has surely pissed Vangle off and will result in Memphis starting for the u15s next week), which resulted in winning a stonewall penalty.

Should do wonders for his confidence, but I think he should be playing centrally. Was very good against Watford in that position and scored a great goal. I'd like to see him play behind Martial. There were some signs of a potentially great understanding earlier in the season.

4568~~~
Had just as good a cameo from the bench a few weeks ago, before proceeding to be shit again afterwards.

4569~~~
I just can't get around the fact that every time we had the ball out on the left there are three defenders marking Memphis. Either our system doesn't allow other players to pull defenders away or we are just too static in our play. Memphis certainly did well in his cameo but he can't do everything on his own.

4570~~~
He showed real intent to create havoc and that is a BIG plus in comparison to his teammate. I have little doubt he'll a good player, patience is needed because his development will be frustrating for a while.

4571~~~
I really think we should use him as a super sub at the moment.No more,no less.

4572~~~
Please no, not another car!

4573~~~
Him and Pereira did more in 20 mins than Rooney, Mata, Herera and Fellaini combined the whole match. Pereira should get more chances. That ball behind for Lingard or Martial was top drawer and he is very capable of that.

4574~~~
I agree. Young should not have lost his place to Memphis at the start of the season. I think van Gaal placed too much faith in both Memphis and Rooney and it is hurting him now.

4575~~~
Agreed. If we dole out the negatives let's also try to see the positives when they occur. Such as his contribution from the bench yesterday

4576~~~
All his cameo has told me is that bringing him on as a sub if we need a goal (Which we in all likelihood will) is the way to go with him right now.

It's hard to tell how much potential he really has. His best games have come against Championship clubs and an injury hit crap Brugge side. On the other hand his ingenuity against PSV and Southampton were brilliant. What seems obvious that he's at best in the box or running on to passes. Feeding him the ball and asking him to beat his man and make something happen will not work

4577~~~
Did not get a chance to see the game, but it looked like he was good judging from the highlights? Very similar to what I have seen him do in PSV, taking shots from outside the box whenever the opportunity is given to him. Hopefully he continues doing that, It is really what we need right now.

4578~~~
Have we tried him as a right winger? I know he usually plays on the left, but I don't see why we can't at least try him there instead of Mata. He will at least stretch the play and can put in some good crosses, plus I feel like he might have a better time beating the full back on the outside rather than cutting in. I could sort of see him doing the Valencia thing, just running powerfully to the byline and getting the ball in. I think his left foot is good enough that he can still mix it up as well

4579~~~
Shows how low standards are now that a few decent minutes get reactions like...he should be starting every game.

Nani was shipped out while LVG spent 20 million plus on Memphis. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4580~~~
How about we try him a CF again, he did OK against Watford there, Martial stays on the left, Depay upfront, Rooney/Herrera in behind, can't be any worse than what we're seeing now.

4581~~~
at least he had that believe to have a go and try at the goal. with memphis he needs that lift from the fans especially when things are not going that well.

our fans applauding and cheering an attempt from 25 yards though..<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> while it was good for memphis, i never thought i'll be witnessing this.

4582~~~
20M+ is small change for United, especially when invested in a talent such as Memphis. 

Despite his detractors, he fits the profile of a United forward perfectly, and I'm sure he will be a success here.

4583~~~
He's a very direct, counter attacking player, who does best in a team that transitions quickly from defence to attack, but we're now at risk of going over old ground so I'll stop there. 

I watched Real Madrid against Deportivo the other day. Leaving aside the disparity between the two teams, I was impressed by the way Real set up in order to get the most out of their three direct forward players; Benzema, Ronaldo and Bale. Obviously their attack betters ours by a significant margin, but the <i>urgency </i>with which Real played, the desire to get a shot in after 4 or 5 passes was readily apparent to me. I believe Memphis would profit greatly in such a system.

4584~~~
Positive cameo again, worked really hard, good crosses from free kicks, good move before Rooney's goal, great cross, trackinf back, more of the same.

4585~~~
Neglecting his pathetic defending?

4586~~~
Wasn't great but hardly pathetic, fantastic going forward though.

4587~~~
Looked lively when he came on, and had a decent involvement in Rooney's goal. Needs to be able to deliver that over a whole match though.

4588~~~
don't want a player like this near the club. comes on as a sub, last few minutes sees darmian doubled over on the left (why the feck is darmian on the left) and then doesn't track back to help his left back. This is how you concede goals. As a left back myself i would have made my point very clear. He has done nothing to warrant that freedom, take your stupid car back to holland.

4589~~~
? I would fault the effort and not the execution, he pushed Sissoko away (which is hard enough) but sadly couldnt take the ball with him. A lot happened after that as well, which wasnt good.

4590~~~
What was it then? He got robbed on the byline.

4591~~~
surprised he didn't start toay, but will surely start next match. he was lively off the bench again today.

4592~~~
He could've just put it out of play. Though it was a refreshing change to see him actually bother trying to defend.

4593~~~
Nice cameo up the pitch, still needs to learn what to do when a breaking ball is by the box

4594~~~
Can't defend, fantastic in attacking positions, useless when needed at the back.

4595~~~
Like I said, wasn't great but he did well to originally get his body in there in the first place. His attacking play more than compensated for a misjudgement whilst trying go defend, no worse than Mata jogging out block the resulting cross.

4596~~~
Looked good to me tonight. Should've done better for their third, but at the same time there was mistakes before and after.

4597~~~
Better from him tonight and I won't blame the loss on his shite play for their third - the blame for the loss lies squarely with the fecking useless Fellaini.

4598~~~
Can't understand why he wasn't playing earlier given how recklessly Newcastle defended. 

A 2nd great cameo in a row. Should have had an assist too. Fellaini robbed him of it.

4599~~~
He's a liability defensively but thought he looked alright when he came on

4600~~~
It's pointless getting in position and doing feck all.

4601~~~
And then get a corner and when they score from that, blame him as well. Shit happens, get over it. The goal wasnt his to blame, look what happens after.

4602~~~
He has the talent and potential to be one of the best players, now it seems that he is recovering his form. He had a good game, but I expect more of him.

4603~~~
He didn't do feck all though did he? Most players wouldnt have got in a position to make an error in the first place, as I say Mata is probably more to blame for not putting pressure on the crosser.

4604~~~
Not quite a loss but I have to agree. There were chances to have a larger lead before Newcastle scored - and there were mistakes committed before Memphis' in the 3rd Newcastle goal.

4605~~~
We didn't buy the cnut to defend FFS!

4606~~~
He cancelled himself out. Created the last goal but was positionally terrible all game and left Darmian exposed. He has no clue tactically it seems, he was drifting central all the time. He is half a player.

4607~~~
Much better attacking wise. He was going past people and crossing well. Unfortunately all season he has been completely useless at defending.

4608~~~
On comes a player who actually creates, has the run and shot that sets up Rooney's goal and then he sets up Fellaini on a plate. And some of you manage to write him off again. You'd probably be happy with the drab 0-0 we usually serve up.
He has troubles defending, but the whole team was all over the place defensively. He's certainly looking better offensively, and we really need that.

4609~~~
What happened after was Smalling winning a difficult header and somebody banging it in via a deflection. Are you really trying to claim that putting the ball out of play was not the right choice?

4610~~~
What did he do then?

4611~~~
I don't quite get your point.

4612~~~
You forgot Mata not closing down the crosser to stop the ball coming in in the first place.

4613~~~
Did very well I thought and I've been a fierce critic of him.

4614~~~
So was almost every player on the pitch tonight. Even Rooney when he moved to AM role.

4615~~~
Quite simply, he makes things happen in attack.

4616~~~
It's a simple question. What did he do to help our defence? Get into position and then lose it? This is a good thing?

4617~~~
That doesn't equate to pathetic mate, players occasionally lose out in challenges, like Lingard did when getting fortunate after fouling in the box, and the dozens of other fouls committed on the pitch.

4618~~~
He commits players and plays with intent, other than Martial we don't have that in this side.

4619~~~
It does. He literally did nothing. He was looking infield instead of putting it out of play. Even f he had tried to clear it he was looking to do it across goal which is absolutely moronic.

4620~~~
He's a winger. It's part of the job description. If he wants to be excused defensive responsibilities then he'll need to do a lot better when he's attacking.

4621~~~
It doesn't, it's an error than he was only able go make because he had the power and pace to get back there in the first place, would you expect any better from any of our other wide men?

4622~~~
Why didnt Smalling head it away in the right direction, or why didnt he deflect the ball the other direction, oh dear (exaggeration). Fault the effort if it isnt there, but sometimes the execution is just unlucky, poor, too bad. Wouldnt make that much out of it when an attacker pushes off a midfielder but couldnt bring the ball with him. Too bad, but pathetic defending nah.

4623~~~
Looks a different player recently. Biggest thing for me is that he's taking people on like he actually means it, and because of that is getting a lot of success. Let's hope he can turn it into full match performances now.

4624~~~
Which I said made a refreshing change because he doesn't normally bother. My point is what's the point in doing it if you're going to do feck all when you actually get there. How it can be described as anything other than shite defending is baffling.

4625~~~
Depay is improving offensively and I think if we're to quality in the top four, we'll need a strong finish from Depay. I do wish though we'd have kept Nani (as well as Rafa). I think we have left ourselves too bare.

4626~~~
Okay. It was super defending. Well done Memphis. Thanks for tracking back for the first time since Stoke when you fecked up trying to play the ball infield too.

4627~~~
Again what one of our wide men would've done any better?

4628~~~
Ashley Young probably. It's not really relevant mind you. We're talking about Depay. If you'd like a conversation about the defensive ability of our wide players start a topic. Depay won't be at the top of any sane persons list mind you.

4629~~~
Nah, I'd say Darmian being a bit crap left Darmian exposed.

4630~~~
He has shown in the last couple of matches that he can inject something useful to our attack, I think he needs more time to adjust, he needs to play regularly.

4631~~~
Depay was not doing his defensive duties. Lingard did. If you have a sub par defender it is especially important, no?

4632~~~
I'm enjoying his positivity in the last two games.

It looks like he wants to prove a point which is good.

4633~~~
Memphis was more dangerous in attack though. Lingard was crap in the 2nd half

4634~~~
Good run that led to Rooney's 2nd goal and put in a fantastic cross that Fellaini should have buried, I'd say it was a good cameo in attack which in fairness is what he's here to do. He's putting the effort in to track back more than he was but he's positionally poor at helping his fullback, something exposed by the lack of mobility in the double pivot and without a top LB.

4635~~~
Yeah I'd agree with that. He's just not very good at LB

4636~~~
The winger who is primarily a defender now who got exposed a couple of times today as it is? You've singled out this mistake and called it pathetic, yet it's something you wouldn't expect any of our other wingers to do any better with, it's completely relevant.

4637~~~
It's not relevant. Shite defending is shite defending regardless of who does it. Should we not criticise somebody making a mistake just because another equally useless player wouldn't do any better? That would be stupid.

4638~~~
Yes, much in the same way as I wouldn't call Smalling pathetic for missing a one on one, you've completely exaggerated an error that most players playing in his position would've made anyway.

4639~~~
It's unfounded and I'm not one to speculate usually but I do think his team mates aren't the biggest fan of his

4640~~~
Granted, attacking wise he did make a difference - and he did show some desire to win the ball back a few times.

But the moment he lost the ball out towards the full back area I knew a Newcastle goal was imminent.

Luke Shaw, I miss you so much!

4641~~~
He's primarily here to attack and that he did well. His defensive contributions could've been better, but he was showing effort, which always a good sign. It's not like we were a fortress at the back prior to him coming on either.

4642~~~
A lot happened after he was robbed on the byline. TBH we shouldnt have been in that position, but yeah he needs to be smarter going forward. Next time he needs to just put his foot through the ball, put it for a corner if need be or hook it out for a throw in.

But I think this is how he should be used. Rotating and not playing every minute in his first season. Him and Lingard rotating (or him and Martial, whatever) which will help him and the club.

4643~~~
Did very well again I thought. Can't blame him solely for conceding that goal, was comical defending from everyone, and he's more a forward/winger anyways, while the others at fault were defenders and center mids. What he did do well was create the space for Rooney's goal and made a sitter for Fellaini. Should be starting more I think. Put Rooney as the 10, Martial up top, Fellaini on the bench, and Lingard and Memphis on the wings and have us play a counter attacking style. We'll be much better for it.

4644~~~
He really should be able to do what he done for Fellaini's chance more often.

4645~~~
Because kicking the ball out of play is as difficult as scoring a goal? Don't be ridiculous.

4646~~~
He's a forward,  he needs to play as part of a front three or not at all.  He's a good player,  let him play.

4647~~~
He's a winger. That's where he's being played. That involves defending. He doesn't do anywhere near enough while attacking to justify his complete lack of work ethic going back.

4648~~~
Why are so many making it out as if he never runs back, he was back every time we were defending and he did make a tackle. Yes he's not the best defensively but he's a Winger ffs

4649~~~
Look at the third goal about from a minute earlier. He does not track back and lets Janmaat cause a 3 vs 2 against Darmian and covering CM. As a result Darmian is all over the place and a cross comes in and play develops further resulting in the goal. The problem was he got lazy and took the easy option of a token gesture of pressing their central defender and stayed upfield in no mans land instead of tracking his man. In the final minutes protecting a slender lead, having been on for 30 or so minutes, imo that defending was criminal.

I actually saw that in real time and was thinking this is going to feck us.

4650~~~
Or at RB, for that matter.

4651~~~
Memphis can be or is a fine player but lack balls. Watching him play in the prem is frustrating, not sure whether he thinks he deserves more protection or avoiding an injury. Not saying he should go do a Jones but he has to stop trying to cheat the play. 
His tendency to duck out of challenges by dangling his leg halfway before withdrawing is annoying and affecting his all round performance. 
Like his attacking displays lately though and a positive development for a player that's been struggling with form, hopefully he keeps it up as expected.

4652~~~
Make your mind up, you were applauding his work getting back a few posts ago.

4653~~~
He drifts infield far too often too hoping to get a pass so he can get his 30 yard shot on goal.

He has to be positionally disciplined and defend from the front because only when you are as good as Messi, Ronaldo or David Silva can you be so slack.

Memphis is along way from that level. He has talent that is obvious but he needs to be more of a team player.

4654~~~
Looked good again. His defensive game is not really a priority right now so I'm not too bothered.

I'd still limit him to sub appearances for now though

4655~~~
He is improving and is starting to make contributions, a good option to have off the bench for now though.

4656~~~
Was very good when he came on imo.

4657~~~
Should have had an assist if not for that guy.

4658~~~
That was an excellent cross for Felli. It looked so effortless.

4659~~~
Did well when he came on, his directness got us the 3rd goal and Fellaini. The fact the game was very stretched suited him down to the ground as well.

4660~~~
I said it made a refreshing change to see him actually attempt to get back into a defensive position. My mind has been firm in him being both reluctant to defend and shite when he actually bothers.

4661~~~
Does hit shot for Rooneys goal count as an assist?

Fellaini should of buried that cross. Considering Rooney has to start, I'd like to see Memphis given a run on the left, Lingard on the right and Rooney in behind.

4662~~~
Start against Liverpool?

4663~~~
Clearly, you originally didn't bother to acknowledge how well he did going forward, concentrating on the defensive aspect of an attacking player instead.

4664~~~
He was okay going forward. One good move and one shit shot that rebounded to Rooney. Defence is part of his job and his failure to do it cost us a goal in the last minute.

4665~~~
So you down play his involvement in the goal but highlight his part in the one we conceded? His shot led directly to the goal and a cross that should've lead to another, his challenge was proceeded by two failed clearances, a deflection and failure to charge down a cross properly before they scored! Your bias is showing a little here...

4666~~~
Now the goal is because of Depay's failure, credit to you for holding on so long..

4667~~~
Eh?

4668~~~
I think as a winger it's pretty normal to not sprint back every time you concede possession. The midfield are supposed to shift across to offer the numbers whilst the team falls into a defensive shape, no?

4669~~~
If he,Rooney and Martial can start playing well, I reckon we have a decent chance of top 4.

4670~~~
Agreed, though I think you're being harsh. It was another bright cameo, which included a nice run to destabilise Newcastle's defence - which led to Rooney's goal - and then a wonderful cross to Fellaini, who should have scored. However, as soon as he came on, our left side was exposed and we looked terrible defensively, and I don't think that's a coincidence. He's used to not putting a shift in - often playing high on the left, waiting for an opportunity to counter the opposition, which explains why he's inept defensively.

I think Memphis' hesitation on the ball is what causes him lots of problems, and it's good to see that he's looking more confident when he picks the ball up. But right now, LvG is managing him perfectly. Bringing him on against tired opposition and allowing him to express him freely has obviously worked really well in the last two games.

4671~~~
I think so. Mr. Philosophy will drop Lingard to the bench for missing that chance.

4672~~~
I don't think hitting a shit shot and a striker having to hit a great strike to lead to a goal is a particularly strong piece of attacking play. He did very well for Fellaini's chance. My only bias is towards what is best for Utd. Depay has been a flop so far. His attacking play has not justified his awful defensive play.

4673~~~
A winger is part of the midfield. Two central midfielders can't deal with their central midfield and their full backs.

4674~~~
Think that's a big part of where LVG's formation is getting it wrong. In a 442, absolutely, the two wide players have a lot of defensive responsibilities. But in a 433, the forward players should be able to concentrate purely on attack, and pressing in the opposition half. 

Not like you often see any of Suarez, Messi or Neymar tracking full backs into their own area.

4675~~~
Not at all, were you in the other player threads equally criticising players there after every mistake? You've made a conscious effort to exaggerate mistakes and downplay the frankly very good aspects of his performance. From your comments it's evidently clear you've already decided he was shit and no performance would change your mind, you've not viewed the game objectively at all.

4676~~~
Do you go into every player thread after a game? Try not to be a hypocrite about this. I don't think he's particularly good, you're right. Performances like last night won't change that because any good he did going forward was negating by his part in us dropping two points. I won't be engaging with you anymore however as you're going on ignore. Enjoy.

4677~~~
In most one striker systems .. Wingers are in attack, not midfield

4678~~~
That's not how we play at all.

4679~~~
You are being harsh, ignore his position as every player has a responsibility to defend, but other defensive players made less attacking contribution and were equally as poor defensively

4680~~~
Are you purposely obtuse? We play with two wingers, who last night were more inside forwards than anything else, they cut inside, especially Memphis..

4681~~~
Its not even as if he didnt defend, he did, but didnt get the ball. Watched the highlights and it's nowhere near as big of a deal as he's making, he makes it look as if he just stood there doing nothing.

4682~~~
Exactly,and to be more fair he has come from a team only last season where he didn't have to defend, adapting to how VG wants him to play the role won't be instant, he came on at a time where we needed to attack and he did that, good cameo, far from perfect but he looked good

4683~~~
Okay. If you think our wide players aren't expected to defend then there's no point debating with you.

4684~~~
When did I say that? Can you read?

4685~~~
Top post.

4686~~~
If I were to comment in the Rooney thread the fact he messed up a half chance inside the box wouldn't be my <b>only</b> contribution to it, nor would I downplay anything he did well either. You're not looking at the game objectively and you've already formed an opinion on his performance based on past games before you've even seen him play. That's the difference.

4687~~~
Yes. Can you debate less agressively? He has defensive responsibilities in the position he plays in. Whether he cuts in or not he is part of the midfield. He's shite at it.

4688~~~
Also been crap

4689~~~
Enough is enough with this donkey.

4690~~~
Dude is awful. I wouldn't have him on the bench.

4691~~~
Has to learn to keep the ball when we're under pressure.

4692~~~
A terrible cameo but in fairness to him this was a tough game to come in.

4693~~~
Thought he was defensively superb today, came and and stopped them creating anything down their left today

4694~~~
We just beat Liverpool at Anfield. You're allowed to enjoy it for a couple of hours at least  ffs.

4695~~~
Jesus Christ some people on this place. Enjoy the win ffs! He actually did well defensively.

4696~~~
Tried to score at the end and lost the ball when we needed to keep possession. You have to defend from the front too.

4697~~~
Didn't do much and didn't get a chance to do much either but the knives are already out. Where's the abuse for Martial losing the ball several times?

4698~~~
His first touch was also an awful clearance that put Liverpool back on the attack but we will forgive him that as he just came on the pitch.

4699~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4700~~~
Lacked composure on the break I thought.

4701~~~
He is technically very poor but today is not a day to be angry.

4702~~~
He is too one dimensional--Cut in and shoot, rinse and repeat. He looks a bit slow as well..

4703~~~
There was a counter where he was going to be one on one with the keeper if he could just get past his marker. It's speaks volumes that I had zero confidence a chance was going to come out it. 
He didn't disappoint, the defender came out on top quite easily.

4704~~~
Just seen this bump <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4705~~~
Some of you are just ridiculous. "Cut in and shoot, rinse and repeat" - most goals he's created came from beating his man to the line on their left ffs.

4706~~~
Great win but a terrible player. But anyone that watched a bit of Eredivisie could see that Wijnaldum was the guy to buy not that flashy knob.

4707~~~
Could this be the next Anderson.Full of potential.

4708~~~
Some people on here....give the young lad a break. I stand by the fact his time here went downhill once Shaw was injured. He had some decent performance in Europe and score goals. A bit more patience and less knee jerk, we might have two of the brightest attacking prospects in Europe.

4709~~~
We might but there's nothing other than hope and blind faith that suggests it. If he plays for anyone else people here would be falling over themselves laughing at him.

4710~~~
What goals were they?

4711~~~
Hope and blind faith? What about giving him the benefit of time or don't we do that anymore with young players. Attitudes like that will prevent any potential young player to come here.

4712~~~
Anyone with the exception of our scouting department and our manager who actually coached Wijnaldum for 2 years..

4713~~~
He's getting the benefit of time. Me giving an honest opinion on a football forum isn't going to stop players signing for us. What makes you think he could be one of the best young players in Europe? Lingard could be one of the best young players in Europe too but it's bloody unlikely.

4714~~~
Exactly. If Wijnaldum was that good, whys he ended up at Newcastle. It's funny cause PSV, Spurs and Liverpool scouts must have Sh1t in there eyes too....

4715~~~
Calm down. Completely different playing for Newcastle than it is player for a massive club like United with all the pressure it brings. One thing we always hear about Memphis is that he works really hard and is determined to be the best. We need to give him time.

4716~~~
Benefit of time isn't reflected in the comments on here. Sometimes people forget it's someone's son or brother they are making those comments about. Forums are a reflection of fans opinion and despite of how much money players are making, fans opinions count when your living in the city you play for with your family. PSV weren't talking to Lingard or the last time I looked, he's not been to a WC either.

I'm sure the likes of you weren't saying don't buy him cause he's going to be crap, no more than predicting what's going to happen in the future either. What about support the young players and a bit of patience before writing anyone off before they've even been here one season....

4717~~~
I can only judge him on what I've seen. So far he's been useless. Hopefully he gets better but this idea he just needs support and he will one of the best around is nonsense. He needs a lot more ability for that. My words or your words have absolutely no bearing.

4718~~~
the 5 he has, as per the top of this exact page.

4719~~~
That his total assists. How many came from beating a player to the line and crossing? The ones that instantly come to my mind are the cut in and cross against Bruges. The cut in and pass away to Bruges. His pass through the middle against Ipswich and him shooting and hitting the post against Southampton.

4720~~~
The majority of his goals and assists came from a position coming diagonal from the left either with or without the ball. His goal against PSV is an example.

4721~~~
He is capable of a good final ball, he's been inconsistent with it at United however; Brugge cross to Fellaini, the almost-winner against Newcastle are a couple examples.

4722~~~
Which is what was initially said. He's incredibly predictable. As it goes he has no assists outside of games against Bruges or Ipswich.

4723~~~
It seems pretty obvious that he's not as gifted as the likes of Martial and Sterling in terms of close control and being in complete control of the ball in tight situations. However, hopefully what we've seen this season is a bad representation of him in this regard, and even if he's not going to match the above two in the same, he can still do it to the acceptable level required at a club like United, and make the most of his other supposed strengths such as strength, invention, crossing and shooting.

If his season doesn't burst into life before the end of the season, we have an important decision on our hands, whether to put faith in him for next season, or send him out on loan to regain his mojo. Personally, I'd send him out on loan if LVG stays for next season, and give him a shot (in pre season till august) in case we hire a new manager whose system uses him better.

4724~~~
You only have to go back one game to find him beating his man and putting in a delightful ball to Fellaini on the outside or the game before when he won us a penalty by beating his man on the outside.

4725~~~
I'd start him against Southampton.

4726~~~
His body language is signaling he's submissive nowadays. Ever since that idiotic header that almost cost Van Gaal job he's been looking ashamed. I still think Van Gaal should keep him under restriction and make him prove he's a superstar instead of just trying to look like one. I'm not impressed with these guys born in the 90's who show up with their freaking caps, hair and tattoos as if they were some sort of Mexican gang member/black american gangster rapper. You're a footballer ffs, not a manga toy. No way SAF would have had any of this.

4727~~~
Yeah right....
I dont care how many caps or tattoos they have, as long as they perform well. Dont see a correlation at all. In the end, it's the talent and attitude that counts for young players
BTW, Messi has one arm fully tattoed...

4728~~~
Yeah, but Messi looks like a white indie rocker, and not a black rapper!

4729~~~
Looks like it counts only for black players then

4730~~~
I have been thinking about it hard and long. I have conducted some research, watched our matches over again where he has played and come to the conclusion that We have bought a dutch donkey, who can only do one thing that is cut in on his right foot and he fails miserably at it too.  I never wanted us to sign him, We bought a 30 million pound donkey!

4731~~~
Matteo Darmian is a devout Christian who abhors tattoos but he's struggled just as much as Memphis. Somehow, I don't think the ink on his skin and the length at which he grows his mutton chops is what is affecting his game.

4732~~~
Mutton chops affect aerodynamics and tattoos add unnecessary weight, that's why we are seeing a slower Memphis who can't beat his man....basic science.

4733~~~
He definitely needs a loan. He looks a million miles away from being able to compete for a place in a top team. With most signings like this you can see the raw potential, but poor decision making is obscuring the talent. With this kid I struggle to see the potential and he doesn't seem to have a great work ethic either, which is damning for a 21 year old who's been given such an opportunity. The strength, crossing and invention you talk about I've yet to see against decent opposition.

Januzaj should be far ahead of him in the pecking order, who himself also needs a loan at a club like Bournemouth.

4734~~~
That's not what the post I replied to stated. The fact he's predictable is barely up for debate.

4735~~~
we should give him a game on the right, just put your head down, beat a man and put a cross in.

4736~~~
if that were true, that would mean both players would have to go on loan... you really think that's a good idea?

4737~~~
It kind of is, the original post being along the lines of 'cut inside and shoot, rinse and repeat'. The fact he's provided two absolute quality chances from beating his man on the outside as opposed to cutting in shows he isn't as predictable as being made out, so yeah very much up for debate.

4738~~~
Based on what? He was utter crap for Dortmund

4739~~~
Based on the fact that in his career he's actually had a good season in the top flight and been able to show that his talents can make a difference at a club like United. Being in poor form after proving yourself somewhat should put you ahead of someone in equally poor form who's never proven themselves.

Definitely. Neither are near the quality we require yet but we shouldn't completely write them off either because of their age. Both need loans to a lower Premier League club.

4740~~~
He's just been painfully average, if that. I'm not sure I'm seeing this awesome potential others have seen in him, or a reason why he cost us £30 million. Currently he looks no better a signing value for money wise than Bebe. We could have bought Shaqiri for £10 million who looks no worse. I do think we should give him next season before getting rid, but there's no point keeping him any longer if hes still shite and doing what we did with the likes of Anderson.

4741~~~
Nani had no tattoos but he was hated just the same. United fans would rather have a non talented but hardworking drone on the flank than a lazy/inconsistent but talented one.

4742~~~
Messi also won a couple of things. Depay should keep his mouth shut and play football.

4743~~~
Like what, whats he been saying recently?

4744~~~
What the actual feck are you on about?

4745~~~
Something in the line of you have to learn how to walk before you can run?

4746~~~
Yes. But that has nothing to do if he has a tattoo or wears a cap. Or are only successful players allowed to have a tattoo?

4747~~~
No, only players who doesn't run a risk of looking like a Mexican cartel thug or a black american gangster rapper (white gangster rapper is fine, obviously).

4748~~~
Ah so he's got the wrong ethnic background go be allowed one then...

4749~~~
The one sensible comment and it just slips under the radar.

4750~~~
H
He's not a winger, though. He didn't make his name as a guy who crosses for others to score.
He's a wide forward. His best work is the 'forward' type stuff (i.e. shooting, running onto through balls, being dangerous once he's gathered momentum...)

He's a counter-attacking wide forward, not a winger in a possession team.

4751~~~
And where exactly in the theory of evolution is it allowed to get a tattoo or wear a cap before internet feckwits call you a gangbanger?

4752~~~
It doesn't though. Because that is about the only moments of him doing it to any effect that anyone could pick out this season. Watch him play and it's obvious. If he played for Liverpool not a Utd fan on this forum would rate him.

4753~~~
Yeah they hated Ronaldo too didn't they. They'd rather have something who can perform. This talent Depay allegedly has is bloody well hidden.

4754~~~
Good post.

4755~~~
To be fair Fergie made Bebe cut his dreads off.

4756~~~
Really it's not, like against Sunderland and against Brugge, but there's really no point discussing it as you'll try to downplay anything he's done or going to do, just like against Newcastle the only thing you'd mention was a minor error.

4757~~~
I dont know much about tattoo's but I am pretty sure it had little to do with evolution.. 
Keane pretty much said the same thing but it had less gangbangers in it.  It goes something like before you act like you're all that. You have to do all that and win all that. 
I totally get what he meant, Memphis has been rubbish all season but he acts like he's King of that clan..

4758~~~
Ronaldo was always hardworking. Maybe not in the valencia/headless chicken way but he would learn from his mistakes and improve. If he was brought down he would clean the dust and continue. Young players are by nature inconsistent and prone to pass from rough patches. They should be careful not to attract too much attention of the wrong type. That's why saf used to keep a close watch at promising kids (ex giggs, )

4759~~~
I know, but it requires less thinking that way and may give him a confidence boost. I genuinely believe it's all in his head.

4760~~~
Okay so fans don't like players that don't work hard is what you're saying? Is this strange to you?

4761~~~
This thread represents the true nature of Utd fans. I was always brought up thinking we were a special club with special fans but it seems that we are just like all the other moneybag clubs that don't give a flying monkey about young players. There a litter all people in this thread abusing him with names and racist comments how the hell can you justify that even if Memphis has underperformed. I don't understand why people can't just reserved judgment for a couple of years and under a new manager at the very least.

4762~~~
No mate, the thread represents the culture we've become accustomed to with regards to players over the years.  a number of people don't seem to give players the time to adjust to united / English football etc and I agree with you there 

The true nature of a united fan is to love the club and support players who play for it, those who slate a 20 year old who moves to a new league and country and struggles aren't the fans I know as all my mates understand it will take time with elvis

4763~~~
This thread is always upseting, he is discrete, he doesn't talk much, he doesn't act badly on the field but he is still abused by his own fans. He is only 21 years old, he is still developping and he isn't used to possession football or the PL, he is the perfect example of players who need time and support.

4764~~~
Should people just blindly pretend he's been great or that he doesn't look to have much talent?

4765~~~
This thread is proper shit. Questioning his tattoos, saying he looks like a Mexican drug cartel/Black gangsta rapper.. feck me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4766~~~
This. just as one of the above posters thought..i too was of the belief the fans of this club were much more patient of our young players. Kids 21, really not fair the treatment. He only wants to get better and back to his best and do well for his club. i have faith he will coem good given time

4767~~~
Agreed, from body language experts to style experts he's getting abused all over this thread. He just needs time, he's a magnificent talent and we've seen that in the World Cup, PSV and in flashes at United. It's his first year and it would be idiotic to rule him out already.

4768~~~
Memphis is a nothing player alright, a footballing fraudster on the pitch, but to take the Mickey out of his life off it is uncalled for and plain sad.

4769~~~
What I'm saying is that

A- our fans tend to be more tolerant to workhorses as compared to talented players who are inconsistent, they think that they are bigger than life or lazy

B- since youth talent tend to be inconsistent it would be better off for them not to pissed off the inpatient fans by staying out of the limelight

4770~~~
It's not possible the fans track the players now and when they find something they beat the shit out of players with it.

4771~~~
I'd like to see him get a run of games centrally, I think long term he's more likely to be a success there than on the wing.

4772~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yeah that's why he's at fecking Newcastle.

4773~~~
It would help if he displayed this supposed talent. I'm personally more forgiving of Januzaj's inconsistencies because he's actually shown something at Utd.

4774~~~
Januzaj is our lad. There's a bias towards him. If he was  British he would probably be considered the next Beckham same as Jones was considered the next Duncan Edwards. Depay had shown glimpses of class unfortunately they were rare. The fact that he looks like a gangster and goes in training with flashy rolls Royce doesnt help him much

4775~~~
You can laugh all you want but in one of the worst PL teams he has manage to get 9 goals and 3 assists in 22 games..  Our Memphis who was bought to replace Di Maria has 4 goals in 23 games in a much better team.. Wijnaldum would also have cost less. Not that I am saying Wijnaldum would have been United quality but he was and is a much better player than Memphis just without all the hype and drama.

4776~~~
Problem with him is that expectations have been far too high. He played some great seasons for PSV and did quite well at the WC.
Some seriously compared him to Ronaldo and a lot of People here thought buying him and selling AdM would improve us.
Looking at it as neutral as possible he is not a bad Player and has some potential but never enough to reach the Level of AdM or other Players in that bracket.
I would be fine if he reached the Level of Valencia/Young at their Peak.

4777~~~
No but to resort to personal insults about his ethnic background and his looks is pretty low. He's a Man Utd player so deserves support especially as he's a young lad in a new country, at a huge club. For those that can't see the talent just watch him last year and tell me he's not talented. Isn't it amazing that Di Maria, Mata, now Memphis are all worse players under LVG, now maybe I'm being bold here.... But maybe... Just maybe, Memphis, Rooney Di Maria, Mata playing like shit is down to the manager and not the players. If you want to believe that all these players wearnt top class under different managers then good on you, but it's clear denial to not accept LVGs role in their decline. 
I had high expectations for Memphis when he arrived and he clearly hasn't lived up to that yet but there is no way you can Write him off yet without being a fool.

4778~~~
Yeh your bang on here

4779~~~
I think he can be the same player that left PSV only if we change our style. Counter attacking football suits him, not giving him the ball when there's 9 men already in the box and expecting him to score.

4780~~~
The key is that Memphis isn't a creator, he is a finisher. Knowing that, people should understand that he will always be one of the first victims of our incapacity to create chances, unless we manage to completely change his game. His game is all about movement and shooting technique and he showed that he was good at both, it's obviously not enough for us since we lack in creativity, but he was never the player that some people fantasized.

4781~~~
And yet I never felt that way about Darron Gibson or Kieran Richardson. Bias has nothing to do with it. Would you think Depay was an extremely talented player if he played for one of our rivals?

4782~~~
Writing him off is no more foolish than having high expectations for him. In fact the way he's performed lends more evidence to the former being less foolish. His performances in the Dutch league are no basis for believing he will be a great player. 

With all those players you still saw glimpses occasionally of them being very good players for Utd. They've also done it at other clubs at a much higher level than Depay. Take away games against teams from a much lower level and Depay has done next to nothing at Utd. I've asked this question of others and it's not been answered. How highly would you rate him if he'd signed for Liverpool? People would be falling over themselves laughing at him.

4783~~~
He was getting stick after he'd scored or assisted 8 times in his first 10 matches.

I understand the criticism and he has been woeful at times. But I think it's foolish to rule him out just yet. I'd say a lot comes down to LvG's inability to motivate and I think Memphis needs a chance to gain some momentum and confidence. And maybe next season, that will be under a new more attacking manager.

4784~~~
No he fecking doesn't.

4785~~~
Utd aren't a much better team though when you compare our offensive to Newcastles. We've managed to score only four more goals than Newcastle this season in the BPL (28 goals scored vs 24). Over all competitions Memphis has amassed 5 goals and 5 assists while Wijnaldum's got 9 goals and 3 assists having played about 500 minutes more than Memphis has in all competitions in the premier league only. So there really isn't as big a rift between them as you say. One could even argue that Wijnaldum has had the better conditions to flourish in.

4786~~~
What a shite post.

4787~~~
Wijnaldum is three and half years older.

4788~~~
I suppose PSG,Liverpool and us were competing to sign for Wijnaldum then?

4789~~~
If you ask me, Depay his shown much more in some of his performances in the Champions League, notably the qualifiers. What does Januzaj have to his name? that performance vs Sunderland?

4790~~~
Shhhh don't say thing like that too loudly, we must maintain that Januzaj under Moyes was the best thing since slice bread....

4791~~~
He'd a lot of good performances that season I would say. The best that can be picked out for Depay is a performance against a pub team. Januzaj was also three years younger than Depay.

4792~~~
Yeah, because that's what I was saying. Be careful you don't go against the supporting our young players grain.

4793~~~
Like?

4794~~~
Because I have a differing opinion?
I support Januzaj, I actually like him. However it seems his performances that season have been widely over played.
Even in the games he did well in, he was inconsistent (as most young players are) I don't see how anyone can say hes done more than Depay.
For me they have both shown some talent and contributed to goals, but have been inconsistent in many games and poor defensively on the wing in a lot of games too.

4795~~~
Yep, unfortunately too many idiots judge him based on how he dresses or his tattoos or the cars he likes. It's fecking pathetic.

4796~~~
It's a struggle to remember too many individual games from that season but he was good in the game he scored against West Ham that I can remember. I also can recall being more hopeful while watching him play than I have been watching Depay. Though obviously he was just as shit last season so perhaps he'll turn out to be a flash in the pan. He wouldn't be the first. Not sure how any of this makes Depay one of the most exciting talents in Europe.

4797~~~
I don't see how that's relevant, unless Januzaj was performing at that level since that season, which he hasn't been. Plenty of 18 year olds burst onto the scene only to quickly fade away and I'm not saying Januzaj will. The only game that really sticks out for me is that Sunderland game he scored the volley in. Depay has bagged a few good performances in the Champions League, including a goal against his old side.

4798~~~
Apparently so. People are being accused of not being real Utd fans for not pretending Depay is great. And my opinion differs from yours. I think Januzaj was better that season than Depay has been. I'm sure I'm not in the minority there.

4799~~~
It's insane, I can't believe I'm reading some of the stuff on here. He's 21 ffs, what do people expect? "He looks like gangster," I have read it all now. 

He's a young player making a huge step up, in a new league and the team is off-form. Him being poor on the pitch is not a surprise.

4800~~~
Because you're comparing their performances as to who was more impressive. Depay has done nothing outside of games at a very low level for Utd. I can just about see why people retain hope for the future but I don't see how anyone can say he's been anything but awful this season.

4801~~~
I agree, he's been for the most part awful, but I don't see how Januzaj could be marked down at the brighter talent either. Both have a hell of a lot to prove.

4802~~~
They do. Januzaj has been disappointing for over a year now. I only used him as an example of a player I would be more forgiving of being inconsistent because there was a time when I felt he played well for us. All Depay has going for him is performances in a nothing league and a game against the worst team we've faced all season against whom even Rooney in the worst form of his career scored a hat trick. Even players just struggling to adjust will normally show what they have in their locker. I don't see it with Depay. All I see is a wide player who struggles to beat players, doesn't pass the ball very well and has erratic shooting.

4803~~~
Anybody else think maybe his choice of boots has effected things?

He was fantastic while wearing Adidas for PSV, soon as he switched to under armour towards the end of the season he stopped scoring. Since he's joined us his form hasn't recovered, time for a switch back to Adidas I feel.

<span style="color: #ffffff">not really being serious.</span>

4804~~~
Me too, but do we even know if he's a wide player yet? LVG has tested him as a number 10 too, which didn't work, but doesn't mean he won't be tried there again by our next manager and does better. Who really knows how he'll turn out, but he has shown glimpses of why we purchased him and I'd trust he's the right people around him to help him kick on next season. The club certainly won't be giving up on him anytime soon, given the investment alone.

4805~~~
Next season. First season is very harsh to judge him.

4806~~~
Januzaj has talent, gibson/Richardson did not

4807~~~
Which is the point I'm making that you seemed to think was routed in bias. I don't think Depay is as talented as Januzaj. Can you answer the question I asked? Honestly.

4808~~~
Januzaj has talent. The likes of Gibson and Richardson did not. That's the difference. Certain supporters tend to be a teeny weeny biased towards their own kids despite them not being very talented (Take Carragher or our OShea for example). If they have a decent amount of talent, than such bias is taken to ridiculous levels (think of Fowler, Fletcher, Butt etc). I still remember a Liverpool fan friend of mine claiming that Fowler was among the top 5 strikers of his generation.

What can I say about Depay? Stats do not lie so the boy does have talent. However much better players have failed to make an impact at top leagues. The likes of Bergkamp and Pancev were unwatchable in the Serie A. Its still early days to say that Depay cant cut it in the EPL. That doesn't mean we shouldn't bring in a first team winger if we need too because of him

4809~~~
Petty sure him being talented is based mainly on everything he did before coming to United? Which doesn't get erased due to a poor start to his United career.

4810~~~
Stats can often lie. They would suggest Di Maria was good last season. Until he can do something outside of Holland then he has it all to prove. Your eyes don't lie and you still won't answer my question.

4811~~~
In a vastly inferior league. A league in which Dirk Kiyt has scored 13 in 16 games. That context needs to be applied to Depay's supposed talent.

4812~~~
It's doesn't show the entire truth but it give glimpses of what the player can do. For example this season we aren't creating any chances. Hence one should question whether it was wise to sell last season main assist man. 

I think I've answered your question but there again my English is a bit shit. I wouldn't sell depay just yet because his stats in Holland are enough to justify another chance. However he hasn't shown enough to be considered as first team material. So if let's say the club has the opportunity to bring Griezmann in than they should do that with no hesitation. If depay is good enough he will win his place back

4813~~~
Most of the leagues are inferior to the epl

4814~~~
Indeed. But we don't sign players from them often and then insist on pretending they're extraordinarily talented.

4815~~~
Exactly. Thank you very much for that. People who don't understand a word of what I wrote must have a lot to learn about life.

4816~~~
Not sure what you're getting at most players who end up in the PL come from inferior leagues. The guy has talent, whether he can realise such talent and become a top player is another story all together

4817~~~
It should be pretty obvious. Basing an opinion he's going to be great on how well he did in Holland as opposed to how terribly he's playing now is stupid. I'm not convinced at this talent because he hasn't displayed it outside of games against incredibly weak opposition.

4818~~~
His stats in Holland were phenomenal

4819~~~
So are Dirk Kuyt's.

4820~~~
Who wasn't a bad player for Liverpool at all

4821~~~
He's also considerably older now. And he was never one of the most gifted attackers in Europe. He's second in the scoring charts at the minute behind Premier League legend Luke De Jong.

4822~~~
Almost as stupid as completely writing off a 21 year old whos played the equivalent of less than 15 competitive matches for us.

4823~~~
A player really is only as good as his last match around here, isn't he? He's 21 and playing in a new league ffs.

Well, I'm glad none of you have anything to do with the decision-making in or around the club, to put it that way. I'm comfortable with the fact that most of the people in the know in regards to footballing matters seem to regard Depay as one of the greater talents in eorld football.

Doesn't mean he will come good, of course, but I do choose to believe that it warrants him a great deal more patience than many of you seem to be allowing him.

4824~~~
Has anyone noticed in the past few games that Memphis has tried to be more direct,
as in trying to run at the opposing defenders at speed ala Martial?
Seems to be taking more shots from outside the box as well, hasn't really scored
from those but at least he is trying.
I believe that he should be a better fit to our team next season.

4825~~~
I think he is just guilty of trying too hard. He plays in a team that doesn't take risks, yet his game is built around dribbling and beating a man which is essentially a high risk endeavour. He looks like he goes into half his dribbles with fear, knowing if he loses the ball he's going to get bollocked and dropped. Completely the wrong mind set for winger. It's the same affliction Di Maria suffered from when he was here, but luckily one that hasn't struck Martial....who is just a force of nature.

I think he will come good. He just needs a run, some time, and to keep working hard. He's got the talent.

4826~~~
I don't know, but that's what I got from Succesful's post, given that he only highlighted people who looked black or Mexican. I, personally, couldn't care less how he looks. He doesn't really dress any different from other young men around his age, and tattoos are very fashionable these days, so I think it's retarded to use his style/tattoos against him.

4827~~~
True. He needs to go back to basics.

4828~~~
He's had a handful of games where he wasn't good. Some of them, he tried to hard. Others, he didn't try hard enough. He's a young lad who is immensely skilled but he's inconsistent, he's raw, but he's not as bad as everyone is making him out to be. I have a lot of faith that he will come good.

4829~~~

4830~~~
Where the feck have I even said that? I said he has talent, whether he can realise that talent at this level remains to be seen

4831~~~
I never said you did but are you paying attention to the conversation that was going on around the post you quoted?

4832~~~
I haven't completely written him off. Just doubting this supposed unquestionable talent. So as you were.

4833~~~
But you have, you can pretend all you like you're being balanced but it's evidently clear what you think of him, you've thrown aside his past achievement and downplayed entirely anything hes done in recent weeks (Newcastle) to instead concentrate on slight negatives.

4834~~~
But I haven't. I don't think he's very good based on what I've seen. He could prove me wrong. It's like it's a crime to rate a player under the age of 22. He's a lot to do and anyone clinging to his record in Holland is bonkers.

4835~~~
After the equivalent of 15 games... under a new manager, playing a new style of football, in a team that is struggling to create chances, in a new country, with a new language, at the age of 21.

4836~~~
A fine list of excuses. He's played for Van Gaal before and he's supposed to be one of the ones creating chances. He also speaks English. The proof will be in the pudding so I'll draw a line under it for now. How many games before we can judge somebody?

4837~~~
"He obviously is very talented" is where we differ. For me he's about Lingard level, and I don't think he's anything special. 

Not sure I'm allowed to express my opinion or should I wait until... When exactly?

4838~~~
At the end of his career at United not the start. He is still at a formative age in his career, his early responsibility at PSV is not the norm for a young football. I am not saying people should be patient or arguing his talent because I don't believe he is highly talented but let's allow him to get playing football.
In the same way you feel he is not lived up to expectations, there is bound be people that feel strongly about creating the right environment for an individual to flourish. The environment right now is quite toxic, the constant sniping and rubbishing of his past achievement cannot be helping anyone.. Would like to believe people should be using it to remind him of what he is capable of as a motivational tool.

4839~~~
So we can't rate a single player in football until the end of their career? That's stupid. I can assure you that anything said on an Internet forum that Depay has likely never heard of let alone read is making any difference to his career. It's up to him to make it work not the fans questioning how good he is.

4840~~~
Yeah excuses, let's pretend none of these things matter to a young person, that he speaks perfect English and is well adjusted to a new country and culture, let's even pretend he's a creator and not a quite obviously a finisher, whatever suits the arguement hey?

4841~~~
That's exactly what they are. Is there a tangible point where we can question him? He's played for Van Gaal, he speaks enough of the language to play football. You're acting as if we've taken a farmer from Mongolia and asked him to perform open heart surgery. He's a wide player. It's part of the job description.

4842~~~
He might go either way.

The Dutch league is a very poor one. We've seen plenty of players from there that have come here and flopped mightily. Alfonso Alves, Ryan Babel and Luuk de Jong (after his German stint). So the fear that he could also fail is a real one. He's also struggled for the majority of his games here, leading to him being hooked of at HT or being benched.

Alternatively, he was rated amongst the top young talents in Europe and attracted the attention of many European powerhouses. He was decent in Europe last season too, and performed well for his NT. His playing for a side that creates very few chances, and a philosphy that isnt working in this league.

It really can go either way.People just want to pick a side to be right later on.

4843~~~
That was a good post - but it begs the question, why did VG buy him?

4844~~~
It is not about writing him off at all. We should only adjust our expectations and hope he can fulfill them.

4845~~~
You might not be, AC certainly is though.

4846~~~
Plain to see a possession based system doesnt suit him at all.

This is my main gripe with LVG. Zero flexibility with tactics even though Rooney, Martial, Mata, Depay would all do much better in a counter attacking system.

4847~~~
For me, I'd reassess him at the end of next season. We've made an investment on a young player, there's no sense in giving up on him at this point in time. 
Having said that, I expect to see improvement from him between now and the end of the season, in terms of offering a more reliable threat, even if it doesn't always result in a goal or assist. The same way that Martial always looks threatening, even if nothing comes off for him. He's looked a lot more threatening in his last few appearances, where he's started to run at defenders from deeper positions as opposed to trying to take them on from a standing start, which he isn't good at (to be fair to him, only Martial seems to have that ability in our entire squad). He's also started taking the ball across the face of goal to draw defenders out, which was what led to Rooney's second goal against Newcastle. So there are some positives there.

4848~~~
Well said.

4849~~~
I never understood the fuss about his clothes and cars. Does it really matter?

4850~~~
We clearly need to adjust them so that it's not part of his job to create or defend apparently and we can only have nice, fluffy comments about him until either the end of his Utd career or the end of next season.

4851~~~
Yes that would be best for all involved so we don't have to listen to meaningless moaning all the time...

4852~~~
I'm sure you'll apply that to everyone equally and not just the people you like.

4853~~~
yes I'm sorry that i'm one of those fans that supports the players rather than slates them. Memphis has been poor this season but give the lad a break. Di Maria, Mata, Rooney, how many former world class players are gonna have to turn shit before people realise its the manges tactics and not the players.

4854~~~
Are you though? Or is it just some players.

4855~~~
Haha I love it... Thing is I'm not writing off anyone of the new signings, I think Memphis has been poor and I actually don't really have a problem with people saying that. I just cant stand people writing off players before they have had the proper chance to prove themselves. Despite whatever you might throw up i do support the players and thats better than some of the shit people dish out on here. 

Whats funny (and a little sad) is looking at your previous posts and realising you only ever post in this thread to tell us how crap Memphis is. Its pretty funny seeing people trying to justify their own agenda against a player. let me guess you don't like the way he dresses, talks, acts....

4856~~~
But you've done no different with Scnneiderlin to what I've done with Depay. You've done the same with Lingard too. I don't rate Depay from what I've seen. I don't give a shit how he dresses. Have a look through my posts and see if you seen anything where I've talked about how he behaves off the pitch. Good luck. When he plays well I'll post about it. I'm sure if you looked hard enough you'd find it.

4857~~~
Except for the part where I still fully expect Sneiderlin to improve and be a mainstay of this Utd team, because guess what I think he deserves time. I forget that in your world you have to perform instantly to be any good and have any quality. Sometimes in life it takes longer to settle into a new area, a new life for different people and that's no different with football players ( who may I remind you are still human beings). I've in no way written Sneiderlin off, and I'm fully entitled to thinking he had a poor performance and hasn't hit his potential yet the same way I acknowledge that depay has been poor. I just don't think you can judge a new player and particularly a player that young, after less than a season. Particularly when he's shown glimpses of real quality.

4858~~~
But yet you've said that he has a long way to go to be Utd quality. You've also said the same about Lingard. You're being a hypocrite and no amount of words you use will change that.

4859~~~
There's your quote on Lingard. In case you'd forgotten.

4860~~~
This is the Memphis thread why do you keep bringing up other players?

4861~~~
Playing Memphis in a front of 3 with Martial and a new right winger/wide forward would be interesting, like Barcelona with Neymar-Suarez-Messi or Madrid with Ronaldo-Benzema-Bale.

Memphis-Martial-[Griezmann/Dybala/Sane] look good to me. 

Do you think he would improve in a 433 (like when he was in PSV)?

4862~~~
Merely pointing out your hypocrisy. You just want people not to comment negatively on players you like but you're happy to do it yourself.

4863~~~
It does if it suggests he's more concerned with acting the lad around town than knuckling down and making sure he has a career here

4864~~~
Memphis isn't the top dog on his team anymore. He has to learn how to defer and take his chances when there are available and cannot force it nearly as much. Martial, arguably, is top dog next to Rooney.

In order for Memphis to improve, his effort, composure and selflessness must improve ten fold.

4865~~~
The thing is reading your posts I'm really not sure you want Memphis to come good, you've written him off already and I think you'd love to be right.

4866~~~
It's blatantly obvious, in the Newcastle the only thing he could talk about was a missed tackle. Apparently he should be completely adjusted to the game in England after the equivalent of 15 games and anything he did prior to joining United doesn't matter, honestly.

4867~~~
I'd say unequivocally, it would play to his strengths, as it's been alluded to in this thread he's more of a finisher than a creator. His off the ball movement really is top notch and he'd be pretty dangerous as a wide forward.

4868~~~
Yeah, I absolutely love it when Utd players turn out not very good. Be sensible. I've done no different to what you have done on other players. At least be honest with yourself.

4869~~~
Anything he did previously needs to be judged on its own merit. Goal scoring in Holland should not be taken too seriously when you look at the two players who currently top their scoring charts. Something everyone here is failing to acknowledge. I don't expect him to be fully adjusted. I expect better from somebody allegedly so talented. He's not showing it and if he played for anyone else there wouldn't be anybody here singing his praises currently.

4870~~~
Yes it does need to be taken on its own merit, no one here thinks it's an elite league, but its still a decent league and he deserves some plaudits for his performances there. You seem to be incapable of seeing anything between genius and atrocious. He's underperformed yes everyone accepts that but he's shown glimpses of genuine quality, enough to not totally disregard him as a failure not midway through his first season in a new country at the age of 21, like you.

4871~~~
I haven't called him a failure or a flop, merely I haven't seen this talent and I have doubts. I've seen him fail at the basics a lot more than seeing him excel. That people are clinging to a cross against Newcastle shows what he's served up this season. The Dutch league is awful. Truly awful so forgive me if I don't believe he's incredibly talented based on what he did there last season. The same way I don't think De Jong or Kuyt are great players. Do you? How often did you actually watch him in Holland? If he goes on to improve then super. But he needs to. A lot.

4872~~~
And for every failure there's a Saurez or a Robben, whats your point? Try judging him on as an individual and not applying a blanket generalisation.At no point have you suggested anything as grey as having 'doubts', you've rather blunt about your opinion on him so there's no point in trying to purvey a degree of balance in your view.

4873~~~
My point is saying he's undoubtedly talented because he scored lots of goals last season is stupid unless you think Kuyt and De Jong are too. I see you've ignored my question on how much you watched him so I'll guess you didn't. I am judging as an individual and on what I've seen. It's not been an undoubtedly talented player struggling because he's moved to a country where he speaks the language and has played for the manager before. The excuses here from him from certain posters all season has been unreal. Initially it was because he was played in the middle. Now it's because he plays out wide and he'd be better in the middle. One minute he's the only player being creative. The next it's not his job to create. Or defend. What is it about his game this season that has stood out? 

I am no more blunt in my opinion than you have been in yours. Unfortunately for you there's more evidence backing my current stance than there is for yours. Because I didn't come in with a predisposed opinion on how good he'd be. If he turns out to be as good as you think then happy days. My words are here for them to be quoted to prove me wrong. While I don't think he'll become the player you think it doesn't mean I rule out the possibility he'll improve.

4874~~~
Again with the black and white analysis. He speaks the language, so does Van Gaal but you're telling me he hadn't struggled to protect his point? To communicate to the level he has. You've ignored entirely any possible variables and decided there's absolutely no reason why he shouldn't be performing to his best at this moment in time. It would be a valid point of he hasn't played the equivalent of less than 15 games for the club. Speaking of ignoring statements (yes I've seen a decent amount of him prior to joining us) why do you think less than 15 games of football is enough to write off a new player? Show me where you've alluded to him he'll possibly improve to a good standard? Because up until now you've been entirely brazen about how shit you think he is. You've been an constant in this thread and you've been exclusively negative, even when hes played well. Yes there's more evidence for your point if you choose to ignore or discount anything in his favour as you've clearly done, I'm managed to stay balanced accepting when's he's been poor and praising him when he's played well. You've actually goes out of your way to find fault.

4875~~~
That's a lot of words to say very little. I haven't alluded to him proving me wrong and being as good as you think because I don't believe he will. It doesn't mean there isn't the possibility I'm wrong. 

Have you really? I don't believe you. How much did you watch him in Holland because I don't think you were singing his praises too much before we signed him. Feel free to prove me wrong though. 

How often have you accepted he's been poor? Can you show me a post during or after a game from this thread where you've said he's been poor and haven't constantly made excuses?

4876~~~
And your argument in a nutshell, let's flip it and now you prove to me how regularly you've watched him play prior to his move (good luck with that).
Your turn, let's see this balanced view that didn't magically  appear in the last couple of pages, oh that's right you're talking nonsense, whats the line? Feel free to prove me wrong.

4877~~~
Your post about his attempted headed back pass? Would you like me to quote your follow ups? Is that really the best you could do? 

I've never claimed to watch much of him. I saw him in the World Cup and didn't think much. So there's not really a lot to be proven wrong I'm afraid. I've been quite clear on the fact I'm forming my opinion on what I've seen. I'm not the one pretending I watched him in Holland.

4878~~~
no idea what he'll be or what he won't cause I've seen signings that have excelled and others that have failed irrespective of what we've paid for them. Dutch league maybe a lessor standard but the list is endless the amount of truly world class players that have come from it, including some that have been here.

For me, the fact that the goalkeeper is probably the only world class player in this team and the football is so shocking, I think even Messi would struggle to show in this team. Needs a team that's more attack minded and a manager thats more expansive too before we see the best out of him....

4879~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at least you've been consistent, thought I wouldn't find criticisms (wasn't hard), when I do (easily) you downplay them. Just to clarify I work within the horticultural trade, we get a hell of a lot of plants from Holland here (Veen, Planting etc.) so football is a chief subject.

4880~~~
One post. Surrounded by excuses for him. If you've been so balanced show us some more examples. I could show posts where I've said something positive about him. Like yours mine also come with a but though. But I'm capable of being honest. It's surprising with how much Dutch football you watched you weren't telling us more about him when he was first linked. I didn't realise talking to Dutch people was evidence of your keen interest in watching the league.

4881~~~
Well show then. What evidence were you looking for then that I watch Dutch football, examples please.

4882~~~
I just find it strange such a keen watcher of Dutch football had only a handful of posts in the year long thread before he signed none of which talking about games he'd played in. Ultimately it doesn't really matter because you're clearly unlikely to back down and admit you were bullshitting now.

4883~~~
Still waiting for those posts.

4884~~~
There's the excuse coming shortly after. Amongst a plethora of excuse riddled posts talking up his contributions.

4885~~~
Still waiting for you to explain why you didn't regale us with tales of you watching him in a 95page thread about him before he signed. Your most telling contribution there was you thought his name was cool.

4886~~~
Still waiting on that post, just one little post.

4887~~~
There's two for you from this thread. Care to tell us why you weren't talking about his performances in his thread since you watched him so much last season?

4888~~~
115 posts in this thread and this is the best you can come up with <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

think I'll end it there, someone else can argue aimlessly with you, it's like banging my head against a wall with you and I can't seem to stop, <a class="username" data-user="42549, @Rado_N" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/42549/">@Rado_N</a> possible to thread ban me for a week or so?

4889~~~
<a class="username" data-user="20951, @acnumber9" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20951/">@acnumber9</a> is right. You can use all the excuses you want but his form has been very concerning and worrying and there's been very little of his supposed talent on view and even then mostly against lower league garbage. He's not been inconsistent, which is what you'd expect, but been downright shite for most of the season.

There's been just about enough to suggest (Or maybe that's just me being hopeful) that he could eventually turn out to be a good buy but going on about how he scored a bazillion goals in a shite Dutch league is pointless.

4890~~~
Or scored 2 goals and assisted in the WC, or was PSV's main man in the Europa League for two season is pointless as well? And that shite league, look at players like Bojan, Wijnaldum, Pieters, Tadic, Pelle, Blind, they arent doing too bad in the best league of the universe arent they?

4891~~~
Been allot better coming off the bench past few games, LVG managing him quite well at the moment. Not do the same with Januzaj and work them into the side.

4892~~~
He was average at the world cup, average in the Europa league despite goals against some more third rate crap and disappearing against anyone half decent. And he's been shite at United. So, yes, it all boils down to a deluge of goals he scored in the Dutch League. There's nothing else to fall back on when it comes to Depay. If you want to cling to that pretend he's very good, good on you. Don't expect everyone else to fall in like with your delusion.

Not one the players you mentioned is at the level we need our first XI to be. Not sure what you're point is.

"Best League in the universe". What the feck are you talking about?

4893~~~
My delusion? Think you should turn that right round, you're whole post is just full of agenda.

4894~~~
I don't think you have any idea what you're talking about.

I'm full of agenda for suggesting Depay has been shite so far? Ok then....

4895~~~
I really don't get it cause how many young players hit the ground running in any team in their first season? Footballs not a science and we've seen a proven World Class players that have failed. Unfortunate in modern football, no one gets the benefit of time.

4896~~~
I didn't expect him to hit the ground running and take the league by storm. I did expect to see more glimpses of his talent though. It's one thing being a young inconsistent attacking talent in a new league (Nani) but Depay has been really really bad.

And no one's writing him off. Calling his performances for what they have been so far is fair in my books.

4897~~~
No because he has been shite, but saying that he hasnt shown anything in his career, average at WC, average Europe League, Eredivisie shite league, put down the players that I named (actually most of them could easily start here, and forgot Eriksen, Alderweireld, Verthongen as well), that is agenda driven. Everyone can see that Deoay has been poor so far.

4898~~~
It's not agenda driven if it's true. The Eredevisie is obviously a bit shit (at least relatively) and common sense dictates that bringing up his goal scoring stats each time someone questions is talent is pointless. For every good striker Eredevisie produces there seems to be an equally crap one. And he was the main man there, taking every freekick and basically played like an wide striker which accounted for a lot of his goals.

And yes, he was bang average at the WC. The entire Dutch teams was bang average aside from the one game against Spain. Only saw him a once or twice in Europa but he didn't pull up any trees. Goals against the mighty Estoril and Chornomorets <i>Odessa </i>must mean he was great though.

4899~~~
It amounts to double your criticism. I've been consistent throughout. You've lied about watching loads of Dutch football.

4900~~~
Never mind mate..

4901~~~
It's not great to directly compare players but he could be like Kondogbia, after every moves Kondogbia seems to need one season to settle and after that he flies. But on a more serious note, I think that it's near impossible for a normal talent to perform directly in a team that plays a different type of football and isn't really playing like a proper team, I mean just look at Hazard he is vastly superior to Memphis but he still struggled badly when the entire team turned shit, football is a team game after all.

4902~~~
I'm not a huge follower of the Dutch league but you surely can't believe that it's a bit shit...whatever "relatively" is meant to mean in this context. Not being as good as the few recognised big ones doesn't make the Eredivisie shit. You shouldn't need to denigrate Depay's achievements as a young man in a competitive league to make your point. 

The fact is that he has been disappointing this year compared to all of the OTT hype and that is often the case with a new league and that is hard to dispute. The arguement will be whether he's got another level in him or whether he found it in Holland. I believe he has shown enough flashes of ability for the former but who knows. We shall see....

4903~~~
Read the posts, there's many writing him off. I do think after the Shaw injury, we seen a down turn in his form and also I think he's genuining trying too hard to impress. Football isn't easy for him at the moment....

4904~~~
I think that's all right and in particular, I do believe that the Shaw injury has had a bigger impact than people realise.....

4905~~~
Well done for being consistently wrong <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4906~~~
All true but there's nothing wrong with pointing out that he's been poor although I do think the Shaw injury is just an excuse. He was poor in the league even with Shaw there.

I do think LVG is using him correctly now. Sub appearance are the way to go with him right now and he had a couple of encouraging cameos before the Liverpool game.

4907~~~
On what exactly? Have I been wrong in saying he hasn't been very good? Am I wrong in pointing out that being top goal scorer in Holland is not currently a sign of being a great player? Do tell. I know you watch a lot of Dutch football. Is Luke De Jong a great talent?

4908~~~
You know I can't think of a single player who's come from the Dutch league and performed (this the Dutch league you admitted you dont watch), you're ramblings become more and more ridiculous <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4909~~~

4910~~~
Not sure a excuse to be honest, just an observation. Shaw was his friend and they struck it off so as he came. It's like that mate at work that you can have a laugh when's things are good, bad and indifferent. Shaws in rehibilation and I think he's missed him. Most of the young lads there know each other from a younger age, and the older lot in the first team are significantly older and or married. OT can be a lonely place especially when your not from England. Bit different but if you've relocated for work reasons, money doesn't make it any easier.

4911~~~
Vid version.

4912~~~
I find this whole "returning to PSV 5 underperforming months later for a farewell' very strange. Not least given his questionable attitude towards application and the current state of affairs at OT. All this aside from the fact that he already returned there with Utd on 15th September anyway!

Not like Martial went back to Monaco to get his ego massaged... Or any player ever beforehand?!

4913~~~
The relationship between Memphis and PSV is a special one.

4914~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> the José of footballer & ex-clubs!

4915~~~
If you asked me which one player would definitely, 100%, be a far, far better under a different manager that isn't LVG... then my answer would be Memphis.

4916~~~
Martial won nothing with Monaco and it might be ridiculous but for a club like PSV 6 years without title was a very long time.

4917~~~
Still don't get it... He's a Man Utd player now, he's already been back at PSV wearing the Utd jersey. 
Don't see Mata going back to Chelsea for a fanfare, regardless of when they last won the league.

4918~~~
Memphis has been in their academy for years, he was a difficult kid and PSV was like his home and brought him on the right path. They gave him a chance and he took it with both hands, he could have left before last season after bids from big clubs, but said that he wanted to stay one year extra to bring PSV the title. That's what he did, became topscorer and lead them to the title. So they have a mutual relationship of respect and in some way love, PSV fans absolutely love him for last season. Probably it was the club that offered this, this happens all the time in Holland especially and has absolutely nothing to do with "his ego" or his current performances at Man United.

4919~~~
He is a youth product, he is one of them, they love him, he loves them.

4920~~~
This.

He drove them to the title. It was obviously a special season for the club.

4921~~~
Wish he'd feckin stay there the useless tw at

4922~~~
Don't see the problem. Wijnaldum was there too. Rooney went to watch an Everton game a few weeks back. Who cares?

United players have lives outside of United, and outside of football. Regardless of how much they are paid, expecting them to simply live and breathe United and nothing else is unreasonable, and it just won't happen.


Reminds me of when footballers post non-football things on Instagram. The comments are hilarious. Memphis (I think it was) posted a picture of a plate of spaghetti recently, and he got hammered for it, telling him to forget food and concentrate on football. Darmian's recent post about his injury seemed to have everyone telling him how to be a better right back. A bunch of spotty teens whose only experience of football is a game of FIFA, coaching a pro, with specific advice. Ace.

Makes me wish I was a footballer, just for the social media trolling. "Yeah, thanks mate. I'll work harder and make the right passes in future. Sorry for being shit"

4924~~~
Still don't get it... Should we roll out the welcome banners for Danny Welbeck?! He was a youth product at Utd and won a league before he left!

Its bizarre entirely.

4925~~~
The fact that you compare it to Welbeck winning a league title at United tells me that you don't understand the season Memphis had for them, nor the season it was for them. From what I know, he was more like their Ronaldo, than their Welbeck, and it was a very memorable title for them.

4926~~~
Did we spent half a decade without title and did Welbeck scored 25 goals to help us win it?

4927~~~
I simply don't care what kind of season he had for them. I care about the kind of season he's had for us... a complete non-event, in the midst of which he heads back to PSV to have his ego massaged.

So it's now a thing in football that you return to the ghosts of your successful past to bolster your ego when you're having a crap season? He's a Utd player, he needs to focus on the here and now and not the there and then.

4928~~~
I really don't see what the big deal is, seriously.
Hes been poor for us yes, hopefully he can turn it around, but that doesn't mean the lad isn't allowed to lead a normal life outside of his commitments to the club.

4929~~~
Bit strange to "simply not care" about something yet post about how it is bizarre.

4930~~~
If you read back though my posts you'll note that I "don't care what kind of season he's had for them"

The only thing I rendered bizarre was the fanfare a Man Utd player got for returning to his former club, mid-season, when our own season is in turmoil, and he's been 2 goals shy of terrible & he's been under-performing consistently.

4931~~~
Which is why you're wrong. Feel free to find him returning there bizarre, that's your wish. But there's absolutely nothing bizarre about the fan fare he got when he returned there, given he was a talisman for a huge league title for PSV, and they don't give two fecks about his United-career not meeting expectations so far (obviously).

4932~~~
I don't care about the fanfare he got, I just find his return there, pitch-walk & media attention strange given the state of his year for us. 

For the record, I couldn't care less about PSV, their title win, his goals for them or how they receive him. I only care that he's underperforming for Utd and him re-visiting his old club was strange. 

I'm done with this.

4933~~~
You really havent got a clue about what you're talking.

4934~~~
This post says otherwise, given you found the reception bizarre only moments ago.


Of course.

4935~~~
Wonder if we could sell him to China

4936~~~
Whatever, clearly not worth dignifying your lack of intelligence with a response.

4937~~~
Jesus wept. Good luck at the missing the point awards.

4938~~~
I got the point. It was shit.

4939~~~
Some posts in here that are truly idiotic.

4940~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4941~~~
Alright.

4942~~~
The reactions here over a simple event!!!

Thumb rule on caf:

Player cant go for dinner buffets if they lose a match
Should not buy new gadgets, cars after losing a match
Managers should not attend family events because they lost the match

4943~~~
I love when people get outraged over something a footballer did in his life <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The "logic" being that if you are playing like shit, you should suspend all other activities and train 24/7.

4944~~~
Ffs

4945~~~
He really must have a serious attitude problem or something. 

Either that or LvG thinks he's shite.

4946~~~
It's obvious LVG doesn't trust him. A 27m signing you just bought should be playing <span style="text-decoration: underline">ffs.</span>

4947~~~
Not really a big fan of his, but considering the price we paid for him, he should be given an opportunity, particularly ahead of Lingard.

4948~~~
Let's be honest, from what we've seen of him in a United shirt, he's been gash

4949~~~
He is dating Steve Harvey's daughter. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4950~~~
Wont even get minutes against Derby ffs. If the coaches think he's that way behind technically 
, we should get rid in the summer.

4951~~~
Looks like PSV would take him back...

4952~~~
Think he has been stone average but he should certainly not be judged fully. He should at least be given next season also to find his way. He has great potential and I hope he fills it here. And yes Lingard is not what we need, I seen a lot of people slag of Newcastle for signing Townsend but he's a much better player than Lingard.

4953~~~
Why's he not been given minutes for the U21's?

Surely any game time is good for him atm, even at this level.

4954~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/man-united-star-memphis-depay-7287436" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/man-united-star-memphis-depay-7287436</a>

Mirror have some funny shots of him stocking up on loo roll and bottled water. Even has a mate in full training gear to help him pack it in the roller. Since when did players do there own shopping!

4955~~~
I guess that the paper is more or less understandable seeing how often he shits himself during the match, water's probably to wash all the shit but to take a fecking full-kit-wanker-squire with you to the shopping? 

He's doing himself no favours really.

4956~~~
needs to keep the gold teeth in fresh water on bedside table at night. obviously

4957~~~
To be fair, while all that bog roll and water is a bit weird, it's hardly calssic prima-donna / spoilt footballer behaviour.  Andrex and Evian don't scream out "I'm better than you, pleb!" to me.

As for FKW... well, I guess you can't really control what your mates wear.

4958~~~
Was joking a bit obviously.

This ain't half as bad as the golden grill shit he used to wear.

4959~~~

4960~~~
City might have got pep, but their players wont get in the paper for buying toilet paper.

4961~~~
Shock horror they made a mention of his 250k car yet again.

I wish we'd play 433 and get him back in the team. He has all the potential in the world.

4962~~~
When was the last time he started?

4963~~~
Permanently frozen out of team like Di Maria. Great way to make signings succeed!

4964~~~
Such exemplary man-management skills.

4965~~~
Really can't understand why he isn't playing for the U21's to help him get some game time, and confidence.

4966~~~
I really don't think playing in the U21 will give him confidence.

4967~~~
73 mins gone and still not on the pitch when we're 3-0 up at home. Yikes. Naughty step indeed.

4968~~~
I dont think he's a bad player, but he's just not adjusted one bit to the pace of the Premier League. He sees the passes he should make, the crosses he should give but he misses the handling speed to make them on time, and when he tries to make them hastly, he hasnt got the right execution to get them to the good end. I hope he gets to that out a bit by next season surely, it's keeping him down at the moment. The difference in pace from the Eredivisie and Premier League is just huge.

4969~~~
This to me is key when talking about him, the important thing at this stage is that he is seeing it, some players never even get that far, it is a matter of execution which he will mature into I am sure of it.

4970~~~
Thought he should have came on when we scored the 3rd, Martial could do with a bit break and Memphis needs minutes, the truth is though I think Martial will be our main LWF for the foreseeable future and Memphis is going to find it hard to get regular games.

4971~~~
Id like to see him given a chance from the start again, probably would have to be at the expense of Lingard on the right though. 

His eye for goal combined with Martial just destroying teams down the left could lead to something.

4972~~~
He is being managed correctly now, being given bits and bobs and seeing if he wants it enough to want more, he has lots of potential not sure of his attitude to learning and progressing, time will tell.  He should look at Martial, a glowing example in a difficult season, he is a standout as a young player with a very good attitude.

4973~~~
Next season he's either going to have to make RW his own or convert into a CF. Maybe even nail the SS slot.. LW is Martial for next two years.

4974~~~
Injuries and loss of form mean there's always a chance to get into Louis van Gaal's team, you just have to make the most of your chance when you get it.

If Mata doesn't perform but Memphis does Louis will try Rooney behind Martial with Memphis left or Memphis behind Rooney with Martial left.

4975~~~
Next time, he'll take his chance. 

Martial - Wilson - Depay. What a front 3!

4976~~~
I really want to see him on the RW

4977~~~
I'd like to see him there to get him back to the basics but from what I am seeing he is in direct competition with Martial and not Lingard.

4978~~~
Seems that way

4979~~~
He was only on for a short time but I thought that there is a different attitude and played clever and team oriented. Let's see if he really (or finally) improved once he gets more minutes.
As others say, if he did, he should start on the RW for Lingard eventually

4980~~~
Can't see him on the right. It will take away the most lethal aspect of his game.

4981~~~
agree with you on this.

on the other hand martial is going stronger and stronger and the LWF position in a 4-3-3 system is his position at this moment. depay has to either get better of martial (which is very unlikely for the closest time being) or try to fight with lingard for the RWF, which seems to be the easier option.

4982~~~
Where exactly does he fit in? Martial's incredible on that left-hand side and he gets so much joy on the ball there. He's never played on the right-wing as most of his game is about cutting inside and he doesn't provide the work-ethic Lingard would.

Rooney's cemented the CF position (rightly so)

This season is over for him I suppose...

4983~~~
If the season continues as it is with little to no football, I think he and the club face a decision at the end of the season. The club will undoubtedly invest in more attackers in the summer.

4984~~~
As in selling or loaning him? That's not going to happen.

4985~~~
<span style="color: inherit">
Perhaps he'll get his chance in the Europa League.</span>

4986~~~
Yeah, pretty much.

He'll get games in the Europa League though.

4987~~~
Hehe

4988~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I think he's alright me.

4989~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Seems to be keeping his head up.

I'm going to make a prediction that Mourinho will convert him to a striker next season.

4990~~~
Given all the hype when he first signed he seems to me to have been a bit of a disappointment so far.

4991~~~
As soon as he messed up that easy pass for Schneiderlin, you knew Chelsea would go up the other end and score.

4992~~~
Yep just had that feeling about it.

4993~~~
I hate him.

4994~~~
I honestly hate him. Sell the fecking fraud.

4995~~~
He's woeful.

4996~~~
Goal all comes from his fecking stupid pass.

4997~~~
Fecking useless.

4998~~~
An absolute waster. Please Christ, sell this pathetic joke back to the fecking sham that is the Eredivisie in the summer.

4999~~~
His intelligence with/without the ball for us this season has been abysmal.

5000~~~
Go away. Just go away. It was an unforgivably lazy shite pass in that situation.

5001~~~
Just getting worse and worse. Unfortunate as I did and still do want to like him. We should've just kept Nani.

5002~~~
Toilet roll for an absolute toilet of a player

5003~~~
Brainfart!

5004~~~
He will be shipped out first.

Mourinho isn't the type to wait around.

5005~~~
There's absolutely no excuse for missing such a

5006~~~
Should go, everything he touches turns into shit.

5007~~~
Jesus wept. Thrown a result away.

5008~~~
Seems to have a lot of those doesnt he? 

Jeez its like having a younger Nani back at the club

5009~~~
Memphis gave the ball away much too easily leading to the goal

5010~~~
He's one of the worst players I've ever seen in a United shirt. Absolutely dreadful and a massive fraud.

5011~~~
He's fecking awful.

5012~~~
cnut lost us 2 points. No other way of looking at it.

5013~~~
He really is fecking useless.

5014~~~
Shit pass, jogs back like he played 90 minutes, he's fecking annoying to say the least.

5015~~~
His lack of effort, concentration and intensity for the little time he has to perform is pathetic.

Doesn't have the right stuff to be a top footballer.

5016~~~
Its so funny cause as soon as he made that bad pass I told the folks watching the game with me "Well that was brain dead from Memphis"

5017~~~
That pass wasnt that bad. People need to stop over reacting.
The defender got a foot on it.

5018~~~
fecking rubbish

5019~~~
Feck him off in the summer; he's useless, absolutely useless.

5020~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The reaction here. The defender deflected his pass and people here are predictably losing their shit.

5021~~~
And didn't track back, he jogged back. Couldn't careless if he's binned by the new manager in the summer.

5022~~~
Pathetic! I've had it with this guy I hope we get rid in the summer.

5023~~~
It was a fecking terrible pass mostly because he went completely the wrong side of the defender.

5024~~~
It still wasn't a hard pass to make, it was lazy.

5025~~~
he had so many options what to do and there was so much space for the pass as well

5026~~~
Not only the pass, his tracking back was pathetic for their goal.

5027~~~
Go back to the Dutch league where you can have it easy; you can be the main man too.

Useless prat.

5028~~~
His Manchester United career looks over before it's even began.

5029~~~
Didn't Nani do the exact same thing as him against Chelsea?

He had been on the pitch for like 39 seconds and plays that terrible ball that led to their counter attack.

He could have at least sprinted back. I'm fuming.

5030~~~
A few weeks ago he at least looked like he was trying, doesn't look bothered now.

5031~~~
Turned into Nani it seems - poor decision when leading into injury time at Stamford Bridge = costs the team the result.

5032~~~
Great cameo.

5033~~~
He should have kept the ball, any smart footballer would have done that. It was a poor decision to make that pass.

5034~~~
Nothing lazy about it. Defenders sometimes get in the way of passes.

5035~~~
Mate he had acres of space to pass the ball under no pressure, inexcusable that the he allowed the defender to get a deflection. Also watch his reaction when it's lost, he joggs back.

5036~~~
Sell in the summer. It's not a matter of taking time to adjust, he saunters around with now work ethic and that pass summed up his entire first season, lazy and lethargic.

5037~~~
Fecking crap player

5038~~~
no 1 -lazy pass and no 2 didn't give a feck about getting back.

5039~~~
It was absolutely terrible and resulted in us conceding a goal from the next Chelsea move. It's not an over reaction, Memphis just cost us that game.

5040~~~
Brainless tit. Absolutely winds me up this stupid twat.

5041~~~
Well then its schneiderlin fault because he was calling for the ball.

5042~~~
I'm sick to death of this bone idle little prick.

5043~~~
Sorry but half decent Nani was twice the palyer Depay is.

5044~~~
Same mate.

5045~~~
Inexcusable? Every one of our players makes a bad pass. It's not a very abnormal thing to happen. He jogs back because he had no chance to getting back in time. The bigger issue was CBJ playing Costa onside and then not connecting with his tackle. Memphis is an easy target though.

5046~~~
Can we stop comparing Nani to this guy. Nani was ten times the player at his worst

5047~~~
Simplest pass ever its 2-0 but he fecks it.

Never want to see him in a United shirt again.

5048~~~
0 goals 0 assists for Holland during our failed qualifiers for Euro 2016 too, at the moment it's really hard to like him.

5049~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5050~~~
He couldn't look like he cares any less.

Shit twat. Sell the spoilt cnut.

5051~~~
That pass. It was so easy and yet he fecked it up. What's the point of this guy..

5052~~~
Pathetic and predictable thread bump.

5053~~~
No brain and no heart

5054~~~
Strange sub from van Gaal... Let's not give him any minutes for a long time then throw him in the last 20 minutes once we parked the bus away to Chelsea. He has potential, but van Gaal really is awful with subs and working players back into the team.

5055~~~
It reminded me of that game against Chelasea at Stamford Bridge in the Carling Cup when Nani did something similar and it led to them scoring either the equalizer to go to extra time, or the winner.

5056~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5057~~~
I groaned when he came on. He is the last player in the world you want to help see out a game. I would be happy if he leaves in the summer.

5058~~~
That's twice he's done it now.

5059~~~
There were multiple interception made all over the pitch, the player at fault is none other than Blind, yes he slipped but he should not have left his position.

5060~~~
The guy has nothing to offer people, and it's not his fault.

5061~~~
not the first time his pass has led to opposition goal... <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

5062~~~
This sort of player type has nothing to do in a team like Manchester United. This is a typical Inter garbage player who will spend all his career trying to shine only for his own good. I can honestly say I hate him. That effort with the pass proved he's not worth getting another minute in the team. He's not interested in playing football, he only want the glory but is not ready to work one bit for it. LVG, I fully expect you to not let him have a look in for the remainder of the season.

5063~~~
You may be right, his lack of effort and disinterest when he came on was not promising.

5064~~~
It's not his fault. Why bring a player that is going to squander possession and is more a possession risk when we're clinging onto a lead?

5065~~~
Louis can take him with him when he leaves. Costs us more than helped us.

5066~~~
I can understand giving pass away, defender got a touch to it, but to just stand there after that instead of sprinting back to help defence it's something I cannot understand.

Either he thinks there's no need to play in both ways or he's just lazy that kind of behaviour is unacceptable. Everyone else works their asses of for the whole 90min yet he comes on and joggs around, beyond pathetic...

5067~~~
That #7 shirt is cursed. Think Ronaldo's been working some of his voodoo magic.

5068~~~
I mean lets be honest, he's been shit and that was shit but they brought the ball up the pitch 90 yards, Blind tried to be clever pushing out rather than going for the ball, and fell on his arse and CBJ's inexperience showed when he wasn't looking across the line.

It's a shocking goal to concede and he made the first error, but calm yourselves. It was definitely preventable after that.

5069~~~
The turnover comes from Memphis's ridiculous pass. Chelsea move back down the pitch, Memphis not even tracking back, and score.

5070~~~
I am really beginning to dislike Depay. He offers nothing. LVG should have never put him on.

5071~~~
It needs to be retired

5072~~~
It's not his fault... the decision to bring him onto the pitch in the first place was completely stupid.

5073~~~
We can all play blame game, a number of players were at fault if we want to nit pick

5074~~~
It was god awful. There was so much time and space that it shouldn't have close enough for a defender to get a foot on it. Typical lazy shit from him.

5075~~~
Memphis Decay

Hope he rots in the reserves from now on and learn Cantonese in his spare time. Can't wait to see the day he finally wears the red of Guangzhou Evergrande, which is where he ultimately belongs.

5076~~~
I hope they take the #7 and give it to Griezmann next season.

5077~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5078~~~
He is being asked to do fairly simple shit, be careful with the ball and do the same amount of running Jesse was getting through. If you can't do that then there is no hope.

5079~~~
Very frustrating and lack intelligence

5080~~~
Yeah, it's definitely not just on him.

5081~~~
Nani did a similar thing in a league cup tie against Chelsea few years ago, and we conceded in the last minute. Ferguson was raging.

5082~~~
I hope that is what happens. 
Both of them have  completely stunk this season.

5083~~~
Would rather Januzaj get a run now. Still haven't gave up hope for Memphis though.

5084~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Settle down cowboy.

5085~~~
What the feck was he doing before they got possession to score. What an idiot. It was a counter attack and we could have scored and goes and gives the ball away.

5086~~~
I don't know what match you're watching but there was plenty of time for him to get back. If you see the goal again smalling is on the right covering darmian, something he should have been doing. I'm not excusing CBJ position but that was probably the only mistake he's made in the last few games. Memphis on the other hand, everything he touches turns to shit.

5087~~~
well yes but are you cupping his bollocks when you posted that it was a player's fault for calling for the ball. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck off. he's  a fecking forward loads of players will be calling for him to pass. you're fecking defending a horrible choice. he's he shouldn't play again for the big team and drop him down to the u21's where he belongs.

5088~~~
Just watched it again. That's his fault.

5089~~~
I guess it just goes to show that hard work will always trump potential. Memphis thinks he's made it as a footballer whereas Lingard has had to graft all of his career.

With Mourinho in charge, there's no way this sub happens.

5090~~~
I would love to hear what Fergie has to say to Memphis. It's the kind of player he would have cut into pieces.

5091~~~
Such a godawful signing which I wasn't excited about in the first place. It's harsh, but he lacks EVERYTHING.

5092~~~
The idea was fine but you cant expect to win matches when you sub a player for a donkey.

5093~~~
jesus christ just saw the wide angle camera from SS and he just jogs back motherf...r. Completely fresh and doesnt give a f..k

5094~~~
Walking back all the time as well and people still defend him! He needs his head pulling out from his arse!

5095~~~
On the pass, would need to see it again but my first thought was that Schneiderlin didn't make it obvious in his position or movement whether he wanted it to feet or in behind. It was sloppy to lose it there with so much space.

Just his luck at the moment that they go and score seconds later.

Having a really rough time in his first season. Hopefully he has the confidence to come through it.

5096~~~
That pass was just so bad from him.

He looks out of confidence and form and subbing him on 1-0 away defending a lead is not a wise move.

5097~~~
I am not a big fan of Depay and I don't want to defend him but come on! You can't be judging players on 5 minute cameos. I'm not saying he has proved to be better otherwise but tonight is not a good night to judge him.

5098~~~
Amen!

5099~~~
1. Martial misses a pass - unlucky, Memphis misses a pass - lazy
2. The goal came when our defence had settled, it had little to do with Memphis. If anything Blind falling cost us, and CBJ played Costa onside.

5100~~~
Man, that sounds harsh but I'm inclined to agree.

5101~~~
kill the game off. end of. he;s not smart enough on the pitch. simples.

5102~~~
No idea what happened to this guy but he looks like a completely different player compared to couple of times I saw him for PSV against Ajax and the Dutch national team.

5103~~~
"Memphis Depay, rating disabled."

Shame, would be funny to see what the useless prick ended up getting.

5104~~~
The idiot should have taken it to the corner flag and park his big ass there. Not even sure why LvG even brought him on other than to waste some time.

5105~~~
Sorry, I can't kill the game off. 

He missed a pass, shit happens.

5106~~~
Partly, others deserve blame too though.

5107~~~
He should have tracked back more urgently and should have done better with the pass itself but to blame the goal on him is seriously stretching it. Yes you can technically argue it wouldn't have happened without his poor pass but there was plenty of opportunity (and the full length of the field) to stop them scoring.

He gave the ball away in the opposition box, the best place to lose possession if you are going to do so. The subsequent defensive calamity (multiple facets) was the problem and the fact the entire team seemed to sh*t the bed and forgo any sense of control for the last twenty minutes of the match is the real issue that should be being discussed.

5108~~~
He basically never does the right thing. Fecking frustrating, but we should have learnt by now not throw him on when we're defending a lead.

5109~~~
Looks as if he's got too much confidence, to be honest with you. With him it isn't a confidence issue, it's basic footballing skills and brain issue.

5110~~~
mostly when he's put on the pitch. he's not good enough. should be left out of he team. shows very little. tin man , no heart.

5111~~~
I still have faith in him, but he's not going to find any form with these 5 or 10 minute run outs every 3 or 4 games. He takes a lot of the blame as his attitude on the pitch is always so laid back and lazy, but I think he could have been managed a lot better.

The stupid decision was bringing him on. We're fragile as feck, and we're holding on to a 0-1 lead at Chelsea, and we bring on a luxury attacking player who WE KNOW won't track back and dig in? Lingard is a limited player, but one thing he does is dig in and run and probably should have seen out the 90. If he was knackered, then why not even bring on Varela as a wide midfielder to run and tackle?

The goal wasn't completely his fault, but they countered with so much space on their left. Holding on to a lead, you need runners, and Memphis just isn't that.

Of all the times to bring him on, this wasn't it.

5112~~~
Completely agree. From my first view i think Schniederlin is to just as much to blame as Memphis is. If Schniederlin holds his run its a much easier pass to make. I also think its two isolated incidents, we lost the ball but they didnt score directly because Memphis gave it away. There was still 2-3 other mistakes in their goal.

5113~~~
Get over it he made a bad pass, big deal. 

The goal came almost a minute afterwards. If blind doesn't come running out trying to win the ball and stay in line that goal wouldn't have happened.

Yes he should have done better but both he and schneiderlin struggled, I think the quick tempo towards the end caught them out a bit.

5114~~~
Totally disagree, his confidence dips more easily than Nani's. Kid's got a lot of front but it's all bravado. The header at Stoke, the f-k up today when we could've finished the game, he's not got the head for big games.

5115~~~
I blame @NLmax

5116~~~
SELL HIM THIS SUMMER.

5117~~~
He passes that, it's two players versus the keeper.

5118~~~
Yep.

5119~~~
not just based on today, but definitely needs shipping.

Aside from a couple of peachy goals early on has offered nothing but mediocrity.

Needs shipping asap.

5120~~~
What an idiot.

5121~~~
That may be because you actually watched a different player then.

5122~~~
Schneiderlin was very tentative but Memphis should have taken control of the situation and forced him to go either way. He was just careless. It wasn't just pure bad luck that they scored seconds later either - the fact he didn't track back was a pretty key factor in them working the ball forward up the left wing before progressing the play.

5123~~~
Limited player? That's a bit harsh mate! Did you not see his goal?  Would Memphis have scored one like that? He'd have probably been walking around in his own world miles away, or smashed it into row z of the stand that isn't even behind the goal.

5124~~~
Well if he's got half a footballing brain in the first place those mess-ups wouldn't have happened, wouldn't it?

5125~~~
Yeah well that was wrong, he of course played for PSV, just watched their games against Ajax, the season before he joined us and he looked really good in both games.

5126~~~
I'm not sure why it took us 80 minutes to make our first substitution.

5127~~~
If the pass was a good one the defender wouldnt have got a foot near it.

5128~~~
Most players "show very little" when they come on late in games at the age of 21/22 and your team has 7% possession.

5129~~~
He's making bad decisions because, underneath the front, he's actually caking himself. Van Gaal was wrong about him, he hasn't got the mentality for this level. He's a far inferior version of Nani. If we wanted a confidence player out right we could've stuck with the Portuguese.

5130~~~
Yeah just seen it again and if he had tracked back he definitely would have been in a position to influence the play when it came back to one of the Chelsea players (think it was Willian). Poor from him.

5131~~~
I'm not saying Memphis is better than Lingard. I'd take Lingard over him every day of the week. His goal was an immense finish and he took it incredibly well. 

The goal aside, I think he was struggling to impose himself in the game when he had the ball, but I'm saying he should have stayed on anyway because he will also put in more legwork than Memphis even if he's running on fumes. It was a tireless performance from him and they didn't get much joy down our right until Lingard went off and that lazy lump came on.

I can't fault his work rate, and he's capable of some very tidy finishes, but he is a little limited overall. I thought that was the general consensus here? The matchday thread were begging for him to be subbed off at half time, and that seems to happen nearly every game.

5132~~~
We need to be ruthless. He needs to be sold. No more keeping players around for a 3/4 years in the hope that they realize their potential and he's not even that talented.

5133~~~
That's not true. 
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/9l40" width="560"></iframe>

5134~~~
so when has he been good enough to demand a starting place. that short time on the pitch has been his normal form. shit end product and no desire to play.

5135~~~
Clearly a player who is lacking match sharpness. I keep waiting for the light to go on but I'm losing patience with him and don't want him anywhere near the team.  He just doesn't project the right attitude of a player fighting for his place or the success of the team. 

Just a bulky, lethargic...lump, void of any desire or commitment to the cause. Lose a couple of stones and you may get your explosiveness and confidence back.

5136~~~
that's his lazy ass not getting the ball to a spot on the pitch then not being arsed getting back. that sums up hid season. thank you

5137~~~
Limited isn't the word I'd use. Developing youngster is more like it. Either way, like you I'd never go Memphis over him, and could see Mourinho if he came in, shipping Memphis as quick as anything. Back to the dutch league for a massive cut price fee.

5138~~~
What was he brought on for in the first place? We weren't arsed about getting out of our own half so it's pretty evident he'd be in areas he shouldn't be, and effectively useless. Someone needs to tell him he's not a professional weightlifter as well, probably the least agile winger we've ever had ffs.

5139~~~
Really mystified by the fact that his touches are really bad and he loses possession ever so easily lately.

5140~~~
What a f*****. Forgot all about football and decided to play it as if it was the 5th minute instead of a game where victory was important. Why do you pass through to Schneiderlin instead of just passing the ball on the side or keeping the ball? What did he learn at PSV?!?

5141~~~
Jesus. I'm so angry right now I could kill a panda

5142~~~
Mourinho will coach that out of him.

5143~~~
Ufff. Still "shit happens" for the pass, but inexcusable for the lack of effort in coming back. Fabregas passed it to Hazard, who was where Depay was supposed to be. :x :x :x

5144~~~
Mourinho will not entertain such glaring mediocrity. He'll be shipped out pronto

5145~~~
It's harsh to hammer him, but I'm going to anyway. His attempt at a pass inside to Schneiderlin was absolutely pathetic.

5146~~~
Someone, steal his Capri-Sunne, he doesn't deserve it.

5147~~~
Oh he's definitely not been good enough for us this season. And it's looking a terribly spent 25-30 million right now. If a new manager takes over in the summer and he's still not looking up to the level required, then I'd consider loaning him out for a season. 

Also, it was a bit of a poor substitution by LVG as well. Needing to be defensively solid and get a bit more of the ball, Memphis, given the season he's had, and that too on the right, was a strange choice.

5148~~~
I hope this can serve as some kind of turning point for him. Not the first time he has put the team pressure after coming on, it's simply not good enough. He has ability but needs to switch on and graft.

5149~~~
He didn't even need to make the easy pass, just keep the ball in the corner & run the clock down.

fecking ridiculous decision. Such a shit, spoilt, lazy player.

5150~~~
Confidence player and he has none. Doesn't help that he wins a pen v Sheffield, sets up a goal v Newcastle and then doesn't see the pitch again. 

But he needs to realise at an absolute minimum that he needs to work hard here. That's how Lingard and Young are here and playing. 

Not writing him off yet and some of you need to have a word with yourselves, the abuse you're giving him.

5151~~~
Think the hysteria around Memphis for the goal today is pathetic. He tried a neat pass, defender almost flicked ot out for a corner where we could have wasted time. Instead the goalie got it. He jogged back at the same speed as Martial who was playing the same position on the opposite wing. Was it 30 seconds? Or more? that past until the goal went in? Get over yourselves. Had nothing to do with Memphis. Could blame any number of players for losing possesion in injury time.

5152~~~
He had a bit weak season but today he went full retard.

If Nani and Chicha were still here they would convert that with eyes closed.

5153~~~
Remind me again why he wears no.7? A series of under-achievers have degraded that iconic number.

5154~~~
They've just shown the build up to the Chelsea goal, and the way Memphis gives the ball away is unforgivable.

We're 1-0 up, have the ball towards the corner flag in Chelsea's half, we have a 4 on 2 situation. Memphis could have just as easily turned back and kept possession and we don't concede. Instead, he tries a nonsense pass that he messes up, Courtois picks up the ball and Chelsea go ahead and score.

As a professional footballer that is just not acceptable.

Quit driving around in range rovers, piss off with that goldenboy/ playboy lifestyle, put in some hard work on the training field and maybe you'll achieve something in your career. Otherwise you're just going to be an expensive flop. Achieved nothing so far, but thinks he's a post-Balon d'Or Messi. Shithouse needs to get his arse in gear.

5155~~~
What can you say... 4 vs 2, no pressure and he gives it to Chelsea. Very disappointed with him and not only in this game.

5156~~~
I wonder what his opinion is of Memphis now, Was very vocal when he first signed.

5157~~~
Nightmare season for him..

5158~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I don't think anyone should blame Memphis for the goal itself, more just comment that he was a bit crap when he came on (which he was) and/or that he should never have been brought on in the first place (he shouldn't have)... but regardless, the comaprison with Martial doesn't really wake because a) Memphis hadn't played 90 minutes of football and b) the ball didn't go out to Martials side.

Ultimately, he lost the ball cheaply when it was easier to keep it/play someone in - during a crucial period of the game... that is worthy of criticism in itself.

5160~~~
People going a bit overboard with that pass.. Yes he should've played it better but shit happens. It's not his fault that the center backs were nowhere to be seen. It was a stupid situation to put him on in anyway. Barely plays a minute in recent weeks, then suddenly comes on when we've parked the bus. Makes no sense. He'll be fine long term, just needs time and confidence back.

5161~~~
not smart but makes up for it being lazy.

5162~~~
The moment the substitution was made, my mate sent me a text saying "calamity will cost us. Tw*t has no work ethic."

He was referring to Depay, obviously, and he was unfortunately proven right. His decision making, desire and work ethic leading up to the Chelsea goal was truly shocking. Nevermind the poor attempt at a pass, or the inability to track back, he could have gone for the corner flag and won us the game.

He seems like a talented young lad whose head isn't screwed on right. If he doesn't knuckle down quickly he could throw away his United career.

5163~~~
Shit effort, but where were the fecking centre backs?

5164~~~
4 players man... Memphis, Schneiderlin, Mata and Martial, and only 2 defenders. You have to score, Chelsea players were not chasing back, they were mentally destroyed.

5165~~~
The way he gave the ball away was pathetic, but that's where it ends. So, what were our midfielders & defenders doing after that, where was Smalling? And what was Blind doing jumping out like that like an idiot?

5166~~~
Err the player he was supposed to pass to and who was supporting his run was one of the centre backs, who managed to get back to somewhere close to the action when the goal was scored.
That being said i think the worse decision was substituting Fellaini, who was performing solidly in defence and midfield. 
Neither Depay or Schneiderlin have really clicked for us so far but i really don't think they're at the "should never wear a utd shirt again" stage. We need to support our players who are going through difficult time not sh*t all over them

5167~~~
Memphis Depay was brutal once again.

5168~~~
Something like this.

Something is not right with Depay.  I think you're right, he has fallen for his own hype and not figured out that the likes of Beckham, Giggs, Ronaldo and Messi were the best because they worked the hardest in training and made huge sacrifices in their personal life.

Right now, I'm thourougly unimpressed.

5169~~~
He was playing the line when he saw all the Chelsea players were in front of the goal and looking to pass through. If CBJ follows as he was initially instead of tracking the ball and doing a step back when Blind was moving up, it's clear offside and a very smart defensive play.

5170~~~
Memphis needs taken out the back and the ego slapped off him. Absolutely stinkin application from a "professional" this season.

5171~~~
Useless.

5172~~~
No.  It was an unforgivable piece of bad decision making.  Unforgivable because Memphis is supposedly a professional and its monents like these that seperate pub footballers from professional ones.

5173~~~
Poor pass but we had so many opportunities to stop it afterwards and ballsed it up. He needs time and patience.

5174~~~
I don't think he was ready for the move to United and it has probably come a year too early for him. Van Gaal admitted that he was forced to step in because PSG were pushing hard for him. I hope he can sort himself out.

5175~~~
Loan him out next season.

5176~~~
At fault for the goal and overall he's just shite.

5177~~~
He's got to improve on this next season surely. He's starting from such a low standard it's hard not to.

This season is a complete write off for him. He's young and has time to adapt and I hope he does it, but we're not in a position as a club right now to hold his hand for too long.

5178~~~
So we did play with 9 men then?? Didn't see Rooney much either today. Was too slow always when he got the ball.. Even Lingard was poor but he scored a fantastic goal.

5179~~~
Have a look at this. Said last week that with more attackers coming in the summer, we should consider selling him.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/memphis-depay-is-slaughtered-following-chelsea-draw-and-rightly-so/63334?utm_content=bufferf0546&amp;utm_medium=Social+organic&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/me...rganic&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer</a>

5180~~~
I think he at least deserves another season to prove himself.

5181~~~
He is actually horrific. Never ever, ever want to see him put on the United shirt again. Disgraceful shit, needs to get his head out of his arse whilst he is at it

5182~~~
Depay loosing the ball close to the oppositions box doesn't cover up Blind's slip and Borthwick-Jackson playing Costa onside. Maybe they should never play again?

5183~~~
No because they haven't been anywhere near as bad as he has whenever they have played? Yeah they are to blame for the goal, but obviously we can't just flame at them given the context of the situation. Depay is just constantly rubbish, it is like watching Nani at his worst except that there are no good moments amongst the pile of dog turd that he serves up most of the time

5184~~~
Both have them have much better confidence than Memphis... Memphis has not played much last fews and at the same time Lingard has not been playing well either, but 2 goals in his two last games does help him a lot tho... Sometimes you can play poor but score goals.. Before we can judge Memphis he needs to get a run of games just like Lingard has.

5185~~~
This board is ridiculous if we are actually blaming Depay for that goal. Some of the comments here are laughable. If you did not see that goal coming before Depay even came on then you should probably stick to highlights on Youtube and MOTD. That goal was the team's fault, at one stage Chelsea had 93% possession while we sat back, did you think it wasn't going to tell? The truth is that we bottled it and trying to mask the shame behind the young guy is just pathetic.

What is even funnier is the amount posters wanting him sold after one season. If anyone expected a 20 year old from the Dutch league coming to the PL under this philosophy to tear up the league, then thay should lay off the FM. Martial is an anomaly, and we should not put such pressure of Depay. Yes, he should be doing much better, like everyone in the squad but to write him off is just silly talk. It is normal for a young player to be inconsistent, talk less of in the PL. It is part of progression. There is also every chance that he could be performing really well, if he was in the same team that Ronaldo broke into with us. Fans need to consider what percentage of 20 year old forwards really shine in the first team, on a consistent basis. It's almost like we are comparing him with a 21 year old Messi or Ronaldo, maybe we should compare Rooney to a 30 year old Ronaldo or Fellaini to a 30 year old Alonso too.

5186~~~
That pass was horrific. It was a simple square pass.

5187~~~
I don't blame him for the goal. I blame him for fecking up a simple pass that no professional footballer should do. Hitting Azpilicueta with the ball was fecking criminal and I'm still pissed off.

Look at this shit..

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/12687932_1129053347114456_812616004977564361_n.jpg?oh=3b1144f2eb8f297d84e02785895debe1&amp;oe=572DD449" src="https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/12687932_1129053347114456_812616004977564361_n.jpg?oh=3b1144f2eb8f297d84e02785895debe1&amp;oe=572DD449"/>

5188~~~
I'd say you're the disgraceful shit, but I won't (because I'm civilized). He didn't do well, and he's had a poor season for us, but this is beyond unnecessary. He's still young, he's still learning, and he's playing in a system that isn't really suited to his strengths.

I especially love it when people point to an early bloomer and use that as a reason for why Depay can never be good enough, as if we've never seen late bloomers.

5189~~~
It's a good thing you don't make the decisions at OT

5190~~~
What are his strengths because I keep hearing that all the time? What are this guy's fortes? I'm really eager to hear that given that there were plenty of people who wanted to take Lingard's place and give it to Depay.

5191~~~
What that doesn't show is that we have a 3 v 1 if he makes that simple pass.

5192~~~
I was going to offer a tiny bit of sympathy because this mistake is miles away from where/how they scored.

But someone just mentioned the Stoke header, so now I can't.

The guy's a complete nightmare signing, atm.

5193~~~
That's just a whole new level of stupidity

5194~~~
Maybe I am... I'm not denying it. I don't really give a damn though, whatever system he is playing in, he has no reason to have failed the pass (you can see the picture above, anyone could have made that bloody pass). He is going to be 22 in a few days and you want to make these excuses about systems when he can't even make a pass that a damn 5 year old could make. Lets make it clear, I am not blaming today's draw on him only but when you look at the bigger picture (minus Brugge), he hasn't done anything even remotely useful for us.

5195~~~
Shocking really. Martial was there too, 30 million pounds and he can't provide the right ball in that situation, unreal, why are people even defending him?

5196~~~
Needs to be shown patience and needs a calming and controlling figure in the dressing room. He is definitely talented but he needs to put his head down and chill out a bit.

Or else he'll go the Di Maria route next...

5197~~~
No come on, enough of that common sense on here....let people have their usual dog to kick. I'm surprised their not blaming Felliani even though he wasn't on the pitch....!!!

5198~~~
All he had to do was either take the ball into the corner to waste some time or play a simple pass to Schneiderlin who was in plenty of space but no he stupidly gave the ball away and cost us the game. No idea why van Gaal took Lingard off and brought him on, Lingard works a lot harder for the team than this guy ever has, bloody useless.

5199~~~
That's bullshit. He couldn't complete a fecking 5 yards pass, it was not a neat pass by any means. No hollywood pass, no skills flick, no no-look pass, nothing. He wasn't spriting while doing it, he wasn't under pressure, he essentially fecked up a simple pass and couldn't bother to track back afterwards.

5200~~~
This place is as bad as Twitter when it comes to over-reacting and the whole "must find somebody to blame to take my anger out on".

5201~~~
The worst thing about this United critics is how soon they forget how young these guys, the situation they have been thrown. Januzaj, McNair, Lingard, CBJ et al have all been thrown at some of United's lowest points in recent history but what amazes me is how we forget how well they did when they first came on the scene. I remember when Januzaj came on in the Moyes era, an 18 year old literally lit up our hearts and OT when the so called experienced manager and senior players where doing rubbish. He was abnormally good under such circumstances. Fast forward a couple of months and after a series of poor performances as expected from a young player, the RedCafe faithful started throwing stones at the kid. Same with McNair, who came on in an injury hit period and was also a revelation, he is now McMare. Same with Lingard. I can only imagine the abuse Martial and CBJ will get if they put in a string of poor performances. Give me strength.

5202~~~
There was a split=second when the pass looked on for a moment & MS might have even started to show for it and then change his mind.  At that same split-second Memphis is making his (poor) decision, which has an element of bad luck.  If it's the 2nd minute and/or they don't score, it's just one of those things, probably.

But he does put a strain on one's patience, to say the least.

5203~~~
AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON JANUZAJ !!! <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

5204~~~
Sorry but as the last defender that poor defensive play, no matter how you spin it. That movement left the backline exposed and also led to Bojacks resulting lapse because he was already marking someone else. Smalling was blamed for same type of defending the other week.

5205~~~
A proper fair comment. It really is just one of those things.

Ronaldo even made more poor decisions than these, we just had a very good team to mask his errors. Imagine a young Ronaldo in this team, deary me. this board would have skinned him alive.

As much as I like him, he frustrates me a lot but he still needs time to mature.

5206~~~
No people have had to come down to comparing him to the current Young, Valencia and Lingard. He still comes out looking shite.

Coming to a new league is all nice and good a decent excuse for being inconsistent. It's not an excuse for being complete dog turd right from the off.

Even if he comes good, I've seen nothing, absolutely nothing, to suggest that level will ever be good enough for United even as a squad player. We should stop wasting his and our time and let go off him. He's not good enough.

5207~~~
This would all be completely fair if it actually applied to Memphis but it doesn't at all. 'Inconsistent' would imply there was a time where Memphis was actually good or showed something. The simple fact is he hasn't, he's been here 6 months and he's played well twice.
He has literally shown nothing, I don't think I've ever seen a young player at United show so little in terms of quality and effort, I mean what is he good at? what are his main attributes? I dont actually have any idea because he has shown nothing.
With young players you can always tell what they're good at quickly,Rooney was his tenacity, Ronaldo was his dribbling, Martial his composure, Lingard his work ethic, with Memphis I literally don't know what it is he's meant to be good at. Well that's a lie, I know he's very good at going to the gym and making himself bulkier and driving very expensive cars. Not sure how we can use any of those things in matches but there you go.

To be honest, he rubs me the wrong way, his pathetic performances coupled with his showman attitude off the pitch tell me here's a young guy with the wrong attitude, he won't make it here because he thinks he already has.

5208~~~
Really, not even Valencia would have managed to hit Azpilicueta. And he loves to hit the ball in the nearest opponent player.

He doesn't look like a footballer, let alone a good footballer.

5209~~~
But, is he really? Lets not forget that Kezman and Aves did very good in that league.

Since his transfer here, bar a couple of matches, he has looked anything but talented. Bebe has performed better than him.

5210~~~
I'm not going to bother listing strengths, because I'd just say he knows how to beat a man and some passive-aggressive person is going to come around a shout at me (in text) about how he's never proven to be able to for us (despite the fact that he has). That goes for most points basically. I've tried before (not with Depay) to point to all the cool stuff players did before they came here to show that they have the ability, only to be told that it counts for nothing, because it wasn't done for us.

Fact is, though, that the PSV side he played in was a quick, counter attacking side where he used his dribbling and off-the-ball movement to get himself into good positions to score tasty goals and create chances for his team. We've been anything but in his time here. So not only does he have to adapt to a new and much stronger league, he has to adapt to a completely different style of play as well. To me, those are good reasons to give a talented youngster some time before writing him off as scrap, calling him a disgraceful shit, attacking him for how he dresses, criticizing him for what he drives, complaining about him being out with his mates and whatever other kind of shitty, petty complaints people have leveled at him.

Oh, so you were saying that you, based on that one pass, think he's a disgraceful shit who should never pull on a United shirt again? Because I thought you were just fed up with him in general, and that was the basis for my post.

And saying that he hasn't performed outside the games against Brugge is patently false. Granted, he hasn't set the world alight, but there's plenty to criticize him for without pretending he's only had one or two good games for us.

Yeah, the lack of patience, not only with youngsters, but new signings as well, is something I find almost disgusting. Not because it isn't fair to criticize, but because some people are taking it to the extreme. They downplay, or outright ignore anything good a player does, while attacking every minor mistake, real or perceived.

Then they attack you if you try to act as a counterbalance, even if you acknowledge that the player has been poor.

5211~~~
I appreciate your comments and don't get me wrong, I think he should be doing better. My average rating for Memphis is no higher than the forum's average rating. Having watched him a couple of time at PSV, it was clear he has the potential to be top class. That said, I didn't he was ready to move up to this kind of pressure at United, even his coaches thought the same thing too. He was only brought in at the time because PSG were snooping in. I don't think we can compare all young players with the same development ruler, some show their potential younger than others. I used to be part of a local coaching set up and I've seen young players who were written off when compared to the rest and overtook them after 3 years. Not all players have the same mental strength. Maybe a run of games would do him good but I see how difficult it would be given the state of the club at the moment. I think he needs to be given the benefit of the doubt. He needs every chance to fulfill his potential but sadly United is not exactly in the right state to nurture young players effectively.

5212~~~
Alright, since you don't want to enlist those strengths then let me ask you why can't he fecking run? I mean, why can't he track back, show some desire on the pitch, whatever. Today he was how many minutes on the pitch before they scored? 5? And he couldn't bother to track back. This is the biggest problem. Even if he can't translate his game from Eredivisie to PL he <b>has to</b> show desire, hunger for game, he's showing feck all at the moment. You know who was not running a lot? Berbatov. But Jesus, this guy showed 1000000x more ability than Depay and was actually a striker.

Today's performance pretty much summed him up for us: very little skill, can't do basic things and very shit attitude by being incredibly lazy on the pitch. I'm not saying he won't come good in the future, fine, benefit of a doubt because we paid shitloads of money for him. But at the moment he's a fecking disaster and if Mourinho comes in, he either changes his attitude by 180 degrees or he can pack his shit. Under Mou everybody had to run a bloody lot, even Hazard, everybody defends. He's already gone at the moment if he doesn't up his ante.

5213~~~
I must admit I have never been a fan, partly because I don't like youngsters being hyped. 
That said, something is just not clicking for him at the moment and he looks out of place. 
He has to mentally prepare himself for next season, to me he wasn't ready for the change in tempo and demands that come with being an attacking player in the EPL. It looks like he is already adjusting, keep it up he'll get there.
The mistakes in the pass and not tracking back to affect the course of play are things that can happen to any player, can't pass judgement on his footballing ability based on that.

5214~~~
What the hell are you talking about...Yeah I am fed up with him in general, but the basic pass that he failed to make today just makes things a lot worse for him; that much is undeniable.

5215~~~
Yep, lost the ball 90 yards from goal and everything is his fault. That makes sense. It was awful playboy him, but that is just stupid.

5216~~~
It's not just the shit pass. He just jogs back after that when he had the opportunity to press Willian (?).

5217~~~
It's interesting to see how views about Memphis have changed as the season progressed.
the following quotes are taken from the first page of this thread.


And now, one of the latest posts of this thread (which had me in fits of laughter):

5218~~~
I'm sorry if I offended you by having faith in Depay. It seems to have angered you something fierce.

I assumed you were fed up with him in general, and commented based on that. You then responded as if I was defending that one misplaced pass, and not just sticking up for the player. I then felt compelled to ask if that one misplaced pass was your sole reason for making the original post, because your response to me defending him could certainly make it seem like it. That is what I was talking about.

5219~~~
No, you really haven't.

5220~~~
Oh, okay. You were just coming at me in such an aggressive manner for what was, essentially, me suggesting we give a player time because he has shown promise. (Also, I'll think you'll find that I did, in fact, list some of the strengths that he's exhibited (at PSV, granted) and that I'm hoping he can put to use here, eventually.)

5221~~~
I
If you search well, you will find similar posts on Januzaj, McNair, Lingard, Varela even Shaw. I feel sorry for our young players

5222~~~
Please elaborate on the multiple good games he's had? I can't think of many.

He's been substituted at half time in a number of our biggest games this season I.E Liverpool/Arsenal/Wolfsburg etc. You'd think it would light a fire under him but no he just get's worse. I can understand the argument that foreign players need time to adapt but he's shown close to zero. Di Maria got subbed off around 65-70mins regularly as you could see he was starting to fade but he looked excellent on plenty of occasions throughout the game. Memphis rarely has any periods of looking dangerous. The league is physical but no way should it make much of a difference in the first 20-30mins of a game, vs Arsenal in particular his defending was atrocious.

5223~~~
Of course yeah young players develop at different rates and we're not in a great position right now to be blooding them, but again I have to go back to the fact he has shown literally nothing.
You look at the other young players who have come through this season, Lingaard, Martial, CBJ, I'm seeing things in them, I don't think Lingaard is the most talented but the guy puts work in, he's chipped in with goals. I dont see any of this from Memphis, he doesn't even posses the basic things you expect from a footballer, that is extremely worrying.

5224~~~
Get a grip of yourself.

5225~~~
I am fed up with him in general, but I wouldn't have commented with that had he not misplaced that pass; because it made a lot of us angry. I am just saying that the misplaced pass is another example to add to the numerous poor performances that he has had this season. As if him not being dangerous or influential enough in matches wasn't already a problem, he has now messed up something so basic which was the start of a build up of events which led to us conceding a goal.

5226~~~
Mourinho won't stand for him 

Guarantee he will be gone in the summer if Jose does indeed takeover

5227~~~
Nah, don't feel offended mate, no point.

5228~~~
From a neutral, the pass was idiotic, but everyone makes those. Problem was him not running back to cover his flank, specially considering he just same in a minute ago and it was all happening in extra time. Watching him feels like he doesn't really understand the game of football.

To quote myself:

5229~~~
It's the mental side and effort of Memphis. It's a bit similar to Januzaj. Both are young, talented and have been thrown into the limelight. Both have failed to impress or sustain/build upon previous success. Memphis isn't the centerpiece and has to sacrifice his individual play for the team - he hasn't adapted to this at all.

The attempted headed backpass at Stoke is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen in sport. Memphis fails to show us that the Stoke debacle was a one off.

5230~~~
Criticism yes, but demanding he be sold as if a bad pass was THE FINAL STRAW. Give the guy a break. He's young and clearly struggling to adapt at United. Low on confidence despite him protesting otherwise. Guy needs our support ffs.

The simple pass would have been to square it, not pass inbehind the defender for so and so to run on to. 9 times out of 10 a pass like that goes out for a corner after a last ditch stretch from the defender. He jogs back as much as he's been told to, similarly to Martial. I didn't see him gunning it back either? We had more then enough cover at the back to deal with the situation, it was poor defending elsewhere. It was a completely different phase of play before the scored. Their attacker (whoever it was) even ran back towards his own half before he passed the ball forward. We had the time to organise ourselves, it was just poor defending. Nothing to do with Memphis.

5231~~~
Then I guess he would have sold Hazard next summer if he were still the Chelsea manager... He has been even shittier than Memphis!

5232~~~
Funny enough, I had doubts early on about his ability, but I was called out on it. It seems I was right all along. However, I feel that he has been mentally destroyed of his confidence, as such I can't see him regaining his form under Van Gaal ironically. Even with that said, I still would not keep him under a different management because I rather give our academy players the opportunity.

5233~~~
You can't see a difference between Martial who plays for 85 minutes and fecking Depay who plays for 5 and is at fault for losing the ball?

And no, it was still the same phase of play, he even followed the ball but was always behind it, till the very end. Didn't bother putting any pressure on Chelsea players with the ball. Lazy dick.

5234~~~
this no7 must be cursed or sth, I have a faith in Memphis but he needs to focus more on the game and work hard, if he cant do this then he can go

5235~~~
I think the ability is there but he needs to sort his head out.  At the moment he looks like a classic case of too much, too soon, regarding money and moving to a club like United. 
That said, either he is showing ability and confidence in training and that's why LvG has thrown him on recently or, LvG is mis-managing him and by throwing him on when we need to keep the ball to win the game, like today, and by not having much confidence he can't make a simple pass or dribble.
Either way, he has had an horrendous season and needs to get his act together if he wants to remain here for a long time.

5236~~~
I was actually expecting him to replace Rooney. Fresh legs to harass central defenders and some pace on the counter.

5237~~~
Man that is true, he is going down as one of our most disappointing transfers ever.

5238~~~
He did feck all harassing on the wings and barely used his pace there. 

Irritated the feck out of me the second he came on the pitch. I usually defend him but today he just didn't play his role at all. 

At one stage, he just watched Hazard (?) make a run towards the line of our defenders, completely unmarked and all he did was hope that Mikel/Fabregas/Matic (whoever had it in the middle) wouldn't see the pass option. 

The way he lost the ball before Costa's goal irritated me too. Schneiderlin was right there. Play the easy option and yet he couldn't even play that. I won't blame him for the draw, but you can't ignore the fact that he caused another uneccessary attack out of nowhere. 

You can see Carrick crying out for him to get back into position while Courtous had the ball too. 

I'll give him next season but bloody hell he's such a lazy fecker.

5239~~~
People want to get rid of him...he has hard time at the moment,its his first season in new league,i mean...

5240~~~
Not really

Hazard has the accolades behind his name to save himself (he's still reigning pfa player of the year).

Its the same reason why Van Gaal has survived this long with results bordering on Moyes territory. Past reputation buys you time.

5241~~~
There's another crazy player who doesn't really track back, he's called Messi. Do you wonder why he can't show desire, hunger, or whatever word?

Memphis problem is not the tracking back. He was requested to hurt on counters. He did it well, got a wonderful pass from Carrick, and then his footballing brain froze but it doesn't mean that he's a lost cause. He will shine in the future, that's a given. And it's a lie to say that Memphis doesn't have skills. His ball control to beat the opponent is a proven one. But right now, he's being clumpsy and without confidence, it doesn't work, just like when Martial failed to beat opponents in and out until today against Ivanovic and it worked out. Everything takes time.

5242~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5243~~~
There is a higher tolerance of poor performances when a player puts a shift in.

When you're a lazy cnut who clearly couldn't give a feck, people tend to turn quicker.

5244~~~
That post is correct though.

5245~~~
He should be given at least a year before making proper judgement. I remember people wanting Ronaldo gone after 6 months <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

That said, he never really impressed me for the Netherlands or PSV, so was not too fussed if we missed out on him. Hes a good player (capable of being one) but he does not possess the talent to make him elite, down the line, imo

5246~~~
If you contribute greatly to you team in an attacking sense like Messi, Ronaldo or David Silva (to a lesser extent) the team will carry you. Memphis is not in that bracket of player yet by a long shot and I don't think he has enough to his game to ever get close to having those privileges.

5247~~~
Absolute BS.

5248~~~
When you can score 20 to 20+ goals a season as an attacking player, you can be forgiven for not defending much.

When you can score 40+, you shouldn't be tracking back, you should be scoring goals.

When you're messi, you can bang prozzies on the pitch, while doing lines of blow off their arses, and not only should you not be punished for it, you should be celebrated for it.

Let's me know when Depay starts scoring 60-70 in a year <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5249~~~
That's an awful comparison. Messi's attacking contribution is so good that he can get away without tracking back. 

Memphis meanwhile just contributes nothing and continues to look like a pub player out there.

5250~~~
Excusing his lack of work rate because Messi doesn't track back. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

5251~~~
People want to blame the loss on him for that pass but Rooney did the same exact thing essentially with his stupid attempt at chipping the keeper. It was a bad pass but let's not get carried away. Other than that he didn't really have any time to do anything and it was stupid of LVG to bring him on.

5252~~~
He's shit at everything and he's lazy. I'm just bewildered as to how he even made it this far. I've tried to be patient with him all season but my god...he is just shite.

5253~~~
Can't argue with that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5254~~~
Mem-piss.

5255~~~
He did but the key difference was that the ball went out of play (he should have cut the ball back to Mata who surely would have scored) so we had the chance to get back into a defensive shape. The time when a team is most vulnerable to conceding is when a turnover of possession happens whilst they are attacking, this is because the rest of the team are not in their optimum defensive shape. I am not pontificating here this is fact. It is what Jurgen Klopp bases his whole philosophy on. It is imperative that an attacking player at least tries to disrupt the opposition team's play if they lose the ball to allow their team to get defensively set. 

Memphis perhaps could have been forgiven for the awful pass (if you are being very kind) but there is no excuse for making no effort to correct his mistake.

5256~~~
A totally underwhelming signing so far. But he's still very young.

5257~~~
Blaming the loss on him is harsh but Schneiderlin was in acres of space on the edge of the area. That could've and probably should've been 2-0.

When you've been sitting on the bench all game and get a few minutes to come on and impress then you better use them properly. It was an easy pass to make. Really infuriating.

5258~~~
I swear that #7 shirt is jinxed.

5259~~~
Who do you think is a more disappointing transfer... Djemba-Djemba,  kleberson,  Bebe?

I stand by my statement.

5260~~~
He is dire. I genuinely cannot think of a worse wide player we've had since the success began under Ferguson. He offers nothing technically, has no turn of pace with a football at his feet and has to be one of the laziest modern day footballers. I'd take a £15m hit on him and flog him to PSG.

5261~~~
How much more did he cost than Zaha? 

Based on his showings this season he's on a similar level or worse

5262~~~
He played as wide forward in PSV and as second striker with the national team. Talking about positions, he is more like Ronaldo/Neymar than a traditional winger. For example, Dybala wouldn't be as effective on the wings compared to playing as second striker in a front of 3.

In my opinion, Memphis is more a finisher than a creator. Unfortunately, it seems that he lacks of confidence for the moment, but I still believe he has the talent to become a regular for us in the near future.

With an attacking full back like Shaw and playing in a front of 3, do you think Memphis would improve his game?

5263~~~
I frigging can't believe you idiots blame Memphis for Chelsea's goal !! There were like 40 seconds between Memphis pass and Chelsea's goal , other then that there were 10 United players behind the ball to correct him .

5264~~~
It was horribly shit from him to give such an unconvincing pass and then not track back like a maniac.

5265~~~
Oh give over, bad pass but you can't blame him when he's been on for a minute

5266~~~
I'm sure Rooney on two occasions has lost the the ball in the midfield stupidly that led to defeats. No one slated him this much.

5267~~~
Rooney tracks back and usually looks like he gives a shit.

5268~~~
Even more the reason to track back

5269~~~
Granted he was lazy getting back but the goal isn't his fault.

It's not even like Azpi was even involved in the goal, who is Memphis man.

5270~~~
The emergence of lingard had really put his nose out of joint.

5271~~~
"Rating disabled - late substitution or taken off early"

I would like an exception for this occasion.

5272~~~
Shit decision to pass. Should have held the ball up. But every single player was determined to piss the ball away. One of them had to be punished for it.

5273~~~
I remember Fergie in an interview talking about how he never wanted Ronaldo to drop and help defend. We dont know what Memphis' instructions from LVG have been. People here could be accusing him of not dropping back to defend when he has been instructed to stay high.  A lot of abuse being aimed at Memphis based on minimal knowledge and assumption.

5274~~~
Meh, people were saying the same things about Smalling after he got sent off against City (myself included, I think). In fact, people have probably said the same things about every young player ever. Short-sightedness is in our nature. 

Give him time.

5275~~~
He didn't need to track back like a maniac, just like a professional.

5276~~~
one would imagine it would be to protect the lead. not give the ball away and then do feckall to win it back if you do memphis. that's what i'd assume since i watch football.

5277~~~
I stopped reading there. And then I made a conscious effort not to perceive anything of what followed from the corner of my eye. Horribly hyperbolic post.

5278~~~
key word, assume and you know the saying about assume dont you

5279~~~
The under lining problem with Memphis is he isn't that good, he's had a few good moments against lower quality defenders, but in general struggled against premier league level defenders.

Add his lack of wok rate in, and you just can't justify him been in the team, currently looks like he is gonna be one of uniteds worst signings.

5280~~~
Funny, but Smalling was covering the hole he left on the right side.

5281~~~
That and Martial taking over his LW position and playing miles better than Memphis ever did for United.

5282~~~
I can't remember him having one good game in the PL. Huge disappointment. Looks like we got a Kezman/Alves and not a Robben

5283~~~
What? You probably need to take a few months off from football! It was a terrible play by the lad at a key moment, but this over-reaction is worse. An older and wiser Nani did similar the last time we played chelsea in the cup and lost in extra-time.

5284~~~
It's hard to argue with that.  The problem may be deeper than just that he's in over his head in a tougher league.  He looks like a payer who believed all the hype about him before he proved anything in this league.  When his play turns to shit, as it has over and over, he's staggered.

5285~~~
I agree that there are some worrying signs with regard to his attitude, and he certainly hasn't displayed the talent one would expect given how much we paid. However, to call him the worst player since the SAF started being successful, as one poster did earlier, is just idiotic in the extreme. He achieved more in his first month for us than Djemba-Djemba, Bebe, Obertan and Kleberson ever did. Granted, that's damning with faint praise, but it's worth remembering that he's young, adjusting to a new league and playing in a team for which there have been very few standouts (one of the few standouts being Martial, who has happened to excel in Memphis' preferred position.)

If we are still having this same discussion in February 2017, then I'll start thinking that we need to write him off (or flog him on a free as some clown suggested in the match day thread,) but not until then.

5286~~~
fecking up a pass happens every time in every situation, that's not the problem for me. It's the lack of reaction afterwards, late in the game, under intense pressure, if you make a mistake you have to run back and help out. Blaming him in some way for the goal conceded is incredibly bitter and retarded.

5287~~~
No doubt hes been shite, but blaming him for the goal yesterday is unfair. He lost the ball at their corner flag, and quite a few others were involved before it ended up with Costa

That being said, and this is only assumptions, but it seems to me he has a shit attitude. There is more to being a footballer than landing a lucrative contract with a big club and then living the playboy lifestyle, but he seems content with that right now. There is no doubt the lad has talent, but what happens with him in the future is up to him (for the most part)

5288~~~
I remember Memphis saying that 'failure is not an option at United.'


Let's see.

5289~~~
He really needs to kick on. He's new to the league, a big jump from PSV, but you have to wonder if he has improved at all. We can argue if its the team tactics or his role on the pitch, whatever is to blame for his poor form, however, his natural ability should shine through once in a while. Lets face it, he has not shown any at this level.

He just has to knock Lingard, who isn't any worldie, off the team for a start. There's no Euro for him to look forward to as a motivation as well. He's just going with the flow.

5290~~~
Yes, attackers will leave holes, it's not something new, is it? Where were the midfielders in that case? He gave the ball away, fine. But I can't believe that we're blaming him for the goal, how about getting an offside trap right? How about staying with/behind Costa? Memphis did not do himself any favours but we had adequate time to regroup and we did not.

5291~~~
And before yesterday, he's done well in substitute appearances & many were calling for him to start ahead of Lingard (on twitter atleast).

5292~~~
I don't mind that he can lose the ball at times or make a wrong decision, he's young and it happens. However his lack of effort and willingness to work defensively is not on. He isn't Messi or Ronaldo, put in a defensive shift!

5293~~~
Just one more season lad. Just one more to show something. Else be ready to go to China for 75M

5294~~~
I though I'd wake up and find some positives about him to console myself.

Nope. He's still dogshit and needs to be sold this summer.

5295~~~
Exact same feeling. Went to sleep absolutely disgusted with him. Got up, watch the video again and feel the same. I don't want him sold, but he needs to wake up and really play better. 

Pass was disgusting - no idea how a professional can pass like that. The pisses me off is his lack of effort in tracking back. Very rarely do I agree with Henry but he was spot on. He loses the ball, he should be sprinting back and help out the defense - he just came on and there were only a few minutes left - there's no excuse. Instead he slowly jog and stood around defending no body. It simply isn't good enough.

The goal wasn't completely his fault, but it could have been avoided if it wasn't for him. 5v3 - you expect us to be 2-0 up. Blind tried intercepting but slipped. BJ played everyone onside (due to Blind stepping up) but tried to recover and almost did.... Memphis played a horrible pass and jogged back.

5296~~~
The lad is clearly struggling and finding it tough in this league, i blame LVG for throwing him on when we needed to close the game off.

Still think we should give him another season before completely writing him off.

5297~~~
Is this a joke? You can't blame him for that pass because he was on the pitch as a sub for a couple of minutes? He didn't need to thread a needle with 10 opposition players in between. He needed to make a 5 yard pass to Morgan who was in acres of space.

5298~~~
I said it when he came on that he wouldn't track back and it would hurt us. I like him, and maybe he's just going through a rough patch, but he needs to wake up and realise he's playing for Manchester United.

5299~~~
I said I wanted him gone straight after the game but that was hasty. There is talent there but the attitude has to change. He won't last under Mourinho anyway if he doesn't change. Mou would have lost it completely if he was in charge yesterday.

5300~~~
Agreed. If Jose shipped can ship out Duff (and arguably Joe Cole) who contributed more offensively then Memphis, Then I would hazard a guess that Depay's days would be numbered unless he really knuckled down. This is all based on the gossip that Jose is actually taking over.

5301~~~
A bit harsh, but could explain his inability to run back.

5302~~~
There's a video online showing he had three opportunities to recover the situation if he was willing to work. Instead he let Willian do his thing on here separate occasions. Carrick was even screaming at him to press. 
Personally, I don't rate him. Worst case is I'm not seeing any redeeming quality. I'm not seeing anything to hold on to that he's going to be a great player for us.

5303~~~
"<span style="font-size: 15px">The Millennium </span>Falcao" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Sorry, just saw this <a class="username" data-user="76497, @Cooksen" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/76497/">@Cooksen</a>

5304~~~
It's as if LVG hadn't watched him at all this season before bringing him on... why did he/we expect anything else from him (Memphis that is)?

5305~~~
I think very few people picked up on this until Souness highlighted it in his post match analysis. I don't think it was as big an issue as the absence of the midfield and the combined step up from Blind and Non step up from Bojack!

5306~~~
laughing at those who say it isn't working out because of our system.  The truth is his attitude stinks and it comes across when he's playing.  What annoyed me wasn't the pass that a five year old could make it was his attitude after he cocked up.  He wasn't remotely bothered and then decided to jog it back instead of trying to make up for his mistake.

5307~~~
This thread is something else and I only thought that he would be a good player at best.

5308~~~
I've seen little flashes that he has creative ideas in possession & a decent first touch & shot maybe but he doesn't seem lightning quick by any means & decision making & attitude are just utterly piss poor.  Big NO atm, and I don't think he can turn it around, meself.  Hasn't got enough, or one big asset which is a threat on its own, kinda thing. Might be wrong.

5309~~~
Go back and look at the match thread.

5310~~~
yeah, match thread were all over it.

5311~~~
Everybody was screaming at him being shit in the match thread and straight after his blunder.

5312~~~
Feel a bit sorry for him. I don't know why but he seems so down and out. His body language is so negative. I'd definitely give him another season because if he does turn it around he is capable of being one he'll of a player.

5313~~~
Yeah I wouldn't right him off yet but he certainly needs to work harder.  Maybe with a new manager in next season he can start from fresh.

5314~~~
I think he needs a new manager at this point.

Hopefully we can provide him with one.

5315~~~
It is really weird that he doesn't give him minute against Derby and other shit opponents and yet he brings him when we are defending against Chelsea.

5316~~~
The europa league can't come quick enough for him. He needs real game time to build himself up again. It's really not helping him that he's always thrown in at the deep end when the shit's hit the fan.

5317~~~
shit from the fans is hitting him, atm

5318~~~
His task was to counter! It's his role that makes that tracking back was not the main duty. Not his attacking contribution. Should he have had a football brain and pass to Schneiderlin or Mata in a 100% safe pass to make sure the ball is in the box against 1 defender and scoring a 2:0, he would have done exactly what he was asked to do.

5319~~~
Fixed.

5320~~~
Playing for the U-21's tonight.

5321~~~
nothing wrong with playing in the u21's. for some it's a great way to get confidence back, which is something he should hopefully be able to gain from it.

5322~~~
Surprised he hasn't done it before. It could really help. As long as he isn't the sort to take it as an insult.

5323~~~
Sell after one season at the age of 21 and his first season here in England? Don't exaggerate, yes he made a horrible mistake yesterday doesn't mean we should get rid of a promising 21 year old after just one season.

5324~~~
i agree on all counts. this is a really stacked u21's lineup today... i assume it's televised?

5325~~~
On MUTV.

5326~~~
Still not sure what he's good at. I think he probably needs a run of games but we're in no position to give him that.

5327~~~
The Chinese dont deal in such meager amounts

5328~~~
Just caught up with the Chelsea game. Oh Memphis. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5329~~~
He did a back pass on a windy day at Stoke, with his head. The ball went 2 yards, when his pass was intended for at least 20 yards. Anything he does, good or bad, will not stop this haunting (but funny) sequence in my mind.

5330~~~
A reserve game is a good chance for him to show he's got some determination.

5331~~~
are you for freaking real?

You think no one noticed that he horribly gave up possession with minutes left, and they went and scored almost immediately?

Is that what you think? That no one noticed that?

Cripes.

5332~~~
I think he's been a bit unlucky in that nearly all of his errors have been punished with us conceding. A lot of other players are making stupid mistakes and getting a way with it.

5333~~~
Memphis, Memphis, Memphis. What we going to do with you, pal? Unfortunately for him, and us, he's just not making the impact as a sub Van Gaal is looking for. I understand it's hard coming on in such a tough game and adjusting to the pace straight away, but the error he made was pretty basic. I mean, what do we do with him? We freeze him out and give others a chance i.e. Januzaj, Periera, or we continue to play him and hope he finds some form? 

I honestly think, as some have suggested, we should try him as a striker. His best all round game come against Watford, in my opinion, when he was played up top. Ran the channels well, held it up, good link up play and scored a great goal. Either that, or we play him as a wide forward in a 433, where emphasis is on running in behind, rather than always getting it to feet, because to be honest, he's not great with the ball at his feet. He's shown signs of good dribbling, but it's been few and far between.

5334~~~
Memphis botched an opportunity to waste precious seconds and he should be condemned for his mistake and his subsequent "I couldn't give two shits" attitude after his mistake, but he wasn't responsible for the goal.

Going forward, I'm torn on what to do about Memphis.  He needs matches, but we can't afford to keep giving him matches.  Perhaps we should start him against Midget Land and Shrewsbury, which will hopefully give him renewed confidence.  But even then I wouldn't start Memphis over Lingard for vital matches.  Not for the rest of this season.

5335~~~
Two assists playing for u21 today. Also:

5336~~~
Good lad. What score did it finish?

5337~~~
7-0, Will Keane with 5 goals.

5338~~~
Found his calling then.

5339~~~
For all the crap he gets he was excellent for the 21s tonight, and clearly looked a class above, I still firmly believe he will come good if we give him time.

5340~~~
Bit raw in the first half but some nice moments and I think 2 or 3 assists so good night for him overall.

5341~~~
Also could have spat the dummy out but showed a good attitude tonight. The lad is talented but just hit a wall at moment and bet this is the first time that as happened in his young career

5342~~~
Confidence, he seemed a bit nervy even at the start of this one as the game progressed he became more relaxed and his performance improved.

5343~~~
He's looking leaner and more agile recently compared to before. He'll make it here, just needs time and not be crucified by everyone because he misplaced a pass in the 5 minutes he was on the pitch. I don't think the way van Gaal uses players and drops them for a long time before bringing them in uncomfortable situations is good for them either, just makes no sense. But hopefully he gets some changes to start in the coming weeks, like against Shrewsbury and Mydtjelland. Perfect chance for him and Pereira/januzaj to make an impact.

5344~~~
Aye it's unfair that we only really go in hard on the times when it does result in a goal, even if that loss of possession was about 10 yards away from the opponents' goal. It was stupid and somewhat typical of him though unfortunately.

5345~~~
It was a very young Norwich U21 team against a very experienced U21 United side. This Norwich team were miles off the standard of the Premier League.

5346~~~
If you check out his performances from last season, he looks very talented.He's short on confidence and has a bad attitude to boot. He has to sort those quickly. Or else he might be shown the door.

5347~~~
I'm with those who want to stay patient with him. You can see the class, but his lack of confidence is making him overthink almost everything. In the thread for the U-21s game against Norwich, look out for the gif of the rabona. He's trying everything, and when it comes off (as it seemed to for the most part in this game) he looks great. Also, his attitude has been criticized, but he seemed up for the Norwich match.

5348~~~
3 assists and got through some running and defensive work/high pressing, grand response.

5349~~~
Who was it here recently who said, I'm not sure what exactly Memphis offers?<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> On a more serious note you would expect him to do well against an U21 Norwich side, nevertheless he looked very good.

5350~~~
He's done well tonight but the fact Keane scored 5 says it all.

5351~~~
Embarrassed some Norwich players tonight.

5352~~~
Completely ignoring today's performance, it's just stupid to write him off like people have done because of a 5-10 minute appearance. He's hardly getting any chances in the team, so one little mistake like that is getting blown out of proportion. People just need to stay patient with him and not get on his back for little shit. Hell, people couldn't wait to criticize him on here just because he's a more cocky person and enjoys more flashy things. Who gives a feck about all that, really? 

Give him some proper game time, not in a style like we were doing earlier in the season when everyone looked awful, but when we actually play more attacking football like recently, and give him more then 5-10 minutes, and he'll play a lot better. Like Rooney and everyone else, he's just not suited at all to a possession side.

5353~~~
I think games like he seemed to have tonight, and his form in the Dutch league, shows that he's clearly capable of performing and looking like a very good, capable player when he's in a more dominant side against weaker opposition where he's probably got more freedom. Now, he's got to start improving at a higher level and feel more confident to express himself/play with freedom against better sides. He's still young though, and he's one of the players in our side I still have a lot of hope for when it comes to improving, despite how abject he's often been this season.

5354~~~
Ahead of who?

Plus seriously, could we stop pretending that 'people are blaming him for one mistake'? People are blaming him for what he's done after that fecking atrocious pass, which is being a lazy cnut that he's shown the whole season.

5355~~~
Blaming him for jogging back? He was the right winger, that goal defensively speaking wasn't remotely his fault. We had almost everyone back and when he came on his role was pretty clearly to stay high and try and counter like he tried to do that one time. 

Also I'm not saying start him right away, but give him more sub appearances and start him in the cup games against the lower league opposition. Or in prior games when the likes of Fellaini and Lingard were being pretty useless in every game. It's not like our team is firing on all cylinders and it's a side where everything is working and you don't want to mess with it. It's improved compared to before, but it's still far from being good all around and can easily be improved upon.

5356~~~
Yes, the jogging back given that he was on the pitch for whole five minutes is probably more annoying than inability to play a 5 yard pass. Who we've had behind is one thing, him starting it all is another and all the shit at the back wouldn't have happened at all if it wasn't for him. He's been jogging back (if at all) defensively whole season, it's been pointed out number of times here that he's giving absolutely no defensive contribution.

Given that Fellaini is playing a CDM role this season I can't see how he would get ahead of him, or where for that matter. Sure, the side can be improved upon, but does Depay bring any improvements to the side? At the moment it's pretty much contrary.

I'll pretty much repeat what I've said last time in this thread, since hopefully it's Jose at the helm next season, he either steps it up and fixes his lazy attitude or he'll be one of the very first to be shown the door.

5357~~~
He's worked hard plenty of times defensively as well, and he has tried to improve on that aspect compared to the first few months. He's just not very good at it. It's like when Nani would track back defensively... They do it, they just aren't very good at it and there's a fair chance of them fecking something up or not doing it properly, so it's more useful for them to be the ones waiting to counter attack. 

As for Fellaini, I'm using him as an example. We used herrera as a 10 for many games in a row, even though he's more of a midfielder, and we've stuck with Lingard for a while despite him not doing much for a while (as all players do). Memphis had runs like that at the start of the season, but in recent months, has hardly had a look in, but in some of his recent sub appearances, has looked a lot better (like the Newcastle game where he made a big impact). But then subbing him on yesterday for 10 minutes when we've parked the bus and had 10% possession in the last 20 minutes is just stupid. It was asking for trouble and isn't going to help his confidence. 

People are just too quick to write him off basically. He's a young player, who scored almost 30 goals as a winger last season, of course he has potential. He just needs time to adapt to the league and develop as a player with the higher expectations at a club like United. Also in an environment where the attack is actually functioning and not completely useless for most of the season, as that also won't help him.

5358~~~
Memphis has played a lot more than either Fellaini and Lingard in both the league and the CL. The idea that Lingard should be dropped after a few poor performances and Memphis should return and be rewarded for an entire season's worth of shit performances is mind boggling. And then you have people saying, the forum is biased towards the academy players...

In all the time I've watched United, I'm struggling to think of a single player who's played as much as Depay has despite being nothing short of complete garbage week in week out. Januzaj and Perrera must be double teaming LVG's daughter if they're struggling to get ahead of Memphis.

5359~~~
He's got something, it just needs a chance to develop. He's going to make mistakes, but now I've calmed down a bit there's no point blaming him for too long. We can't rely on him as a first teamer just yet, but I think he's shown enough promise to justify some faith.

5360~~~
I think it's understandable. Memphis has more potential. I think we all can agree on that.

5361~~~
He has hardly shown he has the potential to do anything in PL. All we have is hope based on his performance in the Dutch league

5362~~~
All these flicks show to me is a lack of maturity. I think Depay and Januzaj are both in the same boat, and the trajectory of their careers depends mostly on how much they want to improve and are willing to work for it.

5363~~~
Ermm...no we cannot. Lingard looks better to me on the basis of this season

5364~~~
Based on what?

5365~~~
Isn't it obvious? Lingard is a solid player. He was a good finisher for the u21s. He doesn't have much more in his locker. Now that's not a bad thing as he can still contribute and as he grows, he can continue to play for United. Memphis has more skill and has shown at first team level that he can finish better than Lingard. Right now his confidence is down and his decision making is a bit rocky. He's young. It can get better as he gets older.

Jesus, I didn't think this was controversial in the least bit. I'm surprised by the responses. It's not like Lingard has looked amazing while playing for the first team either. He's contributed nicely taken goals and assists, but he also needs to improve his all around game at first team level.

5366~~~
I'd like Memphis to show that at the first team level in the PL before coming to the conclusion. PL is a different beast to the eridivise and it's showing atm. Even Memphis referred to the huge gulf between the standards of the RBs he's used to facing. I do agree about Lingard in that I don't think he'll become  a permanent starter unless he gets better and adds to his game but at his age, it could very well happen.

5367~~~
The thing is, he showed more in the Eredivisie than Lingard showed for the u21s or when he was out on loan. Also, it's not like Lingard has completely dominated at first team level like Martial has or even to the level that Januzaj did under Moyes. He's not showing technique, vision, etc... on a level like Pereira or Januzaj that you can factor into this comparison. He's contributed goals and assists, but his overall game hasn't been impressive. He tracks back, offers some good movement at times, and pops up out of nowhere with a goal or an assist. It certainly doesn't show that Lingard now has more potential.

Hell, potential doesn't mean Lingard won't perform better than Memphis next year or the year after. All it means is that if Memphis does fulfill his potential, he'll be a better player than Lingard should he also fulfill his potential.

5368~~~
You seem to think I believe Lingard had amazing potential, I don't. As I said earlier, unless he improves and adds to his game, he won't be more than a squad player. What I said is Memphis doing what he has in the eridivise but struggling in the PL doesn't point to having great potential either. He's used his physical superiority in the Dutch league, it's never going to be enough here. So he's in the same boat, improve massively or fail.

5369~~~
Yeah I also don't think he has the ability of someone like Martial who has amazing technique, dribbling ability, etc... but I think Memphis is capable of individual magic more than Lingard is. I believe his play at the Eredivisie level showed that, if you ignore the instances that showed his physical superiority. For example, free kicks surely show this and they have nothing to do with the physical side of the game.

5370~~~
FKs are just 1 aspect and unless you're a beckham/juninho, it doesn't matter much. I'm more interested in his qualities in open play which need a lot of work unfortunately.

5371~~~
I agree with people who say he has the potential, there's a good player in him but for whatever reason it's not coming out at all. Maybe under a new manager.

5372~~~
And on the basis of last season Young was an equal or better player than di Maria, but it doesn't work that way does it?

I really think that you're vastly oversimplifying his success by putting it down to mere physical attributes. That doesn't explain why he was able to successfully establish himself for his national team neither. Most players struggle at coming in to the league but we haven't really given him a chance to redeem himself which I think is fair as other players have performed better. But looking at Firmino and how the faith that Liverpool have shown him is finally starting to pay off should give hope to those believing that he can turn it around. However, as some already have said I think it might take a new manager coming in before Depay can turn it around. I think that the style of football we play will continue to hold him back.

5373~~~
Weird comparison. One, Di Maria excelled in an even better league so any doubt was down to his ability to adapt not his actual quality. Two, Di Maria did show his quality for the first couple of months. If Depay had been even half as good as Di Maria was in his first two/three months then there would be very little doubts raised over his potential.

5374~~~
This debate was all over the Newbies forum.

Memphis Depay hasn't shown anything that suggests he is a player who can represent the levels demanded by Manchester United / and or any big, competitive club in the Premiership. Personally, I think the guy is hugely over-rated, and is struggling both on and off the pitch to represent the "talent and potential" he allegedly has.  LVG stated that he was one of the most coveted young players in Europe. Well, if he is, that doesn't say much for the quality progressing across Europe's emerging players.

His application to his game is dreadful... consistently. I have no idea where his head is at, and I question his basic skill and talent anyway. poor player, and unless he has a huge, and I mean huge improvement next season, he will not be at OT for very long. Guy looks a very poor player. And his attitude doesn't help.

5375~~~
question to the memphis haters.  do you remember Luke Shaw's first season with us?  He went from looking like the best left back in the world (or potential anyway) at Southampton to one who was worth 20% of what we paid for him.  Look at his second season with us (pre-injury)

Give memphis another year before we write him off.  said this before - if anyone on here is 21, new to the country and with the weight of United on your shoulders let me know how you're getting on as pretty sure you'd be struggling too.

I honestly think it's a case of finding his feet in Manchester, getting used to playing in a higher quality league and understanding the hard work he needs to put in to achieve his potential.

5376~~~
that's harsh, every player might struggle being proven or unproven, Dimaria came here as a worldclass player and struggled as well for some reason, it can happen to anyone and more so to youngsters..

5377~~~
I don't think anyone who worked with him as ever questioned his work ethic. It's probably more about understanding how to work smart than to work hard. But he has made progress, first his timing was off, he was out of sync with the pace in the PL. He made his moves like he would in the eredivisie, and thought the hard part of the job was done, and then got surprised by the defender getting another foot in or another defender already closing him down. In the eredivisie if you pull off a move an defender, you can just chill a bit and take your time to aim for a teammate's eyebrow in the distance. In the PL you've got to prepare for the next move before the previous one is finished. So he couldn't relie on his moves and tricks, but had to change his own pace moving and thinking. Of course that's a big change and undermining confidence. I thinks he has made that change to a decent extend and will continue to finish that change. 

The other thing is his tendency to have a 'mourning moment' after a move or pass didn't work out. He needs to overthink it, and after 1 or 2 seconds he realizes he's got to track back. But then it's already too late to do anything more useful than just jogging back. He needs to work that out of his system. I'm sure it's not arrogance, indifference or laziness, but it isn't good either.

5378~~~
... well, it's an open forum and we all will have respective opinion... but those comments are based on what I have seen.  I'm actually quite surprised that it seems many feel he is the type of player we want at the club.  I see this far too often.

There isn't anything wrong with buying a player and it doesn't work out... as these things happen. But just stating that a player will be better because he is here longer doesn't equate with me. Too many average players (in my opinion...) have been at the club, given time and they haven't made an impact, and become top-players. Anderson, Nani.. Kagawa, Gibson.... Cleverley.... now Fellani, Mata.. Dempay.

All decent players, who occasionally have their headline performances. But that's not enough for United, not if we wish to be a top team again. All of the above play consistently at a certain level.

Depay doesn't even have occasional performance to reference. Club Bruges in September?  Come on folks... we're not a charity for young players to develop. He's not a youth team player, through the ranks etc. He's £36m, with ridiculous salary-per-week. I'm not going to sympathise with the lad... he's a big boy now. Nothing personal, but he needs to show some true quality because thus far he has failed rather miserably. If I'm wrong, tell me why.

5379~~~
agree with a lot of what you said.  the highlighted part though I think you'll find with a number of the younger players (wingers in particular) until they learn playing for the first XI against men in their 20s / 30s is very different from playing in the U21s and reserves.  Yes, Memphis played for a few seasons in the Ere divisie but the pace of that compared to ours, like you said, is huge.  

Hopefully he'll have a good pre-season like Shaw and he'll come back a player with a different attitude.

5380~~~
There is definitely talent there, it's just he's such a confidence-type player. 

Needs to work on his mentality, which will come with time.

5381~~~
If we have a manager that believes in him next season, he will become a very good player.

5382~~~
Based on what qualities that he's shown? I don't understand posts that just assume because he cost £25m he must be talented.

5383~~~
This reminds me of Nani.

5384~~~
Huh? He's scored some good goals for us this season and has had a few great performances. The ability is there, he is just woefully inconsistent and when he isn't confident he is terrible. That's all down to play time and gaining confidence, which is why playing for the U-21s last night is perfect for him - and he played well.

People are too quick to label a player as shit, or world class. It's all black and white with a lot of fans, cut the kid some slack.

5385~~~
Who mentioned anything about the fee? He started really well and was on fire last few seasons.

5386~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.punditarena.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Depay-pass-1024x708.jpg" src="http://www.punditarena.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Depay-pass-1024x708.jpg"/>

If only. 

His decision making will become the unmaking of him.

5387~~~
Sigh

5388~~~
He is actually incredibly consistent. Just not in a good way. These few great performances intrigue me. Aside from a game against the worst defence we've faced all season when did these occur?

5389~~~
I don't think it's a weird comparison at all as i'm not comparing their level as footballers, Di Maria was the finished article and a record signing while Memphis a promising but unproven talent. What i'm comparing is the situation of Memphis vs Lingard to Di Maria vs Young. You can't deny the parallells between Memphis and Di Marias first seasons with us, both coming off of sensational seasons prior to joining us, doing well initially and then went on to slowly but surely fading out before eventually finding themselves replaced by inferior talents who were deemed more balanced and fit the system better. As has been shown since his departure Di Marias talents vastly exceeds Youngs, just like I predict that Memphis would prove that he's a far superior talent to Lingard should he leave for another club in the summer.

5390~~~
Played well in both legs against Club Brugge and the first leg against PSV. Has been incredibly up and down since, unfortunately, considering it was ages ago. And I thought he played pretty well against Sheffield last month.

5391~~~
A few great performances? Apart from the game against Brugge where they gave him acres of space to operate in, which are these other great games? I'd count the split of games so fair as 1 great, maybe 5 acceptable-good and 20 very poor.

He hasn't been up and down at all... He's been consistently down. Way, way down.

He didn't start really well... He played a few decent games with a great game against Brugge who were awful. In terms of being on fire the last few seasons I'd argue that this is irrelevant; Afonso Alves was more effective in the Eredivisie.

To be honest all I've been looking for is any qualities he possesses that if worked on would make him a Premier League player. However he doesn't seem fast, he doesn't seem strong, he has poor decision making, he has a mediocre first touch, he can't beat a man and his technique seems average. Apart from a good right foot shot when he cuts inside and is given 10-15 yards space could anyone tell me why he is highly rated? What separates him and say Carlos Gil who is struggling to get in a relegated Villa side?

5392~~~
You're incredibly generous saying he's had a few great games. He had one great game against an awful team and some OK ones. The rest have been awful. If he played for anyone else no Utd fan would rate him.

5393~~~
So you're right over United's scouting system? He is awful and doesn't deserve to be in the Premier League? Crap. He's a 21 year old who moved from his place of birth for the first time. He has showed he can score goals and he has barely been given a game in the last few weeks. How is he expected to settle.

5394~~~
So is that why he was rated as one of the top u21 players around last year and scored almost 30 goals as a winger? Please. He may be struggling to adapt to the premier league and in particular, United's awful attack, but let's not pretend that he's the only one struggling in our team. He's got loads of potential and with time and in the right set up I have no doubt that he'll turn into a very good player one day.

5395~~~
Needs to play in the right set up. He has always been a really highly rated youngster at PSV, it's not like he came out of nowhere. And he scored almost 30 goals last season playing on the left, at the age of 20. It's incredibly stupid to write him off because he has struggled in his first season in the premier league, playing for a team with one of the most restrictive and slowest attacking plays in the league. Not everyone can play equally well or anywhere close to as well in both counter attacking systems and possession based systems. Especially not ours where nobody does anything except pass backwards.

5396~~~
Just read the thread, paying attention to those who've argued for patience. But anyway, this isn't mathematics. There's no absolute right or wrong, just opinion. Which of course you're entitled to. Those of us arguing for patience aren't wrong, either. If he's given the chance and matches his potential, we'll look like we made the right call. If he doesn't, we won't.

Also, I don't know why you've inflated his transfer fee to such a ludicrous degree. Quite honestly, that makes me suspicious. It's what rival fans do when they want to ridicule United. He cost nowhere near £36 million. He cost 28 million <i>Euros</i>, which is about £22 million. Surely you must have known this if you're a United fan.

5397~~~
What?

He's one of the top young wingers in all of Europe and most sought-after when we were signing him, and you're telling no one else would have rated him? That just doesn't make any sense.

5398~~~
Its not really people writing him off, its more people that never bought into the hype in the first place.

He should not be starting games for us. The only way to get back in must be through perfomances when he does get game time(Even if they are substitute appearances). We cant afford to carry passengers. We tried that with him earlier in the season, and it turned out to be a wasted sub as we had to haul him out at HT.

The opportunities are limited here at United. Just like with Zaha, a new manager doesnt mean things will get better. If Jose , who demands wingers that track back,arrives here and he gives similar kind of perfomances, he's a goner.

5399~~~
its ironic though.

When we signed Memphis, n.l max hyped him to ridiculous levels, while Koroux tried to dampen the Martial hype and lower expectations.

It should've been the opposite.

5400~~~
Lets not pretend United's scouting system has been something particularly great recently. We've let obvious targets pass us by whilst hugely overpaying on the likes of Fellaini. It isn't that he's inconsistent or that he's just making poor decisions, it's that I can't see any positives or potential shining through.

Again I can't see any qualities to build on. If he was strong and fast but was making poor decisions, fair enough. If he had great technique but was getting pushed off the ball easily, fair enough. If he was missing easy chances but was getting into great positions, fair enough.

However I've seen absolutely nothing apart from a good right footed shot when there's no-one near him. If he were a 21 year old through our academy he'd be being loaned out to a League 1 side next year.

5401~~~
He was playing in a piss poor league. Check out their top scorers chart and try and tell me it's indicative of players good enough at the highest level with a straight face.

5402~~~
Imagine he'd signed for Liverpool. This forum would be full of people laughing at how bad he's been.

5403~~~
Even if he was quite decent we'd probably be laughing at him if he played for Liverpool.

5404~~~
No, he pretty much said that if he played for somebody else the way he plays for us we'd be laughing at the fee paid for him and wouldn't take anybody suggesting we should go for him serious.

5405~~~
Looking at that image, you've got to wonder how he's messed up so badly. He either clips the ball into Schneiderlin's path, cuts back and pass into the space or fires the ball across for either Mata or Martial.

What he did was basically pass the ball straight to the Chelsea full back.

5406~~~
I want too see him in the team performing recently. We've clearly upped our tempo and getting the ball forward much quicker which will suit him massively.

5407~~~
Exactly. It's such a simple decision to make. Yet, he goes for one that was painfully more difficult and less effective.

To me, he did cost the draw vs Chelsea. Their chance came straight from Courtous' pass out. Had he just made a simple pass in, we could have scored/shot on goal/missed the goal completely - but at least we'd have been shaped up straight from the restart then.

Sure Blind slipped and other stuff happened - but for goodness sake look at the space Schneiderlin is in. It was 4v2 and he royally fecked it up. It's basic stuff he's messing up with. 

I've defended him all season, and I desperately want him to do well but he really isn't helping himself. Hopefully next season he'll come good. This season has been such a write off.

5408~~~
All the critics are so funny. People are so easily fooled by form. Most people were saying young was championship standard under moyes. People thought Januzaj was the best youth in the world. People wanted De Gea replaced, and were excited over Liam Miller. We all know nothing about football lol accepting that wil make you look foolish less often

5409~~~
Any chance to see a video of his performance against Norwich last night?

5410~~~
Or by stats.

5411~~~
Pretty much. Along with the quite funny notion that's he's clearly talented and it's only a matter of time. He may prove me wrong but it's not the certainty some seem to think. Nothing about his game stands out.

5412~~~
I just don't understand the position of people who want to write him off now.
1.its his first season in a far more difficult league with a quicker pace and stronger defenders.
2.Hes 21!
3. He has shown that he has talent by scoring 30 goals last year, now I don't care how shite the league is, you can't take some of the chances he took if your utter 'shite'. He scored the most free kicks in Europe and I think the fact that he hasn't converted them here points to some more serious drops in confidence and form thats affecting the way he plays.
4.Utd have had their worst attacking display as a team for about 50 years, scoring few goals, having even less chances and generally playing like garbage. Now at what point do you stop looking at the players (Rooney, Di Maria, Memphis,Mata, Herrera) all turning absolute shit and start looking at the manger, to me anyone with any sense looks at that before they point anything at the players.

I absolutely agree that Memphis hasn't performed as expected and I think he's been disappointing, but he cannot, be written off yet unless your simply I don't like him. I think this is where it gets interesting..... I think people look at the car, the tattoos and have build a preconceived image of him off the field and on it. Instead of looking objectively they now just see some playboy, dick who doesn't want to improve and that then correlates to them arguing he's got no talent. I've seen a good few posts in this thread slating his attitude but the truth is no one knows him, all I go off is the fact that when he speaks he sounds like a lad that wants to put his head down and succeed here.
The least everyone can do is give him the benefit of the doubt due to some terrible antecedent conditions and try and actually support him rather than analysing what he hasn't done here yet.

If after next season, under a new manger, he hasn't improved then it's time to cut the rope but until then he deserves full support, credit for his abilities (that he has shown in his career) and abit of bloody slack.

5413~~~
Some people, maybe.

At no stage did I believe that Young is Championship player. His energy and work rate alone make him a EPL player.
Januzaj, under Moyes was an up and coming youth player and I thought he could be great. But he seems to have stopped improving ahd appears to have reached his peak, which isn't particularly high.
De Gea - best GK in the World. I've been saying this for the last 2.5 years. Some will say Neuer is better...I disagree. I never said we should drop him. Ever. Hopefully Mourinho will get him to stay.
Liam Miller - I don't think I saw him play at all. Though I do remember him being heralded as the new Roy Keane, when he joined us.

Generally speaking a player needs to show good form for at least half a season to prove himself. 
This is the same reason why I don't rate Shaw highly, because he has shown great form in roughly 5 games (I think)...which is nothing to brag about. I'll be convinced once he does well in 20+ games.

With regards to Memphis: he was great in the Dutch league. This is fact. One could argue that he has adapted to LVG's philosophy and can no longer score a goal - a problem which afflicts many MUFC players. We will find out next year though, under Mourinho. If he can't create/score goals, he'll be shipped out quickly. It was amusing when people expected Memphis to do better than Di Maria, when Di Maria is an absolute World Class player, capable of commanding a first team place in any club in the World. I never understood that (deluded) logic.

5414~~~
I hear what you are saying.
We should definitely give him a 2nd season (Mourinho's arrival may just be the catalyst to get Memphis firing again).
In any case, next season is going to be the make or break season for Memphis. He will either do well or will be sold off to a lesser team and years from now we will ask, "whatever happened to Memphis".

5415~~~
yeh i absolutely agree that next season is make or break especially if we have a new manager, im hopeful he can still turn this around

5416~~~
Saw some tweets yesterday about him costing the Chelsea. To blame him for the goal is mental. It was sloppy and naive but exactly the same thing that Herrera has done for example and then defended. There was a fair amount of time for the defence and midfield to get set and he just seemed to be an easy target. The same account also criticised him for driving a Rolls/Merc etc. Is he not allowed to spend his wage how he wants? He needs time and confidence to be shown in him if he's going to improve. The lack of patience is worrying.

5417~~~
When any one of our players comes in for extended criticism, it increases my affinity for them even more as I want all the haters to be proven wrong. 

He's clearly not suited to a slow tempo possession side. With a new manager, different style of play and losing some more bulk (he already looks leaner than he did in the beginning of the season), I'm sure he can be a good player.

5418~~~

5419~~~
Why do people keep calling him a winger?
He's not a winger, he's a wide forward, like Hulk.

Zaha (for example) is a winger.

5420~~~
True, even though he plays on the wing, he's no winger. You need a good attacking fullback behind him to utilise the left flank, as was the case with Willems behind him at PSV, or the case with his idol Ronaldo, who has Marcelo to keep width.

5421~~~
Bingo.
That's really ll there is to it, at this point.

Plus, he's definitely not a cocky, over-confident guy. I'd say he's very much the opposite. Flashy cars or not.

5422~~~
not in the u21's today, presumably back in the squad for saturday.

5423~~~
Step in for Lingard. Time to step it up and make most of the opportunity.

5424~~~
Crap from him again. Lost the ball and made crap effort to recover it. Rooney, our striker at the tip,  had to show him how it's done.

5425~~~
The worst thing is that him coming on moved Martial to the right. Where he's been invisible

5426~~~
He's crap. Nothing more, nothing less.

Waste of money like everyone else bar Martial and Blind.

5427~~~
Can't dribble past his player. Can't outrun his player. No power in his shot. Can't press. Doesn't track back. No sense of responsibility when he loses the ball. No determination. Can't pass. Shows no improvement in any way since the start of the season. I do not know why LVG continues to persist with him.

5428~~~
I would call him Ryan Babel mk2 if it weren't such an insult to Babel.

5429~~~
Done a lot more than Lingard today. Actually shows up for the ball, receives it and attacks the full back. Had more shots on target than the entire team did in the first half.

5430~~~
Are you taking the piss or? Has been our best attacking player this 2nd half. He did track back multie times, created moee than all the other places. That chance, he should be doing better admittedly.

5431~~~
Cantonese lessons are on the cards for this fraud.

5432~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Sorry but that's just not true at all.

5433~~~
Surely he was not this bad when he was at PSv? It is obvious something toxic is affecting players at this club.

5434~~~
How bad was he today? I've seen far worse from him, in the 2nd half Martial, Rooney, Mata werent much better or did I see something wrong?

5435~~~
I thought he was positive. Anyone blaming him for our poor showing in the second half are insane.

5436~~~
He's been wank.

5437~~~
Why on earth did LVG sacrifice our best attacking player to accommodate this numpty?

Sunderland's weak spot was down that left flank too.

5438~~~
He is incredibly lazy. There was a bit of play where he lost the ball and started running back, Rooney who was behind outsprinted him to retrieve the ball. I mean wtf, he was supposed to be full of energy at that point.

5439~~~
It really seems that he cant get out of the narrative now. You can say he's wank or a fraud, but not because of this display, way better than his previous matches.

5440~~~
Fecked up on some occassions but was still our biggest threat in the second half.

5441~~~
Can anyone tell me why he got the chance to get back to the team today? I said it last time around - no more play for him this fecking season. LVG couldn't understand this little thing and of course he's getting punished.

I'm sorry to say it but I honestly believe I know more about football than LVG. You fecking fossil.

5442~~~
Wasn't atrocious but why did LvG shift Martial to the right for him? Stupid move.

5443~~~
Aye he was totally at fault for the loss <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5444~~~
Is this lad just suffering from lack of form and confidence plus hes still adapting to new country league and club, or is he just another hyped up over rated youngster from Holland?

5445~~~
Would it kill us to just put him on the right? We have hardly ever tried it. Straight swap with Lingard was a sensible decision. Switching him with Martial was bloody stupid.

5446~~~
He has been worse, but today I expected nothing when he came on and he fulfilled that expectation. He had multiple chance to score a goal (Jackson cross and When Martial cut the ball back to him), but his attempt at goal was lifeless in both. This is not the Depay that I saw dazzle for Netherlands last year and at the moment, he looks short on confidence.

5447~~~
Track back? There's track back and there's track back. When have you last seen him bust a gut tracking back, stop an attack tracking back or do something meaningful when he tracks back?

If Martial had remained on the left wing and had the ball and chances that Depay had.....if only. Crap substitution by LVG.

5448~~~
Done more than Lingard in his brief cameo, which admittedly isn't saying much. Was the right sub to make, but he should have played on the right, with Martial on the left.

5449~~~
For some reason, I am reminded of fat albert when he runs.

5450~~~
Aye it's irrelevant now, the caftards can't be objective about his performances.

5451~~~
Didn't understand why he did this either. Depay did manage to create more than Martial though after he came on, probably because a bit more focus got shifted to the right with Martial but nonetheless, he did okay. Visibly lacking confidence though which is not a great thing for an attacker.

5452~~~
Well, scored 2 goals, 1 assist at the WC and named the 2nd best talent there, scored a couple times in Europe as well. Somewhere in between probably.

5453~~~
Can you not see what kind of attitude he brings to the pitch? You know guys like Gattuso and Roy Keane??? Well, Memphis is the opposite to that!!!

5454~~~
It was a mixed bag at best Ivaldo. He was OK going forward and got into some decent scoring chances but there was still the lazy and slack play that makes him a luxury player we can't afford.

5455~~~
This guy has his confident levels on negative. 

Why the feck lvg risk him on games like the last or this one. 

He needs his confidence reconstructed from scratch, but instead this fecker (lvg) throws him to the pitch when pressure is way too high.

Thing is, despite him being shit today, he still young and needs more time, and a new manager obviously.

5456~~~
He created a good chance for Mata and could have scored but also had some crap passes and touches.

5457~~~
That chance of Jackson was really poor, but he created a chance for Mata, created that chance for himself which was a good attempt, and his attempt for Mata got blocked by an elbow, not sure if it was going in. But that must be wank, I suppose. It was no great performance but it's so typical that he get called out for that display, while realistically it was nothing worse (I'd say slightly better than the others).

5458~~~
We should give him another season and hope that he settles after a good pre season.

5459~~~
Was he actually a good finisher before he came or was that a myth?

5460~~~
Oh I agree he wasn't spectacular by any means, there were far worse players on the pitch that drew less attention though.

5461~~~
He wasnt a great finisher but PSV created many chances so obviously he's got to score a few, some better than the others. He generally knew where to position himself, scored some free kicks, some pens. But it seems to have regressed a bit.

5462~~~
1 of 4 players who were better then shit, CBJ, Blind & Martial being the other 3, made things happen set up a good chance for Mata who forgot his scoring boots also had a couple of half chances he made for him self

5463~~~
He was still getting into the right places to get chances, all it might have taken was a bit of luck and his confidence could have come back. It just shows how our squad has been mishandled to the point where we don't seem to have taken into account he is only 22 and not ready to be replied upon.

5464~~~
The £30M Kieran Richardson?

5465~~~
Currently, hes resembling the latter. Lets hope/pray for the former. Wouldnt bet my mortgage on it though.

5466~~~
It's actually sad watching Memphis try to maintain his brash and confident demeanour while trudging through the monstrous shower of shite he continues to leave in his wake.

5467~~~
Oh yeah, and happy birthday.

5468~~~
If Mourinho comes, he better step up in terms of energy and fighting because he'll spend a long time on the bench otherwise.

5469~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5470~~~
I definitely am worried about how little he has shown since he joined us. He just seems so limited, and not particularly good at anything.

I'm not writing him off though. Hoping it's just a patch of bad form and low confidence. We'll see how he goes next year with (hopefully) a new manager and a more functioning attack.

5471~~~
Mou doesn't do luxury players. He prefers hard working donkeys to a Depay type player.

He is good at cutting inside and shooting with his right foot to be fair.

5472~~~
Any better than Zaha or Nani? I'm regretting we didn't make more of an effort with Di Maria tbh.

5473~~~
Rooney had 1 shot. A 25 yard miss. 
Lingard had 0.
Memphis had 4. 2 blocked and 2 on target. 

Context.

He wasn't half as bad as some of the comments in here are saying. Yes he could have done more/better in certain circumstances but he was not alone in that either. Too much piñata bashing going on in this thread right now for me, personally.

5474~~~
Really wasn't bad today, but everyone is getting pelters. Even Smalling and De Gea, our best players all season long.

Some soft finishing, but he was making things happen, something nobody else was really doing today. He made a brain fart with one pass in particular but it was far from his worse game.

5475~~~
It only depends if the flair player wants to work hard or not. Look at the likes of Hazard, Ozil and even Benzema (who he criticized heavily before he adapted), they thrived under him most of the time. If Depay displays this attitude, he'll get benched and then sold.

5476~~~
Why are you pretending to be opta?

5477~~~
He isn't better than Nani, that is for certain.

5478~~~
1 - The amount of times that's been said to me. Disappointed.

5479~~~
He is much younger and could be!

5480~~~
Don't think he could have given more than he did today. He has a lot to learn as a player though, this is not about confidence.

5481~~~
It was wrong of LVG to switch Martial over to the right, but Depay did OK. At least he tried to make things happen. He looked a bit quicker today - Yedlin is a rocket, according to Rio, and Depay didn't look slower.

5482~~~
Thought he was okay today... Did at least more than Lingard and Rooney together... Martial was maybe our best attacking player. Didn't do much tho other than the goal.

5483~~~
Nani was our best player in a title winning campaign. Depay has a long long way to go to match that. Do you think Depay has enough to his game anyway? It seems to me that he is a one trick pony. Nani was two footed, could go past a man with speed or skill, was a very good crosser of the ball and could score from range.

5484~~~
Not even close to Nani. Still dirty we sold him, especially since it's the right wing (ie. the side he was always more consistent on, but rarely got to actually play on) that is open for somebody to stake a claim on.

Even on Nani's bad days, he still consistently created our best clear cut goal scoring chances every match.

Of course, I am a self-confessed Nani fan. He'll always be a massive 'what if' from me, as I reckon we mis-used him significantly and both parties are the worse for it.

5485~~~
Nani was here for around 8 seasons and was good for about 18 months max. Depay is not at that level yet but he's not even been here a season in a struggling team in a new country.

5486~~~
He needs time. 

In another universe he'd have Gary Neville behind him covering up for him or Roy Keane in his ear. 

I think he can develop into a good player. My only worry is that the standards have slipped, and the characters are missing to bring along a player like Depay.

Giggs, Rooney and Carrick have their own troubles..

5487~~~
Not a great performance from him, but not crap either. Hard to beat him with a stick over this game, as really he was one of the few players actually looking like they wanted to push forward and score. While he wasn't brilliant, he did more than Lingard did while he was on and there was no other real options on the bench to bring on with us chasing the game. 

I think we really need him to get a goal soon. That way he can pick his head up a bit and start playing with a bit more confidence. You can tell from watching him that he is second guessing himself a lot of the time, or things are just not quite working for him. With this season wasted already, I wouldn't mind to much if we played Depay over Lingard for the rest of the season just to see if we can him to show some form like he had for PSV.

5488~~~
Laziness with tracking back and general teamwork is somewhat acceptable when you're the level of Ronaldo and others but not otherwise.

It's really hard to tell if he's just complete pants or if he's mentally checked out. The point above makes me question if it's the latter.

5489~~~
I liked how Rooney and him were tracking back from the same position but Rooney was the one who decided to sprint and win the ball while Depay casually jogs around. Should be sold this summer

5490~~~
Nani outsmart and outrun his marker(s). Depay has done neither. And, if we are honest with ourselves - we'd rather anyone of Young, Valencia, Perreira, Nani, Zaha, etc than Depay. His fatal shortcoming is that he does not show any grit or determination. We can forgive a lot, for a while at least, but if you do not show you have the fight in you - you're not United.

5491~~~
He can't seem to get past a fullback, almost seems like he's going to trip over the ball when he tries, but he did come closest to getting us a goal in the second half, so there's that. Much too fecking lazy though.

5492~~~
You guys are a bit mental.

5493~~~
The No.7 shirt should be given to Martial. He's not fit to wear it.

5494~~~
We should just not give it to anyone until someone truly deserves it. Martial's been brilliant, but let's wait a few seasons first.

5495~~~
He has shown nothing of sort to justify the hype around him at this level. He could greatly improved next season but I have to ask what is he good at really?

5496~~~
I really don't like his attitude. Obviously it's hard to know what these players are really like, but Memphis doesn't seem like a grounded individual and it shows on the field. He plays as though he has free license to do what he wants, but he hasn't earned such freedom. He's coming on in the second half and should be a lot fresher than his team mates, but that rationale he should be putting in a huge amount of effort. It was incredible today to see him jogging back while Rooney sprinted past him to get a tackle in.

He obviously has potential, but that will count for little if he doesn't apply himself the right way. I wanted to come onto the pitch today and really put a shift in. Simply didn't happen.

5497~~~
Hard to argue with any that but Depay should still get another season minimum.

5498~~~
Would love to dump him in the youth for the remainder of the season.

5499~~~
Zaha is a lot better

5500~~~
He just isn't good enough. Said it before we signed him and stand by it.

5501~~~
Bingo mate...

5502~~~
Such a shame. He was decent in the early half of the season. LVG drained him senseless by playing him every game. He is pretty much useless for the remainder of the season. How is that smart man management?

5503~~~
Can't stand him.
Other than the Brugge games who has he performed against?

He's be dreadful, and not only has he been dreadful, he's also not given a feck either. In my opinion, he's all about his image and not switched on enough to care about the game.

5504~~~
Even in his worst form, Nani used to work his socks off for the team.

5505~~~
That was unbelievable. It is a perfect example of the kinda player he currently is.

5506~~~
Personally think he does have talent, watching him for PSV last year he can offer us something, but he needs to be dropped for the rest of the season, go told to train with the youth, give him a boot up the backside and hope he fecking wakes up.

5507~~~
That's just utter bullshit

5508~~~
That was disappointing. I wasn't too annoyed by his contribution last week given we were ahead, but casually jogging back with your 43 year old captain out-running you and your team being behind and needing to turn things around, was extremely poor.

5509~~~
Memphis isn't fit to lace Nani's boots <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5510~~~
Agreed. Early half of the half of the half of the half of the half of the season, he was absolutely incredible.

5511~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5512~~~
He has a lot of talent but a lot of the time just looks like he can't be bothered. Would like to see him knuckle down and try and earn his way into the first team through merit. but at the minute he's far from it.

5513~~~
I'm not sure why the main criticism of our left winger is a lack of tracking back. If we had a system that made sense, when searching for an equaliser late in a match the last thing you want is a winger wasting his energy and getting out of position to track back. 

The issue I have with him is that he's out there to create chances, and while he showed glimpses, the quality of the final ball was woeful. 

But going after him for some perceived lack of defensive effort is missing the point. Might as well criticise Smalling for being singularly unable to control a football and pass the damn thing. It's true, but that's not his role in the team.

5514~~~
Agreed. Unfortunately when you're shite at what you are supposed to be doing other areas will come under the scanner.

5515~~~
As a dutchie i would love to see him be a success, but he needs a kick from behind. 120.000 a week is by no means a justification to not give it you all on the pitch. Obviously he has time on his side, but next season he surely needs to improve/

5516~~~
Giving him the #7 shirt has killed that number totally. The new generation will think of it as a losers number. Thanks a lot Memphis!

5517~~~
All three new signings have struggled (Darmian, Schneiderlin, Memphis). Give them time before you judge.

5518~~~
Outsmarting.. The main problem here. Defenders seem to know his intentions, yet he still goes for it. Even when receiving a pass the defenders read the situation better than him.

5519~~~
Yeah, people should remember how poor Ozil was for a long time after initially impressing for Arsenal. Plus, the situation at United doesn't seem to be doing any favours to many players.

5520~~~
I can't see him surviving under Mourinho. You have to pretty special to get away with a lack of work rate under his management i.e. Sneijder, Ronaldo

5521~~~
Was he protected by referees? Just a feeling I get when watching him.

5522~~~
Sort of, he was the star player and was treated so by his team and the refs, still, he was given a free birth off of the left, he'd come over pick up the ball and have a look for a pass, or run at someone, take a shot, on free kick duty, generally... look like a threat.
What on earth he currently offers to this Man Utd team is beyond me.

<a class="username" data-user="64110, @Skills" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64110/">@Skills</a> above is right, Mourinho will boot him out, cant see any other outcome with his lack of teamwork and effort. He's not good enough currently to be offered a free role.

5523~~~
This. It's simply the truth. If you spent time watching PSV last season, you would realise he is technically short but made up for it by taking a ridiculous amount of shots.
@NlMax had people believing he was the second coming of Messi.
I will be honest, I don't have much hope for him. If he stays, he's going to spend the majority of next season on the bench. It's just the truth.
I was hounded out of the newbies last year for calling him an underwhelming signing and saying spew should steer clear before he came.

5524~~~
Thank you

5525~~~
Its quite noticeable in how much time and space he expects, lacks of any ideas when he doesn't get it and falling over for fouls when dispossessed. 
Any player can be phenomenal if afford all the luxuries. I hope he is ready to go back to basics and understand the problem is deeper than confidence, from what I have seen though it seems he thinks if he can start scoring it will all fall into place.
He should watch some pub football, will help him understand the football culture better and what is required of him as a footballer in England.

5526~~~
Doesn't look at all convincing trying to run at players. Looks quite slow, heavy footed, predictable and rarely looking like he's fully in control of the ball. Been extremely underwhelmed by him

5527~~~
Been cutting him a lot of slack this season but enough is enough now, he needs to pull his socks up or he'll soon be packing his bags and heading back to Holland branded the latest United flop.

5528~~~
Ozil had proven himself at the highest level. It's a pointless comparison. If you want like for like there are better ones.

5529~~~
He's taking a really fecking long time to find his feet. It's not like he's had the odd brilliant game either in the Premier League. Just total shit. Header vs Stoke, misplaced vital pass against Chelsea...just not good enough so far.

5530~~~
It's just a name that came to mind. People who can be patient and give players a chance will do that, those who don't won't - no matter what someone says.

5531~~~
He needs to provide a reason to be patient. If things aren't going well then work hard. Playing shit and not putting effort in is not going to go down well.

5532~~~
Like many others he looked good when started playing for United, but instead of getting better with time he got worst which is nothing but poor managment from LVG.

Playing with fear from making mistake(s), confidence non existing, he looks like he forgot how to play footy overnight.

5533~~~
What percentage of foreign players actually hit it off in their first season? I understand that people are are angry but it's ridiculous when people just don't want to have hope in him succeeding at all. Not all 21 year olds are Messis you know? The boy is here because he has potential, what that means is that he can get better. The club is in a poor state, the tactics are not great, the manager isn't cutting it as we had hoped, are these the conditions for a potentially good player who relies on high confidence levels? I think not.

Our manager persisted with Rooney for months despite him serving up some atrocious football for a £300k United and England captain. And in that time we lost a lot of games that we shouldn't have too, only recently did things improve, not by much mind. Imagine if the manager persisted with Depay in a similar manner, there is every chance that the boy could be performing to the potential that is expected of him.

It's sad to see fans hide behind a young player's poor performances knowing the circumstances of the club especially on the pitch, whereas the so called senior players with decades of experience can serve up rubbish with no complaints cos we knew they had it in them 4 years ago.

He has been poor no doubt but to write him off after a couple of games in his debut season, a bad season for the whole club is just moronic (apologies) by some posters.

5534~~~
I don't have the data at hand to give you a percentage. Do you know the answer to that question? How many players have a shite first season and then continue to be shite because they just aren't that good?

As bad as Rooney has been he's shown before to be a very good player. He's also done better than Depay this season too. Ultimately Depay hasn't been good enough to keep Jesse Lingard out of the team. And that's nobody's fault but his own. If things aren't going well in an attacking sense then work a bit harder on the pitch. Do that and peopl le may cut him more slack. He isn't owed anything.

5535~~~
Many saying he had a great start. He was good in the two Bruges games, poor against Spurs, decent against Villa. The rest were just Memphis Depay performances. He has not been great for any period.

5536~~~
Well, his last season suggest that he can put in some pretty good performances for someone so young. You have blatantly failed to ignore that and categorize as a player with no potential to go and assume that he would be poor beyond this season. I would like to know what your thoughts were on him before he joined United. Ozil as mentioned by the other poster was shoe in for the worst piece of transfer business in recent history but has turned it around to potentially be the player of the season. Maybe we should have the same hope for a 22 year old player. Sheeesh, this place!

When you say before, how many seasons ago are we talking about here? Because the Rooney for the last 2 seasons has been living off past glories and hype, yet many have persisted with him knowing that he is on a severe decline and will not improve in any way but yeah let's write off a player who will still improve by all accounts and has a future on him.

Of course, Rooney will do better given the game time that he has been afforded. Rooney actually hasn't improved, he just hit form like most players, even the poor ones do given the a good run of games, so to compare him on that level to Memphis is unfair.

May I remind you that our very own CR7 was actually bad  in his first few months but the quality of the team around him, the manager, the results seriously masked his inadequacies then. If CR7 was in this team as his first, he may be facing the same criticism that Memphis is facing now. Now I'm not saying that they are on the same level but that young players need the right conditions around them.

It's also easy to compare him to Lingard who has grown up around this league all his life and knows what is expected of him, who knows the importance of tracking back that a lot of fans want to see. Even Martial for all is brilliance is really poor at tracking back but that is not the point here. You just don't go from the Dutch league to the PL and suddenly light up the place as a young player.

5537~~~
Utter shite again. We lost money on Zaha to buy him? At least Zaha crosses the ball.

5538~~~
Give a young Player a chance

5539~~~
What? Did you even watch the match? Or do you know what utter shite is?

5540~~~
At this point i maitain that half decent Nani is twice the player Mephis currently is.

5541~~~
You win some, you lose some.

Martial came in and immediately ripped it up, in spite of us playing such turgid football.

Unfortunately Memphis is proving to be a much slower burner.

Just something feels wrong with him, be it the suspicion on his extracurricular activities, or the clear "bling" nature of the guy.

Personally though, it was seeing him play for the dutch and always thinking "this guy aint that good", but upon hearing we'd signed him and hearing his stats, hoping I was wrong!

Whatever happened to him being a free kick taking legend by the way <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5542~~~
I hope he doesn't end up being another player who hangs around at United for 5 years before the club accepts he is another shit player who needs to be sold. Wonder how much we could could get for him....£10m?

5543~~~
Take your own advice.

5544~~~
I said it about two months ago and I stick by it now: he reminds me a lot of Nicklas Bendtner.

5545~~~
His last season was at such a low level of football it's almost meaningless. Look at the scorers charts in Holland this season. Did you watch him much last season or are you just basing his performances on stats? I had no opinion on him beforehand really. I saw him at the Worild Cup and didn't think much of him but it's a small sample size. This season he's been dreadful. Had he a history of performing at the highest level like Ozil did maybe I'd cut him more slack.

Rooney has been past his best for a while. Even then he's been better than Depay has. The reason he continues to play is because of him proving himself in the past. Depay hasn't done that yet. Lingard's Premier League experience consisted of one half before this season. Do you think you need to have grown up in England to understand that working hard on the pitch is necessary?

Also, the Ronaldo comparisons do you no favours. Ronaldo was both better than Depay has been and also three years younger.

5546~~~
I think Depay is rubbish

5547~~~
He's such a one-trick pony.  Apart from cutting in from the left and trying to curl a shot in with his right from just inside the corner of the box, does he have any other ideas at all?

5548~~~
I agree with this (except for the moronic part, as everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and I even understand the frustration). His confidence is shot, but he doesn't hide. That's a good sign. He still tries to take on players and make things happen. I watched his performance for the U21s against Norwich and his attitude was fine.

5549~~~
Nope, none at all. 

He is worse than I thought he would be in the summer. When people say that X or Y will come good when they have had time to adjust to the league, those players in this period show some talent during that makes you belief that it's a matter of time. With this guy, the writing is pretty much on the wall. He doesn't have anything in game other than cutting in and trying to take a shot. That worked in a shit league for 26-28 times a season but won't work here. 

Another one for China.

5550~~~
This.

I'm not in the 'get rid camp' yet but depending on Martial's position ST/LF is another position open to better addition.

5551~~~
I've had enough of this bullshit about giving him time and patience. You give time and patience to players who have shown something. Given you some hope that that once they get it right they might turn out to be United quality. Depay has been complete shite from day 1. He's shown no quality, no ability at all in his time here. I'll give Januzaj and Lingard patience because I've seen glimpses of something that make me think they might at least make it as a squad player here or more in Januzaj's case. I see nothing in Depay at all. I compared him to Young at the start of the season and it appears that was grossly unfair on Young. He's closer to Bebe than he's to Zaha. He's single worst United winger to have racked up this much playing time in my lifetime.

And for the love of god stop bringing Nani and Ronaldo into this. They got time and patience because their immense talent was obvious from day one. Hell, even Anderson showed more in his first season than Depay has.

5552~~~
Scapegoat-ism 

Its your least attractive trait redcafe 

Memphis obviously has talent - he showed that at PSV and in the World Cup 

Sure his time at Manchester United has been disappointing but theres a lack of patience on here in terms of him 

Hes only played a few cameo roles since that awful mistake againdt Stoke and I wonder how anyone expects him to properly find his form when hes barely getting gametime 

For what its worth he did put in one great delivery and had a good shot yesterday 

Memphis was at best alright yesterday which is a damn sight better than others in the team and our whole team bar De Gea were not at their best 

I think Memphis needs time, encouragement and actual game time - he has much more to show

5553~~~
He has no spring in his step, he just seems so slow and cumbersome. Dutch Zaha is an insult to the real Zaha.

I hope he likes China.

5554~~~
There is no guarantee that the next manager will bother with him;just like Zaha found out.

And we really lack a proper winger in our system (one who can beat a man, has pace and can cross) . So we'll still definitely need to go to the market for that. Depay is more of a forward, however we have a much better player for that role in Martial. He's game time could get even less next season.

5555~~~
I'm convinced he's either going to be in the bench or sold next season. We will sign two attackers at least in the summer and they will be ahead of him. Not looking good.

5556~~~
He's not showing signs of being worth keeping at all.

If Jose comes here, he'd be in big trouble. You simply have to track back with him. Coupled with the fact that Memphis has minimal output too, that spells trouble. 

I've mentioned Zaha as an example of someone bought for a large fee, but who didnt show enough to be kept. When a new manager comes in, because he's not the one responsible for the large financial outlay, he has more room to get rid of underperforming players. Its similar to the license that Van Gaal had here when he first arrived.

5557~~~
People need to stop investing so much emotions into players. Players come and go and there's no need to play and play players just so they can develop. Just look at his mentality ffs!! Is that the kind of player you want in a CL final when things start going against you? There's a reason players like that never reach anything in their careers.

5558~~~
Gotta love how everyone is being shipped out to China by the Caf.

5559~~~
I don't even want him on the bench. You bring someone off the bench with the hope of achieving something different, of making an impact. At this point, I doubt anyone feels he will have that impact, just a sense of dread that he is going to f*** up somehow and cost us something at some point. And that he's going to make our blood boil because he is going to be lazy and irresponsible on the pitch.

5560~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5561~~~
It's weird, but ever since he's come
To England his shot power has looked nowhere near the same, I actually think it might be to do with his boots. He scored pretty much all his goals in Holland with adidas boots, but since he switched to the new ones he's stopped scoring and his form has gone bad. Probably just a weird coincidence but maybe they lack traction/have poor footing .

5562~~~
Surely he shouldn't be switching away from Adidas the season we go to an Adidas sponsor

5563~~~
That bizarrely seems to be where the new money is, so it'd be great if we could ship some players there for huge money, rather than the usual 2-3m to Everton or Sunderland.

5564~~~
I doubt too many players in their prime will do a Teixeira and move to China. Someone like Memphis certainly won't.

5565~~~
He went to under armour at the end of the psv season, and that coincided with his form dipping too. Probably just a coincidence

5566~~~
His attitude is what pisses me off the most and makes me think he should be gotten rid of. He's had enough time to know what's required of him and yet every display we've seen of late has been lackadaisical and careless.

5567~~~
He's not a hard worker at the moment. There was a moment when he lost possession yesterday and just jogged back half paced. Rooney came belting down to try to get it back. He doesn't understand this league at all at the present.

5568~~~
Had some good moments when he come on yesterday, but still not making the impact expected. Maybe he's a player who needs to start a game and work his way into it, but he had plenty of times to do that prior to him being dropped.

Very romantic guy, all I`ll say is the money in football ruins players, and hes one of the many example of youngsters getting too much too early

Massive bellend for doing that, I don't care what anyone says.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5572~~~
For being in a picture with two women? Or is there more to it?

Massive bellend for losing us that Chelsea game. Don't care what anyone says, it was his fecking fault.

5573~~~
No apparently he is being a bellend because he has bad taste, there is only one woman.

5574~~~
Two women? Wtf are you talking <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Anyway, wtf is this about? He just thinks about his cars, grills, tattoos, girlfriend, basically anything outside football, no wonder he is shit. Whats next? Posing with a gun a la Nile Ranger? This shitty attitude doesnt help one bit, should close all his fecking online accounts and train night and day to get to a level considered good enough to clean Martial's boots, let alone play for us.

5575~~~

If his game on the pitch was as good as his game with girls, he'd be world class. Really hope he steps it up next season.

5578~~~
Refuse to call it after 1 season at a new club in a new league. Make no mistake he has been truly awful and his attitude seems to be a massive problem. as people have mentioned he's the quintessential "Too much, too soon" young starlet rolling about in fancy cars and going clubbing instead of focusing on what is, a very short career where if he aspires to be the best, he has to make sacrifices for, and at the moment it doesn't seem like he wants to do that.

something i posted before though earlier in the season, is that because he seems to have bulked up a considerable amount of mass before the season started, I believe it has seriously hampered his game and he has failed to adapt to his new weight. especially in a sport like football, excess bulk regardless of if its lean muscle or not, will hit a point where it becomes more of a hindrance than a positive. 

His movement seems sluggish, whilst he seems quite strong he also looks off balance during his take ons. he seems to have lost a yard of pace which looked to be a part of his game at the world cup. So all and all in addition to having to adapt to a new home, new surroundings, better players etc He's also having to relearn his game to his new build, and redevelop those attacking instincts. 

Ill use the example from basketball i used before, Raptors center Jonas valanciunas a couple of seasons ago went on a Strength and conditioning program where he put on another 8-10kg or so of muscle in order to improve his post game. but what actually happened is at 7 ft, that extra 10kg or whatever of bulk made him sluggish and killed a ton of his natural athleticism and his rebounding and everything went to shit for a bit.

If memphis slimmed down to a more suitable build for football (most footballers are incredibly skinny for athletes in general) i think he would begin to reclaim a bit of the form that saw us spunk 30m pounds on him.

5579~~~
Aye, at the start of the season he was going over too softly, perhaps he added more bulk to counter that, but he was always more than stocky enough for a footballer.

5580~~~
Mayhem that most (seemingly) are writing off a 22 year old after his first season in England while he's playing for a manager that only 1 attacking player has looked good under in 2 years. 

He's undoubtedly got some lessons to learn and needs to get his head down but the hate he's getting here is embarrassing. The football forum is generally a mess nowadays and threads like this are a reason why.

5581~~~
A season long loan to Sunderland wouldn't be at all out of order for this clown.

Steve Harvey's daughter?

That picture on the jacket reminds me of the King of Queens episode when Doug had a painting made of Carrie and she had a man arm.

5585~~~
Is it wrong to say she looks less painted on the jacket?

5586~~~
This lad is one of the worst players I've ever seen play for United

Hope I'm wrong but, he is awful

At one point, he lost the ball....He jogged back after the lad who took the ball off him...Rooney was behind Depay when this happened and yet, Rooney ended up ahead of Depay and tried to dispossess whoever it was, while Depay was still jogging back.

He's not cut out for United IMO

5587~~~
Rooney looked frustrated with him at weekend, some many simple balls are given away with lacklustre effort. That's not that I think Rooney has been great either but Depay is failing at all the simple stuff. 

I'm starting to think he's just waiting for the season to end, so that he can bugger off elsewhere.

5588~~~
Nah, he loves the attention and prestige of being a Man Utd player.

5589~~~
look at his interview when he signed and all the comments he made. I think he expected to come in be the main man and start winning games on his won. Already talking about being a legend. There's nothing wrong with that but the difference in level has overwhelmed him. He isn't a bad player but he looks like he wants more time to make every decision on the pitch and he doesn't look like improving.
I said it in the summer that I think his technical level is very low. His game in PSV was all about finding enough space to get his shot away. There isn't that space in this league and he's looking clueless.
The frustrating thing is you can't even rely on him to change a game because he wants to do every thing at 0.5mph.
As I said last week, I think we will bring in a couple of wingers and strikers. He's in real trouble.

5590~~~
People will say it's kneejerk. But when assessing a player, you looks for positive signs, redeeming factors to say, "ok lets see how it goes at least he's doing this well". I'm not seeing anything

5591~~~
His movements are good, but he moves like a striker not like an inside forward.

5592~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPwejuCWgAAUMkE.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPwejuCWgAAUMkE.jpg"/>

5593~~~
Let the guy live. Who cares what he does in his personal time? Criticise him for what he does on the field, not off (unless of course it's something utterly stupid).

5594~~~
He kind of remind me Lacazette and Aubameyang at the same age, they were playing wide and you could see that something was wrong, at the time I thought that it was the players being wank but when they finally played upfront it was obvious that they were misused. Memphis could be a poor player but since he has mainly been a finisher, I think that he might be in the wrong position.

5595~~~
How much did we pay for him?

5596~~~
i think 21m without addons, not much.

5597~~~
Not worth 10 at the moment.

5598~~~
After 7 months, in a fairly poor team.

5599~~~
Im not sure I can see him being a central striker but in a front 3 as a wide forward rather than a winger perhaps that would bring the best out him.

Depay---Martial---Embolo?

Probably a bit too FM for it to work in real life but as a minimum I hope he gets another season (hopefully under a new manager) to show what he can do

5600~~~
Refreshing to see a reasonable post!

5601~~~
I have never seen Embolo play but I would swap Memphis and Martial, Martial is faster, better at dribbling, better at defending, he has more stamina. While I see a good finisher in Memphis.

5602~~~
Memphis has missed more sitters than Lingard has this season. I thought finishing might be his saving grace but he's been rater crap at that as well.

5603~~~
Well, a player out of confidence will miss sitters, like our own Chicharito. But I won't pretend that Memphis is a guaranteed good striker.

5604~~~
But he hardly does anything on the pitch.

5605~~~
And we've rightly hounded him for it. He's 22 years old and has a life outside of his job, at which he is terrible, and we should let him live it.

5606~~~
Was he out of confidence at the start of the season as well, which is when most of his sitters came?

In any case, I was questioning the assumption that Memphis is a good finisher, when based on his time at United that's not the case. Just like how he was supposed to be a good dribbler when we signed him. There's no reason to fit him in the team when he's so crap. Relegate him to the U21's for a while and be done with it.

5607~~~
At the start of the season he was visibly nervous and we created nothing, he was never a good dribbler just a capable one, he was never a winger and he was never a creator. That's why I was convinced that we wouldn't sign him because he wasn't a straight answer to our problems.

5608~~~
Well the problem is, he looks like he doesn't give a toss on the pitch but is more than happy to 'brag' about the luxuries being a footballer brings. That's why he is getting the abuse he is. Remember when Ronaldo was sleeping with prozzies, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian? No one cared so much because he was fantastic on the pitch and justified the right to 'brag / live the high life'.

5609~~~
He's celebrated his birthday... and Valentines day. Nothing wrong with that? He dresses as he pleases, once again, nothing wrong with that. He drives a car that he can afford to own, nothing wrong with that.

However, he resembles a donkey on the field, and we can, rightly, criticise him for that.

5610~~~
Everytime he comes on the pitch I for some reason get excited. Then the ball goes near him and I remember what a clown he is. So frustrating.

5611~~~
Maybe he's finding it difficult to come to terms with the pace and physicality of the league. Maybe he'll come good over the summer. I, personally, don't think he's shown any glimpse of potential at this level. But I'm willing to give him time. The one thing I find annoying is that no matter how good Martial is doing at LF, once they both are on the same pitch, its always Martial that is moved to the least suitable position. No fault of Memphis though, I know.

5612~~~
I think this more down to trying to get Memphis settled down into a position, We all know that Martial is capable either side (although he is much better at LF i agree).

5613~~~
Let him go.... Let him go....

5614~~~
I don't know why, but this post greatly amused me (and not a bad idea, in fairness.)

5615~~~
Didn't see this posted. Granted it was his birthday, but hardly the brightest move following a loss to Sunderland: 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/memphis-depay-parties-in-rotterdam-hours-after-manchester-united-defeat-a6873306.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...-after-manchester-united-defeat-a6873306.html</a>

5616~~~
Is he supposed to sit at home and wallow over his shit form?

5617~~~
Goodness me, it was his birthday. He is allowed to have a life you know? It's not like he tweeted a picture of his RR 15 mins after the match. Which is more pathetic, the fact that newspapers have nothing to write about or that fans are enjoying click bait.

5618~~~
No, but celebrating in such a garish way after a huge loss isn't the brightest idea. Ask yourself this: could you imagine the likes of Keane, Scholes, Van Nistelrooy, or even Beckham doing that (particularly if they and their team were mired in a slump like this?) That level of professionalism is what we need at this club. 

I'm one of those who thinks Memphis needs another season before we can definitively rule him a bust, but my god, he doesn't half come across as a flash gimp.

5619~~~
Do you know what they were up to after matches? I think not.

5620~~~
If I was in the middle of an abysmal run of form and had just seen my team lose a match that may well seal the fate of the manager and the team's CL hopes, I'd probably opt for a low-key celebration with my girlfriend (but that's just me, I guess.)

5621~~~
No, hence the use of the word 'imagine.' However, I'd be willing to wager (were it possible to know for sure,) that it didn't involve gimpy birthday celebrations.

5622~~~
It doesn't give the best impression though does it? Makes it seem like he doesn't care.

5623~~~
To be honest, if I had as much money as he has I probably wouldn't give a feck what people thought of me.

Whether what he's doing looks good or not, there's nothing particularly wrong with it. Sitting at home is not going to make him a better footballer which is ultimately what we care about or want from him.

5624~~~
The audacity to have friends, I simply can't believe it.

5625~~~
It's only because of the presence of social media we are acting like this. You wouldn't have known if no one took pictures of it.

5626~~~
I don't particularly care what he does off the pitch that's up to him but don't act like these things don't matter. You have to be 100% committed to be one of the best players in the world and he's prancing about acting the part off the pitch whilst playing the part of a championship player when he laces his boots up. He wouldn't look out of place playing for Villa. Fair play to him he's earned a big contract and he is living his life but I don't see a lot of hope for him in being a United player unless his attitude changes.

5627~~~
Other than celebrate his birthday, what has he done to cause this outrage?

5628~~~
Living.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes he's having a shit season but it's ridiculous the amount of shit he's getting in his first year.</span>

5629~~~
As a more dramatized example - If my kid is hurt because a policeman didn't do their job correctly, id be livid If i then heard that guy was out partying the day after and living his life.

Football isnt as serious as the example above, but it is....for some.

5630~~~
There's no outrage. I do find it a bit odd to see someone with the attitude of Ronaldo when Lingard is keeping him on the bench however. I don't think there's anything wrong with celebrating his birthday but the more I see of him the more I question his mentality and if he will make it here. He looks a bit too comfortable.

5631~~~
Yeah, whenever he comes on the pitch I dont see the "Im going to prove my worth today" look. I just see a guy who seems content with the 5 minutes or so he is getting. 

For all the talking he does, great players are not getting benched at his age. He is not 18/19 he is 22 now. If he was as fierce a competitor as he makes himself out to be, he would be livid at the fact that Martial is shining so much more than him, playing in his preferred position.

5632~~~
Why does he has a huge image of Michael Jackson's face on the back of his jacket?

5633~~~
In a more realistic example, if an employee for a business you have shares in filed some paper work incorrectly and you spotted him out celebrating his birthday on the weekend, would you berate him for it?

5634~~~
They are human beings too you know. They can celebrate their birhday.

5635~~~
Social media are the worst invention ever.

5636~~~
"Professionalism", it's non-sense. If he was celebrating the night before a game, I could understand people being pissed off but other than that this has no impact on how he'll perform going forward.

5637~~~
How dare he drive an expensive car, go shopping for groceries, wear clothes of poor taste and have a life outside of football duties.

<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

5638~~~
I'll repeat: he comes off as a gimp. I won't care about it if/when he does the business on the pitch.

5639~~~
I was excited when we signed him but the more he has played the more I'm not fussed any more and that picture of him wearing a grill or whatever its called didn't do him any favours either. Its like you get everything that comes with a world class star apart from the world class part. Still I hope he gets more playing time because he can be a exciting player to watch.

5640~~~
Bit harsh to be having a pop over him going out for his birthday. And I say that as his biggest critic. 

Anyways, Robbo, Keane, Sharpie, Bruce, McGrath, Whiteside lived for their nights out <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5641~~~
so he comes across as a gimp because he celebrates his birthday. boo fecking hoo.

there are loads of things to criticize memphis for but celebrating on his birthday isn't one of them, regardless of whether he lost or not in a previous match.

5642~~~
Agree with that.

That fecking awful pink jacket is a sackable offence though surely?

5643~~~
Well said. Being a complete footballing fraud on the pitch has very little to do with anything off it. Ronaldo did rather well for us in spite of his poolside orgies, did he.

5644~~~
He has massive potential, the kind of player we should be signing, but he needs to be handled correctly and quickly to make it here.

5645~~~
Weird to criticise a player over something like these. From what I have read so far, he is the type to always strive to improve his game, evident in last season's performance after the world cup. He changed his attitude as well for both off and on the pitch. 

This season, it doesn't quite work well for him (yet, I hope) but we haven't heard anything that resembles bad attitude from him, off pitch wise. Yes, I know his performance doesn't quite match up to par yet, and lacking the discipline to work defensively but he is getting there. 

I just find it weird people find time to criticise him over such petty matters, whereas player like Mane who is lauded here, supposedly already letting his current team and previous team by missing/late to team meetings/trainings, which should be the bigger thing to concern over, attitude-wise.

5646~~~
Are you people for real? Of course a player is entitled to a birthday bash.

But let's not act like Fergie wouldn't be on the verge of murdering him for pulling a stunt like that, a couple of hours after a result like last saturday. And let's definitely not pretend like that would be harsh or unfair to Memphis, and we really should just leave him alone and let him live.

It's not the first time either, this whole season there has been a pattern of silly and stupid behaviour, with literally feck all in performances to compensate. He's struggling with the fame, and he's struggling with the high demands of English top football on top of that. I really feel for him, because it's been a huge step for him and I can imagine how difficult and confusing it can be at such a young age. It's also not his fault that we have been so incredibly shite.

But he really needs to get his ass out of his head and get his shit together, pronto.

5647~~~
I don't get when people get annoyed with a footballer when they aren't in the best form or the team lost.

"How dare they go out for drinks! United lost on the weekend!"

Wtf is he supposed to do? sit in his house all week in the dark and talk to no one?

They still go to training every day, you can't just control people seeing people in their lives because United lost a match.

5648~~~
I dont think anyone would begrudge him celebrating his birthday. But there is really no need to flaunt on social media, especially on the back of a such a humbling defeat for the team.

Even Cristiano got slaughtered for his lavish celebrations on the same date Real lost 4-0 to Atletico.

Its not a matter of whether its right or wrong , but its about the PR image it portrays. Coupled with his aweful on-field perfomances, it doesnt create the best image for Memphis. His management team should be smart enough to know that. That's just how the life of a celebrity works.

5649~~~
People are so small time and petty. I guess you lot mourn for three weeks after a bad day at work? 

He lost a game of football, not his grandmother. Perspective ffs, perspective. It is not the end of the world.

Besides, the loss was hardly his fault. He didn't start the game and was OK when he came on.

5650~~~
Big moment for Memphis. With Rooney out until the end of March, he will compete with Adnan for an extended run in the team.

5651~~~
Big opportunity for him to grab a place in the team with Rooney injured.

5652~~~
Huge opportunity to lead the line.

5653~~~
Lead the line? I suppose the only thing he is interested in is scoring so it might just work.

5654~~~
Keep Martial on the left and play Memphis upfront. Let's see what he's made of

5655~~~
Wouldn't mind seeing Memphis as our 9 like we seen at Watford. There's pace there to use and we don't have to worry about his tracking back so much.

5656~~~
I'd rather see him on the left. He's not going to be a CF in the long term, while Martial is.

Might as well give him some confidence and a run in his best position so that he goes into next season with the best possible chance of making an impact. Our season is a write-off anyway, the development of the youngsters is the only reason to be interested in watching right now.

5657~~~
Nobody is saying it is. He's just a gimp, is all. Let's hope he turns it on in Rooney's absence.

5658~~~
I'd rather not see him at all.

Will Keane to start please.

5659~~~
I concur. Memphis had so many chances already and didn't use them. It's time for someone else to get a chance to show what he can do.

5660~~~
If he can't start games when Rooney is injured and with one of the thinnest attacks in years, we should just cut our losses.

5661~~~
even though lvg has lasted as long as he has, there's still a hope he'll be gone in summer. nearly every player has been shit under him, so i'd be willing to give depay another shot next year.

5662~~~
Hes started 12 games...

5663~~~
Couldn't care less about what he drives or who he screws (beyond the usual jealousy) but he is terrible at football.

I voiced concerns when we were linked about him having no ability to run with the ball. In that sense, he doesn't seem an actual winger. My summary is not good enough personally, and I'm not of the view that a player needs to be here for years before they can be judged. I'd sell him in the summer if we could.

5664~~~
Looks much faster recent weeks, seems to have adjusted to his weight gain a bit. Hope it will reap its fruits (?).

5665~~~
Memphis is quite Welbeckian in his ability to get into great positions and then let it peter out to the extent that it seems like it was never a chance in the first place.

5666~~~
Welbeck was a far better player mind you.

5667~~~
He's so selfish. He never gives the ball to anyone making a run he just selfishly tries to use the opportunity himself and does nothing with it. Really irritates me

5668~~~
Even when he scores he manages to look like a fecking pillock doing it.

5669~~~
Er, I was hacked, guv...

5670~~~
What did he do just now? Or when Lingard almost went 1 vs 1, or when he tries to pull back for Martial in the first 5 min but it got blocked?

5671~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5672~~~
Even looked shit scoring his goal.. it's been said many times, he's not United level.

5673~~~
The attitude towards him from some people on here is pathetic. I swear they <i>want</i> him to fail.

5674~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5675~~~
I don't know Memphis Depay, I've never met him or had any contact with him, but I.. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

5676~~~
Can't understand if those people call themselves "supporters", literally wanting your own players to fail and be agenda-driven towards them. Completely baffled. If you think he's shit, thats more than fair enough, but downplaying every good thing he does as well is something else.

5677~~~
I know it's mad. He's shown many times what he can do, I wouldn't write him off yet.

5678~~~
He actually did really well for the goal - had lost his footing before the cross but still put it in. If Hernandez does that, people laud him.

5679~~~
He's been complete wank aside from the tap in. With a bit of luck someone will pay us 10m for him in the summer

5680~~~
Look at the reaction Carrick got for gifting them a goal and compare that to Depay failing to take his man on, ridiculously Depay gets more slack! In fact, 5 minutes after the goal and MC thread still hasn't been bumped.

5681~~~

5682~~~
I couldn't understand why you'd tag me after laughing at his fk. He was the best FK taker last year in Europe, wasn't he?

Credit where it's due, got a goal.

5683~~~
Every one of our attacks from open play have involved Depay, there's a reason why he finds himself in good positions.

5684~~~
Complete wank? So beside his goal every other thing he did was just bad right?

5685~~~
Cheeky Mexican scamp he is, look at him falling over his own feet, bless.

5686~~~
It's like he's so conditioned to cocking up he's finally cocked up cocking up and scored from it.

5687~~~
Not only is that bollocks, but that was never a bloody tap in.

5688~~~
Yes. He's shite.

And we're playing who haven't played in a couple of months and who conceded 12 goals in the group stages. He's found his level.

5689~~~
He is completely brainless. Some rank amateur stuff out there tonight. Despite his goal he has been awful. Carrick has money in the bank from years of service for Manchester United. Although him and Herrera has been diabolical between them.

5690~~~
Im really confused, it looks like Akash is always watching a different match as I am. I'm not implying Memphis has been brilliant or even good, but he's got involved in some dangerous plays, good hold up, decent free kick, good cross after, but also few poor dribble and passes. But that's seems to be "complete wank".

5691~~~
Im not talking about that, has he been completely wank this first half?

5692~~~
I'd like to watch the match you are. He's been shite. He's got a stat to pad out people's arguments for how undoubtedly talented he is though.

5693~~~
Except he hasnt, he's beaten his man what 5 times? Held the ball up well, tracked back, won headers he had no right to win, put Lingard away with a lovely control and volley pass,  he's also messed up 2 passes and failed to take his man on but that's all that's been focused on.

5694~~~
The free kick was the definition of stupid. What are the chances of beating the keeper from there? Just because it went on target doesn't mean it is good. Mata should be swinging in a cross from there.

5695~~~
Memphis actually made a great run on that same play and should have been played through.

5696~~~
he's been pretty bad. he got a goal, but there's very little to show from that half. to be fair to him, there aren't a lot of players that covered themselves in glory in the first half.

5697~~~
Do you think there might be a reason for that?

5698~~~
Better today but still pretty shit.

5699~~~
Well, compared to some of his team mates (Herrera, Carrick and Mata) he's looked positive world class which doesn't say much because they've all been unbelievably shite. Depay has also been absolutely awful though. Doesn't look as bad as he sually does but that's to be expected given he's playing a team that's actually worse than Brugge

5700~~~
He is pretty shit

5701~~~
Not everything is coming off for him and clearly he is lacking confidence but I don't mind that as he remains a threat.

5702~~~
Looks like he's found his level.

5703~~~
Attack the post, not the poster. Attack the post, not the poster. Attack the post, not the poster. 

There are some idiots in this thread. 

Memphis has made some good runs, played in people, put in a great cross and scored a goal. 

What other attacker has done as much as him this half? All well and good saying it's Midgetland, but none of other players are doing much. 

Cut him some slack you vultures.

5704~~~
People have already made their mind up. His always involved when we're creating. That passenger on the right flank should be criticized if you want to, but he is creating and looking good.

5705~~~
Wonder what the level of our other attacker is tonight, considering he's doing more than them.

5706~~~
According to Whoscored he has 3 successful dribbles but has been dispossessed 5 times. 1 stupid freekick, one pass out of play when he passed to Herrera's dummy run?! He ignored Martial on a simple one two that would have put him in and dallied on a cross because he was looking at the ball, he ended up hitting it straight at the defender. He has 0 tackles and 0 interceptions.

5707~~~
his manner on the pitch is like he holds all the records in world of football and is the best player on the planet yet he did feck all so far and is playing on a very low level.....he should put his head down and work his ass off on the pitch and people(well, some) would be more forgivable about poor performances.

5708~~~
Yea, because he dresses a bit 'out there' and drives nice cars internet muppets have decided he's an arrogant prick.

5709~~~
If we played that game every week it wouldn't be Depay coming out on top.

5710~~~
And what made him absolutely awful? Did he do more terrible things or good things or? It seems like you just slag everything and everyone off, Herrera's shit, Memphis' shit, Schneiderlin a whole new level of shit, Carrick shit, Rooney shit, everything shit. Anyway I'm not implying that Memphis has been brilliant or good today, but I can say that he's had poor moments, touches, passes as well as good touches, hold up, challenges, passing the rb, and ofcourse bagging a goal. Just cant see how that translates into "completely wank, absolutely awful".

5711~~~
He's so bereft of ideas when he has the ball, it's pathetic. He's talented or so am told, and maybe he truly is, but I'm yet to see a hint of that talent.

5712~~~
I can guarantee for example that he's won the ball back so that's bullshit.

5713~~~
He desperately needs the summer break and pre-season because right now he's barely looking like a footballer and I know he's capable of way more than he's showing.

He seems to struggle at the very basic elements of the game so him trying the elaborate stuff looks embarrassing at times. It also doesn't help that he's extremely leggy for a wide player.

5714~~~
Memphis has been our best player by a distance in that half, you lot are fecking crazy. Made your mind up on the kid and won't change it for anything. The rest have been shite so I'm not saying he's been amazing, but he's gotten past his man consistently, worked hard, had a few dangerous moments, scored a goal... Nobody else for United has done anything remotely useful so it's completely mad that he's getting slack again

5715~~~
No. Personally it's because he has been pretty shit so doesn't have the history of being a good player for our club that Hernandez had and he's a lazy bastard. You can pretend it's because of his clothes if you want and it's nothing to do with how he performs but I think you'd be wrong.

5716~~~
You're psychic? That's amazing dude. You should use your powers for worthwhile deeds.

5717~~~
Except for Lingard who got the assist and created another chance.

Don't include me in that. I couldn't care less what he does off the pitch.

5718~~~
Correct. They're all fecking shite except Martial and De Gea. However, some of them have shown to good enough at least unlike Memphis who's not United standard by any metric. Not even the current United team.

5719~~~
Great run and he wasn't offside. 

He's a real forward, he moves like a forward not a winger. Makes those types of Run.

5720~~~
Think he was fairly decent first half.  He took the goal well considering he was off balance and falling.

Think a lot of the criticism is a tad harsh.  He's a young lad and sometimes he does frustrate... but he makes things happen more than anyone else in our team besides Martial.

5721~~~
Not that it holds any value for you but he's scored them previously (not for us obviously) so obviously he'll still try them. It got us a corner eventually right (?) so no where as near as a big deal as you make of it. Ofcourse a normal cross is the normal better option, but how much threat that does give in our team.

5722~~~
Good.

5723~~~
He scored and did a pretty neat turn in their box.

Other than that he has been wank as usual.

As I write this I have just seen Martial take on two players and set up a chance that should have been a goal. He is younger and 10 times the player Memphis is.

5724~~~
And if Memphis had done the same he'd have been slated for not shooting.

5725~~~
Memphis would have give it away before he got in the shooting position.

5726~~~
Seriously, the amount of hate people give him on here is disgusting. As bad or worse then what Fellaini got/gets. And he hasn't had anywhere close to as much time to prove himself and is just a young player (who has shown plenty of promise in the past). Best player on the pitch for us and he's getting criticized more then any other United player for what exactly? Because he took a shot from a free kick that required a save? Better then hitting the wall or going out for a goal kick like the vast majority of freekicks we take from other players.

5727~~~
No. How many weeks this season could we have played that game with Depay as winner? As it goes he's still behind Martial tonight.

5728~~~
He just did the same and had his good work ruined by Herrera. Look at everyone rushing to mention it.

5729~~~
Brilliant cross but still wank.

5730~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5731~~~
Great cross, Mata should hit the target.

5732~~~
Ignore another great cross lads.

5733~~~
Oh look, created an excellent chance there. Bet people like <a class="username" data-user="91612, @Classical Mechanic" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/91612/">@Classical Mechanic</a> missed that though

5734~~~
Wank cross, should have bounced it off Mata's head and in without Juan having to move.

5735~~~
He breaths, is wank.

5736~~~
You mean like that?

5737~~~
Just ignore that though.

5738~~~
So Martials been better tonight yeah? 

Okay pal.

5739~~~
Yes. Enjoy the rest of the game.

5740~~~
Don't tell me what to do.

5741~~~
I did miss it actually. The commentator said it was behind Mata <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>. That was crap though, overplaying.

5742~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5743~~~
I'm also disappointed that he didn't save Sisto's shot, too wank for words.

5744~~~
Ok pal.

5745~~~
He's been our best player.

5746~~~
Also his fault Herrera missed that shot.

5747~~~
This thread has been entertaining tonight.

5748~~~
More so than the actual game.

5749~~~
Absolutely awful today.

5750~~~
If I wanted my own comeback I'd have asked your mum.

Edit: I apologise. I'm not even mad. Shouldn't bring your mum into this.

5751~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5752~~~
Nah it was a sweet cross. In his defense he has got a nice right foot.

My problem with him is he gives the ball away so much. We will see a glimpse of something good out of him but 9 time out of 10 he is getting tackled or doing a shite pass.

5753~~~
Why did he let Love get that yellow? Disgraceful.

5754~~~
He is inconsistent but for players of his style, they need games and trust. The only time Nani ever looked like fulfilling his potential here was when he was trusted with that RW position. 

Depay isn't getting either of those and it's hindering him. But to get those minutes he needs to realise he needs to, at an absolute minimum, work hard and he doesn't always do that.

5755~~~
Great save from Memphis tbf.

5756~~~
Was a bad pass, hope we sell him for 5m.

5757~~~
Its probably a confidence thing as well. He got the goal and he is having a good second half to be fair.

Hes doing it because I have been slating him. Bastard.

5758~~~
I can't be the only that thinks he's done pretty well tonight? Should have set up at least one goal (good heading Mata), scored, could have been through if not for a terrible offside call.

5759~~~
Had a good second half

5760~~~
Probably been the best player on the pitch.

Not saying much though.

5761~~~
No theres plenty of us who do its just drowned out by the ridiculous hatred.

5762~~~
Bloody Memphis !

5763~~~
Memphis losing us the game, the useless fecker. Give him away in the summer.

5764~~~
Back to the u18's!

5765~~~
A turd in a field of steaming turds. Enjoy your moral victory you sad sad men.

5766~~~
That has to go down as an 8/10 performance if he is still averaging 5.5 <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

5767~~~
Average rating is low for most players. Even Martial is 6.6

5768~~~
Ah, the people who aren't rushing to their computers to shit on him and criticize every sub-optimal choice he makes in a game where he's the best player for us are the sad ones. Feck me.

5769~~~
I wonder if he even knows what his username means.

5770~~~
Well I came up with it? 

I am only trolling anyway. It was bad of me to do so. If you think this player should be starting for this club then I am in serious disagreement with you, however. To be fair it was a 7/10 performance from him, which was better than 10 of our other players.

5771~~~
He looks clumsy and basic a lot of the time but he did get a goal tonight which might boost his confidence a bit.

5772~~~
Obviously it's distracted from a well known topic/group/study/cant think of the right English word in physics but anyway.

I dont think he should be starting for this ub, we should normally have a world class olayer there and he isnt. When I look at the current United, he shouldnt be starting too, he's been really poor generally. But it just baffles me how some try to downplay every single thing he does, he has been decent today, nothing too good, nothing too bad, got us a goal and was our biggest threat. To want him sold, him to do bad, to abuse him as a Man United fan just baffles me (not directly pointing at you). Give him some time, I think he's shown at times that he does have quality and ability and isnt the worst player to ever play for United (as some have said). But he does lack the consistency, final ball and is very frustrating with losing the ball in unneccassary positions. It just seems too hard for people on here to give a fair observation on him.

5773~~~
Kieran Richardson > Memphis.

In fairness, he had a decent second half.

5774~~~
When he was walking at Utd
He was walking ten feet off the ball
Walking in midfield
But do I really feel his highlight reel

5775~~~
It is just a play on words. Classical mechanics is classical mechanics, a mechanic fixes cars. Newton is a bit of a hero, if I have any. 

I am too hard on Depay. He has a goal in him for sure but to me he is little more than a luxury player because he is so one dimensional and has so many flaws. He just isn't good enough to be carried IMO. To think Di Maria couldn't get in our team because of his wastefulness. Depay is a vastly inferior version of Di Maria on the left to me. I don't see that much upside with him either. Not enough pace, not enough strength, not enough skill, too lazy and he is weak in the tackle.

Young and Valencia are comfortably better than him. OK Depay edges them in end product attacking wise but both Val and Young can defend a bit and look after the ball.

5776~~~
As I mentioned in the match thread:

He doesn't get enough support from his fullback. Even the best wingers need space created by outside or inside runs but there is good reason he doesn't get this support - he doesn't support his fullback when play switches and we have to defend.

Nor is he good enough to warrant tactically catering for this laziness like Nani or Ronaldo were. 


It's in his best interests to work harder at getting back and defending because then the fullback will be allowed to support him.

5777~~~
Dont agree at all with not enough speed and especially strenght, he did look slow in the beginning of the season but did you watch him today? He does have speed and his strenght make him quite comfortable up front because he can hold up defendees quite easily. He might be skillful but his ball control and dribbling is substandard. He's not really a winger but a wide forward. Valencia wouldnt do a better job attackingly imo, Young would. But he's one dimensional as well. And btw he's just turned 22, to have flaws in your game isnt surreal. It will be a problem if we all see that he isnt working on them while they're holding him back.

Furthermore put things into perspective a bit, he's at a new club, in a new league which is much tougher, faster and different to what he's used to, he's at a club where the system isnt working, even the so called top class players look absolutely woeful here, shot on confidence and he's in an entire new role. Im not trying to make excuses for him because some of his performances have been inexcuseable, but I dont see the need to rush a judgement on him, nor downplay everything he does.

5778~~~
I will be very surprised if he makes it here. Performing for PSV and against Club Brugge/Midgetland (don't even think he was that good today, average while others were shit) doesn't mean much when he is atrocious in the league. His dribbling ability is surprisingly very poor for a wide player and I think it's his laziness which is why a lot of fans have no problem with being blunt when he is poor. I don't think he's displayed anything to make me think he's going to develop into a good player for us instead of being another one to add to the list of average players who looked good in the dutch league.

5779~~~
He doesn't look strong or fast in the Premier League. He looked really good against Brugge and quite good against this Danish team. In the big league he looks poor. It is about levels. Young can defend quite well IMO. I think he is a better modern full back than Darmian.

5780~~~
Amount of his apologists popping up after today sums up how fecking awful we've become <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5781~~~
No better than Ryan Babel thus far. And that's pretty shit.

5782~~~
Looked good today I thought.

5783~~~
People were mostly reacting to the fact that people came in here to have a go at him for insignificant shit while the rest of the team were busy having a shocker. He was getting more shit than the players who were giving away goals and playing like amateurs, but yeah, the people criticizing that behavior are the laughable ones.

5784~~~
Well he does, it's not his physical flaws imo in the PL, more that his handling and technique isnt to the right standard. He played vs Yedlin in the weekend and wasnt much slower if any, and he is one of the fastest players in the world. He's played up front a few times and could battle properly with the CB's, hold up play, even won some headers (remember it very well from the Bournemouth game where he scored, he was up front then). But in the PL, his decision making, slowness in thought, bad passing, bad dribbling, poor defending cost him time and time again. Even though I thought he was one of the better attackers in the 2nd half too vs Sunderland, nothing too great but was better than the others.

5785~~~
Where did you see them I wonder?

5786~~~
Wasn't great tonight, but he tried to force the issue, which was nice to see. He actually tried to take on his man tonight, and was far less predictable. Mixed up his game well. With Rooney out, I guess we'll see more of him down the left. Needs to build from this performance.

5787~~~
Match thread and this thread.

The trend is still the same for him - decent performances against crap sides in Europe, absolutely abysmal in PL. And today his goal masked quite many flaws that many are pointing out, I still can't get my head around people who praise him beating their fullbacks when every time bar 1-2 when he's done that his crosses were either blocked or shite. One exception being the Mata failed header.

Even the shit like 'yo, he looks like he lost muscles and runs faster, actually tracks back', we've been here before, he really doesn't.

5788~~~
Imo Memphis is a very good footballer with the potential to be one of the worlds best. He is playing in a team with confidence rock bottom and zero swagger. He needs to be in a positive environment. I have said this ever since he has been in not the best form. 
It's clear to see he has the tools to be such a good footballer.

5789~~~
There's a player in Memphis, the talent is obvious. It'll all click one day.

5790~~~
Fecking hell! So calling someone out for coming in here to have a go at him when he's actually having a decent game is being an apologist? I think you need to look up the definition of that word, because it doesn't mean what you seem to think it means.

5791~~~
Yes yes, thank you for that patronising shit, highly appreciated, on my way to check it up.

5792~~~
Does a good thing, but then spoils it by doing something shite about 2 seconds later. Rinses his man with a turn or a trick, then blasts it against himself for a goal kick, or gets tackled when he had all the time in the world to play the ball.

I still want to see what a manager with more fluid tactics and an ability to form relationships and motivate his players can do with him. He seems an emotional lad who dwells on everything. Ronaldo was similar. He was managed perfectly by Fergie. I'm not saying Memphis is or will be anywhere near as good, but he needs to be managed by someone with a bit more softness than Louis van Robot.

I guess that makes me a Memphis Apologist too. Forgive me for not wanting to draw a line under a talented young player after only 5 months of mostly off the bench cameos in games where the whole team is playing shit and he is seemingly expected to save us single handed.

5793~~~
Nobody is saying that he played great or something, he was decent. The hatred he got from some was unwarranted and those poster were called out for that. That was it. Furthermore, he wasnt abysnal vs Sunderland as well, not good either but he seems to be improving a bit and credits where its due. Why do you feel the urge to just slag your own players off I wonder genuinely.

5794~~~
You're in no position to call people out for being patronizing.

5795~~~
Technically I think the kid has now scored more goals for us than Ashley Young has scored in the last 4 seasons. How's that for statistics?


We are proper fecked.

5796~~~
But the 'you can obviously see the talent in him' shit comes back which is laughable, I still can't see it unless the new standards of 'where you can see talent' are against types of Brugge and Midjtylland, thus my comment about how the mighty have fallen. 

Abysmal, shite, very bad, make your call really. 

As for why I feel the 'urge to slag my own players', see, I really don't. You won't find me talking shit in other players' thread most of the time, not my thing, even today I've given him credit where it's due for his goal but this guy is bringing all the shit on himself <b>due to</b> his absolutely awful attitude on the pitch which is the most repeated reason by the most who give him shit and by some for his cringeworthy off-pitch behaviour, about which I couldn't care less. 

Most players even when they are playing subpar bust their gut out, he doesn't, 90% of the matches he didn't. If he wants the respect from the fans he has to earn it, he's taking stuff for granted. He's already made it, which will probably be his downfall.

5797~~~
If he is going to play it shouldn't be on the left for the time being. Stick him upfront, he has the movement for it and won't necessarily have to beat a man. Martial was poor tonight and is the only player we have who works on the left, why f*ck that up just because Rooney is injured.

Decent game tonight but he still struggles with many of the key challenges that playing on the left presents.

5798~~~
If you dont see it, you dont. I cant open your eyes or change your view or anything. What annoys me is "fans" wanting their own players to fail just so they can say I told you so. After every bad pass repeat how shit a player is, and close their eyes for the good thing they do. I find it embarassing. I wont disagree with you that Memphis has been poor, that's the obvious. But I wont right him off as well, and I think this attitude thing that keeps getting referred to is a bit overplayed now. I've seen him doing plenty of defensive work lately, or is he supposed to track back everytime the opponent have the ball?

5799~~~
That would essentially mean that I want my team to lose so you're barking up the wrong tree again.

I'd say that actually tracking back when he's lost the ball would be a good start. He hasn't done that against Chelsea which resulted in goal, there was a situation which was mentioned here and in the Rooney thread against Blunderland when he's lost the ball and it was Rooney who was still ahead of him that actually chased the guy back while Depay was still jogging back. His fecking awful laziness on the pitch really is, sadly, not overplayed. Which I'm sure will be taken into account once, hopefully, Jose arrives.

5800~~~
Will be better when Shaw returns and LVG leaves. I truly believe that.

But if not, will be sold. I dont think LVG has done him any favours at all.

5801~~~
I thought he was alright tonight but yeah Ryan Babel is a pretty good shout to be fair.

5802~~~
I'm willing to give him a pass this season.

Young foreign player in his first season in PL playing in a rubbish team with confused identity... It's not his fault.

Can only hope he flourishes with a fresh start next season

5803~~~
Just glad he scored tbh, don't give a shit how. Just hope he'll kick on.

5804~~~
I don't see any outstanding talent, I don't see enough speed either. He can be neat & tidy, I even see the occasional good idea but just how bad is the Dutch League?

5805~~~
Not that bad, but defenders tend to be inexperienced, and judged on a lot of other stuff than basic defending. The main difference for an attacking player is that he only has to beat one man once, and then has time to look and pick out a pass. In the PL and Europe a player has to think quick and act quick after that too, otherwise has to beat the same defender again, or the next man. Depay still has trouble adjusting to that pace and rythm. Besides that he's not even close to his 2014-2015 form.

5806~~~
Spot on, the only fullback to support him was Shaw as he ate up ground that easily he could cover for Memphis lack of work and still offer an outlet in attack. Our other options don't risk it, perfect example last night was Blind hardly bothering to overlap like he did when paired with Young on the left.

5807~~~
Like he did after his goal against Watford?

5808~~~
Been saying this for ages...Memphis reminds me of a less mobile, less skilled Kieran Richardson.

5809~~~
He was probably our best attacking player last night, but that isn't saying much. I think he should stay in the team for now though.

5810~~~
Dont know, but I do know that their champions are better than we are.

5811~~~
Spot on.

5812~~~
What a shot.

5813~~~
2 minutes later, a carbon copy.

5814~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5815~~~
Unlucky, great feet.

5816~~~
He'll score tonight.

Against the Shrews.

5817~~~
What happened to the poster who praised Memphis all summer?

5818~~~
<a class="username" data-user="94481, @NL Max" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94481/">@NL Max</a> dont know, and that free kick was going in, bummer.

5819~~~
Never trust a nationalist who writes long, meandering posts in praise of his countrymen. The history of the Caf has been littered with people like that.

5820~~~
Lovely little nutmeg to put Martial through, his end product can be all over the place but there's no denying hes been involved with most chances as of late.

5821~~~
I heard he was relegated to the U21s and hasn't featured a lot lately. Got a good opportunity tonight.

5822~~~
Poor start but he's growing into the game. Good stuff.

5823~~~
To be fair, he didnt spout pure nonsense or anything, it just didnt work out for Memphis this season and that's a shame, that's football at times. At PSV he did show that he was one of the biggest attacking talents, hence the concrete interest from other top clubs like Bayern, PSG, Liverpool.

5824~~~
Did well to let Mata take that free kick. Been involved in everything except our goals.

5825~~~
He clearly did. To him, LvG and Depay were world class in their fields.

5826~~~
Nothing great but just good to see that he looks like a footballer with a brain again, two poor long range shots, but created a good chance for himself with the left foot, created two good chances for Martial, got a free kick and took it well (unlucky that Martial got in the way), less losing the ball, more ball retention, tracks back more, positive signs. But the opposition is sh*te and he yet needs to perform against teams of higher levels, but hope he gains some confidence.

5827~~~
You're a terrible WUM.

5828~~~
baby hulk

5829~~~
Seems to revisionism to me, he acknowledged Memphis flaws and dont forgot that his observations were from Memphis' performances in the Eredivisie and Europe League, Dutch NT, nobody could predict that he'd become this bad this season.

5830~~~
Puttig him on ignore is one of the best decisions you can make.

5831~~~
One day he'll say something insightful and there will be no one around to notice.

5832~~~
He takes chances tbf, which not a lot of others in our team does. Id rather him trying (with the cut in and shooting) then the cowardly pass up the opportunity.

5833~~~
It's funny because the critics in here are the exact opposite. This entire thread is a clusterf*** if I've ever seen one.

5834~~~
It's just a parody of your posts mostly.

5835~~~
It's sweet for you to pay me so much attention.

5836~~~
Thank feck his pace has recovered.

5837~~~
I have you on ignore. I sometimes take you off for a laugh.

5838~~~
Makes sense sweetie.

5839~~~
Stop pulling each other's hair girls.

5840~~~
He looks faster, doesn't he? He's not a patch on a young Giggs, even a 35 year old Giggs would probably give him a real good run for his money, but improvement none the less.

5841~~~
He's having a good game but he's played well against dross before. Until he starts playing well against at least decent level opposition, I can't really say he's improving.

5842~~~
Good free kick. Make the keeper work.

5843~~~
Created two superb chances, place goes silent.

5844~~~
Ridiculous the shit he gets.

5845~~~
Aye, I've got no problem with him getting shit when he's been poor, just be prepared to praise him when he plays well. He's a United player yet so many here seem to actually want him to fail.

5846~~~
There will be plenty of praise for him when he can do it against some quality opposition. I doubt anyone actually wants him to fail. That would be stupid.

5847~~~
Yep its a conspiracy against Depay

5848~~~
Just give your own players credit where it's deserved, why are you a supporter if all you do is slagging everything and everyone off, it baffles me.

5849~~~
He's done really well tonight.

Against the Shrews.

5850~~~
I don't. I'll give an opinion on a player. Have you ever criticised a player? He's done some good things nights tonight and some fairly awful things. Against League One opposition. If he can do it at the level required then I'll be as pleased as anyone.

5851~~~
Good game.

5852~~~
I had to go back four days. Why can't you just support our players?

5853~~~
Should score that.

5854~~~
He has been poor for 95% of this season and I understand the negativity towards Memphis based on his performances. That said I feel that many posters on here want him to fail and will take great delight in the day when he leaves our club. 

I hope that he can put this season behind him and start afresh next season with a point to prove. He no doubt needs a further tweak in attitude but lets hope his failings this season will have brought him back down to earth a bit. It's understandable that his ego would have been boosted given how he performed at PSV last year and how he was thought of by their fans. He has shown brief glimpses that he will be a very good player and I hope he can prove to be one for us in the future. I hate the hate that is aimed at some players on here at times and the group mentality lynching against some players. 

Like I said, I can understand the frustration towards him for the most part but don't understand the 'I told you so' attitude and personal glee that some people take from predicting that he would fail. But some people seem to put their own predictions of failure ahead of wanting to see a player actually succeed for our team. He's become a player that has his back jumped on when he F's up but if he does something good no good words can be said.

5855~~~
I thought he did well tonight. Hopefully he can take some confidence from it and improve his performances against better teams. He's been largely shit for us, but there's a good player in there. Somewhere.

5856~~~
Not convinced

5857~~~
Did well tonight, hope he can take some confidence from it. He has been a bit selfish at times, trying to prove himself a bit too much maybe.

5858~~~
Thought he was really good tonight, There was a period after Keane went off that he played almost as a false 9, picking the ball up play making and roaming all over the pitch. 

His passing was crisp and accurate, I really do like him. Gutted he didn't score his goal at the end, should have lifted it.

I still have good faith in him, looked strong and quick again tonight too.

5859~~~
Probably should have had an assist or two. 

He's going to twat a hat trick past Michigan.

5860~~~
The more I watch him the more I think he's got more chance of making it here as a striker than wide man, his control when trying to run with the ball is very erratic and he lacks agility, but his power and willingness to take on a shot would serve the #9 role well.

5861~~~
He is improving, I hope he can gain confidence and form to help us in the league. With Memphis and Martial we have covered the left wing with talented players. I hope we can sign a good RW in the summer like Mahrez/Sane instead of Felipe Anderson/Mane.

5862~~~
He'll be a more productive Nani. A less spectacular Ronnie. Hopefully closer to the latter.

5863~~~
Looked good I thought. Again, I like him more through the middle.

5864~~~
Mixed bag for him tonight. Created 4 chances which was decent but Mata created 8 and Pereira 2 in 30 minutes which highlighted how poor the opposition was. 9 shots at goal with only 2 on target, neither of which seriously worked the keeper was criminal though. Ronaldo would get slated if he produced that against Barca let alone relegation fodder from League One

5865~~~
Then again C.Ronaldo is looked as one of the greatest players ever.

5866~~~
He tends to look good against weak opposition. Against better players he doesn't seem to be quite good enough.

5867~~~
I think crucially he created 2 1-on-1 chances, produced a chance for Keane who hit the post and would've been on the scoresheet but for Martials head. The quality of what he created was excellent, his own finishing was lacking though.

5868~~~
If anything I hope it boosts his form and confidence a little. Not much to be gained from such opposition besides that.

5869~~~
Was a lot better than Martial today..

5870~~~
Good to see him getting involved in a game, hopefully this full 90 minutes and an easy win gives him back some much-needed confidence. He's clearly shaken by recent performances, some of his shots today were so hurried and snatched that he was missing the target by miles. In fact, that was pretty much all the Shrewsbury fans had to cheer. I think he had something like 10 shots but only got one or two on target? Anyway, it's a start, here's hoping he continues to get stuck in.

5871~~~
I don't think you can give him points for hitting a free kick into his own decoy. He was playing against a third tier side. Granted it will good for his confidence but I would prefer to see Martial in his best position, maybe even put Depay through the centre.

5872~~~
He is so much better when he plays down the middle.

5873~~~
Better in the middle.

5874~~~
I still can't understand why he hasn't been played as the main striker more often, he is a good finisher, and when he plays on the left he is just too easy to read for the defenders as all he wants to do is cut in and shoot.

Martial on the left, Depay up front, Lingard on the right, and Mata in behind.

5875~~~
Was thinking the same. I remember him playing centrally earlier in the season, did it go really badly or something?

5876~~~
He just doesn't look like a winger really. A wide forward in a 4-3-3 maybe, coming off the left, but it's more his movement off the ball rather then running with it. Looks like a potentially excellent player when more central though. He has the frame for it, and knows how to open up space for a shot at goal and has very good movement (even if his shooting was way off). Definitely a good performance though, as was his last one. His pace has obviously come back as well, after he looked slow for a couple of months at the start for some reason. 

Obviously it was only against a shit team and it wasn't a great game or anything, but there's definitely a lot of potential in there.

5877~~~
Remember the wide spread praise and universal acclaim Van Gaal got when he tried out Depay in the middle? Yeah, me neither.

He really isn't. Missed some rank sitters this season.

5878~~~
Just like Nani, he is excellent when playing one touch football around the box. The flicks and layoffs were delightful. The constant long range punters were nauseous.

5879~~~
He's one of those players that seemingly has bags of potential but tends to get reckless with his execution. A rash player so to speak. It's the difference between being a Ronaldo or a Quaresma. I think he can have a huge future here but his mental strength needs serious work.

5880~~~
As a #10, a position he's never played before, yeah I didn't think he'd get any acclaim either. Would like to see him played as a striker. Martial hasn't been great upfront and should be put back on the wing where he's been playing excellent.

I do remember 2 games in which he did play in strike, on 1 occasion he was upfront with Martial in a 352 formation and both played very well together and the other time it was against Watford I believe where he scored.
#10 - No, #9 - Yes

5881~~~
He is improving game by game, still needs to add some variety to his game, too predictable with his cutting in all the time.

5882~~~
He isn't a number 9 by a long shot, he is just better there than out wide. He doesn't have the opportunity to indulge in his favourite pastime of cutting inside and shooting at every half chance he gets. He does link up round the box well with neat one touch passing in fairness. I am not a fan of him as a 9 long term but we don't have many options right now and we need Martial in his best position.

5883~~~
He's been doing well for a while now when he's come on, the Chelsea game set him back in supporters minds by 5/6 months but he's noticeably better and looks dangerous when he plays.

5884~~~
Didn't see the game but I agree completely. It makes sense why LVG originally wanted him to play #10. I think he would have done well (atleast better) from an attacking point of view if could also have provided work rate and physicality to win the midfield battle.

5885~~~
He's not a #9. Will never be one. There's a lot more to being a #9 than having good movement. Even against Watford he never played as an actual #9 and spent time loads of time dropping deeper.

Should never have played out wide in any case.

5886~~~
He worked really hard and wasn't being affected with poor shooting, kept on trying and IMO was one of our best players yesterday.

Still looks robbed of confidence which leads to some errors, but it's nothing that can't be improved with time (or dare I say different manager).

5887~~~
No way he'll be more productive than Nani.

5888~~~
He still seems lazy to me, if he checks back and lays it inside; he never burst forward. Just starts walking. Should really be able to put the burners on against a league 1 side. Also is it me, or does he look overweight?

5889~~~
He's a less productive, less skilled, less talented and less consistent version of Nani.

5890~~~
I don't really understand what do you expect? People to jump here and chip in with a comment such as 'finally found his level' so you can get annoyed?

I do agree with people saying that he looks best 'down the middle', preferably at #9 where he's absolved of any defensive duties and he can be lazy himself but as somebody has already pointed out being a #9 is much more than having good timing for you runs. Out of four our attackers yesterday both Lingard and Mata were better, Martial was probably the only guy that Memphis played better than.

5891~~~
Christ, it takes some doing to be less consistent that Nani. 
But I agree that he has managed it, he's played decent in about 3-4 games this season.

5892~~~
In actual fact, he's a less consistent version of Ashley Young. But mentioning Nani gives us all hope that we haven't wasted another 25m down the drain.

5893~~~
What do I expect? Perhaps that instead of incessantly attacking our player after any minute mistake to offer him a little support or praise when it's deserved. Do you not see the ridiculousness of this in a United forum? However poor I might find some of our players I want them all to do well. There are so many here that would actually prefer to say 'i told you so' than be proved wrong and the lad succeed.

5894~~~
Since when do we judge a player consistency on 6 months of football?

5895~~~
Standards keep changing here on the Caf, apparently players have reached their peak at 21 as well and there's no chance of improvinf.

5896~~~
Why do people keep bashing Nani all the time? Depay would do very, very well to contribute to our success as much as Nani did. Only remembering Nani's inconsistency is extremely unfair.

5897~~~
TBF hes been consistently shit!
Hope he comes good though, he certainly has talent

5898~~~
Only for players you like though. You have no problem calling Carrick a liability. The hypocrisy of some of you is ridiculous.

5899~~~
Yeah but is it really difficult to just say that he has been shit and stop there. I see this type of comments too often a lot of posters seem to think that 6 bad months are redhibitory, as if football players/managers weren't able to bounce back or improve. They follow the "test it 6 months and throw it away" philosophy.

5900~~~
And I'll also praise him when he does well, you seem incapable of understanding the difference. Still got me off pretend ignore I see?

5901~~~
He will be praised when he earns it. In much the same way people aren't frothing at Mata's better performance last week it's the same here. There's a clear hypocrisy in your position on how people should comment on Depay and how you do on players you don't rate. In the case of Carrick, one who's acheived much more than Depay.

5902~~~
You can say it all you like it doesn't make it true, be prepared to praise if you are so quick to criticise that's all. Aaaaannnddd Ignore!

5903~~~
Yes and no.

One thing about Nani was that he never gave up. It's why even on his bad days, you could count on him to create a couple of VERY good chances every single match. Whether it was a fantastic cross, a great through-ball, or something else, you always knew that he could (and would) create goal scoring opportunities.

5904~~~
Take your own advice if you want to get atop a high horse.

5905~~~
I really hope he has talent, but I fail to see what that talent is from the spell he has had at United. He isn't fast being a winger, nor is he a good finisher. His shots are all over the place and his dribbling is erratic at best. He is one dimensional and his passing is average. From what he has shown at United, I fail to see there is a big talent there. Normally, even when players play like crap, you would, during the course of a season, be able to spot where the true talent lies. I just don't see it. I think he may become a good player, but he doesn't have many stand out attributes that make him a great talent for me. Jordan Ibe looks a greater talent from what I have seen, and he doesn't look great.

5906~~~
This..

I'd take Nani over this kid any day of the week. Depay is clearly more obsessed with his image than his football career.

5907~~~
You're basing most of that watching him whilst off form, not the best to see someones talents, which he does have. Hopefully he can display it for us

5908~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pp4iSsL0YSw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Got to appreciate that a fan says "feck you" to him in his own advert.

In seriousness, he'll come good.

5909~~~
I hear you say it, but what are his talents? He has hardly shown anything but average.

5910~~~
I think it's clear he lost some intrinsic motivation and focus. Got his big money transfer to one of the largest clubs in the world and feels that he made it. It's not that much of a big deal but sooner or later he needs to get that hunger back.

5911~~~
Fantastic off the ball movement, great physical attributes, and very good creative passing vision. He has the "picture" you can see that, but for some reason his ball striking technique is letting him down in passing/shooting recently. 

He's obviously found England harder than he expected, but he is clearly very talented and I think this run of games will do him the world of good.

5912~~~
Probably because he played much better in the middle, LVG said he was better in the middle, and then played him wide again the next game. So the 'wide spread praise and universal acclaim' was lost amongst the failure to understand the feckwittery of playing a player in a position you've acknowledged doesn't work as well.

5913~~~
One hopes Memphis can adapt to a new position because Martial is better than him on the left, and it is Martial's best position so there is no reason to move him.

5914~~~
Well when it all comes together for him, he can be a good dribbler (has shown it a decent amount of times here, getting past players pretty easily. Some games though he can't get past a thing). He has good pace, though again, until recently, he has looked slow and heavy for whatever reason. At PSV he was an excellent finisher and has a good shot from range along with excellent set pieces, but all those things go to shit when you are low on confidence like he has been. He also has good off the ball movement to get into those chances. He's shown he is capable of playing some nice passes as well as having a very good cross on him, but our forward movement is awful under Van Gaal so it's not surprising that he's struggling like everyone else is from our attack. He'll never be a Hazard/Sanchez type player I think where he's a really tricky player, but he is capable of being a very effective wide forward IMO, making the runs in behind and getting plenty of goals. He has the physical attributes, it just all needs to come together for him and for him to get his confidence back. Just needs time.

5915~~~
He I'll probably be one of our better players next season. Football is like that.
I'm certain that being a United player has gone to his head this year. I reckon he'll be back next season, trimmer, faster and head screwed on right. If so, we'll have a cracking player on our hands.

5916~~~
That's too much commonsense, cafe won't take too kindly to it, its still bashing Memphis day. They'll come around someday.

5917~~~
He just lost confidence.

5918~~~
I can excuse a player for being inconsistent, mainly when he's this young. He can not be up to standards because of his age and a new league. He may be shot of confidence and not do anything spectacular, that's ok for me. But when I see these things, the least I expect is for that player to bust a gut and give 110%. Chase down lost causes, be first to the tackle, track back, hassle the opposition players and make life difficult for them. The things that show that the player still gives a shit an is giving 110% to every game. I don't see any of this from Depay.

5919~~~
This.

5920~~~
A poor player. Simple. We need to accept it and be prepared to take a hit on the stupid money. He will be average at BEST in the Premier, because  that's his potential.  Do you think Memphis Depay would improve any team in the Premiership?

I think they guy lives in his own world. Sad thing is, he represents where United are right now. Average at best, wasteful, and showing no clear direction in terms of how things are going to improve. Change is needed. All of these statements apply to Depay.

5921~~~
As others have said, he's looked good of late. Just needs to get his goal-scoring mojo back soon to really recover his confidence. When you've scored 30+ goals a season, a complete lack of goals, particularly in the league the following season, can drain you.

5922~~~
I understand but I disagree, if I was a coach, Memphis and Martial would be exempt of madmen tracking back, I would only give them the 6 seconds rule. As a manager I would like to preserve their energy and lucidity because these are the players that I want to see leading every attacks. And to be fair I hate our defensive system, our attackers have as much defensive work than our defensive players and we ask them to be decisive even deep in our territory.

5923~~~
To be fair even a young Ronaldo and Messi would do their fair share of tracking back. Martial does it too and doesn't seem too fussed by it.

It teaches them work ethic and forces them to earn the right to escape being burdened by defensive duties.

I don't think Depay has earned the right to be given total freedom to attack without any defensive responsibilities.. that said he has been that awful at tracking back, it is probably best to either stick him up front or give him licence to attack in the hope we can get some use out of him. It isn't ideal though usually to give youngsters complete attacking freedom as it can make them arrogant and disrupt the shape of the team off the ball.

5924~~~
You going to give up on a young player after a poor first season? I think you are very wrong with this.

5925~~~
No, I agree that some players should save their energy for attack (e.g. Ronaldo, Zlatan, Messi etc) but Depay hasn't done anything to warrant that. But that's also not the point I was making. Even if he is given the freedom to roam and things aren't working out, then there's other way to help the team, and that's by being a nuisance on the pitch against the opposition. Depay isn't doing anything on the pitch that is worthwhile in terms of attack or defence. He doesnt even look like he's trying and that's my issue with him.

5926~~~
It has nothing to do with freedom or earning it, I said that they would have to respect the 6s rule, which means that they will have to press like madmen for 6s during that time their defensive teammates will transition to a defensive organization.

5927~~~
<i>"I have really had to change my game because in the Eredivisie I could do what I wanted as I had time on the ball, I played on feelings. Here [Premier League] there is direct pressure so it's hard.

"This has affected my game a little bit - everyone can see I'm not scoring every game like I used to but I can feel it getting better and, as I get to know the league more, I feel better and my confidence is growing again."
</i>
He also said that he hasn't justified his fee. At least he knows how and why he is failing.

5928~~~
To make it perfectly clear, no individual can earn the right to be exempted of defensive duties, I just said that in my collective organization they wouldn't have to do a lot.

5929~~~
I'm with you on that

5930~~~
I still think Jose will sell him if he comes here.

Maybe not the first Summer, but eventually.

I think one of his biggest problems is being shoehorned into something he's not. A out and out winger that creates chances and can beat his man regularly. He struggles big time with that. I dont think moving him to CF works either as they are crucial qualities he doesnt have either, like good hold up play. I can see us players fitting those specific roles instead.

5931~~~
When posters and journalist were all assuming that we would sign him, I thought that it was BS, that people were saying that just because he is dutch.
And the reason for my skepticism was that he wasn't the type of player that we needed, he is a goalscorer and nothing else, he isn't bad at the rest but that's not his strong suit, when we signed him I assumed that we would change the system and adopt a front three with genuine attackers, I never assumed that he would be used as a winger.

5932~~~
Its made worse because the manager had used him before, and should have known this.

I dont think he's a terrible player or "another Eredivisie fraud" as one poster once put it, but I dont think he is what we needed. That will count against him imo. 

I also doubt whether the next manager would alter the system just for him.

5933~~~
Look, I think a lot of people will be surprised by Depay as he grows older and more mature. The kid is 22, younger than Will Keane and Jesse Lingard, and he's being written off despite being only one goal behind Juan Mata in our scoring charts. In a season where almost every one of our attacking players has been pretty awful, especially Mata and Rooney, Depay is being written off after six months. The people lauding Nani for his contribution to the team need to remember some of his early performances. Sure, Nani was pretty good in 2010/2011, but it took him what, 3 years to get to that point? I hope whomever the new manager is that he has faith in Depay, as I think he and Martial are two of United's future forward players.

5934~~~
I've been critical of him over the past few months, mainly because I was so excited and backed him to impress when he joined - but I guess I do forget that he's only 22. I'm guilty of that. 

Hopefully he sets the league a light next season - he has the attributes. Get his decision making in check, and we have ourselves a player. His crosses are always dangerous - it's just a shame that he dilly-dallies too long.

5935~~~
Can tell he's started well with this thread not being bumped.

5936~~~
Got us the 1-1, but wank.

5937~~~
Best player by a mile so far.

5938~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5939~~~
Credit to Deapy, he looks sharpe today. When asked what does Giggs do, Giggs at the moment seems to have reignite Depay form.

5940~~~
Best player so far. If only him and Lingard could be combined into one player.

5941~~~
Playing well for a change. Needs to keep this up if we're to have a chance. Good turn there again.

5942~~~
He's been superb.

5943~~~
Probably going to win us this game.

5944~~~
Where the feck has this Memphis been all season?

Oh no, he's just lost the ball. he's shit. SELL!

5945~~~
Wait for the '1 in 10 player', 'can only play against crap teams' etc.

5946~~~
Another superb cross.

5947~~~
He's the best attacker by a distance today

5948~~~
Is absolutely stepping up for us when we need him tonight.

5949~~~
What a little flick.

5950~~~
Our only quality player in offense it seems.

5951~~~
Another Cruyff turn netmeg to win that pen.

5952~~~
Good tonight.

5953~~~
That was class

5954~~~
Confidence player and hes confident right now. Stepping up.

5955~~~
Been keeping us alive in this competition.

5956~~~
Would be nice if this kind of showing could kickstart him off on a nice run.

5957~~~
Think it's because he's the main man tonight.

5958~~~
I missed the first twenty but he's played well so far. With no Martial we'll need him to keep going because Rashford seems to be playing more wide than anyone.

5959~~~
Hope Giggs continues to mentor him, his work rate and courage, tempo is much higher and better recently.

5960~~~
Need to see this against better competition. His best performances have been vs minnow teams.

5961~~~
Looked so good.

5962~~~
Get the ball to him as much as we can in the second half.

5963~~~
He is making a clown of their fullback.

5964~~~
Brilliant so far.

5965~~~
What did Giggs not help him before in the season? That would be strange

5966~~~
Think their RB is absolute gash but Memphis has been very good.

5967~~~
Best performance in months. Looks like our only real attacking outlet.

5968~~~
He'll get their RB sent off tonight.

5969~~~
Was expecting him to hide tonight, but he's done nothing of the sort. Totally grabbed the game by the neck and stepped up when we need a bit of inspiration. Confidence can do a lot for a player like him. More of this please.

5970~~~
Been getting progressively better and better over the last 3 games

5971~~~
There's a different in being "just" an assistant manager and really mentoring a player in a more personal relationship, Memphis gave an interview this week and mentioned the presence and help Giggs is offering him to get out of this bad patch.

5972~~~
He's found his level <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5973~~~
Ah I missed that one! Good call.

5974~~~
best player with Schneiderlin, his decision making is spot on tonight, hope he scores

5975~~~
Beena in a bit of form recently to be fair. 

That under 21 outing when he was given a chance to run riot against poor defenders was good for him.

5976~~~
Minnows that still need beating. Nobody else is stepping up to beat this team, and we still might not beat them.

5977~~~
'Ryan Giggs is a legend. He talks a lot with me,' Depay added at an event for Under Armour on Tuesday night.

'He gives me advice. 'He experienced everything already so he can help me with those kind of things. I don't want to go into details but he works a lot with me.

'Wayne Rooney gives me a lot of things to think about. They really inspire me because that's two legends that talk with you and give you advice.

Where did you get the idea of him really mentoring him and them having a more personal relationship instead of doing his normal job as a coach from those quotes? Sounds like bollocks

5978~~~
Wow Memphis.

5979~~~
He talks a lot with me, gives me advice, he works a lot with me. I dont think the assistant does that with all players, if he does he should get a pay rise.

5980~~~
Crushing it.

5981~~~
You do realise Giggs was a winger and would surely be expected to give advice to players in that position, would be odd for him not too

5982~~~
Been fantastic today.

5983~~~
imagine if that went in!!

5984~~~
Man of the match so far

5985~~~
Let's see him put in one of these performance against a decent side - Arsenal maybe!?

5986~~~
What a difference is him playing with confidence, brilliant tonight!

5987~~~
Who's this guy??????  Is this his debut??? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5988~~~
I'm hoping it will spur him on against Arsenal this weekend because without Martial we really will need the outlet Memphis can provide when playing like this.

5989~~~
He seems to have his best performance against crap team so far at United. Looking forward to his performance against Arsenal to examine whether he has found his form or nothing has changed.

5990~~~
Hope so!!

5991~~~
Who the hell is this fella in the no.7 shirt...

5992~~~
Looks fantastic right now!

5993~~~
nice tricks

5994~~~
Tell me he isn't a confidence player! Question his performances but those questioning his talent are ridiculous.

5995~~~
Taking the piss now<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Now if only he could do this against a half decent PL team.

5996~~~
Drink every time he nutmegs someone.

5997~~~
This is the player we need to see in the league, he has been excellent tonight.

5998~~~
I've criticised plenty but he has been a joy to watch tonight. Easily his best game. If confidence really was the issue then hopefully this will be the turning point for him.

5999~~~
Need a gif of that trick

6000~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/n4rr" width="560"></iframe>

6001~~~
That rabona nutmeg flick reeked of Giggs, remember him doing that in the early 90's

6002~~~
He's been good in most of the European games.

6003~~~
Nani the second. Tries too hard to impress when given a substitute appearance and plays bad as a result. Give him a few matches without the pressure of being dropped and he'll be less inclined to force the issue. We did the same with Di Maria.

6004~~~
I told you 5 weeks ago. He can be an amazing player for us. I hope he continues with this confidence.

6005~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6006~~~
He was given plenty of starts early on but didn't do anything. 

Hopefully turns it around now

6007~~~
He's always good against shite.

6008~~~
Knew I wasn't dreaming:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNQcLkNOpsQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
18seconds

6009~~~
Yup spot on. We need to encourage this type of player and not get on his back/drop him on days it doesn't go right

6010~~~
This is a contender for performance of the season from one of our players.

EDIT - Said this just before he scored, think it's fair to say it definitely is the best performance from a player of ours this season.

6011~~~
What a goal!

6012~~~
One of the most deserved goals.

6013~~~
And a goal to cap it off, sensational tonight. 

MOTM by a mile.

6014~~~
Deserved goal! Great stuff.

6015~~~
Best performance I'v seen from a utd player in a long time, maybe a couple of Martials performances might come close but can't think of much else.

6016~~~
Fecking outstanding.

6017~~~
It would be really good if we can sign a talented right winger like Mahrez.
Memphis - Martial - Mahrez

6018~~~
who is this guy ?

6019~~~
He's been brilliant tonight.

6020~~~
He's played like Super In Form Martial on steroids. Genuine world class potential, whether he realises it or not depends on himself, but he has the ability.

6021~~~
Well deserved!

6022~~~
Sensational tonight

6023~~~
Brilliant tonight

You can point to the opposition but that kind of performance was well overdue

6024~~~
He's clearly talented, and I think he feels a lot more confident in showing it right now against weaker teams where he's more likely to get time/freedom on the ball to show his stuff. Now, he just needs to start showing that against the big boys. Very promising performance tonight.

6025~~~
fancied it from the off tonight, let's hope this continues!

6026~~~
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

6027~~~
He's not shit then?

6028~~~
Up there with one of our best individual performances of any player this season.

Now to repeat against teams in the league. Please.

6029~~~
Very very promising performance, just needs to replicate that in the PL.

6030~~~
Best individual performance since 2010. Unbelievable. Somebody make a highlights reel quick

6031~~~
That's the player we thought we were buying!

6032~~~
Amazing tonight. Skills were a joy to watch.

6033~~~
Shocking what he can do when given a bit of freedom and some confidence aye?

6034~~~
Ok I'm going to go big here:

The best individual display of any United player this season.

A definite 10/10 from me

6035~~~
I really hope this was the turning point for him. He just couldn't go any lower than the performances he's displayed of lately. This is the kind of way we'd expect him to play. fecking dickhead.

6036~~~
Sensational performance. Best individual performance from a United player this season.

Hopefully he can build on this and replicate this in the Prem.

6037~~~
Be silenced, hating cnuts.

6038~~~
Looks world class against weaker opposition but I hope he can carry on this form against bigger and better teams. Fantastic tonight

6039~~~
Well on him, tortured them, teach the to take the mick

6040~~~
And some people tried telling me Memphis didn't have more potential than Lingard. He could become an absolute failure and he would still have more potential. Potential is potential.

6041~~~
Outstanding

6042~~~
What a performance. That was just phenomenal, never mind the weak opposition he just looked so hungry today. Hope to see more of that soon.

6043~~~
I haven't watched the match (last 20 of it) but commentators and people of Caf are very pleased with him so fair fecks to him.

6044~~~
Props to Rashford and Riley whose efforts allowed him to stay on the front foot throughout the game

6045~~~
Looked like Nani at his best tonight in every way. Here's hoping he can actually kick on now and do it regularly next season.

6046~~~
I've been one of his toughest critics but damn, that was a world class performance!

6047~~~
why? The level of opposition makes all the difference. What separates the good players from the average. You're talking about opposition from Denmark who haven't played in 2 months and had won 1 in 10 before beating us. We are talking about a side as bad as some of the dutch teams. Memphis today looked as though he was back in Holland where as he quoted "he can do what he wants" If Zaha or bolasie played against this level opposition it would be more embarrassing. Save it till the Arsenal match before hyping his talents. He played bloody well though so good on him. I just fear him getting put in the pocket of the pacey Bellarin and not being up to standard again

6048~~~
Someone pass him a mic so he can drop it.

Great game.

6049~~~
No talent in there eh?

6050~~~
Great performance, to be fair I have never seen him play this well, even in the Eredivisie. But it was against weak opposition, just hope he has a positive performance vs Arsenal.

6051~~~
Showed up to the venue and TURNED UP

6052~~~
He was sensational today, best performance I have seen from a United player this season.

6053~~~
Best individual performance by any United players in the last three seasons or so. Crap opposition etc etc but in the first 60 minutes, he was dragging the whole team with him. What a performance. Please carry this performance against Arsenal!

6054~~~
Incredible performance.

6055~~~
Brilliant game, today he showed why he was/is a highly rated youngster. Hope it gives him a big boost and he can step it up in the PL too.

6056~~~
Neymar-esque tonight. 
Might finally allow Martial to move inside.

6057~~~
Will the real Memphis please stand up?

6058~~~
Ridiculous performance

6059~~~
first time i've ever given an outfield player a 10!

6060~~~
Tuned in at the 55th minute but he had a great game from what I saw.

6061~~~
Or League 2 level opposition?

6062~~~
I have not seen a fullback get destroyed like that ever, like what Depay did to his man today. People were bashing him, but I seen in the start of the season, he can take out 3 players at once with skills, the talent is there, the best thing about him, is when the going gets tough he doesnt shy away, keep trying non stop to beat his man

6063~~~
A joy to watch, an absolute delight.

6064~~~
Sensational. Made Lingard's performance look even more woeful.

6065~~~
Phenomenal performance. Trickery, technique, pace, power, delivery and a goal. If he can adapt to the PL level quickly, we could have a cracking player. So far the step up has been a culture shock for him. But tonight was evidence of his natural ability. That was as enjoyable a performance by a united player as a I can remember for a long long time.

6066~~~
It reminded me his game against Spain.

Edit: And he has no attitude problems.

6067~~~

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/fl38" width="560"></iframe>

6068~~~
The amount of girth he gave to their right back is unreal.

6069~~~
He was doing things on the pitch that most players can't. Not just with the insane skill he was pulling off to go past players but his passing, crossing, touch and finishing was on another level. If it's so easy to look THAT good why didn't we see any other United player do it? Why didn't Martial do it last week?

6070~~~
Actually quite shocking to see him play quite as good as he just did, when you consider what he's been like for a lot of the season. Just sensational today.

And yeah, they're a shit team - doesn't really matter though. His pace, his close control, his vision, skill, just everything was all so much more on point than we've seen before. He genuinely looked like a different player. Said it in the matchday thread, it reminded me of watching a young Ronaldo

6071~~~
That's more like it, the rabona panna will be remembered for a long time. Let's not forget he also did quite well in the limited playing time he got at the World Cup, scoring two goals. 

If he keeps his shit together and stays focused on football he'll be an excellent player in a couple of years.

6072~~~
A lot more of the same please. If possible.

6073~~~
Well, whatever the level of opposition, that was some good, old fashioned fun.

Loved it. Actual entertainment!

6074~~~
Brilliant performance. However, the full back he was up against was dreadful. The opposition in general were poor too. Memphis was great against Brugge too.

Still worried he can't convert it against decent teams.

6075~~~
They're clearly not League 2 level at all, but regardless... his performance was quite obviously very assured and high on confidence.

6076~~~
Best game I've seen from him

6077~~~
Looks a lot leaner than he did before Christmas. Back then he looked awkwardly muscular, like Micah Richards used to do.

Amazing what a bit of confidence can do. He got better and better as the game went on. Hope he can carry it into the Arsenal game.

6078~~~
This is the Depay we want to see! Well played.

6079~~~
Confidence, he's needed it and hopefully this will allow him to move on in the Premier League. I have seen performances like that from him at PSV. Here's hoping he can repeat against Arsenal.

6080~~~
That's more like it, Memphis. Fantastic performance. 

Romer will cry himself to sleep tonight, then retire in the morning.

6081~~~
Proper horny performance that

6082~~~
One of the best performances by a United player in the last 5 years imo.

Destroyed their RB time after time

6083~~~
The mood here has changed a bit, hasn't it!

Brilliant performance!

6084~~~
These are the kind of performances I was expecting from him most weeks when he signed. Hopefully he can do it when we're not playing piss poor teams in Europe. 

Even so, most excitement I've seen from anyone in a United shirt in an age <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6085~~~
He was fantastic tonight. Everything was coming off for him.

6086~~~
Cometh the hour cometh the man, 10/10 and how much did he/ us need that

6087~~~
That was until now the best performance I'd ever seen from him he was an animal vs spain and was all over the park, I watch the highlights video from that game every now and again it could only ever be a let down for me when thats what I expected from him for us.

6088~~~
Wish he could play against André Rømer every week. Hopefully, he'll take the momentum from this game into the Arsenal game.

6089~~~
We weren't going to lose with him on the pitch tonight. Incredible performance. 

May be if they play Chambers at RB.

6090~~~
And by the way, I'm voting Rashford as MM. Just can't stand his face (for now).

6091~~~
The one thing that tells that he is a hard worker is his left foot, he is a lot better with it now.

6092~~~
Even a touch of class in the post match interview.

6093~~~
He will be a big player for us and will be a joy to watch when he's in a flowing team. A combination of us expecting him to carry the team from the get go (since he wasn't gonna get any help from the established players) and him thinking (I actually don't know what he is thinking but basing it on his attitude on the pitch) this will be an easy ride has been a match made in hell so far but I do believe he got more in his locker than, let's say Nani, who he usually is being compared against. I just refuse to believe he will fail.

6094~~~
Mind boggling performance, absolutely incredible.

It's like he took that pill from Limitless.

6095~~~
No doubt the onus is on him to prove himself at the highest level and he's still a long way off from doing that but there's a reason why he looked streets ahead of any player on the park today and that's because the kid does have bags of ability. The question for me is about application. I don't see any reason why if he works hard he can't adapt to a higher level when he's taking the piss (when confident) against a lower one when no one else is.  But it's up to him to do that and establish himself. Otherwise it'll just be wasted talent.

6096~~~
Wow what a bloody performance.

Hope he can carry this form now and confidence. LVG needs to give him freedom.

6097~~~
Excellent performance, yes the opposition weren't all that good but this was a young team that needed someone to spark them and lead and he did that.

6098~~~
What did he say/do?

6099~~~
Unreal, now just needs to do it against the likes of arsenal

6100~~~
This season? This is easily the performance of the last 5 seasons. The highlights of this are going to be really, really long

6101~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWIUp19bBoA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
How do I stop him...

6102~~~
Told <a class="username" data-user="23903, @Successful" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23903/">@Successful</a> to suck it.

6103~~~
If you have to choose between Martial or Memphis to play on the left wing... who would you choose? (Don't say Martial as striker)

6104~~~
Talked about Martial and praised Rashford too.

6105~~~
I'm sure I'm going to be in the minority but honestly his performance tonight made me dislike him quite a bit. He hasn't played well since Brugge and then comes out and starts showing off against a league one caliber team. He obviously was extremely good but the cockiness was unwarranted after the season he's had.

That said, hopefully this is the confidence boost he needs to finally start fulfilling some of his potential. We'll see Sunday - but I'm not expecting a performance even remotely close to as good as that.

6106~~~
Memphis as a striker.

6107~~~
Memphis got really horny tonight.

6108~~~
Odd. His tricks were all purposeful.

6109~~~
I can understand where you're coming from but I cannot agree with it. Cockiness is doing pointless tricks when you could have kept it a lot simpler. There wasn't a single trick that Depay did tonight that didn't have a purpose.

6110~~~
I like him, but he has been dreadful in the premiership, and the fact he looked stunning tonight tells us all we need to know about the opposition.

6111~~~
Good God.

6112~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6113~~~
Yep you're in the minority.

His 'cocky' tricks all had reason and purpose and mostly advanced our play.  Likewise after such a poor season, it's fantastic that he had the confidence to try such skills.

I want to see a lot more of this from him - it's essential for any wide forward to delay such skills.

6114~~~
Played like a Utd no. 7, I can't stop grinning

6115~~~
Memphis as he puts in better crosses, also seems more natural to him

6116~~~
Soccer AM's Showboat is going to be about an hour and a half long.

6117~~~
To expand on this, he also tried the tricks and flicks at the right time. When the game was on, he kept it relatively simple. When the game was in our favour, then they began ramping up. When the game was won, it was party time.

6118~~~
Got a 10 from me. Sensational performance.

6119~~~
Plays well with freedom imo. Think he needs a run of games (but to be looked after carefully, in terms of subbing him when hes getting tired to keep him fresh).

I do however expect the pattern of people saying "fly him back to Holland" when he next gives the ball away or tries something and it doesnt work (probably on Sunday).
I like him because he keeps trying things.

6120~~~
Well, hello there. More of the same please.

6121~~~
Based on tonight's performance it's Memphis.  It's his natural position.  

The big BUT is consistency... First time I've seen him play so well ands it's tainted as its against much inferior defenders than he has to perform against.  

But it's a great performance to get under his belt and hopefully will inject a bolt of confidence to accelerate delivery of his potential

6122~~~
Bizarre post.

6123~~~
I feel like we put too much on his shoulders too early.  With the no7 shirt and being an automatic starter straight away he struggled to build up any momentum.

Hope he carries the forward into Premiership games.

6124~~~
He did horrible, horrible things to their right back, who probably wishes he was sent off earlier. Simply sensational performance though, hopefully he can keep it up.

6125~~~
That's what I thought!!! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Cracking goal too!!

6126~~~
Go on, son. Do it on Sunday. Step up...

6127~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/eq5g" width="560"></iframe>

New chant for him?

6128~~~
He's gonna have a long highlights reel from tonight. As everyone is saying, this is the player we thought we signed in the first place. You just hope this is the making of his Man Utd career. If anyone can teach him how to harness his attacking potential it's Giggs.

6129~~~
I'm happy that he played well, I really am, but there was just something about the performance I didn't like overall. I've been behind giving Memphis time all season and have always said and thought he would come good with time and I still think that, I just didn't really enjoy the performance tonight.  

Like I said in the original post, let's see how Sunday goes. If he can come even close to that against Arsenal I'll be beyond happy to admit my reaction tonight wasn't warranted.

6130~~~
He was trying to get a second yellow but he couldn't get anywhere near him.

6131~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6132~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6133~~~
Absolute monster showing tonight, loved it.

6134~~~
Was just about to post this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Amazing commentary

6135~~~
I'm buzzing after this performance. It isn't comparable to Brugge, this was much better, a complete performance. The sky's the limit with this guy. I have all the time in the world with players who are constantly trying to do something positive.

6136~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Pleased for him.

6137~~~
Very good game from him, but let's see him string a few together now.

6138~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this is great.

6139~~~
Another cracking performance against 'lesser' opposition tonight. I hope that he can use this one as a springboard for performances against better opponents going forward. Where better to start than against Arsenal this weekend!

6140~~~
Played really well. Hope he can kick on.

6141~~~
Has my approval<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6142~~~
That is brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6143~~~
In your endo!

6144~~~
Still waiting for him to perform against a 'professional' defender.

6145~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nNnCcmPSvj8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

6146~~~
You really are very, very sad.

6147~~~
With his strength and athleticism he has the real potential to be a monster attacking player for us. Physically and technically bullied his full back today.

6148~~~
I'll reserve judgement till I see how he does against Arsenal

6149~~~
Wow what a performance. The best he has had in a United shirt. Hopefully Martial is fit on Sunday. And also hoping Memphis transfers his European form into the Premier League.

6150~~~
If you can't enjoy a performance like that there's quite simply something very wrong with you.

6151~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What language is this?

6152~~~
He was immense tonight. Not sure but may have been my first 10/10 rating.

Shows how important confidence can be for a player.

Have high hopes for him against Arsenal.

6153~~~
I didn't mean the team as a whole, just Memphis. I just really can't get excited about him being good against another crap European side again.

6154~~~
I think French commentary.

6155~~~
Got a 10 from WhoScored.

Hard to disagree.

Rashford just behind with a 9.5

6156~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6157~~~
Looks a different player. Quick, nimble, purposeful rather than the slow, flat footed version we've seen for most of the season. Hopefully he keeps it up.

6158~~~
I don't have too many positives watching United at the moment to be fair. I've sort've backed myself in to a corner with how much I dislike LVG.

Rashford tonight and Martial against Liverpool were probably two of the only things I've genuinely enjoyed this season.

6159~~~
I know. He was all like, 'check me out being entertaining and doing tricks and giving a sustained impression of my full potential against admittedly inferior opposition'. Makes my blood boil!

6160~~~
Probably Martial, if Rooney is in form. 

But, when in form, Memphis showed that he can make the position his own. You could see that he took the game upon his shoulders and basically demanded the ball. 

I wonder if some of it is psychological. Among the front 3 today, you could say he was the big dog, but when he plays with Martial or Rooney, it seems he defers a bit. I see it a bit when coaching kids. Some kids are good to very good, but when teamed with similar or better players, they take a half step back and don't shine as much. Today, he looked at Rashford & Lingard and figured he's gonna have to be THE MAN, and the burden helped him flourish. Granted, he wasn't playing the best defense, but you could also see the team was looking for him more often, and not play at the periphery. 

Whatever it is, I hope it continues. It will be interesting to see if Martial is available and how Memphis reacts to it & this game.

6161~~~
Please get a grip.

6162~~~
Flat track bully <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/> 

<span style="color: #ffffff">I'm fecking kidding</span>

6163~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Cant-stop-listening-to-this!

6164~~~
I think you're just as confused as the rest of us when seeing a United player entertaining the crowd with silky skills for the first time in 200 years, you just react a bit differently to it. I bet there was atleast one Aboriginese which reaction drew association to the phrase 'party like it's 1999' when that scary white man arrived Down Under despite the majority being sceptical. Or I'm just shit at making analogies.

6165~~~
Maybe I just don't want to get my hopes up? Maybe I'm just frustrated that this is only the second time this season he's shown how good he can be. Who knows, I can't really describe exactly what irked me. Can't help it though, I wasn't impressed.

6166~~~
Flipped it to God/beast mode tonight and his performance alone would have made the game worth watching. Really hope this can be the launchpad for a good run of form to help us salvage something from  this season.

His attitude was fantastic as well, you could see how determined he was to make things happen (almost a Ronaldoesque drive about him tonight) and he didn't let anything get in his way. Really glad he got the goal to cap it off.

6167~~~
Unbelievable performance. Just pray it's a turning point for him.

6168~~~
Ronaldo-esque according to an early caller to Talksport.

I shall refrain from calling him Memphis Bellend for the first half of Sunday's game.

6169~~~
Maybe his mental attitude has changed? He seemed to play more from the heart, with confidence. I think tonight we saw the a player free to be himself.

6170~~~
because he was on one. I've seen martial humiliate premiership level defenders so lets not even mention Martial in this thread please. Martial on the LW is different class to Memphis and we see it every other game he plays on the wing. Last week Martial was playing CF and he was isolated as we played a shit away performance vs a team that came at us so pretty bad comparison. This game they sat back and invite us. P.S. who were the other flair players on the pitch? academy players mostly. If Nani played vs this team he'dbe walking past them

6171~~~
One of, if not the best individual performance by a United player since Ronaldo. The right back will be having nightmares about that game for years!

6172~~~
Magnificent performance. I'm lost for words really and I don't really give a shit it wasn't against a strong team. He absolutely pissed all over Roemer and really drove us to victory. 10/10 performance without a doubt. Some of the skills were just....<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

I also don't give a shit about the Arsenal game right now. I just want to watch a compilation video from tonight <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6173~~~
Who is there to "buss tricks" on our weakened team anyway. Perhaps its because not many of our players are flairy piss takers. mata doesn't beat players, neither does Herrera, Schneiderlin, Lingaard is average. So that leaves that young lad who scored 2 as the other star of the show. Varela played well. Does this mean our young goal scorer is suddenly better than Martial since Martial did not score vs these lot?

6174~~~
When all is said and done, it serves me greatly if Memphis can be the real deal against Arsenal as I badly want us to beat them. I just don't want the feeling of despair that goes with getting your hopes up and realising you were just deluding yourself in a groundhog day scenario. If he has another stinker vs Arsenal, what am I gonna do? I will feel a certain acceptance that I don't wanna have.

6175~~~
You can raise questions about the opposition but that performance tonight was unreal.  I've not seen a player light up Old Trafford like that in years.  After going a goal down and with so many young players in the team I was worried that heads might drop... but he stood up and spurred us on.

Despite the quality of the opposition, his talent and potential is there for all to see.  That boy has it in him to become world class.

I just hope the fans don't jump on him when he has the inevitable off days or things don't quite come off for him.  He's only just turned 22 and he has a lot more to learn.  Given patience and encouragement, I'd back him to go a long long way.

6176~~~

6177~~~
Delighted for the kid and delighted that he's shut up some idiots on here for 5 mins at least

6178~~~
That was a very special performance from him tonight, he has so much talent. He can be very frustrating to watch at times but if he gets his act together and plays like he did today then he will succeed here no doubt.

6179~~~
Good to see a player that is not afraid to show some skill.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Fantastic performance, hopefully he can build on it.

6180~~~
You can see the all the potential. He's a fantastic young talent, next season I'm confident we will see a better player. He's really exciting on the ball at times and is a very capable player. Some of his criticism has been warranted and some has been harsh. His tracking back is a concern, and attitude has been questionable when it's not going well but he has talent. I really can see him and Martial in our long term plans, attacking wise. When we get Luke Shaw back next year, that will help memphis down the side. When Depay's confidence up he's formidable. He tore them a new one tonight on that side. Yes they are a poor side but there was so much pressure on United tonight, so many academy players playing is such a big game(they done magnificently by the way). 

I think when Memphis gets's settled next year he will shut a few up in here. He's been made a scapegoat far to often this year. He's not a senior player and everybody doesn't settle as well as Martial. I think Jose could handle him perfectly.He's need to play without fear of getting subbed for giving the ball away. Players like Memphis flourish under freedom. I'm not getting carried away but you see glimpses of magic from him. I think he will be a phenomenal player for us in the future. When we get our squad sorted and properly balanced and a new coach, we will see Depay light up Old Trafford.

6181~~~
everything was going his way today. I was impressed how unselfish he was in the first half, tried not to lose the ball often in some situation where you'd think he would go to try to past defender but he stayed on the ball and played like a team player, not as much in the second half but he was even better when he tried to play a bit selfishly. Hope he has only this kind of games not the other ones.. standing ovation

6182~~~

6183~~~
He was so, so good tonight. More of the same in the Premier League please.

6184~~~
Now that was the Memphis we bought, so pleased he got that goal at the end as if anyone deserved a goal tonight it was him. 
Hopefully this is a huge confidence booster for him and he stars like that more often. Definitely Man Of The Match.

6185~~~
He needs time and games. Every player needs at least 1 season to bed in at a new club so we need to give him some time to adapt but today showed what he can do, granted it was against poor opposition but you have to perform against whats out on the pitch. Give the lad some time.

6186~~~
I've always rated him and thought he has the potential to be one of the best in the world (physique, pace, dribbling etc). I've always admitted his attitude isn't the best and he is lazy. 

I do think all Depay haters need to back off or even better feck off because we all know he is an outstanding player who needs confidence from the team and the manager. Seeing so many posters now saying they are happy for him despite slating him for weeks is an absolute farce.

6187~~~
I've been doubting him, but why wouldn't I be happy for him? He's just played a frankly ridiculous game for us. I'm made up for him. Now we just need to see it more often.

6188~~~
I mean that is a showcase that he clearly has talent, yes its a weak opponent but the fact is, if he wasn't on the pitch we would have lost. I can understand some people saying he needs to do that consistently but to see people actually still criticizing is baffling and actually one of the most embarrassing things ive ever seem. Your meant to be UTD fans, give the players some fecking credit!

6189~~~
thanks for posting it, missed the game but that is brilliant.

the pass to mata <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6190~~~
I don't know about you but I see Depay as a player who needs support to play at his best. He isn't as mentally strong as Ronaldo who couldn't care less about anyone's opinion. Depay has always been that player who needs shielding which van Gaal hasn't done whatsoever. Fergie would've managed him so so much better.

Fair enough we all love seeing United players do well and we are fully entitled to moan when they dont perform. With Depay though I personally didn't agree with all the grief he was getting because it was clear as day that he was being man managed terribly.

I am the complete opposite of surprised that he torn their right back a new arsehole tonight because I know he is capable of it.

6191~~~
Nah, they will be back next time he has a dodgy game

6192~~~
Great to see him do well in Europe again, excellent performance.

6193~~~
There is something very Peter Griffin about that commentary <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6194~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

catchy!

6195~~~
Been awhile since I've seen a full back so utterly destroyed in a game. Brutal for Rømer. Let's hope Memphis kicks on after this. I like when he both cuts in and goes to the byline; so much more dangerous.

6196~~~
He clearly has talent. My only concern is that perhaps the athleticism of the PL is what is derailing him in the PL. Think whatever you want about other leagues, but the PL tends to have more athletic guys, and a lot of Memphis' game is based on physicality. Beating guys on quick turns with his first step.  In the PL he is running into guys that are that much quicker than the likes of the European clubs he has excelled against so far.

He still needs to prove that he can do this in the PL. Hopefully he is a confidence player, and with confidence he will start to blossom into the talent that he obviously has.

6197~~~
Well, he has shown he has the ability. Now to apply it...

6198~~~
He'll be delighted.

6199~~~
Ah, but he'll be going up against Bellend Bellerin.

6200~~~
Brilliant game from him. He looked a completely different player tonight. Sure he had a lot more space than he would get in a PL game but he sparked into life tonight it was great to watch. I think that's what a lot of people including myself have been waiting to see.

6201~~~
absolutely killed it today. this was the memphis I expected when we signed him, now please show this more often.

6202~~~
Fantastic stuff today, but what can he do against Arsenal?

6203~~~
Bellerin will neutralize him easily I am afraid.

6204~~~
I'll wait until he does it against some decent opposition before getting too excited.

6205~~~
Some were claiming he was something rubbish. It was always clear he's a fantastic talent. Just needed confidence. Easily the best player for us tonight. And he looks in better shape too.

6206~~~
Credit where credit is due, he was Neymar-like today.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NpVyDrcKKw0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

6207~~~
His speed on the ball is mediocre at the moment. Too often we've seen him beat his marker on the first touch only to get caught up and muscled off the ball later.

If he can improve on that I'm convinced he'll become one of the best.

6208~~~
Wonder if he could adapt his game to play more likely Ribery. I just fear he doesn't have the acceleration to be a great winger. Clearly has all the skill in the world, but having beaten a man, if they can catch up again in a few steps it's kind of pointless. Will be a real challenge against presumably Gibbs on Sunday - who is rapid. 

One does wonder if he just went out there and had fun tonight. That's the most take-ons I can remember in a United match, certainly in the past 5 seasons.

6209~~~
He'll be up against Bellerin who is probably the quickest player in the league with Walcott, interesting to see how he does..

6210~~~
Bellerin's lightning, and also a generally excellent fullback. There aren't many harder opponents for a LW in the league at the moment. He'll have to muck in and do some defending too, Bellerin's one of their most reliable attacking outlets and too fast for any fullback in our squad bar Shaw to deal with on his own.

6211~~~
That's more like it, Memphis. Great performance. Really hoping he can continue that into the league.

6212~~~
I'm hopeful that this was the pivotal first season moment he has been waiting for, and that he kicks on from here.

Edit: not expecting miracles on Sunday, mind, but a general improvement of his game in the season run-in would be very very welcome.

6213~~~
Absolute monster today! Whatever you are doing Memphis continue please! Really hoping to see him, Martial and Lingard running wild and horny this weekend!

6214~~~
The last time he had a good game, he was dropped for the following match and didn't start again for weeks. Ruined his confidence and put him back to square one again. If nothing else, all the injuries should prevent that from happening again.

He's up against two quick fullbacks at the weekend, but with the naive silliness we often see employed by Arsenal fullbacks in attacking, he will have chances. If we can get him one on one with Per a couple of times he'll turn him inside out.

6215~~~
Probably, but then again if Memphis is open to going to left and not just his right he Bellerin may have a hard time coping with him.

6216~~~
He suffers from the same problem which plagues any young player with potential. They don't know how to pace themselves over the course of 90 mins. They try too hard and most times are eager to overachieve. To add to that, Lvg overworked him early in the season which only messed with his confidence even more. Hopefully he is smart enough and will show signs of maturity soon.

6217~~~
Was great from the start - finished with a goal. Brilliant game from him, destroyed their team and looked ever so confident - meaning his casual tricks and skills all came off. 

Delighted that 2 of the most criticized players recently (Memphis and Schneiderlin) both had brilliant games. They've played worse opposition and haven't stood out - todays side knocked out Southampton, and being 3-1 on aggregate at one stage, they kept fighting and showed that they are a class above.

6218~~~
He is back. Hopefully we will have another minnow team to play soon so that he can be played.

6219~~~
Strong possibility of that but this just could be his turning point.
 Let's see against a group of opponents worthy of the name?

6220~~~
There really is a lot of people with 0 knowledge posting here eh? FC Midtjylland is a League 1 or 2 level opposition? They beat Southampton over 2 legs FFS. Not every team outside of the big leagues are complete shit.

6221~~~
You've missed the point entirely, no one is saying he's better than Martial are they? What's being said is you can't discredit his performance becasue it was against shit opposition when no other player was able to get close to that level fo performance in over 3 hours of football. Why does it have to be a 'flair player', are non flair players unable to dominate games?

6222~~~
Yeah they were quite good at times in this tie. Although we moan about our defending, the skill by that sisto chap for their goal was class, and their football in the first leg was very good.

6223~~~
Does anyone have a compilation of his career ending massacre on that midgtyland right back? I haven't seen a single player get so humiliated on a professional level in a long time

6224~~~
Context matters though. Midtjylland didn't play official games for three months before last week whereas they were in top form vs Soton. 

People seem to forget that Memphis was outstanding in the home game vs Brugge as well and then shit against serious opposition. Unfortunately, I expect the same to happen again. He has the talent to destroy shit teams but struggles against good ones big time.

6225~~~
Something happened last night, there was a sudden response from our players-something we haven't seen at all this season.  I don't think it's coincidence he played well last night as he was linking up with different hungry young talented players with a will to impress and do well and we all know the potential that Memphis has, it was just so fustrating we weren't yet seeing it. I'm hoping we see a similar team against the Arse on Sunday.  10/10 performance in my opinion.

6226~~~
They were obviously horny yesterday.

6227~~~
Oh and that too!

6228~~~
I didn't see the game, have just seen the highlights but.....wow....great performance. I think he has benefited greatly from not having Rooney or Martial in the team. I think he likes the thought of being the star man so without those two it allowed him to shine.

He also looked a yard quicker than he has at other times this season. Maybe fitness has been an issue. Some of those tricks were <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. The video also looks like a season compilation. The highlights reminded me of watching Ronaldinho

6229~~~
In truth, what probably happened yesterday was we played a crap team who've barely played a game for months. They were probably worse than Brugge which takes some doing.

6230~~~
What the!? Who the?! How the!? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

I've been critical of Memphis thus far, and feared the worst for his United career, but I'm glad to be eating my own words. He was unplayable last night!

Reminded me of Ronaldo's debut against Bolton a little bit, in the sense that it was one of those "just give him the ball" performances. Their poor right-back didn't know if he was coming or going, and the fact that they resorted to elbows, blatant pulls and bad tackles goes to show how much he ruffled their feathers.

This kid needed a springboard, and boy did he just get one. A couple more games like that and he could be well on the way.

6231~~~
He's starting to learn that he can't just keep cutting in as he has become predictable, was good to see him go around the full back. Probably the best individual performance this season from any of our attackers.

6232~~~
Absolutely. Well done for the win, and terrific story about Marcus Rashford, but flippin' eck. We beat FC Midtjylland at home for crying out loud.

Arsenal will be an interesting game, and for some strange (but rather beautiful reason which has no basis and v little rationale..) I think we're going to do ok there. How funny would that be...

6233~~~
He's been generally poor since arriving but some of the stick he has gotten on here is a tad OTT. To make things worse, plenty on here have used the likes of Lingard as a stick to beat him with. I don't understand that at all; Depay has struggled but then people go into the Lingard thread and say things like 'oh lol Lingard is great, look how shit Depay is' - I never understand that type of thing on here. It was like last season when everyone used to absolutely tear into RvP, Rooney and Falcao and use the whole 'oh Welbeck is amazing, look how shit our current strikers are' argument- this was instead of just trying to support the players that we had. Supporting youth products is all well and good but I feel other players get a-lot of, sometimes unwarranted critisism because of this. Rant over, but I just don't get it at all.

Anyhow, Depay was absolutely brilliant last night. The opposition were equally as shocking but still, I hope that he can push on from this.

6234~~~
Look forward to Sunday now. Bellerin will be a big test for him. But all the raw materials are there. Maybe working with Giggs one to one is also helping. Who better to learn from, if you're a left winger, than one of the best ever.

ps I believe he broke the Europe League record last night for most successful dribbles in a game. 15.

6235~~~
He was immense last night, and I think a lot of that came from confidence. He started well against their rightback, and thought "I can beat this guy."

I liked his attitude as well, wanting to take corners quickly, encouraging his teammates. After seeing him strolling around in a few games, it was nice to see.

6236~~~
Happy for Memphis, I think he will have a good game against the Gunners too FWIW.

6237~~~
Because Flair players or wide players tend to steal the show maybe, especially if up against a defender they clearly got the beating of. Anyways, I am not discrediting his performance. It was a <b>10/10 performance</b> no doubt about it. You said initially that anyone questioning his talent are ridiculous and it is all confidence with him. Now that is not strictly true as with all players. Your talent is as good as the level it shows or works at. Memphis has made it as a professional footballer who plays on the wing. Just like 100's before him, he must've had a level of skill and talent to make it pro. My doubt is whether he has the talent for the top level of the game which he has yet to show me. When I played semi professionally as a teen, I looked very talented playing against grown men amateur sides who we would beat 7-0. Playing with other semi pros of my age and lets just say it weren't so obvious. As Memphis says, playing with lower opposition you can do whatever you want. If Memphis played with us in a kick-about he would look like Rivaldo. Playing against better defenders you can't do this. It's what separates the real from the pretenders. The pros from the professional showboaters. and so on and so on. I sincerely hope he proves me wrong and demolishes Bellarin. With Martial out, Memphis is our Obi-Wan "our only hope"

6238~~~
Finally looked like an accomplished winger. People will probably infer that it's down to the lack of a quality opponent, however he looked determined and full of tricks and it can only serve to boost his confidence.

6239~~~
we'll see. Big difference between that rubbish right-back and Bellerin.

6240~~~
Pleased for him. The opponents had some good moments and some nice quality but couldn't handle the pace or intensity. We are not a poor team when we stop worrying and play our game. The problems have been when there is a lack of energy in the team and that makes it harder for the likes of Depay, who seem to thrive on tempo. Promising performance.

6241~~~
I think it was a 8/10 performance. He made a lot of mistakes, put a few poor crosses and shots in, dwelled a bit too much after getting past his man a few times. Defenitely MotM and a very enjoyable performance though, because he made so much happen. And he showed his talent to those who don't have a good eye for it. I liked the cocky stuff also, not because he's at a point in his careeer or was at a point in the match to show off, but because he found himsef and will find himself a lot in static situations. He has to be a threat from standing still with the ball at his feet, with the possession game and everybody high up the pitch he can't always have a running start or take the ball away from the defender with his first touch. 

He took a lot of risks, and when it didn't work out, he just tried again and cut the mourning short. It was more about determination than confidence, the confidence grew on him during the second half. The moment I like best was the turn and the blind cross to Mata's toe, that's what he should do more often, just put it in the spot where a teammate should be, don't take the time to aim carefully because in the PL he isn't given that time.

6242~~~
How can you have such terribly low standards for van Gaal and then spout this shite? 

It was the best attacking performance of any player this season. 8/10? Pu-lease.

6243~~~
If he plays like this against Arsenal and Martial has a good game we'll win, it's what we've been waiting for all season; those two to be in form at the same time, if he does stay like this it could be extremely exciting!

6244~~~
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha..... this is incredible. The best performance by an attacking player this season. Ha ha ha..... look how far we have fallen.

We played FC bleedin' Midtjylland!!! This is his best performance since...... coming on as a sub against SHEFFIELD UNITED... and of course his great games against CLUB BRUGES...

Ha ha ha....

6245~~~
He's very defensively suspect but his pace hides a lot of that but I agree he's a massive challenge, maybe we'd be better off sticking Martial there as Memphis having a bad game against Bellerin could knock his confidence back to square one.

6246~~~
Be honest, you didn't even watch the game did you?

6247~~~
A newbie-level post, if I ever saw one.

6248~~~
What is this?

6249~~~
Yeah that was good. He stood up last night and looked determined to became the main man in the absence of first teamers like Rooney and Martial.

6250~~~
In some weird way the inexperience of our team actually seemed to help us. After we went 1-0 down the team just switched up a gear and went all out trying to overturn the deficit and got rewarded for it. Seeing a Manchester United squad play with some fire and urgency for a change was a very welcome sight for me.

6251~~~
Me, low standards? 

I'm afraid those are not mutually exclusive. It was very enjoyable, sparkling and decisive, but it wasn't like he didn't put a foot wrong. Enjoyable and good are not exactly the same.

6252~~~
There's a difference between being talented and performing on a weekly basis. Ravel Morrison is supremely talented, far more talented than say James Milner, but it's looking increasingly likely JM will have a far better career than Ravel. Things like work ethic and confidence contribute as much to your performance as talent does. I beleive it's abundantly obvious Memphis has the technique, skillset and physique to be a top-drawer player, hes just suffering mentally at the moment. It's whether he can play under such pressure and find consistency and retain confidence even when the going gets tough that'll decides if he reaches his potential or not.

6253~~~
Why do I have the displeasure of being quoted in this abomination of a post?

6254~~~
That's club Facebook page material there.

6255~~~
Very true. As I've been saying, he's able to show that he's got plenty of talent against lesser teams when he's got more time on the ball and arguably less pressure to perform. Now, we need to hope that he gains enough confidence from those performances to go on and start performing in the bigger games. It's still his first season though, and he's quite young. While he's struggled this season, I don't think he's had work ethic problems in the same way, say, Morrison has, who's had a lot of problems outside of football. Even if he doesn't kick on from this game specifically, Depay's still young and I've got a lot of hope that he'll really start to perform as he gains experience.

6256~~~
I hear what you are saying its just I expect any winger to have tricks in their locker. I guess its just my standards I guess and comparing those around. People say he has the talent to become world class etc etc but they won't say that about wingers who embarrass superior opposition. I have seen many African, Portuguese, South American Wingers who have pulled out all the tricks vs lower opposition. Matias Fernandez formerly of Villareal. Also Ricardo Quaresma. these guys mugged off players with insane skills. Better defenders than who depay performs against as the Superliga and La Liga is superior to eridivisie. They had the talent, probably superior talent than Depay, but I didn't feel the need to hype them until they stepped up to the plate and did it vs meaningful opposition (TBF Fernandez is pretty good). Point is I've seen many Depays come and go in my time and he doesn't stand out amongst them IMHO. Quaresma did some insane shiz. I'm sure anyone of Sterling, Bolasie, Zaha, LAMELA, Deulofeu, Lallana, Firmino, Ben Arfa, Mane, Shaquiri, Arnautovic, Sessegnon, Payet, NANI, would look World Class vs these lot under these circumstances (no football for 2 months); They are skillful players who are likely to show boat and take the piss out of their opposition. Show boating doesn't mean you are more talented. Jay Jay Okocha can look awesome against a side because he is doing things others could only dream of, but it doesn't mean he is a better player than say Stevie G or Lampard. (Okocha is however one of my favorite all time Premier league players).

You get what the hoola was all about now!

6261~~~
Think LVG should consider playing him up top and Martial on the left against Arsenal.

6262~~~
I think its time for a 'root and branch' review of the newbie system
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6263~~~
I have been one of his biggest critics on here. I'm desperate for him to show this kind of invention against a decent side. Starting with Arsenal I hope.

6264~~~
This was such a filthy moment.

Quotes from Romer (the RB that Depay humiliated) after the game: 

"I have never been this close to crying after a match. I am devastated, and it's not going to be a good night of sleep." 

"He is the best player I have ever faced. It is difficult to argue for anything else when he plays like this. He is the best. He can do anything. He will go inside, outside, turn me around and use his incredible pace to get past me."

"Obviously, I would have loved some more backup, but when I am the one being destroyed over and over, it is not fair to blame my teammates for anything."

"The second yellow card is a redundancy. Completely unnecessary. It will be a game I remember for a very long time."

6266~~~
I'm of the opinion of not fixing something, when it is not broken. Why move position, when he's just played the best game of his United career from the left?

6267~~~
If he can take this form into Sunday's game, well then we can truly say he's turned a corner. I'd love him to succeed here, I really would.

6268~~~
I understand but I'm still of the opinion Martial is the more superior player. He doesn't see enough of the ball when he plays up top IMO. Memphis best quality are the runs he makes.

6269~~~

6270~~~
So pleased he was able to step up Lady night albeit against poor opposition he needs confidence and I think he gained plenty of that with that performance. He created chance after chance and scored a goal, if he can replicate it in the prem I'll be very happy indeed.

6271~~~
Yes, Memphis has been absolutely turgid till now and may continue to be even after last night. But, lets see the performance for what it was - absolutely devastating. There are times when a player can just be so horny, that it doesn't matter who they are up against. When Ashley Cole was still considered a top left back but, Valencia was also at the top of his game, he would just roast him even though he knew what was coming. 

The other thing is last night we actually kept feeding him the ball and that just made him grow in confidence even more. The times he has played this season after a couple of failed moves, we've abandoned getting him the ball and to me that's one of our biggest mistakes, we don't keep getting the ball to our danger men - we've even done it to Martial. 

Hopefully on Sunday we will see a lot of the same but, also as a team make sure we use him (and Martial if fit) as much as we can. We've got to work on find ways to make sure they get a chance to run at Arsenal.

6272~~~
I have been away for a couple of days and didn't catch the game. Outrageous piece of skill above though!

Still, by his own admission, he struggles with the pace and pressing in the Premier League. He has actually turned up against all the weak sides we have played this season so he needs to step up against a Premier league side. Sunday is a massive game for him. His confidence should be through the roof at least.

6273~~~
Depay was very horny yesterday, and hopefully that level of sexual appetite continues the rest of the season. We need guys like him to have raging boners running at defenders and wreaking havoc.

6274~~~
Orgasmic <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I hope he really kicks on from this performance, please God let it happen.

6275~~~
That might just be the case indeed, crazy performance o.O
Enjoyed the highlights reel so much, I decided to rewind it and count his nutmegs during the game. 6 (or 5, if you don't count the one where that other player has the ball for half a second, but then Memphis takes it back) fecking nutmegs in one match. 
The joke's been made before, but geez.. that lad was horny as feck yesterday. Really impressed me. A game to remember.

6276~~~
Haha that's a good way of putting it!

6277~~~
Really pleased for him. Even if he didn't do it against the big teams but didn't it to everyone else, we'd be top of the league and still in CL.....

6278~~~
He had 15 successful dribbles yesterday. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6279~~~
Just watched that. Although their defence was pathetic I didn't think he was capable of playing that well against anyone or of that skill level. Some great crossing in there too.

6280~~~
He's capable of even better. He had many displays like this last year. Just the his bad transition to our league has jaded many towards him. Hopefully he'll kick on now.

6281~~~
That's the test though. He said in an interview that I posted earlier in the thread that he has struggled coming to terms with the pace and pressing of the PL. The key is time on the ball, in the Premier League you have less time to be effective on the ball. At the moment he has only been a flat track bully for United. He needs to step up and show some quality against a side that is strong and willing to press him and kick him.

6282~~~
I reckon it will only take one game for him. The Arsenal one may be too soon with all our injuries to the squad, bit as soon,  he does it once then he will start to shine.

6283~~~
Best individual performance of any of our players this season?

6284~~~
Times journalist Paul Hirst showing once again that you dont have to understand football to be a sports journalist. Gave Memphis a 2/5 rating for last night

6285~~~
Smalling had some cracking performances early in the season as well, absolutely bullied attackers.

6286~~~
More of this please Memphis. Cant wait to see how he does against Arsenal.

6287~~~
But Paul Hirst is excused, I heard he had some problems with his cognitive functions.

6288~~~
I missed the game yesterday, but just watched a highlight compilation. My word!! That was some performance - imagine if he can maintain anything close to that level; he and Martial would be devastating. With Mata in the hole and a new right winger, we'd have a pretty impressive attack there.

6289~~~

Pure filth

6291~~~
Orgasmic moment right there. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
Insane piece of skill.

6292~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLmuBHii1dA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

This made me so fecking horny....

6293~~~
I think you need to be a little more subtle. Perhaps something like, 25 in the Dutch League, would easily score 25+ in the Belgian League and 25+ in the Danish League. I kind of agree with you a smidge, but it was such a fine performance that I don't really care who it was against. I am just happy for him, like one of your mates when he's on a lean streak and he finally pulls a decent bird. Even if she was chatting to you while he was in the mens and saying she was into a one night thing only. You'd be chuffed for your mate to get a bit.

Similar for Memphis, can only be a positive for his development no matter who he dusts in front of him.

6294~~~
Much better attitude, at least he showed a bit enthusiasm and urgency, which i have not seen before from him. He obviously had a better output too, lets hope he can keep this type of performances. I never slated him though, this season was to get him acclimatised, although his attitude was shit, but then again his confidence was shot. I still think he will kick on next season properly.

6295~~~
Why is everyone suddenly so horny? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

6296~~~
What was new in that performance was that he was brilliant with both feet. Having a fully functioning left foot makes him so much more dangerous and effective since he can go inside or outside and cross with either foot.

6297~~~
Because they lack originality, humour and the ability to see that it's been overdone.

6298~~~
Yep. Let's see how he does on Sunday against Bellerin and the rest of Arsenal. Really hope he kicks on from here.

6299~~~
Think the fans are getting TOO excited here but fairplay for getting behind him.  Needs more than this to get me to forgive that headed backpass at Stoke or the Chelsea calamity. Some nice tricks though, yes.  And he can shoot, obvs.

But anyway, apart from telling me I'm wrong, why does he prefer the left?

To come inside & shoot obvs.  If he hasn't got the lightning pace (which he hasn't) to go on the outside vs. proper opposition, and he won't cross with his left foot, we ain't much further forward.  I remain miserably sceptical.

But he looks a better footballer through the middle, how we get him playing there is a difficult question - more interchange with Martial is possible, I don't see Rooney being too keen on it.

6300~~~
It's important given how United fans go on about "fast, attacking football" being the clubs DNA. You've got a young kid with flair and skill, give him some patience. At times, the fans were very impatient and harsh on Nani and Di Maria IMO, especially the former.

6301~~~
I don't suppose you're being singled out quite so much in a team that is crap on an overall basis.  ie: there would have been less tolerance than there has been if we were winning every week - which is a little bit strange but does seem to be how it is. Just talking generally here.

6302~~~
The former ? Nani was here for close to 6 years. I can understand your comment on AdM, but Nani infuriated most fans for most seasons. Personally, I still love him, but I think the comment about not being patient with Nani is a little untrue.

6303~~~
Nah, he was a very good player for us (till the last 2 years where he also had injuries) ad he mostly infuriated those with low patience levels which says as much about them. He even got booed for having a shot from range if I'm not mistaken, which was sad to see. It's easy to boo a flair player, but when you keep patting yourselves on the back for supporting a team that has flair players, it comes off as a bit weird. Especially when Rooney losing the ball through 20 bad touches will never get booed.

6304~~~
Nani was just the kind of player that WOULD disappear though wasn't he?  I think you (theoretically) had to accept that, it was never a question of ability with him.  Actually & always accepting it more difficult I suppose.  I don't think Memphis & Nani are in any way similar as players are they?  I don't see that, anyway. (that wasn't your point, I know)

6305~~~
Nani would rarely disappear. He would always keep trying to have a go and make things happen. He did lack a certain something mentally to be a top player (for many years, he was a top player for 2). Maybe it was self-confidence, or drive, not sure really.

Either way, my point was that if we keep harping on about flair players, let's be patient with them. I don't agree with booing a player because he took a tame shot on goal, for example.

6306~~~
Couldn't watch the match, thanks for that, outstanding performance indeed.

6307~~~
Think my favourite bit is when he just shrugged the defender off using upper body strength.

The kid is built. Combine that with the obvious talent and the upside potential is huge.

Just the big question mark of if he has the mentality (and ability) to do it against top level opponents.

6308~~~
His performance the other day just highlights Van Gaals weak man-management skills. As soon as he had confidence he was playing out of his skin, yet Van Gaal has absolutely destroyed that confidence the rest of the season with the way he's used him and subbed him at half time etc. 

Obviously Memphis is a confidence player and somebody that needs an arm around him at times, which Van Gaal should have known.

6309~~~
Oh. I thought the Caf had a sudden influx of female posters <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> 

Edit: Or that most of us are all sad lonely men behind a keyboard

6310~~~
Big day for Memphis against Arsenal today. He really needs to show a positive performance against better opposition. It was okay doing it against the danes, shrewsbury, Brugge etc but after that performance in mid-week it's time he grabbed the bull by the horns and stepped up to the plate in a big game. Fingers crossed, I hope he can do it and we end up seeing the kind of player emerge that we thought we signed last summer!

6311~~~
I like this Depay. He's better than the one we used to have.

6312~~~
Looks a completely different player.

6313~~~
That flick was just cheeky.

6314~~~
Looks a lot better. Hell of a lot more decisive although he's struggled to beat Bellerin.

6315~~~
Keeping the ball very well today. That flick he did was Neymaresque.

6316~~~
Indeed, but also defended well against Bellerin

6317~~~
Definitely.

6318~~~
Very good today, again. 

Shame it was only Arsenal though. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

6319~~~
Probably his best league performance today. Did his defensive work and helped take the pressure off by keeping the ball well. Long may it continue.

6320~~~
Thought he played well again. Obviously not to the level of Thursday's performance, but he generally looked confident on the ball, was willing to take players on, was regularly involved and posed a decent attacking threat. Hopefully his newly discovered self is here to stay.

6321~~~
Needs to prove himself against a decent Premier League team.

6322~~~
Yes he was great

6323~~~
Did very well. Absolutely superb work defensively too, completely neutralising ballerin's threat.

6324~~~
Obviously confidences makes a huge difference but the main thing for me is he looks so much more determined. I'm not at all worried about his ability to succeed here now.

6325~~~
A very mature performance today!

6326~~~
Confident and mature performance.

6327~~~
Excellent showing, seems completely driven today, kept Bellerin busy and even pitched in well defensively.

6328~~~
Different type of performance today, but for me was just as important.

6329~~~
A clear change of attitude in terms of overall workrate. What a joy to watch.
One thing though, how come we didn't get one replay of his sick control, are those skills not valued enough on Sky <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> ?

It was always a psychological issue with him and now he looks like a United (hungry) player. Long may it continue.

6330~~~
I agree. Suddenly our attacking options in the future look quite mouth-watering.

6331~~~
I think he is a player who enjoys having resposabilities thrust upon him but it is good that he is standing up when we need him too.

6332~~~
Played the perfect game today, even if he didn't score or assisted. Fantastic performance.

6333~~~
Much better performance than earlier this season in the PL, but it's still evident that his technical abilities aren't at the level required to play consistently well at this level. Would consider it a gamble if he's our first option on the left next season.

6334~~~
Very impressed with his mentality.

6335~~~
Didn't get as much joy tonight, but thought he was quite good today. Kept their defenders busy. Defensively fine too, where I think he has struggled.

6336~~~
Brilliant performance, didn't expect that from him.

He's clearly getting a lot of confidence this past week.

6337~~~
The beautiful thing is that it mostly came from him, a change of attitude has had a great impact so far.

6338~~~
Played like a leader. What a week for him.

6339~~~
Nothing special. A bit unlucky some times but his form is definitely going up. He definetely seems to benefit (like most of the team) that we place with a bit more urgency and at a higher tempo now.

6340~~~
Not much came off for him but i thought there was a maturity and work ethic today that was missing in earlier games, no stupid decisions or doing skills in stupid places.

6341~~~
Thought he was class today. What a bit of confidence and a more open style from the team can do for a young player eh? Hopefully people on here cut him a bit more slack from now on, he clearly has loads of talent and has huge potential.

6342~~~
Missed the Midgetland game but heard he was much better.  He was very good in the match today, taking on people, running hard and actually going left for a change.

6343~~~
Thought he had a fantastic game in all honesty, but not in the same breathtaking way as against Mjytlland.

Held the ball up really well, caused Bellerin problems throughout, made good decisions in possession and worked hard to get the ball back. 

Finally looking like a proper United player this past week or so.

6344~~~
I had written him off, today I saw what he is capable of, will give myself an uppercut shortly for having given up on him before.

6345~~~
Got to grips with Bellerin as the game went on and dominated him in the 2nd half, his protection of the ball was a big part in relieving some pressure when Arsenal were on top. Most impressive is he's stepped up and taken responsibility in this young team.

6346~~~
Personally I think that it's because of <a class="username" data-user="69862, @Akash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@Akash</a> and <a class="username" data-user="56592, @Annihilate Now!" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56592/">@Annihilate Now!</a> , he read the post written by the former after the latter talked about the Caf.

6347~~~
Very, held the ball up well, defended from the front and got back brilliantly
Something I did say earlier in the season needed to happen and that playing at the snails pace and trying to clog up the center was a waste for him.

Not going to claim he's made it yet but if he carries on like this.

6348~~~
Ran rashford close as MOTM today 

Amazing what a little confidence and better attitude does. 

He kept bellerin in his pocket today.

6349~~~
Had a very good game today.

6350~~~
He did very well today, not as flashy as the Europa game but this match impressed me a lot more.

6351~~~
Made up for the lad. A really mature performance capped off with an utterly outrageous piece of skill.

6352~~~
Checkout the video that's knocking about, it's definitely to be seen.

6353~~~
He was excellent today. He tracked back on almost every Arsenal attack. A very very mature display. I wish that Rashford combo worked though. That goal would have been special.

6354~~~
If the penny has finally dropped I hope it stays dropped, he seems to thrive being the senior guy in the forward line and I hope he keeps it up.

6355~~~
Very good performance. Completely neutralized Bellerin on the left and even though he was never going to do to Bellerin what he did to Roemer, he was always dangerous with the ball and very positive in his attacking play. Did very well defensively and held the ball up brilliantly.

6356~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

6357~~~
Im you could see he changed his attitude by the way he celebrated against mitjilland.

6358~~~
Finally he's looking confident. He's using his body instead of dribbling. He's a better target player than I thought. I also love the magic between him and Mata. They could form one of the best attacking options in the PL if it keeps growing. Really good understanding there + perfect match in technique.

I'm fine with him looking cocky when he's delivering stuff like this. If not - keep it low key, please.

6359~~~
You need to find a link to watch it!

6360~~~
Oh my!

6361~~~
Wait, what?

6362~~~
He worked his bollox off today and had a good game against one of the PL's best right backs. I'm happy with that performance.

6363~~~
The difference in confidence was so evident! Was tracking back, helping Rojo and Mensah out, not afraid to get physical and take Arsenal players on. 

Biggest factor for me was that his shoulder wasn't slouching and nor was he sulking after losing the ball or getting tackled. Just got back to business.

6364~~~
Very good today. May it continue.

6365~~~
He was impotent in attack for the most part but showed much better work ethic and held the ball up quite well.

6366~~~
Thank you man.

6367~~~
I don't think he played particularly well today, but he did OK. The thing I liked very much about was that he was very involved with the whole match, talking to his teammates, complaining at the referee, stirring up the brawls, slowing play down when needed, irritating them just a little bit extra. It's like taking responsability for the team result freed up his own game.

6368~~~
Thought he was excellent. His defensive contribution was very important IMO. 

Plus he is starting to look confident.

6369~~~
That Midgetland performances reminded him of what he's capable of himself. Confidence has taken off.

6370~~~
We're starting to see the player he knows he can be. I look forward to more.

6371~~~
Played like a true leader. There were so many instances where we had our backs towards the wall and Memphis was the only outlet. And I was always half expecting him to try to take on a couple of players only to lose the ball but he kept proving me wrong by staying calm and making simple passes. Very mature performance from him today. This is what we all want to see. 

And that touch <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

6372~~~
Jesus christ, go watch the Midtjylland  game, their RB admitted he was nearly in tears because of how badly Memphis burned him.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://screamer.deadspin.com/defender-admits-manchester-uniteds-memphis-depay-beat-h-1761508849" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://screamer.deadspin.com/defender-admits-manchester-uniteds-memphis-depay-beat-h-1761508849</a>

6373~~~
Totally agree. The part about him that makes me most happy atm is that he actually looks like he is caring again and wants to do well. The rest will come in time, once the confidence is up again he will start hitting those shots that now still fly miles over the goal.

6374~~~
Nah he was good. It was a huge improvement on what we've seen recently. He obviously wasn't going to replicate Thursdays performance.

6375~~~
Good game.

6376~~~
He's beginning to show his talents. And it's been very good these past 2 games.

6377~~~
He was fantastic today. We could have a real attacking force on our hands with Memphis, Martial and Marcus (with Mata pulling the strings behind them.) Of course, it might be hard to shoehorn those four into the same lineup.

6378~~~
Spot on. You will never have a great attacking display every time, specially a couple of days after a match. The workrate, the determination are signs encouraging that he wants to make it.

6379~~~
Solid game, linked up well with Rashford and his hold-up play was generally excellent.

6380~~~
I've not been impressed all season but today he stepped up and had a very good game, kept the ball very well.

6381~~~
Very good all round performance today. Enjoyed himself even without any statistical contribution.

Cannot bloody wait for him to be teamed up with Shaw again

6382~~~
Another promising game for him. I really hope he makes all the critics including myself look like imbeciles. Please keep it up Memphis.

6383~~~
Considering the opposition, the relative inexperience of the players around him and the quick turnaround from the Europa game, I thought he stepped up big time.

As others have said, if we can get <i>this</i> Memphis when Shaw is back in the team behind him, that side of the pitch could be extremely exciting. Still a bit if mind, but games like these last two should buy him some patience from the management and support alike.

6384~~~
His hold up play is just phenomenonal,  he just has this ability to pin down his marker. Would be good to see us exploit that a little more, drift in on occasion, get some runners off him and fire the ball into his feet.

I said it a few months ago that it's all about confidence with him, he had started to perform better before the midgetland game and now seems to be finding his feet. Happy for the lad after all the shit he's been getting recently.

6385~~~
Well done lad played very well, looks lean, quick and fit.

6386~~~
Dobba made a good point. Even though Depay is young, we've a lot of players younger then him. It's good to see him speaking on the pitch. Hopefully we've pointed out to him, that even though he's young.....we've younger players in the squad who need players like Depay - to forget their young as well and just do what they do well.

6387~~~
Well done Memphis, keep on progressing.

6388~~~
2nd half was better but he didn't create much overall. But he was excellent at bringing maturity, guile, fight and patience into the side, today that was probably more important than getting past his defender a lot or have great crosses and shots. So I don't think we disagree that much, I just expect more pure footballing class from him in the future.

6389~~~
Another very good game for Memphis. He's proper strong, isn't he? Really held it up well and his use of the ball was really good. You could see he was confident from the game against Midtjylland on Thursday. Hoping he can build from this.

6390~~~
Mature is the word that best describes his performance today. Great Work ethic, great decision making and maturity, not things you'd associate with Memphis.

6391~~~
Really love the chemistry he seems to have with the young players. It's like he's becoming a leader of the team when we play with our U13 team.

6392~~~
Decent first touch, that.

6393~~~
Thanks the link.  Just watched the embedded highlight.  That step over then rabona pass to Mata was just sick...

He clearly has the physicality and technique to succeed.  The thing with him was his lack of commitment and refusal to go left.  Seems like over the last couple of games he has adjusted.  Gaining confidence and good to see.

6394~~~
Since that ad came out with the guy on the moped telling him to feck off, he hadn't looked back.

6395~~~
Looks a different player was brilliant again today. Tracking back  and looked confident with the ball going forwards. Held the ball up excellently well in the 2nd half as well.

6396~~~
He isn't able to consistently go past good defenders.

6397~~~
This video and I are going need some alone time.

6398~~~
Brilliant, so strong, gave Bellerin a tough time. 

He's the guy who needs to be the main man, needs to feel like the main man for him to perform at his best.

6399~~~
Yup, seemed to really enjoy Rashford's goals

6400~~~
Great to see Depay with another captain's performance in this game. This is the Depay I expected to see early on. He's emerged from the giant shadows around him and he's a leader with marauding players around him. He just needs players on his wavelength to reach his true level. Looking forward to seeing him improve further.

6401~~~
He looked very quick today. Had a foot race with bellerin a few times and they seemed pretty equal which was surprising. His body strength when on the ball is very impressive.

The main difference for me though is his stamina looks much better. He isnt puffing hard when he gets the ball going forward anymore, and isn't too tired to track back.

Now he's got the fitness required he looks strong and quick again which is allowing him to play at 100%, no wonder he's feeling more confident again.

6402~~~
Good game by him today, consistency is what matters now. Nonetheless, it's always a good sign when somebody manages to perform well after a very tough stretch.

6403~~~
That's fine. It's also radically different from what you originally said, though.

6404~~~
It's great to see him pulling out all the tricks, this club was built on players like that. Players who the crowd on their feet. Memphis has been poor this season but he has the talent to be a great player. Hopefully this is a turning point for him, and hopefully LVG will give him free reign to entertain the crowd instead of asking him to stop it and pass backwards.

6405~~~
No, it isn't. I wrote: "his technical abilities aren't at the level required to play consistently well at this level" which is true. He isn't far off though.

6406~~~
I don't think he was necesarily effective today but he was still good, when he plays like this he makes opposition defence shit their pants  and that is always a good thing. I would say this performance reminded me a lot on Nani's decent performance, with better hold up play. His hold up play was much better than Nani's though, he held the ball under pressure very well, was very impressed with that.

6407~~~
Always said he'd be a success because he has the work ethic to want to learn and improve.

6408~~~
This kid has some confidence. He would have looked like an arse if he screwed that one up. Would have been another reason to bash him in the caf. Fantastic skill. Though unnecessary, Nani-esque.

6409~~~
Hopefully this is the start of what will be the making of him as a United player. We really need him to contribute at this level during the run in! If we can find some form, top four is still not entirely out of the question. But we need consistency from our match winners to achieve that!

6410~~~
Confidence and hard work. Thats all thats changed. Delighted hes seemingly turned a corner.

6411~~~
Not sure how it was unnecessary... the ball was behind him and he wanted to take it down the wing. Considering the alterantive was to stop, take it down with his back to goal and slow-down our attack... it was a perfectly excuted bit of skill that allowed him to progress up the pitch.

It beat Thursday night trick for me... one of the best peices of skill I've ever seen in a game of football.

6412~~~
Agreed.

6413~~~
I'm fairly sure that if he stops, he misses the ball.

That doesn't have to be the only alternative. If he judged the flight on the ball better, he could have taken it in his stride with his first touch and knocked it past Bellerin (if it was him). I remember CR7 doing it quite a few times whenever he got such a ball. He could have also simply got it under his control (Ala Mata style) and then dribbled to the flanks. There is nothing there to suggest that that was the only attack minded approach available. It was great to watch obviously , because the technical difficulty of that skill is insanely high, and as you rightly said, should be considered better than the one he tried against Midgetland.

6415~~~
He has shown serious flashes of quality since day 1. Just been infuriating in many games. Many would draw a resemblance to a young Ronaldo with that, although I'm not sure he has anywhere near as munch talent or work ethic. Still, Ronaldo is a one-off true great and you can hardly write Memphis off just because he isn't on that level. Memphis can still be a top player.

6416~~~
He really seems to relish being a more "senior" player in the team, my only worry has been his work rate and I'm glad to see that this has improved over the last few games.

6417~~~
Very good today again, the only problem for him was he likes to try beat his man but Bellarin is so fast over 10 yards it's very hard for most wingers to do damage against him (see Neymar) so there's no shame in that. 

Hopefully we're seeing the Memphis we were meant to sign, looks a changed player.

6418~~~
He suddenly looks a player with serious, serious potential. His strength on the ball is absolutely brilliant. At times he holds it up like a proper big centre forward. And in these last two games he's suddenly got loads of time always which top players tend to have. Then he's also brought out the trickery which is rare to find. 

It's only two games but now I'm seeing why he was so highly rated. He could be a proper box office player at United if he fulfills his potential.

6419~~~
That's assuming he has the time to think.  It was a quick and correct decision to pull of what he did.

6420~~~
Why shouldn't he ? It was almost a cross field ball. He could have judged it perfectly if he wanted to. I'm just saying it wasn't the only way to to take that ball on. Still loved it though.

6421~~~
Another good performance from Memphis. Happy to see.

6422~~~
Yet again a great performance by a great player. Give him confidence and he will perform. Give him shit and have no belief like van Gaal had in him and he will disappoint. Anyone who has played the game before knows he has potential to be one of the best. If you think otherwise then I seriously question your football knowledge.

As I stated in this thread, I think United fans are awful at times when it comes to players who aren't performing as they can. We maybe aren't on the same level as Real Madrid but when one of our players isn't playing up to scratch we can be very harsh.

Memphis is a joy to watch. I hope United fans realise how special a player he is.

6423~~~
If one moment sums up his improvement it was when he chased back and slide tackled their player (maybe Bellerin?), held him off and won the free kick in the first half. His whole attitude seems to have changed.

Thought he was great again.

6424~~~
<b>Statement 1:</b> It's still evident that his technical abilities aren't at the level required to play consistently well at this level.

<b>Statement 2:</b> He isn't able to consistently go past good defenders.

Yes it is. Or are you equating "going past defenders" with "technical abilities"? The two are not unrelated, but as far as attributes, or to use a less FM-contaminated definition - facets of a footballer's game - goes, they are not even nearly the same. 

The first assertion I wholeheartedly disagree with. Memphis has indeed shown, albeit in glimpses, ample magnitudes of technical ability. In fact, he is one of the most technically proficient players in our team. Consistently employing those abilities in competitive matches is another matter entirely, and we can all agree that he hasn't managed to do so yet. 

Consequently, the second assertion is also fair. 

Again though, the two are not the same. Not at all.

6425~~~
that's what struck me.

6426~~~
Just saw this picture, this looks impossible <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Fantastic defensive contribution today as well.

6430~~~
It's incredible how different his attitude was towards defending today. Tracked back every time, never left his full back on his own, and was also the only player managing to hold the ball up and keep possession for us late on - finally saw him use the fact that he's built like a fecking tank. He can still make better decisions when on the ball, but if he does the above things every time he plays, I'd be delighted to see his name on the team sheet every time.

6431~~~
He probably got embarrassed by all those shit Trickbox videos and decided to give them something to work with.

6432~~~
Was mentally on board with what we needed to do as a team to get a win today, just as important as the skills he showed on Thursday. They didn't create much on his side of the pitch and his threat was enough to keep Bellerin back. Also shows intelligence at the end to slow the game down and keep possession in our half, good to see.

6433~~~
Memphis has probably been the most pleasing thing about the last week, which is saying something with Rashford bursting onto the scene.

It does seem like he finally gets it and hopefully there's no stopping him from here on. He's got the lot.

6434~~~
Mature performance as many have said. He was up against probably the best full back in the league and although didn't beat him completely, the lad knew he had to be best defensively against Memphis. I think we will see him kick on for the rest of the season

6435~~~
I've never seen such a confidence player. To go from a guy who couldn't kick snow off a rope to the player we saw today in 2 weeks is remarkable. Was real menace today. Long may it continue.

6436~~~
I think it's too soon to say he's tuned a corner, but the last couple of games are promising. Here's to more of that.

6437~~~
Van Gaal has rightly criticised him & has stuck with him & given him chances even when he's left himself & the team down. If you actually look at a lot of comments Van Gaal has made about the lad, you'd retract your post. 

As for the fans & comparing us to those guys who boo'd Ronaldo <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6438~~~
People who wrote him off <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He looks like a player with belief and confidence now. I think he was unlucky (eg against Chelsea) where it seemed his mistake was punished (even though there was a helluva lot that happened after his pass was intercepted, and it was on their edge of the box).

Its good to see him playing like this, and its been a while, where hes had two good games in a row. It seems having a proper LB behind him is a good thing. Having Shaw back long term and I think we will see the true benefit of having Memphis on the left wing for us.

6439~~~
Ok I don't know what is the context of your post is but I just wanna add that all I've seen of him seems to indicate his dribbling ability is more flat track bully ala Ronaldo style than Nani. I.e He destroyed the Midgetland full back but if he comes up against someone, who has decent pace, a simple shift, kick and rush won't do most of the times. 

Not that there's anything wrong with it but he's got to learn the timings of how to exploit that. Eventually he may become a Ronaldo type i.e more of a forward (which is good because we need consistent goal threats) than a winger. 

Either way happy for the lad today. Need more.

6440~~~
He used to take a second to decide what to do whenever the ball came to him. Now he's playing on instinct. It was the same transformation that Nani went through. When their confidence is low, they both overthink things.

The difficult bit will be maintaining this form. It's always easier when the people around you are scoring goals because that takes the pressure off. I want to see him do it when the attackers around him are playing badly. There's a leader in him somewhere. Bringing it out is the next stage in his development.

6441~~~
Hes been brilliant this past week. I just hope he can run with this mental reinvigoration long enough to learn how to keep his level up when hes not so high on confidence. I dont want him to be another Nani.

6442~~~
That bit there. Agreed. I think all the players are benefitting from more freedom tbh. The work rate and enthusiasm the youngsters have brought has rubbed off on the whole team.

6443~~~
gorgeous football, fantastic.

6444~~~
I think this is the biggest change in Memphis the last couple of matches vs. earlier in the season.  He finally seems to be taking what the defender gives him and either going on the outside when they cheat toward central areas or holding it up when they get tight.  He seemed to try to rely on his acceleration and dribbling earlier and neglected the physical side of his game.  Bellerin would've owned him earlier in the season while it was an even matchup today.

If he keeps this up, he is going to be awkward to defend because there aren't many that can run with him <i>and</i> have the strength to give him trouble when he has his back to the goal.

6445~~~
Great performance but about the skill: I often do something like that in the park. It looks brilliant but I'm surprised a lot of professional players don't do it. Volleys are another thing. Everyone talks about how difficult volley's are yet I've always found them so easy.

<span style="color: #ffffff">yeah yeah playing in the park is30 times slower but still. I'm awesome and no one gives me credit for it</span>

6446~~~
These are two good back to back performances. Hope he continues the run. Kept Bellerin quiet and really had good pace to match him. Really re-igniting his season. Hope he continues, so that we do not have to write off his first season

6447~~~
It also seems that the pressure is off for him. He is not playing more freely and producing those tricks and flicks Ronnie used to when he used to play freely. Do not want him to compare him with Ronnie, although Memphis might turn out to be equally important attacker for us

6448~~~
I think people look at certain tricks and deem them unnecessary without even looking at the situation the player is in. The control was outstanding and 100% needed in order to keep the ball in the same trajectory of his run. For me it shows a clear lack of football understanding.

6449~~~
If you bothered to read the posts I made after that, I clearly explained what other alternatives he had. People are judging this from the time the ball reaches him. I am pointing out what he could have done from the moment Mata releases the ball. I am not going to go as far as you and suggest that there is a "Clear lack of football understanding", but I am going to say that I tried to be more circumspect.

6450~~~
All players will struggle to beat good defenders, that's why they are good defenders. What's important to be successful is that when you do find yourself against an opponent that you struggle to beat that you can adapt and change up your strategy and Memphis has all the tools to take his marker out of the equation. As we've seen over the season he can cross, move inside and shoot or link up for example like he did with Marcus yesterday, and nearly had a free scoring opportunity, or hold up play.

6451~~~
I read everything before posting so thanks for assuming I didn't.

6452~~~
So you'd rather have seen an insane piece of skill that pushes him slightly forward and wide than do a slightly less technically challenging first touch that takes it beyond the defender and sprinting forward (unless he's brought down!) to get into a genuine chance creating opportunity ? Ok, thanks for clarifying.

6453~~~
What a bunch of nitpickers.

As for trickery in general, it's lame when it's those pointless step overs Ronaldo used to do which 99% of the time fooled noone , and great when it's that cut back he used to do which was a great way to change direction.

Over the last two games Memphis has more often than not been doing the latter - meaningful trickery. It's an invaluable asset from not many players have this in their armory.

6454~~~
Again you're assuming. Why not just stick to what is written ?

6455~~~
How is this nitpicking ? I admit it was an insane piece of skill. But did it beat a man ? No. Did it result in an opportunity ? No. Did he pass the ball back after that ? Yes. 
It just looked like he wanted to try it at a big stage and kudos to him for doing that. And like AN rightly said, that skill was technically more difficult than what he did on Thursday.  It's just that the notion that was the <b>only</b> thing he could do in that situation that I disagree with.

6456~~~
So I assumed wrong in thinking that what I posted showed a clear lack of footballing understanding according to you ?

All I've been talking about was from the moment, Mata releases the ball, what Memphis <b><i>could</i></b> have done. Unless movement off the ball is not so important nowadays.

6457~~~
He could have done a lot of things in that situation. Given the situation of the game, bringing it down comfortably and pushing the ball out wide into space where Bellerin didn't expect it to go and keeping the ball was a pretty good outcome for us. The ball was slightly behind him too. A lot of assuming happening when people start to claim he could have timed his run differently, could have cut inside and beat his man etc etc. Football is played at a high speed and in the moment he took a fantastic touch into space and gave himself time.

6458~~~
His jedi touch is helping me forget about that acrobatic header into the path of our goal earlier this season.

6459~~~
<a class="username" data-user="97925, @Ijazz17" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/97925/">@Ijazz17</a> And you said it was "unnecessary". No skill is necessary really when you think about it. Calling an effective one that brought a pass that in the moment was behind (he didn't set to be ahead of the ball when he made his run/Mata hit his pass if that's what you're claiming) down comfortably and kept it in play and gave himself time on the ball, unecessary, is nit-picking. If it had served zero purpose like some tricks do then I'd agree. In the moment it was quite a good choice.

6460~~~
You know what ? I wanna apologize for being an arse <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>. I'm not usually like that.
To be serious I think there are different things he could have done with the ball of course (as you described in details) but I understood the logic meant behind his control and I loved seeing it. I also think it wasn't unnecessary at all. It served a purpose.

6461~~~
Yeah, totally agree. But when I raised the "unnecessary" comment, AN said his touch ensured a more attacking outcome (Which wasn't the case at all) and that was the only way to deal with that situation. The only point I am trying to make is runs off the ball are just as important too. How often we praise players for those darting late runs into the box, or how their movement shakes off a defender etc. It is clearly an important aspect of the game as well. I just wanted to highlight other alternatives which <b>could </b>have ensured an even more threatening goal scoring opportunity. Hence my use of the word unnecessary.

Ok, maybe it is a little nit-picking, I admit. But it didn't exactly serve a purpose either. If he had stalled and just brought it under his control like any normal situation or done that, the outcome would have been the same is it not ? Bellerin was still tight to him at the end of the skill if I am not mistaken, forcing him back. But it was still a spectacular sight  to watch (And that photo someone posted is absolutely insane, it's going to be my walllpaper for sure)

6462~~~
Ah, right. In that case we mostly agree. You can ignore my next post!

6463~~~
Fair enough. And for what it's worth, I loved seeing it too <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6464~~~
I'd say the opposite. He seems freer and more confident, but he's one of the most experienced players in our attack these past couple of days so there would be even more pressure on him to raise his game. Not really sure what to make of that.

6465~~~
How can people say anything negative about that skill! Football is entertainment and skilful players will always be the most entertaining in my book so long as they can do it consistently and in meaningful ways. Did Memphis need to control the ball in that way? No, but I'm sure as hell glad he did because it's one of the best pieces of skills I've ever seen and highlights yet again just how good this kid could be.

6466~~~
This reminds me of the time when people were giving Lamela grief for scoring a ridiculous goal in the EL because he could have done it the normal way. As long as the skill comes off, players should be applauded for their inventiveness.

6467~~~
It wasn't just trickery for the sake of trickery either. It was a high ball. If he controls that on his chest, he has to stop and break stride. He's flicked that in to his own path whilst barely breaking the momentum of his run. Perhaps if it was any other full back, Memphis could have killed it with his chest, but Bellerin is lightning and he'd have recovered. He's used the heel flick to his advantage and continues his run to get a run on the full back.

Glad to see Memphis is full of beans again. Those writing him off, saying he should never play for the club again were way too OTT. His performances deserved criticism, but not to the point of just giving up on him completely.

6468~~~
Are you not entertained? No pleasing some people,  you guys just want to watch boring football?

6469~~~
seems to be a lot of praise for his "defensive showing." But tell me, is the combination of his defensive and offensive offering good enough to keep Ashley Young out of the side I wonder?

6470~~~
Maybe not for now, but if you look at the potential he has, it might be worth it to play him in the long run, but that's based on his current form. If he plays like he did a few months ago, Young has to be the clear starter.

6471~~~
Woody sign this fcuker up <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.redcafe.net/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" src="http://www.redcafe.net/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png"/>

6472~~~
I can fully appreciate your thinking. Ashley young has a ceiling. We have seen it. As far as premiership wingers go, its not outstanding. Memphis MAY have more potential, but then he may not. Difficult to gauge. I guess its a toss up. Ashley Young based on last seasons form? Or give Memphis the opportunity to see show us how much he can improve?

6473~~~
If we still think that Ashley Young is the way forward then boy are we in shit

6474~~~
Very mature performance, something which I have not seen in him until recently. Looks like he is working hard and will get better. Happy to have him keep his place

6475~~~
Brilliant to see him follow-up his display against Midtjylland with another good performance against Arsenal.

He seems to have realised that hard work is crucial to success in the Premier League. There was one moment in the later stages where he waves his arms around imploring Januzaj to get back quicker. I thought I was seeing things!

Memphis, Rashford, Lingard and Martial have the potential to become an incredible quartet.

6476~~~
Totally forgot about young to be honest. It's going to be along time before he makes his way back into training anyway, but once he does return, I still think Memphis will keep his place (Provided his resurgence continues). But I am more worried of what will happen when both Martial and Rooney return.

6477~~~
The quicker we move on from Young (as an attacker), the better.

6478~~~
Really hope that what we are currently seeing is the turning point of his career in Manchester United. The lad obviously has it, it's just the matter of getting the attitude set. Really wish that he'll get his confidence up and high and finish the season in great form.

6479~~~
People assuming young is a winger in this United team have no understanding of tactics. 

Up until this week we didn't even have a striker who looked like he could head a goal in and people are wondering if we should be playing Ashley Young?  Come on.  He is a wing back for all the reasons he is a winger and he is so far away from being a forward.

6480~~~
Imagine calling a piece of skill "unncecessary" - you want to be entertained, then a player does that, and all you can say is that it was unnecessary, like seriously, ask yourself if football is for you. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6481~~~
Think how disgusting our front four could be if they all reach their potential; Martial, Rashford, Januzaj and Memphis, that'd be grim for opposition defences.

6482~~~
It's fair to say bellerin is one of the best fullbacks in the league but because Memphis was showing great movement and attacking intent all game it completely neutralised any sort of attacking threat from bellerin.

If you're going on work rate then Ashley Young still has the upper hand in that but tbh going forward (if he continues) then Memphis gets the better of him now. 

Luke shaw can't come back fast enough they could have a great partnership on the left side.

6483~~~
Showing the performance he did yesterday shows flexibility in his game. Against FC he was running the show attacking the full back none stop as he will probably be able to replicate against lesser full backs in our league. Against the Arse he showed maturity and the willingness to be a leader against the best RB in the league (arguably) where he came out on top and he became a calming influence in the frantic times Arsenal were trying to push us and defensively, well it's already been said how fantastic it was in this thread. These last two performances were special in two very different ways, has a <b>lot </b>more to him than any of us gave him credit for, even his biggest supporters. Long may this continue.

6484~~~
It's a weird argument to be having, who cares how else he could have brought it down, the way he did was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6485~~~
If we're talking Young, stick him on the right ahead of Lingard. Has the defensive work rate but can beat his man often.

6486~~~
Ashley youngs best games under Van Gaal have been on the wing. He has also performed to a higher level than Memphis in the premier league, whilst playing on the wing. He has been often asked to fill in or cover at wing back when other players are injured. We don't play with wing backs

6487~~~
I'm not convinced by the bolded part. For me Memphis is still unproven in England. He needs to be a consistent threat for him to justify that claim. Young consistently causes his fullback problems. he has games when his crossing his awful and he isn't a goal threat but he does the basic winger stuff consistently. Beat man. get to the by-line. Fling crosses in

6488~~~
Last 2 games memphis has done that, that's why I said if he continues with this mentality and attitude he seems to have adapted now he will become one of the best wingers in the league. Whether he can continue we can only wait and see.

6489~~~
Innit.

Anyway, for some players the skill is natural, in that it's not a conscious decision to 'do a bit of skill here', and something more ordinary would require a conscious choice to reign themselves in.  Better to let them do their thing.

6490~~~
Well Ashley Young's not good enough to be a winger for us, so I'd bloody hope so.

6491~~~
Showed a lot of maturity in his play yesterday even if he wasn't as electrifying as he as in EL. The fact that he was able to take Bellerin, one of the fastest defenders to the byline was great -  he needs to make sure he establishes that in each game because it will set him up for his strength - the cut inside and open up for shots. Defenders won't be able to cheat and frustrate him as he has been most of the season. 

Also, should be able to help create more against the regular teams because our fullback will be able to support him more and just like yesterday, when we keep that threat down the left up, if we can then get switched to the right, there will be acres of space for the those over there. 

Really really looking forward to seeing him continue in this vein for the rest of the season.

6492~~~
It's a great week for him and we should all be encouraged by it. I do think he's responded to having the responsibility of being the main attacker. I think he's run out for the under 21's was the start of the upturn and again responded well to being the leader in many ways. Some people hide from responsibility and others grow with it....

6493~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/SCdP0GF.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/SCdP0GF.jpg"/> 
I'm starting to really like him!

6494~~~
Love when he boy'd off Alexis in the second half. He's like a bull.

6495~~~
During the Midgetland game, the BT commentator mentioned something about Giggs having been doing a lot of one-to-one work with him lately.

Any source for this?

Interesting if true. For all the Giggs naysayers, as a specialist coach for wingers/wide forwards, there can't be many more suited.

6496~~~
That's the photo he picked? You'd think he'd have gone for one a bit more flattering...

6497~~~
United kit with a fancy angle of the OT crowd, looking like he's working hard? Not a bad choice

6498~~~
And Welbz. He's a tank.

6499~~~
You just have to wonder how our season would have been if Memphis and the 2016 Rooney had turned up earlier on.

6500~~~
At this point, I'd take the 2016 Rashford over the 2016 Rooney tbh.

6501~~~
Memphis confirmed it himself in one of his recent interviews.

6502~~~
Not for me. Lingard has shown the end product in his first season which Young hasn't in his various seasons for us.

6503~~~
Has something like 3 goals and 3 assists in his last 6/7 matches, he doesnt play very well all the time but he's very valuable. He isnt even playing as lm, or am, those are his best positions.

6504~~~
He just doesn't have the speed at the moment to play like he did in Holland, but he's adjusting, turning on the turns and twists instead of powering through. It's looking better, and he's surging past on the outside a lot more. He has a decent cross with his left, I think he could be an assist king, but he likes to score.

6505~~~
This, it's easy to underrate Lingard's contributions but it's goals and assists that win matches not how often you can beat your man especially if you proceed to to wild balls which none of our strikers can reach.

6506~~~

6507~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>. The way he cushioned that after doing that mid-flight skill was just as amazing.

6508~~~
Young is a full back now.

6509~~~
He's taken plenty of stick this season, but I've always felt that he's got everything he needs to be a success here. He's making more sensible decisions on the ball and seems to be utilizing his considerable mass and power in a more productive way. He's been playing with his back to goal a lot more to lay the ball off to teammates, and I'm astonished that he hadn't been doing from the start, because he's a big guy that's hard to shake off the ball. Watch closely and you'll also see that he frequently shrugs off tackles that would cause other players to go to ground, which is not something that can be said for a lot of players in this league. 

A long ways to go yet for Memphis and his teammates, but he's on the right track alright. He'll do himself and that famous shirt justice, I'm sure of it.

6511~~~
Replace him with Lingard at half time please. Having a mare and I think Jesse gives us much better balance.

6512~~~
Normal brain dead service resumed.

6513~~~
He can not get past his man without pulling of outrageous moments of skill and that is unfortunately hard thing to do with a high success ratio. Martial would have blazed by these chimps a few times slready and created some havoc.

Nice that our best player is shunted to the right and we play 2 match heroes in his favorite and most effectife positions

6514~~~
Because he's been breezing by his man all day there on the left? When it comes to dribbling it doesn't matter what side of the pitch you're on. Our front three have all been poor with Martial the worst of the bunch. Unfortunately we don't have anyone on the bench to change things up.

6515~~~
Hasn't even got the ball enough. Don't know what people expect him to do when Mata and Herrera have misplaced easy passes to the front 3.

6516~~~
Of course it matters what side you're on when it comes to dribbling. Christ wtf is that post, do you play football?

6517~~~
Dont be moronic, you beat a man by being unpredictable, having the ability to go either way is what makes a great dribbler, you can cut in or go on the outside on either wing, it's the end product that becomes more difficult. Do you even watch football?

6518~~~
Candid ThePie - Just One of those days

And that is exactly why inside wingers exist like Robben and Messi. They are more unpredictable and effective when they can cut inside on their stronger foot because of the threat of a better shot. It might have been dfferent if Martial is a traditional winger and comfortable hugging the line. He isn't and that is why he isn't comfortable dribbling there. As has been proven time and again. 

Pm me when you need another football lesson. I'll youtube it for you. Moron.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6521~~~
Tell us all we need to know about your football knowledge!

6522~~~
Of course it makes a different what side you are dribbling depending on what foot you dribble with. how good was Giggs on the Right Wing? from my memory not that great because he likes to solely whip in crosses. On the other side, inside wingers are particularly dangerous because you show them your inside, they will shoot, show them the line and its yo ass cos they can probably cross well enough on weaker foot.

6523~~~
OK let me back track a little, it has some influence when you're on the edge of the opposition box but Martial hadn't been in that position in the fist half, picking the ball up a little further back or a little more central and it's just as different patch of grass.

6524~~~
He's cut in a few times, and had opportunities to shoot but passed up on them today. Take the fecking shot Memphis.

6525~~~
He did take a couple earlier on and they were bloody atrocious!

6526~~~
Herrera off and this mook left on. Unbelievable.

6527~~~
Actually think he's done okay.

6528~~~
Fairly terrible tonight. I was furious when he pulled rank on Mata for the first free kick. I don't want to see that happen again. He needs to wind his neck in and earn that privilege.

6529~~~
Memphis Delaythecorners

6530~~~
Wasnt awful, but not good either, poor performance in general. Quite disappointed with that.

6531~~~
Thought he was decent. Still feel like he lacks the explosion to get past players consistently.

6532~~~
best thing he did was keep the ball in the corner a couple of times today. otherwise... pretty bad, unfortunately.

6533~~~
Wasn't great by any means but at least he 's no longer a complete defensive liability.

6534~~~
I think our attacking Unit as a whole was poor. Memphis wasn't great but Martial was also poor so im not sure what to think there.

6535~~~
He was decent in that regard. 

Watford are a physically strong team and they press hard. Memphis admits that he struggles in these games. He needs to come to terms with that. At this point though I don't think we should sacrifice Martial for him.

6536~~~
Nyom had a good game, and is a solid RB in general. Always stands tall against his opposite number. Memphis couldn't get the better of him, and it was too clustered in the middle to cut in. I think he should have gone to the right and stayed on his stronger foot, and let Martial go round the outside on the left where he is best.

Memphis was alright though. Good to see him doing the defensive work and digging in when needed. No luck in attack, but we've seen worse from him.

6537~~~
I'd put Martial back out on the left again. Not good enough from Depay tonight.

6538~~~
Unreal time wasting. Up there with Fellaini vs Olympiakos.

6539~~~
Was alright, shooting was very off though.

6540~~~
A lot of room for improvement. Not worried at all, just needs time.

6541~~~
This

6542~~~
He has proved his genuine talent in the past 4 games.  

I like his fearlessness with dribbling and shooting.

With the right playmates and some confidence he could become quite some player.

6543~~~
That time wasting routine <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6544~~~
Though he had an average game. But his performance is so dependent on confidence. 

If you rewind and watch his first few involvements in the game, he was decent getting past his man. But he skewed his shots and crosses all horribly wide (the wind was a factor) and lost a bit of belief in there because of that, which clearly showed in his less fanciful footwork and output for the rest of the half. Was anonymous till we scored the goal after which he was a strong presence again, especially at the corners.

He's very good when he tries the outrageous, and gets even better when it works, but if it doesn't, his confidence drops and he becomes anonymous for a while.

6545~~~
If only Memphis could play vs Dutch league RB every game. Martial back on the left please. I don't feel Depay has done remotely enough to challenge his spot

6546~~~
As Han said to Luke after shooting down a couple of TIE fighters, don't get cocky kid!

6547~~~
That was the biggest thing I noticed. He's now tracking back and putting in a good shift defensively. Most positive thing from his performance today IMO.

6548~~~
Pretty average performance imo, same as Martial.

6549~~~
He just stood like a rock and they couldn't move him an inch. Did it on our, as well as their corner flag. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6550~~~
Eh - still showed a lot to me even if it didn't come off as it has last couple games. He needs to keep his place because he still puts the opposition on the backfoot.

6551~~~
Not a great performance, but atleast he's showing he cares and wants to work for it. Hope he can close out the season on a high note and start the next one with confidence. Still firmly believe he can make it at Old Trafford.

6552~~~
Not more than Martial can on the LW. just think back to some of Martials LW performances. mouth watering

6553~~~
Yea that Belerin is well shit...

6554~~~
I have a feeling that he is close to finding back to his form last year. When he start hitting the target he will be a constant threat.

6555~~~
hardly destroyed him offensively though did he?

6556~~~
He had a bad day against a good defending RB, but he kept his head in the game and that's still progress from where he was. Need to keep playing him. I think he's something of an enigma even to himself.

6557~~~
Martial is better suited down the middle long term anyway and Martial also doesn't offer as much of a shooting threat. Rather we start playing with that in mind since Memphis is finally starting to show a lot of why we brought him here.

6558~~~
He has some good upper body strength to hold off the defenders.

6559~~~
He kept the ball off of Watford for like 2-3 minutes total in the final 15.

6560~~~
Not good but getting better..
Thing is he looked like he wanted it the whole game, just didn't happen for him..  Onward and upwards or something..

6561~~~
His quads are beastly. 

Not as good as the last few, probably suffered as United overall played really poorly and they doubled up on him when he did get the ball, so he couldn't do much. We played at a much slower tempo then the other games and he's just not suited to that. Memphis, and everyone else in our attack is more suited to a counter attacking style. Our only good period in that game was when we played more direct and counter attacking rather then the patient, safe build up that we did for most of the season.

6562~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That was fecking brilliant. Nyom couldn't move him and tried overleaping him instead <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6563~~~
This.

Maybe Martial is not 100% yet. Rashford playing 3 games straight in a week with no prior experience before that? Memphis the same apart from the experience. Surely one or two of the players needed a rest after the big game last time. Then again, the next 10 games plus other cup games would be a "final" for United this season.

6564~~~
Looked tired and jaded tbh. Think he should be rested next match and Lingard should start (then use him as a sub). Keep em fresh with the games coming up fast.

6565~~~
Just another bad hair day at the office really, but the result counts the most! Nothing exciting, pretty nerve wrecking especially at the back but they got stuck in, tried their best to fight for it which is good enough on days like this. It is when they don't fight for anything that would get on my nerves the most. 

WBA next? Have to watch for the rejuvenated Berahino.

6566~~~
Said this in another thread, but I was happy at least he was trying to do stuff when others were fannying about doing bugger all - particularly in the first half. Didn't really come off for him, but I appreciated the effort. He also did get fouled a fair bit to be fair to him.

He was great at helping us see the game out at the end (twice in a row that is) so I definitely commend him for that. He's at least being useful these days, which is far more then you can say about his early season form.

6567~~~
It will come together. 

He's running at players and getting to the line. We know he can shoot and he can pass (I think he's heavily underrated here). It will all come good.

6568~~~
Just about the whole team was pretty much very poor today

6569~~~
Some of you guys are way too harsh. The team overall didn't play, we didn't attack well and it's hard for him too. Didn't link up with Rojo that well, which is understandable considering they haven't play with each other much. 

Watford's right back had a good game, they doubled up on him but he still had a decent game. He tried, he worked hard and made himself available. He didn't go hiding, that's important.

6570~~~
His league form is extremely worrying. I don't quite expect him to perform like he did against the midgets but his attacking contribution is basically zero. Needs to figure out a way  to beat full backs without needing to be in acres of space to run into.

6571~~~
God he's bad at shooting <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

6573~~~
Wasn't great - but wingers are always going to be inconsistent. The difference to his poor game today Compared to earlier this season was huge - things didn't work wel for him attacking wise but he kept his head up and worked very hard defensively. (To be fair to him, none of the attack did well for most of the game - Watford were very well organized and worked very hard)

Two turning points for me was when he made a poor pass near the end and didn't let his head drop, and his ability to waste time. The Chelsea mistake seems to be the turning point and he was come out as a better player ever since.

6574~~~
I think some people here expect too much of him. Hes young, and in his first year in a new league, of course he is going to be inconsistent. Actually, singling out any player after this game seems harsh, since the collective performance was poor by pretty much everyone.

The only player who was really good was Schneiderlin. MOTM by a mile

6575~~~
Memphis is a player on the up. Wasn't a great game last night but he contributed defensively and didn't let his head drop. The difference between his performance last night and earlier in the season is very encouraging

6576~~~
People on this forum are trying their best to beat down on Depay as much as possible. I mean he had an alright game but reading the comments in here you would think he had a shocker. There are 2 sides to a game - he didn't do well offensively but his defensive effort was good.

6577~~~
Average performance, good effort at least. Was a bit too predictable but kept trying things, though can rely on the flashy stuff too much. His FKs have been atrocious though. Can't remember him ever even hitting the target for us, never mind scoring one.

6578~~~
Interesting point. I actually felt it was the time when he played for the U21s (The game Keane score 5 in and I think it was right after that Chelsea game too). I expected him to be lazy and not show enough importance to the match, but I was wrong. He treated it with the same sort of respect, he would any game. He's done a lot better since then. Psychologically, he has upped his game massively.

6579~~~
The one that hit Martial's head was brilliant and the keeper wouldn't have saved it

6580~~~
Absolutely agree. Even though not everything is coming off but the general attitude and spirit is completely different. It's good to see and shows that he's improving a lot

6581~~~
Anyone know the exact rule on this?  To me it looks like Memphis us obstructing

6582~~~
From memory, the u21 game came after the Chelsea game - but I may be wrong. I'm absolutely loving how he pulled himself together after that - I hope he continues to improve as he has a lot of potential.

6583~~~
It's only considered obstruction if you're not in control of the ball (or unable to gain control of it). IIRC, Memphis was the one who stopped the ball there, and is simply using his strength and balance to prevent the Watford players from reaching it. As long as he's not using any dirty tricks, such as elbowing, pinching, stomping, hip-checking (to borrow a hockey term) or something, he's operating within the rules.

6584~~~
Arsenal on Sunday. First half from wide left. Fizzed through the crowd of players. Forced a good save from Cech.

6585~~~
I must be watching different game than,
I think he has played well and try to force issue which most of players not able to do it.
His final ball didn't come off but he was very positive in game which is good.

6586~~~
Besides playing better overall, the most noticeable thing for me has been his improved work-rate. Really came through when we needed to protect the lead last night, kept the ball so well.

6587~~~
His final ball wasn't great as was his shooting but his defensive effort and work rate was a pleasure to see.

6588~~~
Its nice to see hes getting a little more time in this thread now and thats because he has picked up and improved on where he was earlier in the campain. His defending in particular has come on tho I still dont feel thats natural to him. Hopefully against West Brom we see him pick up another level again and continue kicking on.

6589~~~
Im really worried about his shooting for us, his shooting used to be his biggest strength before this season, was it free kicks, long range, cutting inside like Robben, but now most of them go completely over or just wide, poor free kicks as well. Okay maybe they set up the wall better in the PL than in the Eredivisie, but most of his free kicks arent even a bit threatening. Wondering if has got something to do with his new boots or the PL ball, seems unlikely but it's really strange.

6590~~~
He has been putting in more matured performances. Work rate and attitude has been solid.

6591~~~
He has an average game and people want him dropped after being arguably Man of the Match for the last few games.

Stupidity at it's finest.

6592~~~
thanks

6593~~~
The patchy form we're seeing right now is what most would have expected him to be like from the beginning of his career here. He's still only 22. Matches of brilliance, mixed with performances last night where he's still looked sharp enough to stay in the team.  His form for the majority of the season however has been diabolical, but let's hope that stream of piss is now behind him and we keep seeing this Depay.

6594~~~
It really is shocking, isn't it? Some fans are just so incredibly fickle.

6595~~~
Good call, that was well-worked

6596~~~
I think it's the only one though. Which is annoying. Watching his highlight reel from last season, he's scored a good few free kicks, and hit the target with many. It's weird how he's lost that so far.

6597~~~
I must have watched a different game, I thought Memphis played ok

6598~~~
In those highlight reels, the quality of the keepers was very average and the positioning was also weird. Many of his freekicks just sneaked in through (Except maybe the last one he scored for PSV, that was a belter, but keeper's positioning din't help). He hasn't lost that touch so far. He's probably not got enough opportunities so far. And I think in terms of FK's, Mata is still better in terms of accuracy. Memphis for pace.

6599~~~
Won a free-kick and made a foul throw, I think that was his contribution.

6600~~~
He was never given the ball to do anything with it.

6601~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if he was left feeling a bit disheartened today anyway. Finally finds form and then finds himself back on the bench.

6602~~~
He wasn't very good the last match. He excelled vs Mydtjylland and was good in a team effort type of way vs Arsenal. I wouldn't see him as someone who definitely needs to play every game yet.

6603~~~
Yeah, let's not start acting as if he's undroppable. Playing well against Midgetland doesn't guarantee you a long term place in the team, as you said he worked well in a team effort way against Arsenal but against Watford back to the Memphis of old.

He's had a rest and now we go to Anfield, let's see how he handles that.

6604~~~
he did nothing but you can't expect anything in those circumstances with us moving the ball about like it's a medicine ball. the decision to drop him today was a cowardly one from LvG. No chance to play into form at all. At least he offers some degree of creativity.

6605~~~
He'll be happy for Lingard that he got his place back, I'm sure.

6606~~~
Should have come on a long time before he did. But then its madness, we bring him on but dont bring on Fellaini, the one time it would be acceptable.

6607~~~
We has dropped because he can't cope with this kind of game. He would have made no difference. West Brom were tight and aggressive and depay's lack of pace of the mark and ability to operate in tight spaces is beyond poor. He even threw a false throwing, maybe he wants to be Nani after all. This guy would destroy the Italian league, alas, we are in England.

6608~~~
Literally did nothing but lose the ball for 15 minutes.

6609~~~
Memphis is a confidence player, and the problem with Van Gaal is that considering he is meant to be his 'mentor', he has managed Memphis terribly in the fact that when he has played well and got full confidence LVG seems to be drop him again and disrupting his rhythm. I'm still very disappointed in Memphis generally, but he hasn't been helped, maybe a different manager can make more of him.

6610~~~
He isn't a confidence player. Give him space and time and he is excellent. Put him under a press and he doesn't have the turn of pace or control in tight spaces to be effective. At this point he is too easy to mark out of the game, in the Premier League I mean. Added to tha he is too greedy and you have a limited player. He thinks he is CR7 seemingly, entitled to centre stage of freekicks when Mata should be taking them. He is an arrogant man without that productivity to back it up. He is in the big leagues now. He has to be humble if he wants to improve.

6611~~~
Just Not impressed with Memphis. Yeah it was a tough situation to come in and play well, but his only impressive performances have been vs minnows.

6612~~~
Quite possibly the worst attacker in the world in his own half?

6613~~~
Brain dead challenge from a brain dead footballer. Whether soft or not, first his failure to track the run then the stupidity to make the challenge.

6614~~~
back to sh!T then

6615~~~
Seemed determined to foul him. Pulled his arm and tripped him. Just dumb.

6616~~~
Wish he'd feck off back to Holland. The guy is a jinx. Mistake waiting to happen.

6617~~~
Starting to wonder if he is a significant defensive liability.

6618~~~
Clyne went to the ground easilu but a really braindead action from him, stupid goal to give away, has been shite today as well. Back to his old self earlier in the season.

6619~~~
One game against minnows doesn't change he's been very poor this season.

6620~~~
Not that it's good but he played decent at least vs Shrewsbury, Midjtylland twice and Arsenal, nowhere near enough tho.

6621~~~
The pen was soft but his reaction to the pen was just as bad for me. Watch the replay from behind the ball, Memphis has his hands on his hips as Sturridge is stepping up to take it. All the United players around him are reacting and he is just sitting there watching. If De Gea saved or hit the post and came back to play, a Liverpool player could have walked past him and tapped it in.

His attitude sucks big time for me.

6622~~~
He's a pretender.  When the going gets tough he goes missing.  We have too many players like this right now and I'm sick of it.

6623~~~
Unlucky to give away the pen, the contact started outside the box so it should have been a free kick

6624~~~
He's effectively playing as a wingback... which is ridiculous when you think about it

6625~~~
Created our only hint of a chance in the first minute. He is one of the few who can create something in this team. Some here are desperate to have a go at him.
 Our midfield is just non existant, he's man marking Nathaniel Clyne ffs and suffering from it.
In a team so dire in chance creation and imagination, I have plenty of time for someone who actually could offer those things.

6626~~~
Yeah, it's really weird how deep he is. There were several times when Martial was on the left wing and I was thinking Memphis surely must be upfront then. Nope. Same wing, just 30 meters behind.

6627~~~
Soft pen full stop. He's not been great but he's in a queue of many....

6628~~~
The difference in talent between a guy like him and Ronaldo is that Memphis just don't fecking know how to deal with things when he's in a down period. Ronaldo would at least show some anger. Memphis is thinking he's on the street with a bunch of girls watching him and tries to play cool when his shit don't work. I've said it several times before - this guy is fool's gold.

6629~~~
How many times does he play terrible hospital passes to his teammates?

6630~~~
Think he's been better 2nd half but not good enough man. Shame that he's lost his bit of momentum again

6631~~~
For all the negative attention he's received here he's still created our two best moments in this game. For all his ability Martial has been terrible recently. Goes to show how much slack you get if you're likeable.

6632~~~
Martial has been terrible but I feel Depay's glaring weakness is his slow reactions and the time he needs to do anything. At the top level he just can't handle the pace IMO. I don't see that changing too much. Regarding Martial though, he is being sacrificed for the one dimensional Depay.

6633~~~
He came closest to creating a goal out of anyone. 

Twice.

6634~~~
He was shite but attackers always will be when your midfield are incapable of giving you the ball.

6635~~~
Clutching at straws. He is just one of many not good enough for this club. Martial is a more dangerous and effective player on the left IMO.

6636~~~
Martial did feck all squared tonight. 

Memphis was crap, too, but he could still have come away with 2 assists. 

He's an easy scapegoat and gets far more grief than he deserves compared to others.

6637~~~
Played at left back in the first half, tried his best in the second but it was too late at that point. Nowhere near one of our worst performance on the night though.

6638~~~
I think there's a hell of a lot more we can expect from both Martial and Memphis. We aren't playing to their strengths and predictably they're both struggling.

They're both crying out for a 4-3-3 with a fluid front three like we did with Ronaldo, Rooney and Tevez and what Barca are currently doing. Neither can defend, just leave them up there.

6639~~~
He wasn't the worst but he isn't a Man Utd player IMO. Wrong league for him.

6640~~~
Not that I'm going to slate him tonight because I can't be arsed and there's no point actually but you do realise that he gave them a fecking idiotic penalty which somewhat shaped the game, right?

6641~~~
He should have been sent off for that as well. Clyne made the most of it but Depay was very silly to give him the opportunity.

6642~~~
Nah, he's shown enough to give him time. He'll come good.

It'll help having a manager who knows what he's doing. 

It was never a penalty in a million years.

6643~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck me. I'm out.

6644~~~
I'm not discussing whether it was a penalty or not, the ref's been a soft ass cnut and well can agree on that, but the way he's 'defended' there, it was just fecking moronic and in the end ended up with a penalty.

6645~~~
Clyne was through on goal no?

6646~~~
He's turned so many corners in his <i>progression</i> that he's gone backwards.

6647~~~
No.

6648~~~
Wait, what?

6649~~~
Feck me he's shite!

Vanishes against anyone decent.

6650~~~
Terrible  performance. 

His mini renaissance is already over.

6651~~~
That was hopeless, he couldn't run Clyne at all and only looked half interested.

6652~~~
Wish he'd stop being so defensively shit.

6653~~~
SAF would have them bumming teams, sigh...

6654~~~
Poor. I just worry because he's been really poor against opposing full-backs unless they're minnows. He can't get past players.

I don't think he's suited to a possession based system though. He needs space. A lot of our players are the same.

6655~~~
He was shit but so were all of our attackers and our midfielders were non existant which didn't help.

6656~~~
Like I've said through out the season, can't beat a man to save his life.

6657~~~
Yep. And defenders know that.

6658~~~
I thought the early moment and cross was going to give him confidence to bully Clyne but it turned out to be his only real highlight.

6659~~~
He doesn't even try 90% of the time. All he is thinking about it turning back and going inside most of the time. Defending him is easy, show him the inside and he will take it and run into a bunch of other players.

6660~~~
It's ridiculous how shit he is at beating players and dribbling in general.

6661~~~
Think he's a poor signing and we should make a decision in the summer. You can call me names if you wish.

6662~~~
He did Clyne in the first 15 seconds. From that point on I don't remember him receiving the ball in a position where he could have another go.

I thought he did alright the few times he received it. Could have had a couple of assists tonight.

6663~~~
Problems are treating than any single player. Aside DDG it's a struggle to suggest who's worthy of the shirt....

6664~~~
Don't you just love his shots that go closer to the corner flag than the goal <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6665~~~
He's shit at everything we thought he was good at.

6666~~~
Wingers are supposed to be nimble and quick and unpredictable. He's neither of those things. Even if he's trying to be an inverted winger, ala Robben, he doesn't have the necessary skills to do so. I'm struggling to think how he's going to be a success here if he carries on like this.

6667~~~
And for someone who was considered one of the best dead ball specialists last year, he's been absolutely wank with his free kicks for us.

6668~~~
Did his renaissance last 2 games?

90% of the season, he has been below average and I am not sure if he has the footballing intelligence to ever be a top player.

6669~~~
As long as he plays against sub standard players (like those from Midgetland or Shrewsbury), he is fine.
He dominated the Dutch league, by playing against lesser players.
However, in the EPL, against better players, he gets found out very quickly.

6670~~~
How many times this season have his defensive mistakes resulted in us conceding a goal? Crazy that a winger can be responsible for so many defensive errors but he somehow does it.

6671~~~
Was always amazed at how many people listed him among the core part of our future.He'll improve but hell no.

6672~~~
Didn't watch the game so guess he's back to being shit.  I agree with some comments here that he is ill suited to playing this ridgid and is much better with space on the counter attack.  His lazy attitude is not helping either.  Looking like a bust but guess we will need to give him until next January to truly find out.  If Maureen does come in though he's probably looking at the bench.

6673~~~
Was anointed the best young talent in Europe in the summer. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Rafael was sent to the reserves for much less of a crime and eventually sold in the summer. Wonder where he'll be send for the mistake last night.

6674~~~
That potential break in the second half when he had acres of space ahead of him but couldn't accelerate clear of a guy who had given him a ten yard start was just painful to watch. He can't: run, cross, shoot, pass, dribble, tackle, defend nor attack a semi decent opposition. What's he really good for?

I am struggling to see what his redeeming qualities are at this moment in time. If £25mil plus gives you such a shower of shit, there really is no point in trusting the management with spending a dime.

6675~~~
Should have known something was wrong if he was on Brendan's radar

6676~~~
Pathetic performance. Laughable how he completed 90 minutes.

6677~~~
Keeps on reminding me of Anderson in that i'm still waiting to see something from him but it never materialises .

6678~~~
George Best once said of David Beckham;

"He can't kick with his left foot, he cannot head a ball, he cannot tackle and he doesn't score many goals. Apart from that he's all right."

He must be spinning in his grave watching Memphis wearing the #7. 
The kid is Nani in disguise. 
His shooting is embarrassing, actually cringeworthy.

6679~~~
He's ill suited to playing for United.

Unfortunately his performances against the midgets and Brugge has probably earned him one more season of crappy performances at the club.

6680~~~
This guys is lazy never even bothered to run even after loosing the ball,he needs some strong word from someone, lack of leadership in field doesn't helping it either.

6681~~~
For me it just beggars belief how you can give up on him so quickly. He at least created two decent openings, a whole lot more than any other player in the side. He had very few, if any good opportunities to take on Clyne in this game. We just weren't working as an attacking side yesterday. He has shown he has pace, technique and has been working on his defensive side. He was put in attack in the second half, that's why he didn't track back. His instructions were clearly to stay up the field.
I agree with Scholes, it just wasn't a penalty.
You that give him so much flak, you really do deserve van Gaal's, no risk, non-attacking football.

6682~~~
Back to his usual level for me, credit for trying to track Clyne, bit unlucky(and Clyne dived) but was a pen = poor execution of the defensive arts.  Better than some but still piss-poor.

I'd go to 4-4-2 and play him up front just to keep him out of our half.

Back to Holland in the summer, hopefully.

6683~~~
This. In fact, I think it would be hasty to get rid of most of our underperforming/disappointing players this summer. I think a lot of these players could offer something to a better system. We still need investment, of course, but I'm not willing to write players off because they've failed under LvG. Rooney can go though. With him it's more than the system, and Fergie saw it 3 years ago.

6684~~~
He should try to hit something way out of goal. Would probably score some then.

6685~~~
Basically, he's a wing striker. He's not a natural ball carrier, he's not quick on the interchange and doesn't work well with his inside player and he isn't a very good play maker/defensive player. He basically has to have the freedom of staying on the fullback at all times having the game come to him and then be played through or be isolated one on one with the full back to cut and finish or cut and create off the dribble for a shot.

I know it is early days but I really want to see his maturity rise to the top after this season and go home and have a good look at himself and his game. There are serious holes at an elite level and someone who is essentially a striker coming in off the left in the PL is classed as a limited player. 

I think he can improve, but more of that is probably me hoping he can improve.

6686~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6687~~~
You sum him up perfectly. He just doesn't have enough for the top level.

6688~~~
Makes one wish we still had Nani instead as of him

6689~~~
Whilst he should be better, I want to judge him under a new manager with a consistent formation (much like with Morgan and some of our other players).

I do think we will see an improvement when Shaw returns. I truly do believe that. But mostly when a new manager comes in that can help him improve.

6690~~~
It could do I suppose. We are happy to accept that LVG has destroyed everyone else. That said, Memphis seems to have carte blanche to do whatever he wants under LVG. I mean if you miss a penalty you lose that privilege whilst Depay constantly hits shots and free kicks into the Outer Hebrides yet he still does it every game.

6691~~~
I do not blame him for giving away that Penalty. Could have happened to anybody else and seasoned defenders have done a lot of more stupid things in the own box.
However, he has been atrocious again going Forward. Completely useless.
Martial Needs better Players around him.

6692~~~
Except that time he put Martial through and he couldn't control the ball.
He didn't play well but he wasn't atrocious. Infact he also created the other chance for Rashford too

6693~~~
"At the moment", lets hope. I want to see him grow because I think there is talent there, he needs to wise up a little bit though that is for sure. Get out of his own ego a little bit and get into the mode of always wanting to prove and improve.

6694~~~
First season is hard, lots of adjustments, he'd look great in a winning team. 

Bones of a great player are there. Judge him in 24 months.

6695~~~
Is he worth sacrificing Martial on the left for though?

Martial, Rashford/Depay/ Lingard would be more effective IMO.

6696~~~
I think that's the key.

Back in the good days we had the luxury of bringing players (signings or youngsters) into a winning environment.  These days they are surrounded by shit and everybody is looking at them to make the difference.

It's no coincidence that pretty much every signing or youngster brought in for the last couple of years, bar literally one or two, has ultimately disappointed to some degree.

6697~~~
Also no one knows what system we use. Its confusing even for us fans to understand what LVG has in mind let alone the players who have to implement this rubbish. 

At this point I still believe United should buy a quality left winger if they can. However we shouldn't sell Memphis either.

6698~~~
And this is what as a United fan, I find so sad and extremely worrying. Buy a player for £25m, and judge him in TWO YEARS! Within that time we hope that he plays well? Develops? The guy is a poor player. He has sporadic moments when he is slightly above average. That does not mean he is a world-beater in the making. I think he is awful, no brain at all.

This isn't some youngster coming through the ranks and he doesn't carry himself like one. He arrived as an arrogant player, thinking he is the real deal. He looks a country mile away from being close to being a top player and some fans continue to 'wait' for his talent to be realised.

Gibson, Kagawa, Powell, Obertan, Nani, Anderson.... none of them have been good enough for where United should be. Memphis Depay has already joined this motley crew. Mata and Fellani (how embarrassing is he going to continue to be). These players want for nothing and are worshipped when they put on a United shirt. And some of them simply are not good enough. Paul Scholes spoke of standards last night, and he was absolutely spot-on. We are not a flamin' charity, or some 'development project'.

Players aren't good enough right now and the only question in my mind is how quickly can we move them on, because they (as it seems some do not realise...) are taking the club backwards.

Other big clubs change managers and change players.. and they don't capitulate the way we seem to be as a club. let's stop being so sympathetic. We must have played 40 odd games this season and people are STILL suggesting that some players will somehow become some sort of superstar. We have many excellent young players who have emerged in the last couple of seasons. But we also have many players who simply aren't good enough to be wearing a first XI shirt at Manchester United.  Fact.

6699~~~
And who plays through the middle? Earlier in the season we were saying is it worth not playing him through the middle when he was playing so well there...
Anyway my point wasn't that Memphis was great, it was that he was not atrocious, and yes based on that he created our best two chances last night... If there is one player I would want on the end of it, in the middle it would be Martial

6700~~~
Van Gaal knows him and has worked with him before. If anyone should mentor him it should be Van Gaal.

6701~~~
I have said this for a long time now - he's an average player who will do well sometimes against average to below average opposition. He's not a clever footballer and he isn't even pacey.

6702~~~
He needs to put his head down and work his socks off during summer to lose a bit of weight and improve his agility. The talent is there but he really needs to display it soon or he'll be in China next summer.

6703~~~
Maybe, or maybe a new man will give him something new to learn / something to take his game to the next level. Maybe Memphis is too comfy with LVG and a new manager might give him something else to think about.

If Memphis was the one off situation for United, I would maybe agree,but theres too many players who look like theyve regressed or similar once LVG gets his philosophy towards them.

6704~~~
Martial's decline in form has coincided with Depay playing wide left. Martial was our best player and a genuine threat against Premier League teams when he was wide left. Since Rooney has got injured and Depay has taken the left forward position Martial has become invisible.

I would rather play Depay as centre forward. We need our most dangerous attacking player in his best position surely?

Depay would do less damage defensively playing number 9 too.

Failing that play Rashford central and Lingard wide right. Drop Depay altogether.

I just find it crazy that Martial has been shifted from his best position and then Rashford from the CF position where he scored 4 in 2 just to accommodate Depay who can't produce against top opposition.

6705~~~
I'd give him next season to show what he can do after a season of adaptation and under (hopefully) less shambolic management. Although the signs don't look good and, if I had to predict, I'd expect him to be back playing in a minor league in 2017-2018.

6706~~~
Absolutely spot on....

6707~~~
I don't think he is out of form. The worrying thing is he performs well against awful teams. He just is out of his depth.

6708~~~
Is this a joke? We need to start being more ruthless with our transfers. No more allowing players years to "prove themselves" and definitely not when you're paying 25m for them.

6709~~~
25m is nothing in today's market. If we want a fully polished player then we won't get one for that price, it'll be double at least for an attacker.

6710~~~
Sadly I'm starting to think theres some truth in this. 

Even when he kills a right back, like he did Rømer or whatever the feck his name was, it doesn't really scream effortless brilliance in the same way that it does when better players do, it looked like he was having to try very, very, hard and having to bring out the whole repertoire of flicks and tricks just to get past him. Of course, it came off for him that day, 

But aside from that, his end product is just awful. His shooting of late has threatened the linesman more than the goalkeeper, and considering most of his game is based on cutting in and shooting thats a huge worry. And why he's not last in line for free-kicks at the minute I don't know.

He should probably get another year, but he can hardly complain if he doesn't, and when a better player in Januzaj is currently doing absolutely feck all then I'd be inclined to get rid to be honest.

6711~~~
I still don't know why this is constantly used to insult players when trying to call them nothing players.

6712~~~
If the lad arrived like Ronaldo in that team but was performing in this way, then fair comment but come on, who can play even half decent in this team? Even Martial is going the other way.

6713~~~
Bizarre really. Nani was our player of the year and far better than Memphis even on his bad days. Also performed against big clubs.

6714~~~
I'm starting to doubt he's going to make it here, he should start next season on the bench as Martial is better in that LWF position than him.

6715~~~
He needs 3 years to settle here? You do know he's 22

6716~~~
Everyone has been shit, we are collectively shit.

6717~~~
No, just everyone's been crap with the exception of DDG. No point picking out individual performances as it's impossible to play with any confidence when collectively we've been so poor. This is not a Ronaldo scenario joining a team full of quality....if he joined this team at 18, he would have been slaughtered on here

6718~~~
Because to many of us, Nani was a very frustrating, underperforming show-pony with delusions of grandeur and little or no end product 90% of the time.
His rare moments of decent play were too little and too sparse... Just like Memphis to date.

6719~~~
I don't think he'll reach Nani levels. I don't think it's a form thing either. If we played a pub team tomorrow, I'd expect him to have a good game. His game just has serious deficiencies.

6720~~~
Under SAF Nani registered 56 assists in 5 seasons, his end product was alright.

6721~~~
In a team with Ronaldo, Tevez, Berbatov & a potent Rooney. 
He just never consistently performed for me, a trait of Memphis this season.

6722~~~
By "many of us", you actually mean a few who have no idea what they are talking about? Memphis has been here 8 months, lets revisit this when he's been here for 5 years and has had the success that Nani had. The short term'ism on some players is absolutely mind boggling.

6723~~~
I clearly state that I'm judging Memphis "to date" & "his season". Imagine having differing opinions.... Staggering!

6724~~~
That isn't a difference of opinion, nowhere did I offer a contrary version to what you think about Memphis other than giving time to under performing young players is probably a better solution than to jettison. Unless you are referring to the notion that to "many of us Nani was a very frustrating, underperforming show-pony with delusions of grandeur and little or no end product 90% of the time" which I disagree with. But that is not in connection with what I have quoted.

6725~~~
Memphis needs to improve by about a million per cent to deserve comparison with Nani - perhaps not a million tbf, but the reasoning behind the exaggeration is pretty sound

MD is still a fair way behind Anderson for number of decent games too

6726~~~
Agree with this, we need to start being more ruthless with players, incidentally a great characteristic of Diego Simeone (whom I'd love to see here). He's not afraid to pay big for a player and get rid by the next transfer window if the player isn't pulling his weight and it's wielded massive success at Atletico.

But its the whole "United give people time" thing rearing it's ugly head again. Memphis Depay is not a 17 year old amateur who cost peanuts. He's 22 and he cost us almost 30 million and he's been a spectacular failure.
I don't think Memphis is a patch on Nani's first season here, which tells you how horrific Memphis has been. What worries me most is something you touched on, the complete lack of brain, that to go with him being incredibly slow, immobile and having an ego the size of Cristiano Ronaldo.

It's pretty clear we're dealing with a classic case of a flat track bully, I hope the new manager comes in and cuts our losses, this obsession with waiting and waiting and waiting for people to come good has cost us over the years. We saw it with Nani and Anderson, Kagawa, it's now happening with Fellaini. 
Sometimes things don't work out, just let it go, move on.

Big clubs don't do this sort of shite, you saw how ruthless Barcelona were with Zlatan, Atletico with Martinez and Cerci. Real Madrid with an endless list.

6727~~~
Agreed 100%

He did well against Brugge, Midgetland & Shrewsbury.
If memory serves me correct he also scored a goal against PSV (in the first game, I think).
Apart from the these games, I can't think of anything special he has done.

Put it another way. Ronaldo and Rooney at 18 years old were better than Memphis at 22 years old.
The worrying thing for me is that I have seen <i>nothing</i> - and I emphasis the word nothing - from Memphis to suggest he is going to be great.

Sure, if we play League One teams, he'll look great, but against EPL teams/defenders, he is ineffectual.
At present, I feel his level is that of a Championship player. He may get better, but I don't think he will.

In saying all of this, LVG has a history of making attackers look bad, so perhaps Jose can get more out of him.

6728~~~
Well if that's what many believe and that's their reasoning, it's clearly not a very knowledgeable proportion of the fan base. 

Nani's best actually came once both Ronaldo and Tevez had left. He got 10 goals 20 assists in our 19th title season, when even Rooney went AWOL for 2/3 of the season.

6729~~~
I'd give him another season under a better manager to prove himself. If he ends up being underwhelming again then I'd probably pre-emptively ship him away by '17-18'

6730~~~
I think he's been mismanaged from the start. LVG tried to play him in the hole, wanting him to play as Robben did in the world cup. Difference being ones a veteran with a decade of football under his belt and the others a kid, the results were predictable. 

He is now in and out the side but I see no focus to his game, like the rest of the side. I won't judge his potential based on this season.

6731~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6733~~~
He's absolutely useless.

6734~~~
Robben at 21 in the premier league was 100 times better than Memphis. He is not similar to Robben. Robben would run past players with ease. Where as Depay finds it tough.

6735~~~
His dribbling is Heskey-like sometimes.

6736~~~
Been awful vs Prem opposition.

I can't believe he passed up that shot. Opened it up so much for him. Awful decision making.

6737~~~
How is he getting game time over Januzaj?

6738~~~
One of the worst substitute appearances I can ever remember seeing for Utd. He literally fecked up every time he had the ball, it was embarrassing. 

I think the talent is there, but this season he's been a total shambles. Has to improve hugely if he's still here next season.

6739~~~
He played like Obertan when he came on.

6740~~~
"Excellent, I've worked a great opening. Now is my chance to show everyone they were wrong to write me off......but first, I'll drag it back to my weaker foo....crap!"

6741~~~
His decision making is atrocious. Shoots from kilometers away, yet hesitates when he's in a very good position on his right foot.

6742~~~
Once he plays himself a bit in form after months, he will get dropped anyway, just to come on and feck up everything again. Rinse and repeat.

6743~~~
A clown like his manager

6744~~~
Just can't play against Prem oppositions.

6745~~~
He gave us width and a few clever runs, can't fault him for anything.

6746~~~
he fecked up a great chance because he was to cocky....zero brain in the guy.

6747~~~
I don't get the criticism, he was positive with his runs and gave us width, decent cameo.

6748~~~
he's going to be quality - said it before and i'll say it again.  21, first year in a new country with very limited family support / mates, new league etc.  he'll be better than he's shown this season (and don't reply with the usual, "well he couldn't be worse" as we've seen many first years who struggled who came good.  He perhaps needs a manager who isn't shite and wants to hit teams on the break and we'll see a different the reborn version of Elvis and not the latter one in the 70's

6749~~~
He was ok but shouild have took that shot when it opened up for him, I still think things move to quick for him against PL teams.

6750~~~
Useless unless we are playing an extremely shit opposition. The sad part is, that I don't see it turning for him even after this customary adjustment period.

6751~~~
Weird performance. Put in one good cross but more importantly he had this great moment where he did the perfect bit of skill to fool the defense and open up space for the shot, but inexplicably chose to dwell for a few seconds presumably because scoring a winner would have been boring.

His dribbling still comes across as him trying stuff out hoping it works rather than a guy in proper control.

6752~~~
Why was he dropped after a series of good performances?

6753~~~
He did the right things, but it's always that final decision. He had their defenders shitting themselves, but his final touch of the ball is nearly always a terrible one, after he's done all the hard work.

6754~~~
He plays only for himself, trying to emulate his hero Ronaldo.

6755~~~
Agreed with you two.

6756~~~
Had a horrendous few minutes where he actually saw so much of the ball but did so little with it other than one decent cross. 

Still haven't given up on him but hard to see how he can deliver on his promise...

6757~~~
Think he was trying a bit too much when he came on... there was one point in particular where it looked liked he had worked a decent opening for a shot, but instead of doing so, he did another feint and attempted to beat his man again for some reason.

6758~~~
He wasn't but I wasn't comparing their respective abilities anyway

6759~~~
Robben was always direct and could beat defenders all day long. He really was so much better than Depay has been.

Depays lack of effort and over playing is what really gets me. That counter that Varela had to cover from Payet for example. Depay is the one that takes the shot/cross that is crap and get countered on. He barely broke a sweat trying to get back.

6760~~~
We needed 3 goals and LvG didn't bring him on despite being the only attacking sub we had.....

6761~~~
He would do feck all anyway but yeah, maybe bring him on as a token gesture just on the merit of him being an offensive footballer.

6762~~~
He was brilliant tonight. Long may such performances continue.

6763~~~
Bizarre how little faith LVG seems to have in him these days given that he has worked with him before and Memphis had shown signs of better form recently. Probably being punished for the mistake at Anfield.

6764~~~
Similar to Martial then.. Martial has not been good past few weeks.

6765~~~
Martial was our best player today.

6766~~~
Martial rescued a replay vs West Ham and scored a goal today.

6767~~~
Like he would have made a difference. LOL

6768~~~
DDG was by far our best player... I just hate when Martial keeps losing the ball to often and likes to keep the ball and then tries something different and then lose the ball. If memphis does this then he is just bad, why does Martial get a free pass for this?    Martial is good but he is not ready to start every fecking games. But we can blame LVG for that.

6769~~~
With Vangle's love of fullback substitutions and the Bastian fitness minutes he's not getting any game time right now, must be a bit fed up.

6770~~~
He's only got himself to blame. Hasnt worked out so far.

6771~~~
Simply doesn't have the skill to be the guy who can unlock a packed defense. 

His shooting and freekick ability have also declined alarmingly since his move.

6772~~~
You must be mad if you think Martial loses the ball as cheaply as Memphis does. You have to be Memphis's family member to think that he deserves to start ahead of Martial.

6773~~~
Gut feeling is Mourinho won't fancy him.

6774~~~
Mourinho sold De Bruyne who was a better player than the current Memphis back then.

6775~~~
Could be right. Mourinho often likes his players who work for the team and can be quite consistent. Depay has no consistency at all...occasionally brilliant, but immensely frustrating and often doesn't add anything. He'll get a chance I'm sure, but if he doesn't impress then he could be in trouble. Although, reassuringly, he's not the only one who that could apply to. We know Mourinho isn't keen on Mata, and he might not be particularly enthused with giving more chances to youth players like Lingard or Januzaj.

6776~~~
No joke, I just walked past him sitting in his car in front of a hotel in Rotterdam.

6777~~~
pics!

6778~~~
Did you tell him to buck the feck up?

6779~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The car was pretty fecking ace by the way.

6780~~~
What was it?

6781~~~
Everyone knows we all drive Chevy..

6782~~~
Isn't it the G-Wagon with M7 embroidered in the seats?

6783~~~
Unfortunately I don't know what the car was. It was full black, not the G-wagon. Anyway, why would he be in Rotterdam?

6784~~~
If you've got that sort of money, you can travel wherever you like.

It could be Rotterdam, or anywhere, Liverpool or Rome.

6785~~~
Nice.

6786~~~
Upcoming Netherlands friendly?

6787~~~
In seriousness, if he's been called up for the Dutch squad to face France, it makes sense that he's in the country.

6788~~~
I wonder if we should give him another shot in the number 10 position at some point. I definitely don't think we should be giving up on his potential just yet.

6789~~~
Surely Jose will value his world class ability to hold the ball at the corner flag?  Could be invaluable in holding onto a 1-0 win - Jose will have him doing that in the 72nd minute!

6790~~~
Going the same way as Di Maria, great player being mismanaged

6791~~~
I guess the only Player towards which Mourinho might have a biased opinion is Mata. Everybody else starts from 0 and can take his Chance.

6792~~~
Yup, there too.

6793~~~
Debatable.

6794~~~
What do we make of this then?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/news/memphis-depay-believes-man-united-have-lost-faith-in-him" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.teamtalk.com/news/memphis-depay-believes-man-united-have-lost-faith-in-him</a>

6795~~~
Aw, poor guy. Sounds a bit like Yaya with his cake talk, only problem is that Yaya was/is some player whereas Depay's been constantly shit for us.

6796~~~
Seems to me he is saying he is a big thing for the Holland team and nothing much for the Utd team. If that is true, he has perfectly read the situation. 
What he wants to do about it is the difference between being the next big thing and the actual big thing.

6797~~~
Knew it was a mistake signing him and said as much. Hope I'm still proved wrong. Despite his goals, his lack of technique was still very apparent in Holland.
Unfortunately, NLmax put wool over a lot of people's eyes.

6798~~~
Poor diddums. don't bother coming back you inflated slapped arse

6799~~~
Van Gaal has been extra patient with Memphis this season. He kept playing despite producing really poor performances week after week. Of late we've seen an improvement, but that doesn't mean he's going to start every game, especially when we've got Martial and Rashford is playing well.

Surprised with this bit

Nothing wrong with it per say but not the kind of noises you want to hear from a player who needs to prove himself big time.

6800~~~
Is he interested to play in China? 
Then he can boss the league and we get 80M or more as they are interested in getting only the big names.

6801~~~
I'm starting to think he needs a loan. Not to Holland but maybe a club like Newcastle where he will play every match and be the main man again. If he fails to impress then offload, yet it could be the path to proving himself a capable premier league winger.

6802~~~
it's easy to throw around accusations that we have mismanaged him but I think even the coaches are surprised with how limited he is.

6803~~~
I'm starting to think José might loan him out to a club like Stoke or Everton as he'll probably buy a winger or two and another season on the bench for Memphis would be stupid.

6804~~~
Better to loan him to a league where he will look good like France or Italy.

6805~~~
That's if we plan on selling him. If we want him to be useful to us, let him improve/prove himself in this league

6806~~~
Seems like he's saying Danny Blind has trust in his ability and lets him express himself, and LvG does not. Isn't the latter what a lot of us have been saying for ages anyway?

It's up to him to prove the manager/coaches wrong, but it's alarming how bright he looked last season at PSV and how bright he's looked playing for the national team. Then he comes here, starts pretty well, and then rapidly sinks in the same manner that the majority of the team have.

Too soon to write him off when the club has been in a collective slump since November. Eager to see him play when we hopefully make a return to playing well, and not the godawful football we're serving up now.

6807~~~
How bright he looked for the national team? They have been criticizing his performances for the national team a lot longer than us for club form.

6808~~~
They have indeed. Mentioning that his stats/output were poor, especially in periods of Robben's absence. That he isn't a team player.

6809~~~
I haven't watched many full 90 mins of the Netherlands outside of the world cup, but I distinctly remember him being praised for both club and country before we signed him. A number of highlights reels with particular praise for his crossing.

The overall point of my post still stands though. Too soon to write him off, especially when we're godawful as a team and nobody has really stood out.

6810~~~
I remember one Dutch pundit giving him a right slagging for thinking he was Mr Big Time and there was some stat that he gave the ball away something like 26 times in a game for them.

6811~~~
Since the WorldCup he's been a bit shit for the Netherlands actually. Didn't progress as hoped at all. The Netherlands ended 4th ffs in their group for the EC-qualifiers.

6812~~~
In fairness it was probably the worst effort from a Dutch team in their history. I mean even Ireland, Northern Ireland and Wales managed to qualify under the daft new format!

6813~~~
I can't really see what LVG has done wrong in the case of Memphis, other than perhaps signing him in the first place. That being said, I still think he should get another season.

6814~~~
I would like to see him in a 433 formation. Memphis and Martial would do better as wide forwards with a balanced midfield (no Fellaini or Mata). I see Memphis more as a finisher than a creator. Definitely he has the talent, he just need to be more consistent and play with confidence.

6815~~~
People complicate things again.He's just not good enough yet at the moment, particularly too one-dimensional and easy to be nullified by good enough defenders.He has time to sort that out through but his current position in the pecking order is fully justifiable.

6816~~~
Too soon to write him off but his poor season has little to do with LVG. He's been crap for the national team as well.

6817~~~
He was dropped in the NT just recently, and has been highly criticized by the Dutch Media after the poor perfomances during their failed Euro campaign.

6818~~~
This. When he was in the team week in week out, people said he was playing poorly because he was playing too much. When he was in and out, they said he was playing poorly because he wasn't getting a run of games. 
The reason he's not playing is because he's a winger that simply can't beat his man. On the rare occasions he does, he doesn't lift his head up and runs into another defender. There's nothing Van Gaal can do differently.

6819~~~
I'm fairly sure that he will look worse in those leagues.

6820~~~
OK he might struggle with the tactical intelligence required in Italy, I doubt it but maybe, but why would he struggle in France?

6821~~~
Because in Ligue 1 the defenders are physical and the game defensive, basically the league could be his nightmare. The only good thing about loaning him to a ligue 1 coach is that someone like Genesio or Puel is that he will be thaught how to attack against people who intend to defend.

6822~~~
Granted he struggles a bit with the strength of PL defenders but I think he struggles more with the pace of the game and how quickly he is closed down.

If he can't succeed in England, France or Italy then there is no hope for him being a top player.

6823~~~
He has the tools but needs to learn, France and Germany are good places for that.

6824~~~
Biggest problem by a mile. Takes him ages to sort his feet out and always wants more time.

6825~~~
Yeah speed of thought is one definite issue. Defenders are quicker to close him down than he is to decide what he wants to do. That can be correlated to confidence as well. The other thing is that his dribbling technique involves a lot of trial and error. He seems to try a lot of shit which hopefully comes off rather than be in complete control.

He does have a lot of raw tools. But needs to work on how reliably he brings it all together in tight spaces.

6826~~~
I find some of the posts here hilarious. First of all lets see how Depay would play in a system and with a manager that people can actually understand. Its not as if he's the only one struggling with philosophy (ok he's struggling more than others but there again most of our players has EPL or British football experience, he does not).

Secondly why should we send him on loan? Its not as if we've got no experience in developing wingers. FFS some of the finest wingers the world had ever seen were developed by Manchester United, from Best to Ronaldo, from Kanchelskis to Becks right to Giggs. We'll do the same with Depay.

I'd say keep him at OT but consider him as a squad player. Griezmann/James/Dembele on the left, Mahrez/Mane on the right with Januzaj, Depay and Young as cover

6827~~~
He needs to be playing week in week out to develop. players aged 21 plus, its pointless having them as squad players behind a star like James/Martial. He will stunt. At this age he needs games and opportunities to build confidence. I'm saying he will be good enough because he hasn't impressed me in the slightest, however I want him to have the opportunity to play week in week out, build up confidence, improve, and see if he makes the grade. Being a squad player will just mean he'll come on, try too hard, make bad choices, kinda like Januzaj did.

6828~~~
I think that a solid campaign on all 4 fronts (EPL, CL, League cup, FA cup) will provide our players with plenty of games to develop. Also, Depay is not some 17 year old who needs to learn to apply the skills learnt to the game. He's 22 FFS and a Dutch international. Id say play him in a solid system that actually works in the EPL, give him some time to adapt and he'll prosper. Hence why I believe we should add a left winger who can play elsewhere equally well (James, Griezmann etc). If Depay does well, then we can move Griezmann/James elsewhere (forward line or behind the striker). If he fails, he would be a squad player

6829~~~
The system isn't going to improve his pace, dribbling skills, close control, shooting, passing, intelligence and crossing. The system may change the areas where he receives the ball and how often but in terms of ability, that's down to him. From my understanding, wingers are some of the few players who are afforded freedom in the final 3rd under the philosophy and I can see a big difference between him and Martial on the LW which for me comes down to ability.

6830~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6831~~~
I believe he will come good. Difficult times he's going through but then again, hardly a player is doing too well this season. He showed recently that he is improving and his attitude also changed

6832~~~
i keep saying this. He's so poor in one on one situations with a defender that I can't see how a change in system will help. No matter how a team plays the winger has to be able to make use of one on one situations.

6833~~~
Alot of things can change with a system change especially when you consider the mess LVG had created (midfielders in defense, defenders taking corners etc). SAF was able to win with a team with a substantial number of technically limited players. Surely Depay can't be worse then frigging Valencia on the flanks.

Id say let give him a season in a stable side with a manager who actually knows what he's doing and see how things would evolve from there.

6834~~~
Valencia game was very simple. Get to the by line and whip in a cross. His blistering pace allowed him to do hat. Memphis game is more complex and requires more technical ability.

6835~~~
Well maybe its time to make his game simpler, by playing him in less intensive games, in a system that actually works and among team mates that can be relied on. 

I am not saying that he will surely make it. Only god knows that. However while I firmly believe we need to add more quality in this side I also think that this team (include Memphis but also the likes of Herrera, Bastian, Schneiderlin, Januzaj, Darmian and many others) are much better then they are actually showing on the pitch. I can't blame them for not doing so well under philosophy. FFS I am a spectator and even I struggle to understand what the hell this guy has in mind

6836~~~
I hear you mate I hear you! Although Valencia did start off a beast with unbelievable pace and power with a decent cross on him. He deteriorated into a malfunctioning robot who would just turn back and pass backwards or inside. The few times he got past his man was due to RAW PACE and POWER. Then he would cross poorly, pass inside or backwards after spinning on a spot. Damn it was hard to watch. I can't remember how many games Valencia played RW when we won. The challenge Depay has is that because he doesn't have Tony V physical attributes, he's gotta have insane skill and intelligence like say, a David Silva, to compensate for it. But I see your point, surely he must be able to eclipse a "deteriorated" Tony V on the RW?

6837~~~
<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

6838~~~
There's no guarantees in football. OShea had all the skills (he was tall, strong, gifted with decent technique, a great manager etc) to claim that first team fullback role. It didn't actually worked out for him. There's so many things that can affect talent including homesickness, inability to adapt to a league and the player's attitude. Such thing makes it impossible to be 100% that a players would do it.

Returning to Depay I am confident that if played in a system that works and built around his strengths then Depay can do better. I defended ADM for months because of it and I am saying the same thing about Darmian, Schneiderlin, Herrera and co. Don't take me wrong I see nothing wrong in trimming sides from the dead wood. God knows how many posts and threads I've written about that. However I do believe that ultimately philosophies should be built around the players strength and not the lunacy of some manager. Else we would end up with a player's high turnover year in year out and no stability whatsoever to build on.

I love to use SAF as an example. Do you seriously believe that he wanted to end his career with his team playing the worst football we ever witnessed throughout his entire managerial career? I doubt it. However he had to adapt his system to the players he had. You can't expect to play the way the treble team played with the likes of Cleverley, Valencia and Young in midfield can you?

6839~~~
Hell no!

6840~~~
My point exactly. 

LVG's inability in tweaking his philosophy to adapt to the players he have is the main reason why he's failing badly. Unfortunately its a generational thing. I followed some of the finest managers of his generation and most seem to have the same traits (disciplinarians, tactical and extremely stubborn in terms of adapting). They all vanishing from the football that counts or retired (Sacchi, Capello, LVG, Wenger etc)

6841~~~
I was wondering why the greats from the 90's end up lumped into International roles or interim, but are mostly overlooked for the major jobs in favour of the new blood.

6842~~~
With the exception of few people (ex SAF), most have failed to adapt to the modern game. They are old school ie they came from a time where players were mindless pawns and the manager was the chess player. Anything that goes against that concept was severely punished and rejected irrespective of how much talented the player was. Some of the things they did would be considered madness in today's mentality. Players like Mancini and Vialli were left out of Italy world cup team. Players like Baggio and Zola sold because they didn't fit in the manager's philosophy (to be fair Ancelotti learnt his lesson after that) and grifters like Ravanelli who was instrumental for Juventus CL win just few months before was exiled to frigging Middlesbrough because, well, Lippi taught he can find someone better. Can you imagine these quality players being treated that way in the modern game? Can you imagine how today's spoiled players would react to such discipline?

6843~~~
The only blame attached to LVG in Depay's case is signing him and then continuing to play him for no apparent reason.

6844~~~
Didnt play too well, but did well to get 2 assists in 45 min.

6845~~~
Nice freekick for de jong to volleyball into the net and a sneaky corner. Nice two assists but his dribbling, touch and skill in open play was like he performs for United.

6846~~~
Where did that NLMax lad go to?

6847~~~
To the den of football forum shame.

6848~~~
The guy used to post daily essays about Depay. Bizarre.

6849~~~
He simply can't beat players. I don't know if you can coach someone on basic dribbling.

6850~~~
Well he actually can, but he cant think of what he should do right after. He's got no idea when to pass, go further, shoot and has very limited vision. His slowness in thought is his biggest obstacle.

6851~~~
If and when we become a quicker attacking team (if and when we buy some better players) his game will improve.
He's not the man to lead our revival, but I'm sure he'll benefit when we start to break defences down and stop giving teams all the time in the world to build walls in front of us. He also needs to realise bigger isn't better.... As far as his physique is concerned, Lighter is faster! 
  He needs to bulk down.

6852~~~
He can beat people from less athletic leagues. He hasn't shown the ability to go past people in the prem with any sort of consistency. He is beaten for pace and quickness by most right backs he has faced this year in the prem.

6853~~~
I really hope the guys given chances. He doesn't need to work on beating players - infact I think that comes naturally to him. What he needs to do is understand the opposition defenders.

Another thing is that Van Gaal is all systems and watching Depays psv videos today, he spends alot of time cutting in off the left ( all well and good) but he does not stop there and he can cross all the way sometimes to the RW which may not be allowed under such a strict regime.

Also, at PSV, everything he does down the celebrations reeks of confidence. I don't want that knocked out of him.

6854~~~
He definitely does need to work on beating players. Can't believe you think that comes naturally to him. I don't think I've ever seen such a high profile and expensive wide player struggle with getting past his man like Depay does.

I think we should cut our losses with him, get rid and start again. He's given no indication that he has even the potential to improve bar that game in the EL.

6855~~~
There is much wrong in the general set up of the team to blame it all on depay.

Someone like martial dribbles with the ball glued to his feet- IMO why his long term position is not at LW is because this means he struggles to hit the ball cleanly.

Depay on the other hand dribbles with cuts and quick touches - it's one thing doing it by yourself and failing but when the whole team is playing slow tempo then making quick cuts and stuff won't work out so well.

( IMO lingard in the middle against city - showed me glimpses about the fine line between counter-attacking and possession football & it did really add some speed in positions we did not have speed in)

One more thing- Vidic & Evra struggled defensively for a United SAF team that hardly struggled anywhere - give some time to attackers who really do have to show what they are all about.

6856~~~
I still rate his talent and would like us persisting with him. But at the same time I'd sign enough wingers to be comfortable next season. One option is to loan him out to regain his mojo, but I still feel if he works hard and gels with the next manager's system, he could do really well this season.

6857~~~
His transfer has been leaked.

That's a guaranteed £4m less than reported.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://footballleaks2015.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://footballleaks2015.wordpress.com/</a>

6858~~~
So if we manage to sell him for 80M to China, we owe PSV a lot of money <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6859~~~
If he gets sold for €80m, that would make it a €59m profit and 10% of that is €5.9m so not a lot really.

6860~~~
Ya.. I didnt mean owe.. I meant, we will end up giving PSV overall a lot of money on an unsuccessful deal.

6862~~~
Everybody needs to watch this

6863~~~
I can't at work. Quick summary?

6864~~~
Shows Memphis and his life long buddy living in Manchester, their relationship, how he comes across to people, how he reacts and expresses his disappointment for not coming on off the bench

6865~~~
Thanks.

6866~~~
Can see he really does care and that he takes it to heart when he's not playing which is great.

6867~~~

6868~~~
Am I the only one that thinks its far more likely that this football leaks website are pulling absolutely all of this info out of their arseholes rather than having direct access to every single player transfer of the past 2-3 years?

6869~~~
Hopefully he'll start against England tonight and put in a good performance to keep boosting his confidence. 2 assists against France, same again tonight Memphis.

6870~~~
34 mil?. Needs to pull his finger out.

6871~~~
Nothing much to see here.

6872~~~
Watched that Memphis video, and just completely reiterated my opinion that Van Gaal has ruined his confidence. 

A confident and flying Memphis would be one of the best players in the league.

6873~~~
He is playing okay today against a good side, but his confidence.. He has drifted inside two times this match and didnt even dare to shoot, really saddening to see.

6874~~~
As frustrating as his season may have been, why are there so many emotional responses in here that fail to acknowledge the bigger picture? It's his first season in a new country, a new and much stronger league and a new and much bigger club. While it's far from a guarantee that he'll be improved next year, he's far from the first one to struggle in his first season in the PL either, particularly at a club such as United. He may not be in his teens, but is still a relatively young player and has plenty of time to grow and become great. It's not as if it's all been dark, he's had his moments and they should offer enough confidence that he'll be productive for us going forward.

6875~~~
Yeah that's euros I believe, which at the time was around £24-£25m. Which sounds about right wrt how I recall it.

6876~~~
He had a couple of decent moments in tonight but looks really dejected a lot of the time.

6877~~~
Agreed, this season just needs to end and we need Mou to get him fighting again.

6878~~~
Bullshit. He was playing week in week out the first three months and was crap.

6879~~~
It's not as simple as that. There's a reason every attacker we've had under LvG has struggled bar Martial.

6880~~~
I do not see a player with the talent to be one of the best players in the country. 
He struggles to beat players one on one in acres of space ffs. 
I hope he improves next season but you cannot blame Van Gaal for benching him.

6881~~~
I'll add that even Martial, who many rave about, has scored a total of 7 league goals. Falcao, who was realy bad (and I mean really really bad), had 4 goals. In most teams, if a striker scores 7 goals, he'd either be benched or sold. 
IMO, the problem is the LVG system - it promotes defensive play and 1-0 score lines.

Back on topic, Re: Memphis: just how good is he?
On paper Memphis' physical style of play should be perfect for the EPL, however, I saw too many performances from him this season, where he does well against bad opposition (I don't believe that confidence is the problem, otherwise he'd struggle against low quality defenders), but the moment he comes up against a decent defence, he is completely impotent.
His best performances came against Midgetland, Brugge and Shrewsbury. Virtually every other performance, he has either been average or poor.

I think we need to see how he does under Jose. If he still sucks, then he'll be sold.

6882~~~
Looking forward to seeing how he does under a decent Manager.

6883~~~
Just tonight he knocked it passed Sturridge down the line and put in a lovely left footed cross, and also skinned Walker with some quick feet only to be fouled by him once he caught up. He's definitely got it in his locker, we just need to get it from him more regularly.

6884~~~
Martial is our LW and sometimes RW. Not strictly striker. If he ends with 10 league goals and maybe 5 assists, thats a solid contribution for a wide player

6885~~~
Also only someone that hasn't watched Utd games would say martial hasn't been absolutely brilliant in nearly every game he's played.

6886~~~
Well at the very least he has been the ONE attacker that can leave this season with some credit. Every pundit and current manager agrees. We are basically discussing our best attacking player on a thread about one of our worst attacking players as if its a worthwhile comparison.

6887~~~
You could say the exact same thing about Di Maria in the latter stages of last season.

I think that's a common overstatement on here. He's had good/promising games vs Arsenal, Newcastle, Watford and more. But since the general opinion of him is in the negative, people will act oblivious to all performances but the great ones he's had with us.

6888~~~
He showed some maturity against Arsenal and Newcastle which is positive, but even then he didn't look a potentially great player. Just a good one. I'm not sure what he was like at PSV but it seems pretty clear he doesn't have the talent to be a great player. I can't remember a highly rated winger struggle to beat his man as often.

6889~~~
Overall he's looked very Tony Valencia-ish. No ideas, lacking the basics in being a premiership level winger. By basic I mean, the basic Ashley Young level of effectiveness. I read on squawka that last season's ashley young in the premier league; created 3 times as many chances, 3 times as many key passes, 5 assists to memphis' 0, took on more players etc. He needs to up his Prem game for real. He is a winger playing for Manchester United. Can't be 1/3 the effectiveness of the likes of Young.

6890~~~
I don't think anyone can argue that he's been anything sort of underpar this first season, but he definitely needs a fresh start under a manager who doesn't strangle the life out of attackers.

It's quite amazing Martial has looked so red hot at times.

Hopefully Mou has a solution.

6891~~~
I don't think that it's that strange considering it's been a big adjustment for him, (apart from the obvious; new League, club etc), to go from high-tempo counter-attack football at PSV and Holland where he did so well to the slow tactical approach at United that's also been underperforming all season. And it's a bit unfair to compare Young to a guy who's played two full seasons of senior football when you consider that Young's actually played in the premier League all of his career and that he's playing his fourth season for us at the age of 29 and in the best form we've seen him in since the very start in 2011/12. Young even scored higher than Di maria in most of Squawkas measurments from last years campaign.

6892~~~
Di Maria, despite not starting for 9 games straight still managed to be the squads most creative player. I admit it is harsh to compare him to Young; I guess I don't rate Young very highly and hope a club like Man Utd would do far far better. Again it is true that Van gaal's approach could be seriously debilitating all our attackers. It is strange however that under the same coach, Memphis looks world class vs very very weak players in the opposition, despite Van Gaal still being the manager. Maybe he set us up differently for those games? who knows?

6893~~~
I don't know why selling a player for 80m should be considered poor. That's a massive profit on what you consider unsuccessful. I don't think you should give up on him just yet. The fee paid for him is fairly standard for a footballer that scores goals.

6894~~~
He has scored 2 league goals. Do you think the fee paid for him is standard for an attacker scoring 2 league goals?

6895~~~
I'm sorry, I didn't realize that we paid for things that have yet to happen.

6896~~~
Dirk Kuyt is 3rd top scorer in the Eredivisie with 16 goals. Maybe the dutch league is just really shit these days

6897~~~
It is, but Kuyt was also scoring 20+ goals a season there earlier in his career and around 10 in the EPL, he is a pretty good player.

6898~~~
His last season he had 2 goals in 34 league games and his second season was 3 goals in 32 league games...a pretty good player doesn't put up those kind of numbers

And the guy is 35 which is what I found most surprising in him scoring that many this year

6899~~~
He also scored 7 goals in 12 Champions league games in his second season. I don't understand your argument, are you saying he isn't a pretty good player? He has put up even better numbers in the past.

Which is why I said the league is quite shit these days. Its a very attacking league with little emphasis on defending allowing for high scores, the league is filled with inexperienced players and isn't played at that high of a tempo that a 35 year old can't keep up. His experience, movement, and general football smarts would be a level above the majority of Eredivisie players. Altidore or even Luuk de Jong are testaments to the weakness of the league.

6900~~~
Yes I never considered Kuyt to be that good and I always considered him to be very average. Maybe I just dont remember him that well as it has been a long time since he was in England. I mean even when I look at his stats of the 7 in 12 CL season...2 of those goals are in the 87 and 90 minutes of a 5-0 win against Toulouse in the third qualifying round, without looking at the rest of his games that is 9 goals in 47 of the other games games that season. Seems pretty poor for a striker and I do remember him being someone who was laughed at for his awful scoring record and being more of a work horse. 

I don't actually watch any of the dutch league so have no idea what its like.

6901~~~
So you are going to focus on 2 season and completely ignore the 4 where he scored 9-13 goals in the premier league and his four seasons in Eredivisie where he scored 20-29 goals? He also played pretty much exclusively as a winger since his second season at Liverpool so that is actually a pretty damn good record for a winger. Danny Welbeck is laughed at for his awful scoring record and being more of a work horse, is he average? Of course not, he along with Kuyt are both pretty good players. You don't do what Kuyt has done in his career by being very average.

6902~~~
The Kuyt I remember is the one who's second touch was a tackle. Lets just agree to disagree as I don't want to get into a debate about Dirk Kuyt. I was only trying to make the point of the Eredivisie being poor right now

6903~~~
Not getting a kick this guy.

6904~~~
If he could play fullback he might get on.

6905~~~
His wannabe gangster attitude doesnt help him, same with Rojo. Start working harder you fannies, cares more about the lifestyle than things on the pitch.

6906~~~
How do you know that?

6907~~~
You mates with him?

6908~~~
Bloody hell. Now he's getting criticized for something completely made up. Let's just support him and give him a chance.

6909~~~
I don't rate him but I feel for him. Came with such confidence and expectation. Been a nightmare first season.

6910~~~
Yes, i studied him on and off the field. 

No, but seriously, he is getting benched for a reason, just like Januzaj (who doesnt even make the squad), he is not focused enough.

6911~~~
I think he was pretty poor in both halves, barely seen him do anything really, should stop hiding

6912~~~
Nah. Some of the leaks about Porto have beem extremely damning yet no one ever came forward able to deny the content of a single leak. Information is consistent with plenty of the known insiders on our forum. Our club is in turmoil due to this stuff. They are legit.

6913~~~
It's Di Maria all over again. Starts fairly well, then Van Gaal messes with his position. Player loses confidence, benched. Leaves.

6914~~~
Im a Depay fan but this isnt really true, he's been very very poor in his favourite position, its weird tho that he doesnt get a look in anymore.

6915~~~
Memphis didn't start well. He's been average/poor from the start.

6916~~~
Depay has been fecking shit all season. Only done well in European games vs crap opposition. Not like ADM at all.

6917~~~
He's dogshit. I'd rather see Valencia come on.

6918~~~
I just don't understand why he's selected Young instead of Memphis up top.

6919~~~
Wish he'd just burst that rat faced prick Walker.

6920~~~
Gave him a few points for squaring up to Walker. He showed more fight there than anyone else did, TFM aside.

6921~~~
Because Depay can actually play as a striker. The rule is to play the players in their most unnatural position.

6922~~~
Should have smacked Walker.

6923~~~
At the time, I wanted him to smash Walker, but glad he didn't lash out. Had a good moment when he come on, where he took on Eriksen, I think, and put in a decent cross.

6924~~~
I don't know why we brought him on, he's useless. Not sure what all that was about with Walker but it was pathetic to watch.

6925~~~
Well he managed to take his man on, which Is more than Lingard, Mata, Rashford and Young combined achieved.

6926~~~
Wish he had chinned Walker. A red card and we might have seen someone more useful on the bench for the next 3 games

6927~~~
Valencia? For what so they can score more goals past us or to blast the balls into fullbacks or is it to watch him do his little swivel donkey dance before he passes back to a CB.
More useful? Who Januzaj or Pereira, I'd like to see that too or being LVG it be more Fellaini, Weir, Keane etc. Depay hasn't played well in a while and he hasn't adapted to the PL, remind you of anyone? Di Maria whos on fire now because he's being used for his ability, talented and he's allowed to express himself not suppress himself and played in a boring systematic philosophy with no flair or eagerness to take the game to the opposition.

6928~~~
Refuse to judge him properly on this season, he like everyone else who has been crap (obvious aside), deserve another chance under a new manager.

6929~~~
More or less, yes. Basically, more of the same.

[QUOTE="wiz4231, post: 19036452, member: 84431"remind you of anyone? Di Maria whos on fire now because he's being used for his ability, talented and he's allowed to express himself not suppress himself and played in a boring systematic philosophy with no flair or eagerness to take the game to the opposition.[/QUOTE]

No, not really. He's nothing like Di Maria.

Reminds me of Obertan though. Clumsy as feck when he's playing against third rate teams.

6930~~~
I didn't say he was like Di Maria. Depay is a very good player with a lot of talent, confidence is what he needs like Di Maria, he needs to be able to express himself like Di Maria and that's 2 of the reasons why both player did/are not do well under LVG because he's restrictive, methodical, boring, ancient, stubborn idiot of a manager.
Anyway who did Di Maria remind you of whilst playing for UTD?

6931~~~
He has made 40 appearances for over 2200 minutes, any 21/22 year old who has been as poor as him would be ecstatic to be playing that much. 

Based on what? Memphis has hardly ever played as a striker and Young used to play as a striker some times for Watford.

6932~~~
Did more with his 18mins that Lingard, Mata, Rashford(not going to judge the boy) did all game.. He's got that edge in him which will make him even better in the future.

6933~~~
Is there any reason he never, ever plays on the right?

6934~~~
He's never really played there, ever.

6935~~~
He did in the WC didn't he? Guess it was a pretty different formation and stuff.
Just seems strange that he wasn't tried there even once.

6936~~~
Even at the WC he played on the left. Robben usually came from the middle or right and kuyt was the rightback in a five man defence.

6937~~~
Meh, he's underwhelming and somehow people seem to go to him as some example of how bad LVG played him. Was pathetic in both legs against City and playing in a worse league. Also he didn't do much when they lost to monaco and drew to Lille. I don't believe he's performing any better really.

Back to Depay, he's got pre-season to work out what kind of player he wants to be. I won't fully judge what he could be on this season, but he got a proper wake up call that he's not made it and not as good as people have been telling him, yet.

6938~~~
Think that's fair. Giving him the 7 shirt didn't help him either. There are a lot of negatives about being a Dutch footballer at the moment....

6939~~~
I hope he hasn't been broken by LVG. A player like Depay with his back ground is not easy to nurture.

6940~~~
Great play from Memphis there. Rooney should've done much better.

6941~~~
Much improved so far.

6942~~~
That's more like the Memphis I was expecting! Someone should've gambled on that ball. He's growing into the game.

6943~~~
I thought he did alright for a player that hasn't played much recently.

6944~~~
An average performance but an improvement for him.

6945~~~
Quite clearly a confidence player who thrives off of being involved in the game as well. Always looked better when he's had a run of games but I doubt he'll get it for the rest of the year. Shame because he was playing well for a few games not too long ago then was dropped after one average match. Hope for him yet.

6946~~~
Much improved second half. He is guilt of being too casual too often.

6947~~~
Yeah, looked alright.

6948~~~
I can see why Giggs is so frustrated with him, because he has the talent, has the ability....but just doesn't seem 100% committed to making a go of it. For someone like Giggs, that is the biggest sin a player can do in football.

6949~~~
Why hasn't he been given a go on the right?

6950~~~
Did ok today, should have done better with the chance he had .

6951~~~
Once again. When  he comes through the middle he looks dangerous.I liked him today

6952~~~
The team performance was a bit anemic but I liked his second half performance. Created a good chance for Rooney and hit the post. Made good decision on the ball. He struggles a bit after he beats a man a, doesn't have the composure to look up and deliver a cross to the correct space. 
Still I've got plenty of time for him, positive player in possession, there aren't enough of those these days.

6953~~~
Funny how his confidence almost always goes missing against anyone half decent. 

He's not a confidence player. Just another player who likes playing shite teams.

6954~~~
Put him back on corners, he can put in a good delivery.

6955~~~
Was better in the 2nd half, but Villa are woeful. Want to see him play well vs a good side.

6956~~~
If only Memphis had Rashford's pace, he would be a monumental threat.

6957~~~
Nothing wrong with having a flat track bully, need them sometimes.

6958~~~
The thing is he has it all when it comes to physical aspects at his age.

His football brain and mentality however...

6959~~~
He's not even a flat truck bully. That would imply he's good against the lesser PL teams.

6960~~~
At least he was less selfish on the ball. Some decent crosses too.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNrUCBEKZCE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

6961~~~
He scored the goal that got us into the CL proper didnt he? If he did that repaid financially alot of his fee this year. Its his first season in the PL. Judging him now is what Maureen did with de bruyne and it sometimes doesnt work out like that....

6962~~~
Just need to stick it out with him, he'll become a good player in time... Did pretty well today, but he has barely played any minutes the last few months, so the rare chances he gets he is under huge pressure to make any impact so that can lead to poor performances (like we saw often from Nani). Also add in that he has to do this in LvG's super slow and anti risk system with no real quality in attack apart from Martial, and he has someone who is primarily a center back overlapping him... It's hardly the ideal scenario for a young player moving to a different league to succeed in is it? Martial has done it (even though he's been inconsistent too and had plenty of quiet/ineffectual performances), but not everybody is like that. 

Let's wait and see how he does next season with Mourinho, in what I assume will be a more functioning team, higher confidence, and more quality around him so we don't look to him or other 20 year olds to carry the team. Applies to basically all our younger players really.

6963~~~
It's no coincidence he started off well with Shaw overlapping him and giving him an option to work with. 

Jetro Willems did a great job at PSV helping him make their left flank a real weapon, and with him keeping the width it would let Memphis go wondering, finding pockets of space to shoot or pass from. Rojo tries but unfortunately lacks the finesse to really do well in that roll. He often times his runs forward poorly too to actually be a help. 

1 thing our team really lacks together is chemistry, we rarely look a team rather than a bunch of individuals.

6964~~~
That kind of logic will end up in you converting to Scientology.

6965~~~
With more attackers coming in the summer, he's going to struggle for game time.

6966~~~
Not writing off players after their first season in the PL..? He's a kid.....Jesus Arsenal fans were looking for the real Ozil to show up in this which might be his 3rd season?

6967~~~
It is more that you are reaching for tenuous achievements that have no real reflection on his his capabilities to be a consistent t performer at the highest level.

6968~~~
Did well today, should have scored and should stop those free kicks. It worked at PSV but it's just awful now.

6969~~~
Oh get ta feck. The stepover kid came right. This lad is older granted but he's only young. Pump for Pedro and what do you get? Pump for a kid and its a toss of a coin also but he wanted to come. Thats worth alot in itself. This club is nothing if we can't give them more than one season. Some people on here back nani who had bloody years to prove himself!!

6970~~~
This

6971~~~
He was decent. He grew into the game, and what i liked is he wasnt predictable and was trying things. He was going out wide as well as cutting in.

What I do think is we should see him get better next season once we have a better full back (eg Shaw) on the left with him.

6972~~~
Ropey first half. Was better in the second. He's a much better player when he ditches the needless flicks and trickery and just keeps it simple and direct. There was a moment in the first half when he tried to control the ball by sticking his leg out behind him and bring it over with the outside of his foot. Utterly needless, and he predictably lost possession. He needs to bin that. Get the ball, run at his opposite number and create something.

What's happened to his shooting though? Scored some screamers last season. He just can't keep his shots down right now.

6973~~~
He's a confidence player and I thought he was decent today, especially the second half.

6974~~~
He's the kind of player that a Mourinho would sell . He has his work cut out for him if Jose become a manager,especially as we might even sign players in his position.
I think we are likely to see Martial on the left and a new striker at 9

6975~~~
Memphis will always divide opinion because he is a flair player - like Di Maria & Nani

All three will try flicks when a simple pass in on, have shots from 30 yards that have people 50 rows back ducking and might also get caught out defensively. 

In my opinion though, give me a player who tries things and has real raw ability over a Lingard or a Mata any day. You can afford to have one player, especially a winger, who is a bit of a maverick when you are playing teams who put XI behind the ball.

Some people need to realise that you cant have your cake and eat it. The same people slagging off Memphis will be over on the LvG out thread saying we are boring, conservative and pedestrian....

6976~~~
The thing with Memphis is that unlike di Maria and Nani, I haven't seen any of his fancy things work, nor have I seen him try that many actually.
The thing he tries consistently is long shots, that's not the mark of a flair player. He doesn't seem to have a large number of tricks 1v1 with a defender, it's mostly feint one way, go the other. And nowadays since people have worked that out, it's feint inside, go outside, cross. If it worked everytime it's still ok but hardly in the same league as Nani, who could shoot with both feet and was utterly unpredictable for his marker.

Memphis seems strong, decently quick but not rapid, and has shown very few flashes of vision. His crossing and shooting is strictly ok. I definitely don't see him as an antidote to our sterile play, like Nani sometimes used to be in SAF's last season.

Of course, he can get better, I just hope the raw materials are still underneath somewhere.

6977~~~
Memphis is a confidence player as many have stated here. It's difficult to judge an attacking player under the stewardship of LvG. The man is a killer of confidence and instinctive ability. While it's the responsibility of a player to pick themselves up and hustle through, it's difficult when your manager is LvG. I still hold very high hopes for the kid. 

Memphis, for me has always been a wide forward, where he relies on pace and power, direct play and shots, rather than a winger where he is required to be reliant on creativity, dribbling ability and defensive contributions. There is a massive difference between a wide forward and a winger, a former position is where I think Memphis will flourish the most.

6978~~~
He's not in the same league as Nani or Di Maria. What flair has he shown? Aside from a few games against poor opposition he can't even beat his full back. I'm sure he will improve but so far this season he has shown nothing.

6979~~~
Memphis doesn't have anywhere near the ability of Nani or Di Maria. If you think he does, you're imagining a different player.

6980~~~
This is what I think to. Don't think Mourinho will fancy him at all. If you are playing for Mourinho, it's either you have supreme work rate or you're supremely talented. Memphis is neither of those things.

6981~~~
Premier league's flop of the season? Perhaps Benteke edges it.

6982~~~
Remember Eden Hazard? Neither do I.

6983~~~
I meant for new transfers.

6984~~~
Ah, well. My vote still goes to Hazard. He's been that bad.

6985~~~

6986~~~
Nah hes definitely the flop of the season IMO, especially with all the hype, hopefully he can turn it around.

6987~~~
I'd go with Benteke or Sterling way ahead of Memphis as flop of the year. Both cost significantly more, Sterling especially, both know the league and didn't need to acclimatise to it like Memphis has, and both have been no better.

6988~~~
Sterling was actually quite good for a bit though, looked a key player and bagged a few goals. Depay although costing 20m less has done nothing at all apart from have a good game against an awful danish side and an slightly better Belgian side.

6989~~~
Depay has done feck all for us. Goals against nothing teams shouldn't be on his measuring stick. He's had his year of settling in, next season its really sink or swim - we can't be carrying any passengers anymore.

6990~~~
Yeah I see mourinho selling him and januzaj.

6991~~~
Why is everyone so against him? With some confidence he could be a flat track bully next season which is exactly what we need. We struggle to break down the worst teams in the league but if we can get him fully confident he can create that randomness in the final third where most of the stuff doesn't come off but some does and we get goals. Certainly has showed more than Lingard this season or Januzaj last.

6992~~~
People are 'against' him because he has been awful.

I don't even rate Lingard but there is no way Depay has shown more. He's been poor against pretty much all decent opposition.

6993~~~
Confidence isn't his only problem. His decision making is poor, his attitude was questioned, his work rate defensively isn't up to standards. His technique isn't exactly setting the world alight either.

6994~~~
I do think people are quite against him, but I think its mainly because we all bought into the hype and got excited, and what comes up must come down.

Lingard for me has never put in a performance that suggests he is United quality, Depay has put in the best individual performance in the post fergie united and played well in a couple of others.

6995~~~
I agree with you but his decision making will not improve with cameos. Defensive work rate is something he should definitely work on this summer if he wants to get his chance again, although not sure how close I want him next to our goal after that backpass against Southampton, or whoever it was.

6996~~~
Isn't every player a confidence player in a way?
Jesus. opposition? If I play for my past semi pro club and play a blinder against an under 16's team, it don't mean I am talented. It just means I can bully shite players.

6997~~~
A bit disrespectful to the Danes who beat us in the first leg.

6998~~~
I have no filter

6999~~~
The rest of the team played the same opposition and we have several times played worse sides from lower divisions. He was phenomenal in that match and much better than any of our other players have been against anyone. We have struggled against league one sides remember.

7000~~~
Hes been phenomenal in games where he has had it easy, lets see him do it in games where he is double marked and playing against better/more physical defenders.

7001~~~
That's my point though, against better teams he might not be able to do it, but if he is on form and playing regularly I fancy his chances of putting teams like Villa and Norwich to bed. He hadn't played in a while the other day and still hit the post and put the ball in dangerous areas a couple of times. I don't see any of this from Lingard, I've never been watching a game and thought Lingard has got the beating of a player. If Martial and Rashford continue to develop it will get easier as you can't double mark three players.

7002~~~
means nothing. Just because he bullied the poor opposition <i>the most</i> doesn't mean he is some talented player. I have played blinders when playing against poor opposition but I wasn't near the best player in the team. I just showed up and took the mick because I could get away with it. In training I'm sure many of these players do outrageous tricks. The mark of a man is how he copes with adversity, not when all is comfortable, the sun is shining, baby goats are trotting along, everyone is happy eating cupcakes and marshmallows. I was more excited last season for example when players like Herrera was performing from Feb-May against premier league teams as I thought, "we can work with this." Memphis destroying Midgetland, I felt was just a nice, showy cameo but I was riddled with doubts still.

7003~~~
Yeah but that hasn't exactly worked out has it? Herrera this season has been almost a non-entity and I am a huge fan of his, during that run against Liverpool, City and Tottenham he was the best player in our team and was dictating tempo brilliantly. Your blinders haven't been against teams who won their league, qualified for europe and knocked Southampton out of the same competition, a team seventh in our league. At the time that game was probably the biggest of the season and after the first leg we looked to be on the way out and Depay showed up and dragged us through the game, its easy to be revisionist and say look how poor the opposition were, but look how poor we were at that time, it was during an absolutely terrible stretch of form for us and we finally had a shining light. He also more than held his own against Bellerin the next week before being dumped out the team again, almost just randomly as is LVG's way.

7004~~~
Less 'the most' more single handedly, he was leagues about everyone else on the pitch that match and in batches he's shown some true quality. He's also had some real stinkers but I'd have a player with the ability to win matches on his own playing opposed to Lingard who is a consistent 5/10 type player. With a bit of trust and regular play them he could potentially find some real form.

7005~~~
A bad sign when he's already having showdown talks about his future.

7006~~~
His season has mirrored Di Maria's

7007~~~
Januzaj is such a pity. i thought he was a shoe-in to be a star. sadly it hasn't turned out that way.  And he too played a part in that.

7008~~~
Midgetland played southampton basically pre season. Anyone can beat anyone then, and they were still lucky. didn't west ham get beat by some crap team also? Lets not revise Midgetlands status. Evevyone saw this as merely and adventure for them, a chance for them to visit Old Trafford for the first time in their 10 year history, yet as always against any old team, we made them look half decent. Since Southampton, they scraped through their EUROPA LEAGUE group, hadn't won in 10 games and had a 2 month break from actually playing football (longer than off season). They truely were the pits and it showed in the replay. Oh and they conceded 9 against Napoli

Depay held his own against Bellerin as I'm sure Ashley young could and Tony V. I'd like to see my winger skin Bellerin and give him a torrid time. That would be swell. He wasn't dumped out of the team at random. It was because we had no more games vs pub players and LVG wants his wingers to be dangerous threats

7009~~~
what the hell?!?! In 15 premier league starts, Lingaard has 4 goals and 1 assist, In 4 champions league sub apps, he has 1 goal and 2 assists. Thus he has an impact at a much higher level than Memphis. But Memphis who looks average vs anyone of the 25k per week standard, is supposed to be our starry talented number 7. He is just football's Adrien Broner. Lingaard is a Shawn Porter.

7010~~~
I'm not saying they're great or anything but yeah I wouldn't say they were the worst team we have played this season. That was probably Sheffield united, a game which needed Depay to come off the bench and win us a last minute penalty to go through. This wasn't merely an adventure for them in the second leg though as we were without 14 first team players, I'm not saying its not a team we should crush, but at that time It wasn't a comfortable game and we were all worried we would go out as we were playing awfully. In that circumstance Depay stepped up and put in a genuinely superb performance, that megs he did to put the ball through to mata made me jump out of my seat I have never seen anything like it, and he also scored and created havoc, the talent is certainly there to see even if its not shown itself against the better teams too regularly. Lingard is never going to be the type of player to frighten the relegation fodder of the league, wheras depay has literally put defenders in tears.

7011~~~
You are absolutely right. He did step up and I was thinking we would go out due to our own faults, yet Depay delivered us to salvation and I thank him for it as it was entertaining. At the same time I didn't see us as a Europa League potential winners and don't value the competition so it was just an adventure for me. I would rather we performed in the premier league to secure top 4

7012~~~
Yeah and most of them are his defenders on here

7013~~~
I could see this season being a wake up call for him and with the likes of mourinho (a manager with a huge reputation) you could see depay working really hard to try and impress him.

7014~~~
For the record, despite my harsh views, I haven't written him off. I can't bring myself to write someone off after 12 months. it doesn't sit with me. I do need to see something soon though

7015~~~
Out of form depay and rojo down the left wing is enough to make all of us cry I think. I'm aware his form is very hit and miss I just think he's got a lot of potential and should be getting more minutes than he is.

7016~~~
Where did I say he was our starry number 7? Infact I actually mentioned how poor he was at times for us.

An impact at a 'much higher level' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I think there might be just a hint of exaggeration there. But if stats are your game then why didn't you include champions league and qualifiers, why didn't you mention key passes and chances created, because Depay beats Lingard in that department. Infact when looking at impact statistically going forward, their 'attacking score' combines everything and yup, you guessed it Depay trumps him again.

But I digress, my point wasn't about how well Depay had played (in fact my original point was to the contrary) it's that Depay has an xfactor that Lingard doesn't, however poor Depay has been in a game he can still win it for you in a moment of brilliance. I've been saying for a good while he's a confidence player and that when he does something wrong it'd exaggerated. But he needs to up his game considerably to be a United regular, I just beleive he needs game time and proper player management to do that.

7017~~~
Give Memphis a second chance.  He's clearly got the talent platform and athleticism, but what let him down this season was his attitude.  He bought into the hype and ignored the basics of what a professional footballer has to do.

Where was Ryan Giggs when players like Memphis and Adnan needed his guidance?

7018~~~
<img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

7019~~~
Just like few other underperforming ones, Memphis will probably get some sort of a clean slate with new boss in charge.

Hopefully Jose will unlock much needed commitment and typical winner's arrogance on the pitch. Memphis got goods in his legs but his brain indeed needs some serious calibration with the Premier League.

7020~~~
Quite gutted that he didnt get another start, looked promising last match and we should be 100% winning this one, could do him good

7021~~~
Where he was supposed to be.

7022~~~
Lingaard is no more than back up level it is true, yet has more assists, more goals, in the premiership. I don't know how on Earth Memphis has higher attack score as they have created 11 chances each. Seems like bias. Any way, Memphis acts like he can win games, and fools people that he has this x factor but he really doesn't. Even Nani had an x factor. I don't see it with Memphis. He is a pretty good salesman as he sells this image well.

7023~~~
And probably he believes that shit too. 

He's wouldn't be the worst young winger out there if he wouldn't have that persona.

7024~~~
He proper looks like John Legend. 8 out of 10 on looking like John Legend.

7025~~~
I wonder if he is carrying an injury, he looks laboured when he moves.

7026~~~
Agenda much

7027~~~
He's been completely overshadowed by Martial and Rashford. Big next season for him, if he doesn't perform I think he'll be sold.

7028~~~
I still have a glimmer of hope that he'll turn out good. He currently looks absolutely shite though and out of his depth.

7029~~~
Mirror claiming the club is looking for buyers. 
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-plot-transfer-memphis-7816597" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-plot-transfer-memphis-7816597</a>

7030~~~
His best game this season

7031~~~
He needs another season. It's only in the last few weeks we've actually started playing something resembling attacking football, but he's now not getting a sniff because Martial and Rashford are tearing it up, and Lingard puts in huge shifts. 

I still think there is something about him worth giving chances to, and I don't think any player should be binned after only one season. Him, Darmian, and Schneiderlin should all get a 2nd season to prove their worth. Especially has this season has been miserable for the most part.

7032~~~
Absolute nonsense that article.

7033~~~
He need to stick it out and come back strong after a summer break where he doesn't let himself go. 

Shaw had a tough first season too and came back hungrier from it. Evra took a good year to really settle into the side and become a world class player.

It can take time. He's a prideful guy with huge self belief, so this will have dented his ego somewhat. But he can't just let his Old Trafford career slip away so easily. He's still young at 22, so there's no need for him or the club to call it quits at this stage. Unless of course LvG stays on and has had a falling out with him.

He deserves a fresh start under a new regime. There have been glimpses of his potential.

7034~~~

7035~~~
We won't sell him.

It'd look bad on our part to future potential signings that we've punted both him and AdM after one year.

7036~~~
Yeah lets believe what random rubbish that the mirror are throwing around.

7037~~~
It's incredible that the Mirror thinks the "Who Ate All..." bit is funny. Wasn't that from a semi-amusing movie from over 10 years ago?

7038~~~
Did well when he came on, considering he only had 9 minutes to do something against a parked bus. Should have won us a penalty if Oliver didn't have dicks for eyes.

7039~~~
Good cameo, agreed.

7040~~~
Watch people have a go at him for hitting the wall with the free kick and forget Rooney did the same today

7041~~~
I'll take that as a positive today. Scraping the barrel for them at the minute.

7042~~~
Good cameo, looked bright

7043~~~
Could have had a penalty. 

Certainly made an impact of sorts.

7044~~~
He was good. If only we didn't have a potato as a manager...

7045~~~
He did really well. 

I said before that late subs is most likely the best way for him at the moment where he can run at tired defenders.

7046~~~
Gave his team huge chance to win today.

7047~~~
Good minutes.

7048~~~
I'd rather see more of him over Lingard.

7049~~~
Should have come on earlier tbh.

7050~~~
He completely pulled out of that challenge with Kasper Schmeichel, the one that the ball broke across the box and Schmeichel cleared.  Could have got a foot to it, won a pen or something.

7051~~~
This

7052~~~
Much better performances,almost got a penalty.

7053~~~
Not willing to go into a 50/50 in the last minute of a crucial game, he can feck off. Waste of space.

7054~~~
Yep.  No heart, no competitive spirit, no fight.  Too much came to him too early and too easily, he won't make it here.

7055~~~
Looked to be in the replay that he was simply too far away from the ball.

7056~~~
I think he was. He did well today in his short time on the pitch.

7057~~~
Yeah let's forget how he left drinkwater for dead and could have easily got the penalty. He didn't go for a ball that was maybe 70-30 in schmeichel s favour. Sell him.

7058~~~
I thought he should have got a penalty for the red card incident. He also beat his man a number of times. Those free kicks though ffs.....

7059~~~
It was a 50-50 and he didn't fancy it. He's an absolute waste of space.

7060~~~
Get a grip.

7061~~~
fecking crazy. He was no where near and could have caused damage to both himself and Schmeichel. This is like the time many thought Herrera should have risked his head to stop Benteke's over head kick.

7062~~~
Why can't he play as a RW? I would much prefer him there over Lingard, if he could actually play there, that is.

7063~~~
I dont get why our fans have to act as if they cant think just because they dont like a certain player of our own.

7064~~~
I was sat right at that incident it was not a 70-30 for feck sake he clearly never fancied it.

7065~~~
That's the risk you take when you get stuck into tackle. It's not tiddlywinks.

7066~~~
If that's a 50-50 then I don't know what you would call a real 50-50 then

7067~~~
There was no chance for him to get it. I could see it on tv. Surprising that being there you couldn't see it.

7068~~~
The only reason it didn't end up a proper 50/50 is because he didn't fancy it. It was clear as day.

7069~~~
Funny how people define a 50:50, particularly when the player in question is not liked!

Thought he did ok when he came on, I'm still hopeful he'll come good.

7070~~~
I'm just saying it was never a 70-30

7071~~~
Agreed. At least try it once.

7072~~~
Isn't this a picture of the free kick he smashed into the wall? What on earth.

All he seems to care about is his image.

7073~~~
Looks like it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Maybe he's trying to refute the story about him leaving United and deleting all his United pictures/followers from Instagram.

7074~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I've just seen it on facebook and laughed out loud.

7075~~~
Apart from his free kick I thought he had quite a decent cameo. He's not the only one who's poor at set pieces, we are shocking at them. 

A decent summer of rest and a full pre season, I think he'll come into his own next season.

7076~~~
Posts pictures and gets criticized for what he wears. Deletes pictures and gets called a cnut and petty. Posts new picture and get criticized because all he cares about is his image. You just can't please some people.

7077~~~
Wasn't too bad when he come on. Had a good moment, where he could have possibly had a pen. Was probably our most effective sub, which isn't saying much, as Mata and Herrera were pretty poor when they come on.

7078~~~
Sometimes i feel that we are worse than Liverpool fans! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

7079~~~
Very true.

7080~~~
I wonder if he posted that after reading this thread. It's seems like a very direct reply to the criticisms on this page.

7081~~~
How bout start playing well?

He can post his dog his car his tattoo his rap album etc, heck he our cult hero is a kungfu master cum seagull trawler fisherman

7082~~~
It's not even a good reply, this is the best he can come up with?

7083~~~
Pleased he came on so looks like that speculation was bs. Think he did well when he came on. Was a threat in and around the box and unlucky not to get given the penalty. If we get that, then people are more upbeat. I think Jesse needs to do more to keep Depay out the team.

7084~~~
Pretty sure Martial wouldn't have gone in for that challenge too which people are mentioning.Infact he backs out of more 50-50s if anything.


What i don't get about Depay is how he's gone from being really good at set pieces in Holland to being completely shit in the PL?
In rest of the things there can be a difference in quality in league but free kicks ?

7085~~~
It wasn't a 50/50, a 70/30 and if he would have gone for it all it would have been was a foul on the keeper, its nothing like say Walcott on Kaboul last week.

7086~~~
In fairness, he hasn't really done badly the last few times he's actually got to play. It's hard for him to "start playing well" when he gets 10 or 20 minutes here and there, though I think he's done alright. His main problem is that our best player plays in his position and won't be dropped - I would be interested in seeing him get a few full games on the right.

7087~~~
I think the lad has decent potential in terms of raw talent but he seems like a bit of a gimp, mentality wise. He came into the club with this whole desire/passion/destiny bollocks image and he's barely shown anything at all to justify this.

I don't care what clothes he wears or what music he listens to or what car he drives, but I can't stand watching him moan like a little bitch when he goes to ground and cries about not getting a free kick. Not the United mentality I like to see.

7088~~~
So when Rooney does it and has a hissy fit, or the numerous times Ronaldo, Nani, Becks, Giggs, etc did that, they weren't showing the United Mentality you like to see?

7089~~~
Rashford never challenges the centre-backs for balls in the air either. Useless, get rid of both!

7090~~~
Then you need to get your eyes tested, either that or you need to resit your GCSEs because that wasn't a 50/50.
Absolutely zero chance of him getting to the ball first, but yeah, dive in anyway, coz it shows he's commited bruv.

7091~~~
People criticising him for not putting in that challenge when he was nowhere near the ball whilst ignoring the penalty he should be been given.  What a joke this forum is becoming.

7092~~~
For someone who is supposed to be tricky, agile and quick winger, he always looks sluggish/heavy-footed to me. Valencia in his thirty looks far more explosive than him, Nani after long term injuries looked more explosive and agile than him.

7093~~~
Literally his first impact in the game was winning a freekick after shuffling the ball between two players.

7094~~~
To be honest I also hate it these days when Rooney does it. 

With Memphis it leaves a bad taste because of how it clashes with the kind of player/personality he likes to portray himself as for marketing purposes. I don't think he justifies it in the slightest. I hope one day he will.

7095~~~
Did the best he could when he got on, won a penalty that the ref bottled and a dangerous free-kick.

7096~~~
I remember that, weird as it may sound but that situation actually made me write that. He didn't look explosive there either, I thought Leicester players were defending very poorly there. I just think he should show more explosivness than he is showing.

Not criticising him for today btw, I don't think he was that bad as some do.

7097~~~
I don't thinkhe necessarily has the speed of Martial when dribble but he's still a good technical dribbler, he just needs to show it when the pressure is on, if he can.

He's played reasonably well when he's been afforded time recently, it's a pity we are so late in the season and so LVG won't give him another chance to establish himself in the starting 11, though it's understandable.

7098~~~
Need to see him under another united manager to make a final judgement, but there is still something about him that makes me think he can succeed here.

7099~~~
I still don't think he's that talented. His best games have come against minnows.

I'd be happy to be proven wrong though.

7100~~~
Funny place. Someone like Fellaini has been here for 3 bloody season and some still he should be here next season but a young player that ripped apart the Dutch league, with all respect a lesser league, now playing for a crazy manager like LvG in his first season does not deserve a chance? This place, this life!<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7101~~~
The only games he's played well in have been against poor teams in Europe. In the Premier League he's been awful.

7102~~~
I can sense it too. One more full season and if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen. But I suspect it will.

7103~~~
Arsenal?

7104~~~
I think the reason why people said he had a good game against Arsenal, was because it was right after the Midtjylland game where he was fantastic.

He was average in that game imo bar a few tricks.

The one game he was doing well in was against Watford where he played as a striker.

7105~~~
Don't expect anything when he plays. And that isn't a good place to be.

Comfortable with whatever Mourinho decides on him.

Just hope he can get some more magic into the side.
I can't take a season of watching Rooney bob around doing stuff any decent player can do on such insane wages, and hoping martial can beat everyone, every time he gets it.

7106~~~
Think he's been grossly mismanaged, he isn't half as talented as Nani but it's all coming back to me - particularly in terms of fan reaction.

I'd be quite annoyed if he was sold too. Under a manager who wants us to play a fast-paced game with more risk Memphis would definitely benefit, the entire cohort of attackers would.

7107~~~
He did, double-marked yet was through if he hadn't been fouled. Then won a near penalty and sending off, thus creating more in ten minutes than anyone else in the whole match, barring Martial.  Strange time to slag him off really.

Considering Rashford was completely invisible (the person I was with forgot he was playing) I would start Memphis next match, with Martial in the middle.

7108~~~
Fairly average performance.

7109~~~
Sure.

7110~~~
Should probably watch it again bruv, although I am proud of you, spelling GCSE all on your own like that.

7111~~~
Agreed, but he's had the habit of pulling something special everytime I think he could do with a rest.

7112~~~
Behave yourself Ivaldo go back and read what I have said. Depay never fancied it (tick) and it was not a 70-30 (tick). So I'm not needing to go back and sit my GCSEs anyhow I never sat them in the first place.

7113~~~
Awesome comeback, regurgitating what I said to you. Still, if you think Depay had an equal chance to win that as Schmeichel did, then there's no hope.

So whats your point exactly? You arguing over s negligible portion of the fraction, he didn't fancy it because he had a wrong chance of winning it. You can freeze it when Schmeichel makes contact with the ball and he's a good foot away from it still.

7114~~~
Yeah I don't think that this '50/50' for the ball was '50/50', sure, he pulled out in the last moment but he wouldn't have gotten the ball I think, was too far away. Should've had a penalty so it's fair fecks from me. I don't know where are his famous free kicks though, he's fecking embarrassing with them for somebody who had the most goals scored in Europe last season iirc.

7115~~~
I think he has bulked up too much.

Needs to lose some muscle and focus on doing what made him a gun in the Netherlands

7116~~~
Should have won a penalty and the game for us. Nice little cameo.

7117~~~
I think so too. He looked much quicker at the WC although my memory is hazy.

7118~~~
Drinkwater could have let him go though, he'd have fell over during the Rabona showboat attempt.

That free kick was shite an' all.  Still a NO from me.

More seriously, precious little to take a view about from yesterday.  

Overall we have the rather more prosaic talents of Jesse Lingard continuing to keep the Boy Wonder out of the starting XI.

7119~~~
He has pulled out of it by then so obviously he will be a <i>"good foot away from it still"</i> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Surely the point at which to freeze it would be when the ball breaks loose.

7120~~~
Well do that that if you like, Depay is even further away, Schmeichel is already outside his six yard box and he collects the ball a yard away from the penalty spot? Strikers are never going to win them, Rooney does the exact same thing seconds later on the rebound.

7121~~~
I have. No point beating a dead horse here, we aren't going to agree on this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7122~~~
Right you are. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7123~~~
I remember when he first came in this summer Van Gaal said he didn't want to get him until next year because he wasn't ready. He hasn't really looked ready all this season but to me he looked pretty decent yesterday. He tried something a bit different in a match that everyone else on the field looked more than happy enough to let it run down to a draw. He should've gotten a penalty and had he not been pulled back in the box he'd have been through on goal. His free kicks have gone a bit shite but we can only hope it's a confidence thing. 
Let's see what he's like next season before readying the Simpsons movie esque angry mob.

7124~~~
I agree with all this. There was a huge learning curve for him this year, hopefully next season he'll be ready to step up.

7125~~~
Lmao, so true.

7126~~~
I remember Lamela was pretty bust when he first play in the EPL. Probably due to the fact he didn't want to go in the first place. He is doing pretty well at the moment, I think. For me, some players would need some time to adjust his game to the speed and physicality of the league. Leicester players all work so hard covering up the pitch during defending. They may not play the prettiest of games, but they all work hard for each other. Hopefully, with Shaw coming back, and another pre-season with or without new manager, Memphis will play much better.

7127~~~
Was he at the awards?

7128~~~
Yup.

7129~~~
Good stuff ta. Was just watching <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>'s clips and saw him at the end

7130~~~
It absolutely was a 50/50, they were roughly the same distance away from the ball and it's a winger up against a keeper. He just didn't have the courage.

7131~~~
Not a chance, in what world is the keeper not favourite in that position I have no idea. Even if, hypothetically, he was able to get an outstretched toe to the ball first Schmeichel had already spead and was sliding, he'd be collecting it anyway.

7132~~~
Should take a real close look at Kante. Came to the PL, stayed humble, and worked his socks off week in week out. No fancy caprioles, just play football ffs and show what you're worth. So tired of people making excuses.

7133~~~
There's nothing to suggest he hasn't put in work. In fact he has clearly improved since he was benched. Put in some good cameos with the odd start where he had decent games. Like Arsenal midtjylland villa and all

7134~~~
The cameo was promising, I genuinely think he is overweight though. He's far too stocky to be the tricky winger he was at PSV. You look at people like Vardy without an inch of fat on him, that's how you get that speed. I think he's getting back there though. Having a good pre-season is going to be key with him (training wise).

7135~~~
We could do with a still from when the ball first broke loose. That would clear it up.

Watched the game on MUTV. Immediately gut reaction of myself and the commentators was that he should have challenged for it. One of the commentators was Crerand. It takes something for him to criticise a United player.

7136~~~
How can he be humble when LVG was portraying him as one of the top 5 most promising players around?

7137~~~
Just posted a 12 picture collage of him celebrating a goal in a Utd shirt on insta.

EDIT - The Sun are on it already...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football-oranje.com/robben-give-memphis-time-succeed-manchester-united/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arjen Robben on Memphis Depay : "He’s a very talented player, but you can’t underestimate how big a step it is up to the Premier League, and especially to a big club like Man United. He’s still very young, you have to give him some time."</a>

7139~~~
Normally I'd agree with Robben. First season, in and out of the team in a much tougher league than one where he's just bossed it, it's going to affect anyone.

However if the reports of his bad attitude are true then there's not a lot we can do. If someone doesn't want to learn and improve for the sake of both the team and their career then you have to cut your ties.

I just hope he is actually trying hard and isn't going to let a tough debut year get to him. There's clearly some talent there, we just need to work out how best to use it, all whilst he does too.

From what you can glean from his attitude and the type of person he seems to be (massively reaching), you can imagine Martial coming in and immediately lighting up the place was a dent to his ego and he's suffered with that all year.

7140~~~
What reports of bad attitude are there actually? Ones that aren't based on nonsense like his clothes, cars, and instagram pictures.

7141~~~
Based on this Ronaldo must have a bad attitude too? I don't know how people "sherlock" this?

7142~~~
No no.7 displayed here..... maybe we're getting a new one

7143~~~
Speaking to Dutch outlet NOS, Mulder said: "In the Premier League he suffers, yet his attitude suggests that he is a big star.

"It seems that people at Manchester United are starting to get fed up with this."

This is pretty much the extent of these reports.

7144~~~
Speaking to Dutch outlet NOS, Mulder said: "In the Premier League he suffers, yet his attitude suggests that he is a big star.

If anyone knows the going ons at Uniteds inner circle it's Youri Mulder <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> This is pretty much the extent of these reports.

7145~~~
Hope he does well today, this thread is usually the most divided so I'm hoping he gives something to us who think he should get another season.

7146~~~
he may have talent but he also has a shit attitude. he must have something on later today.

7147~~~
Almost every touch has been awful.

7148~~~
He's completely lost self-belief and form. I hope  he comes back a different player next season.

7149~~~
I hope he doesn't come back to be honest.

7150~~~
He looks like an Olympic weightlifting champion but he gets bullied off the ball by every man and his dog. Fecking ridiculous.

7151~~~
I wouldn't mind a sale with a buy-back clause or a loan. Unless this is just a individual's mental crises, he has a lot to work on in  his game.

7152~~~
He's playing against an average team. Here's a chance to perform and he looks like he doesn't give a feck.

7153~~~
Cock piss Memphis

7154~~~
So I can either be happy with him or want him fecked off? Is there no in between? 

I'm in the crowd that want a 22 year old forward who scored 20+ goals last year given more than a season to prove his worth in a notoriously difficult league to settle into. And maybe even given a chance under a coach that only 2 attacking players (Martial and Rashford) have looked anything close to good enough.

7155~~~
driving a nice car? yeah why not, I dont wanna do him Scholes but he just buys the most luxurious car out there while putting in the most attrocious performances, almost beating dimaria to that, with no7 shirt, think you have low standards. you can spot something spoiled in his character, his head is not into football, he's mentally far from ready to play for Manchester fecking United and god knows if he ever be, he's just more expansive Zaha...

Well and if you think everything is all right if he takes 40 freekicks per season and not a single one troubles goalkeeper than there must be something wrong with you, why is he taking them in the first place ffs.. 

cant believe how unlucky we are with the recent "new ronaldo recruitment", its not liek he's been average, he's been shit and doesnt care at all, that is unacceptable for me and shouldnt be for anyone

7156~~~
WTF has his car got to do with anything

7157~~~
I really want him do well but that first half showing was one of his worst. He'll pick it up in the second half, he has to.....I'm going to make the bold prediction that he'll score.

7158~~~
I hate to criticise youngsters but i really cant see, from today's evidence, that he is actually good at anything?

7159~~~
He seems to have no agility or ability to send the defender the wrong way. Most of his dribbles seem to involve him running right into whoever he's trying to beat.

7160~~~
Let's see if Mourinho can sort him out, I've seen enough of him to know there's talent there, even if he does look awful right now.

7161~~~
He has been diabolical today. His languid style looks worse when he is as poor as today.

7162~~~
I thought he was good against the crap sides?

7163~~~
same - but he was supposed to help the attack and those two kids you mention are infinitely better their first yr in a new league. he'll have to have a massive improvement to get a sniff. maybe getting a lb to work with. i think i'd rather have him central as a striker because he'd have fewer decisions to make. see ball kick ball.

7164~~~
To think people were comparing him to Nani at the start of the season <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7165~~~
I hope he gets his act together next season (if still here) as he really has been a grave disappointment. Today's performance has been a real indication of his season as a whole. He just doesn't look the part. Fingers crossed things will change next season as I hate to see a young promising player fail at United. He just looks severely lacking in confidence

7166~~~
I just don't know what talent he's supposed to have. Because it certainly isn't passing, shooting, running, dribbling, crossing, tackling, creativity, set pieces or work rate.

7167~~~
He's testing my love for football. Really can't believe how bad he's been today. Need to see a video of him vs Norwich again.
No way he's a winger.

7168~~~
so he gets the chance to play from the start again and completely blows it again! cant believe this player got more chances than Adnan who played maybe 20minutes from the wing for us past year+ just annoying how some players are preferred to others..

7169~~~
Crazy really. At the moment it's pretty much unthinkable he will ever come close to what Nani achieved for us.

7170~~~
Even I can't defend that performance. get this season done with and get your head sorted for next season lad!

7171~~~
Probably his best free kick of the season in the 93rd min.

I expect Rooney said something like, "just don't hit the wall, either stick it in the net, or smash it into the crowd...waste time"

7172~~~
Another horrendous performance, hope we don't make the mistake of thinking he needs time and keep him stinking the place up year after year, he's clearly a player with a distinct lack of talent and character and it doesn't matter how many years we keep him he wont suddenly gain a lot of ability and change his character.

7173~~~
Abysmal display. The only decent thing he did was the free kick towards the end.

7174~~~
Was particularly shit today.

7175~~~
Absolutely abysmal. Cannot believe how dire he was today considering this was his big chance at shutting down all the haters.

7176~~~
Everyone keeps saying the talent is there. I can't fecking see it. I would understand that point if his decision making was the problem. But that's not his problem. He simply can't get rid of a player marking him. His dribble success rate must be in the low teens. 
To make it worse he can't use that tank- body of his to protect the ball of his life depended on it. 
The simple truth is for a winger, his technical ability is too fecking atrocious. 
You now add he lack of work rate, makes for a terrible player.

7177~~~
Best, Cantona, Beckham, Ronaldo...

Heck even Owen scored a winner vs City for us.

This clown needs to be loaned out, or at least played in the reserves until he manages to get some confidence back. If not, ship him out. What a waste of talent and money.

7178~~~
Zero confidence there, he just looks lost. Completely.

7179~~~
Please answer this? What is he good at?

7180~~~
Getting paid?

7181~~~
Yeah, I don't get it, I don't see what it is he's meant to be good at. I've tried so hard to find what others find but I don't see it. One thing I'll say is he definitely is not a winger because he lacks all the attributes an efficient winger would need.

7182~~~
I don't get how he's so bad, I just don't understand

7183~~~
Worst ive seen him play. lucky to play the full 90 minutes. Given the lack of playing time recently, you would think he would be so up for it. 

Is he a confidence player? If so, I really cant see LVG giving him that confidence.

7184~~~
It has to be a confidence issue, I mean he can be shit but he's fecking up basic things.

7185~~~
Would have been good to see him play for the Dutch in the Euros this year had they qualified. Just to see whether he can perform better in a non-LVG team. 

Still, maybe the rest will do him good. Needs to sort his confidence/head out. Can barely beat a player.

7186~~~
But I'm an idiot for not getting excited after the Midtjylland game...

If LVG is here next season we might as well sell him, if we bring in Jose or whoever else I'd say it's worth persisting with him for another season.

7187~~~
He didn't when he played for them in qualifiers.

7188~~~
Just disappointing.

7189~~~
I keep thinking he could come good next season, but man was he wank. Needs a big summer and pre season.

7190~~~
Dutch public wanted him dropped from the squad for his performances during qualifiers.

7191~~~
Manchester United make me angry.

Memphis makes me livid.

7192~~~
Same here, losing faith in him tbh. I still think he deserves another season but he genuinely needs to work really hard over summer on his agility and weight.

7193~~~
Horror show of a performance, like a bog bowl floater.

Maybe if he'd had it today he'd have gotten up the wing a bit faster.

7194~~~
His best performances have come against poor sides and terrible defenders.
Today, we met with the sort of team he does well against.
Now tough, he seems to fail even against a poor side.
I'm not sure, but it looks like he is getting worse!

7195~~~
Genuinely think a sale with a buy-back option, or a loan, might be a good idea. I'm not sure if we can afford to have this version of Memphis as our second choice LW next season. If we stick with him, for our sake, he better come back a different player.

7196~~~
Have any of our players put in a worse performance this season? I'm nearly impressed.

7197~~~
Would be hilarious if he had a storming season out on loan but came back and still being a shitty United player. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7198~~~
From what I can see, the more he "adapts" to our team/league, the worse he gets.
If he doesn't prove himself quickly, next season, I think Mourinho will boot him out.
And if LVG stays, I think Memphis will be loaded/sold in the Summer.

7199~~~
Very poor today. The time he was 1 on 1 with the Norwich left back and just ran into him is symbolic of his united career so far.

Don't see a future for the lad at the club, I'm sorry. I'd like for him to have another season and improve, but from what he's served up so far I've been very disappointed.

7200~~~

7201~~~
Ashley young could have done a much better job than he did today, Memphis seemed incapable of doing anything right.

7202~~~
I don't get how he can be that bad at taking on defenders. Even Lingard is better at this than him. It just looks so uncomfortable for him. It's like he's unable to move more than a couple of inches in that initial burst. Really really weird.

7203~~~
I'm devastated that Memphis hasn't burst onto the PL scene because he definitely has the potential and has shown it at times throughout the season and moreso for the Dutch national team and PSV. 

However, this shouldn't be ok much of a shock that a young, creative player has struggled in this United team. 

Di Maria looked like Tom Cleverley, Nani played like Bebe, Rooney has for the most part looked like a Sunday league player, Januzaj forgot how to dribble with the ball whilst Young, Valencia, Fellaini... Players who are way less talented but able to play less with instinct and follow rigid instructions, have prospered. 

I remember watching the Bayern team under van Gaal and being extremely impressed at how controlled they were in their approach to the game so I know our system CAN work with creative, instinctive players but it seems the United players, Memphis included, have been unable to adjust so well. 

The fact Robben and Ribery have also featured in Pep's teams would suggest they are flexible enough to play both styles.

7204~~~
There's got to be scientific explanation for his "burst" of pace being so bad. I reckon Chris Smalling could have a better sudden change in pace.

7205~~~
Really bizarre given how young he is. I would imagine even if things werent coming off for him he would be up, down and everywhere on the pitch working hard trying to get it to click...

I am all for giving players time, especially those that are gifted as Depay clearly is, but if you don't work hard as far as I am concerned you can sit on the bench or move on.

I will have it that he hasn't played for the first team much lately so may be rusty but I just don't see the work rate and desire to push through the rust and help the team perform. It is a worry to say the least considering we have an FA Cup Final coming and you would think all the players would want to push on and be involved.

7206~~~
Memphis' talent and Blind's intelligence are two things that seem to completely pass by me.

7207~~~
Increasingly see it this way too.

7208~~~
His pace over the first ten yards is shocking. I think a lot of that has to do with his physique. The only comparable player to him in stature is Hulk. But Hull knows how to use his body to protect the ball. And I also think Hulk is faster so that helps. This guy just can't get away from players even in the rare occasions he dribbles them.

7209~~~
It's very strange. I think he needs to get his physique seriously examined and sorted. I refuse to believe the player of the year in Holland who was a goalscoring wide player is this slow over the first 10 yards. I'm willing to accept that he's not going to make it here, that can happen. But some of this shit just looks off.

7210~~~
He's shit. There I said.

7211~~~
If anything, hopefully our scouts will value natural technical ability above the other aspects of an attackers skill-set, for now on.

7212~~~
I think you're fishing a bit here tbh. Nani had a very good first season at United, you could see the talent was there it was just getting it out of him, the same thing goes for Januzaj who was very good in his first season, hell even Di Maria did well for 3 months. Fellaini and Valencia have also definitely not 'prospered' under van Gaal.
With Memphis there is literally no positive from his first season. There's no sign of a talented young player, there's no sign of a determined youngster, there's nothing, just some bloke who likes tattoos, haircuts and going to the gym. 
I loathe van Gaal as much as the next person but he's not to blame for Memphis. Martial, Rashford and Lingaard , our other attacking youngsters don't turn in the same turgid displays that he does.

7213~~~
I can only see Martial owning the left wing next season, so I don't see him getting a run of games for him to improve on. Maybe the EL will give him the games.

Eredivisie is an unreliable barometer of a player. Maybe he simply isn't all that.

7214~~~
Hopefully that's his season finished now. Needs a good long break and a fresh start in next pre-season.

He got a chance today and didn't use it. Shouldn't be in the team for the next games. Januzaj should get a chance from the bench.

7215~~~
Tough to say many good things. Got a full 90 in his preferred position against a piss poor opposition, and showed virtually nothing. 

Definitely worth keeping as we're hardly going to get much dosh for him AND we'd have to replace him. Let's see how he does with a new manager.

7216~~~
Says everything about LVG's poor judgement that Memphis gets tons of playing time while Pereira and Januzaj barely get any. Memphis must be one of the worst performers in the PL this season.

7217~~~
We need to loan him out preferably back to a Dutch side or sell him in the summer. He looks completely lost on a football pitch. I think moving to United was far too much for him mentally. I don't know if he was ever good enough to come and play here but I can cross better than he can it's embarrassing to watch.

7218~~~
Loan him to an Italian, French or German side. I don't think it makes sense for him to go to such an easy league like the Dutch one again.

7219~~~
I don't think it'll work out for him in the Italian or the German league. He doesn't have the work rate, skill, speed or the desire to be a success against resolute and organized teams he'll encounter in those leagues. 

We should check if PSG are stupid enough to take him off our hands, or this is a 50m+ write off (wages included).

7220~~~
Even they aren't that stupid. Noone is going to buy him for a good fee right now. Our only hope (other than him being a hit next season) is that he does well enough in another league to be ready for the PL and Manchester United, or not quite good enough for us to resign/bring him back but good enough for another team to pay an acceptable fee.

It's an important decision because we can't afford to have him stinking up our left flank next season. We need someone who can take a bit of pressure of Martial and be a threat himself. And I'm sure there are enough other talents we can go for. So we have to make sure we get this decision right rather than just be lazy about it and hope for the best.

7221~~~
I think if we sell him this summer we could get most of our money back. If we keep him and he has another poor season then his value will really start to plummet.

7222~~~
I agree. Don't think anyone is going to buy him, and there is no point keeping him as Martial owns the left attacking position. We should send him on loan; though I don't see him succeeding in any of the top leagues. Plus, I think we'll be subsidising most of his exorbitant wages on loan.  

I can't see it panning any other way than a write off. Would love to be proven wrong though.

7223~~~
This young, talented, give him time nonsense should stop right now. The guy is fecking shit and nowhere near good enough as has been obvious for a long time now. Young players need to show talent and potential to deserve more time.

Keeping him for another couple of years will not increase his price tag not that we get good prices in any case. Nani is light years ahead of him and we sold him for pittance. Advertise him to clubs with the midgetland youtube videio and maybe we'll find someone gullible enough to sign him. Seems to be plenty of them on the caf at any rate. Just get rid.

Hard to know what Mourinho would do but it didn't take him long to bin Quaresma who was more talented and brought by Mourinho himself.

7224~~~
Honestly can't believe he wasn't subbed, he was beyond useless during the match.

7225~~~
I just hope we get this one right. We really need to. This season we banked on Memphis, Rooney and Mata, and it turned out to be a terrible decision. While Martial is our LW, we need another left winger to give a threat and provide genuine quality. Even someone who can perform as well as a Tadic, Montero etc.

7226~~~
Our attack is so bare that I don't know how many we need. 

We definitely need a pacey right winger
We definitely need a top striker
I would love for us to go for Griezmann to play behind the striker 

For the LW, I would be happy if we put our trust in Januzaj as a back-up; and hopefully he can replicate his early form from the season under Moyes.

7227~~~
Genuinely awful today. Not a single positive to take from that performance.

Ship him off on loan.

7228~~~
Still hasn't done anything to convince me that he isn't a bog average player.

7229~~~
If we keep him longer we might not get much for him too.

I don't think he's good enough. He does well against Brugge and midtjylland. But in the premier league he has struggled to show any performances like the above two.

7230~~~
If he starts next season in the same form, I'd be on the phone with PSV asking whether they are interested in taking him back on loan. I don't understand how he's been as terrible as he has this year.

7231~~~
I'm willing to give him a chance. Who knows, maybe he can turn it round next season. His head does not seem right at the moment, needs to sort himself out.

7232~~~
Play a game against the midgets tonight and he'll score 5 again.

7233~~~
Bebe showed more for us than he has. That was one of the worst individual performances I've ever seen from a United player.

7234~~~
Total exaggeration

7235~~~
Holy crap,Dory is so much strong in this one.

7236~~~
Maybe there is some exaggeration there but it is easily one of the worst matches I've seen from a player. He didn't get a single thing right today. To think we've spent almost £90m on two players to fill that number 7 shirt and we're worse off than when we had Nani in the side.

7237~~~
He was very lucky not to be subbed today, he almost looked like he wanted to be judging by the way he played. That cross in the first five minutes summed up his day.

7238~~~
Ive been saying we should give him another season to prove himself for some time, and the fair minded part of me still thinks we should but he is making it very difficult. He was woeful today. 

But I do believe he has more to offer than he's shown and I dont see we have much to lose keeping him around next season. He will have to up his game considerably or he will end up going the way of Obertan.

7239~~~
The way he has played I'd be delighted if PSV took him back tbh. I doubt he's going to be picking and choosing where to go.

7240~~~
The guy is odd that he couldn't beat anyone or bring the ball forward often enough while being a winger.

I am still giving him another season at least though.

7241~~~
Deserves another season under a new manager as does Darmian.

7242~~~
This was a great chance for him today, and he didn't put in a good performance at all. Very disappointing.

7243~~~
What's happened to Depay is crazy, he's way better than this but he just can't seem to get going under LvG, you do fear who we could bin if LvG stays next season, Depay, Herrera, Schneiderlin, Mata, the list goes on, I just hope he isn't given the chance.

7244~~~
Scary, but very true on today's showing from Memphis.

7245~~~
He is absolutely terrible. And I don't think even think it's the adjustment thing that's the issue.

I don't think he's that talented. Like a few others eluded, what talent is he showing? Where is the talent? Should be nowhere near the team. Wouldn't be bothered if he was sold this summer. Plenty of better players out there.

7246~~~
Amen, brother. Amen.

7247~~~
I haven't rated him since for a long time. It was as Hargreaves's said during commentary, 'if you are young and talented it means nothing (aimed at Januzaj) too, you have to work hard and show for the ball and cause havoc. Depay seems to want the game to come to him and when it does he lacks the quality from there. He can't handle the pace and pressure of the league either. He is deceptively weak and cumbersome. I suspect this is from weight lifting.

7248~~~
Appalling today. Laughable how he remained on the pitch for almost the entire match.

7249~~~
Just because he isn't showing much talent at the moment doesn't mean he doesn't have any. I think he's just mentally not with it at the moment and nothing he tries to do works. He obviously isn't as poor a player as he looked today, he can do and has done much much better. I think his free kicks tell a story - he scored 7 of them last season and the players keep letting him take them, so he must be doing them in training. Yet when he actually does it in game they are nearly always useless. It isn't that he is just shit at them, he demonstrably isn't, but they're just not happening for whatever reason. I think it's the same for his all round game, he is definitely a better player than he is showing at the moment.

7250~~~
He really was dreadful today. It's not an exaggeration to say that it was one of the worst performances in a United shirt in quite some time. How he was allowed to stay on for the entire match is beyond me. He hasn't played much, so some rust is excusable. Similarly, I have no problem letting him try to play his way out of the rut he's in. That said, there's a point where, as a Manager, you have to take the blinders off and make a change. It was a must win game, and we spent the majority of it chasing a goal but creating virtually nothing. Memphis killed the play almost every time he got the ball. It was baffling that Van Gaal persisted with him. He must really lack faith in Januzaj. 

I'm not sure what to think of Memphis at this point. He played well in the World Cup, which can sometimes be misleading (Kleberson). He also played very well in Holland last season, although success in the Dutch league doesn't always translate (Kezman). Van Gaal worked with him with the national team. If Memphis lacked skill, work ethic or character, I can't imagine he would have advocated to make the transfer happen the way he did. Memphis clearly has physical attributes, and has shown flashes of skill. He's so far out in the wilderness right now, though, you have to wonder whether he can find his way back, at least at Old Trafford. At the moment, his decision making is shocking, his technique is lacking and his confidence is shot. He needs a good off-season program and a fresh start next season. If he focuses on his football, he can hopefully find his game.

7251~~~
I will give the lad more time but i just have to get this off my chest..

Oh my, my. He is (currently) so fecking shit. He doesn't work for the team, he can't go past anyone, his shooting is dreadful and he is lacking a creative edge. I get he's low on confidence but for fecks sakes, the very least he could do is to focus on the basics. Simple passing and solid tracking back. That's all i'm asking for right now but he insists on doing everything the hard way. I've said something like this post very early in the season too. Come on Memphis, lad, it's not too late to turn things around. Or is it?

7252~~~
Agreed. The rule of young players (particularly those finding their feet in a new league) dictates that he should get more time, but my god is he awful as it stands now. He is just utterly inept.

7253~~~
This dude must take awesme freekicks in training because he seems to get all the ones in a match which is amazing considering he's a sub!

7254~~~
I firmly believe he will not succeed here.

7255~~~
As a club,should we wait and see if he comes good or go out and show proper intent and sign a top winger to battle it out with Martial?

I am not sure if he is worth the wait.

7256~~~
I would give him more time under a different manager (hopefully Mou). It's been his first season, and it's way too premature to deem him a failure.

7257~~~
I am not ready to label him a failure or to get rid of him, but his first season has been abysmal. Hope he can regain his focus over the summer and start fresh next season.

7258~~~
I think he's worth another season at the very least.

Hell, despite how bad he's been, he did start well enough... and put in the best individual performance by any one of our players this season.

7259~~~
He was pretty rubbish from the get go imo. Only played well against seriously poor teams.

I genuinely think Bebe has added more value.

7260~~~
I'm not sure he would get a game under Jose

7261~~~
The suggestion that he isn't tracking back is increasingly unfair. He's been extremely poor, but he's been putting in more of a shift in recent weeks.

When it comes to wingers there is usually the narrative that <i>flair = lazy. </i>Nani suffered from it in spite of working back just as much as either Valencia and Young. Being predictable and a little bit shite doesn't necessarily mean that you're some sort of reliable workhorse.

Memphis is worth another season, I think. Although I can't help but worry that he seems to lack so many of the basics.

7262~~~
Someone said he needs a new manager, preferably Mourinho. Lol
Mourinho doesn't suffer fools. I would understand if they said someone like Ancelotti or Hiddink or Klopp who doesn't mind being soft on players.

7263~~~
I agree. If it was another manager, I'd think he could improve, but I don't think he'd get into team in his usual position.

7264~~~
Why compare him with Smalling who can run? Smalling is rapid. The problem is, Blind has a better change of pace from a standstill than what Memphis displays, and that is worrysome.

7265~~~
I would give another season, he's still young and it's a hard league to get used to, but he has been very bad. 

I was wondering, has a player turned it around with us after a really bad season?

7266~~~
He's been poor but he should get another season at least

7267~~~
I have a sneaky feeling that Depay will be the best player on the pitch for the rest of the league season. He has been rested and has had a taste of playing again.

7268~~~
Andy Cole is the main one that springs to mind.

7269~~~
If Martial and Rashford are fit, he'll benched. Van Gaal knows the importance of this three games.

7270~~~
A) By "rest" you mean two games? and B) He just played the last game and was terrible.

You might be right but you sound like we've got 10 games left and he's all set to return after chilling for the past month or two.

7271~~~
Depay is like Nani. He has the X-factor. The bit of guile and threat. He has been kicked out of his best position and rightly so by Martial. Now he has the chance to prove his doubters wrong. Why not now?

7272~~~
Nani was good though. Depays x factor only comes when playing shit teams like Brugge and Midgyland

7273~~~
Have you been watching the same player as all of us this season?

He was the worst player on the pitch on Saturday. One of the worst performance by a United player I can remember. He lost the ball or gave it away pretty much everytime he received it.

7274~~~
Yes I watched it and I agree. But this is really his chance now. Let's see him play another game and see how it goes. Just make sure he is not the last man defending down the left.

7275~~~
I really don't think he has the mentality to be a good player in this league.

Strikes me as the stroppy child type when things aren't going his way.

Not writing him off just yet, but it's not looking promising.

7276~~~
He isn't, he hasn't, because he's mentally fragile/shite at the moment and shown nothing to suggest that he'll magically become remotely useful in next 3 games and funnily enough those 3 games are pretty much season defining - from absolute failure to somewhat acceptable.

7277~~~
I hope that happens but with Nani his natural ability was very very obvious. He always stood out. We need to at least see that with Memphis even if he doesn't get goals or assists.

7278~~~
He's in very poor form but overall, I think he's not that good, and reminds me of Lucas Moura. Even at his best, he'll not be anything special, because he simply doesn't stand out.

7279~~~
Depay isn't anywhere close to Nani.

7280~~~
PSV really took us to the cleaners with Depay. £27m! He doesn't even look like he's worth £15m

His contract was leaked and I think it said that his wage was £5.2m a year and will rise by over a million each year we are in the CL (for two seasons). Going to be hard moving him on when he's on such a big wage

7281~~~
He'll come good...quote me in 2 years time.

7282~~~
We aren't watching the same player.

7283~~~
He'll probably be on the pitch against West Ham since Martial is injured. I'm dreading

7284~~~
I hope not. Can't carry passengers now, looks like his confidence is gone and he repeatedly moped on the floor when tackled against Norwich.

He really needs to toughen up if he wants to make it here.

7285~~~
The leaked contract said £5m + bonuses during seasons in which we are in the CL, £4m+ bonuses during seasons in which we aren't in the CL. If United take up the 1 year option at the end of his contract, then his salary goes up by £1m I think though can't quite remember the figure.

I agree that it is hard to imagine any other club wanting to pay him a similar amount, given his performances this year and the lack of evidence that he can deliver against reasonable defences. A year ago he had PSG, Liverpool and Man United interested in buying him, which probably explains his current salary.

7286~~~
Poor guy. Feel like I am one of the few who still has faith in him - ridiculous if you think he is a young guy in his first season who has shown remarkable inconsistency, had some bad games but some moments of genuine class.

We will see this summer how he gets on, if he angles to leave or if he gets his head down on the pre season. Who knows if Mourinho/whoever is in charge will see a place for him in the squad.

I really want him to make it and am happy to support him through a rough season. If, however, this form continues through a second season and he shows no signs of becoming more consistent and realising the potential he clearly has then I will have no problem seeing him leave.

I was watching videos of Ronaldo when he joined and realised something. Ronaldo (in his first couple of seasons) played in a team that would usually win regardless of whether he played or not, therefore his mistakes (and I was shocked at how many there were, skills that broke down moves when they failed, bad decisions, pulling out of tackles etc) did not have consequences. Compare that to Depay who is in a struggling United team who really need everyone to play well in order to win and any mistake is criminal.

7287~~~
I still believe he can make it.

7288~~~
Really hope he doesnt start. West Ham seem to be really up for this game. We cant afford to carry anyone tonight.Its the second biggest game of our season.

If Van Gaal persists and he starts, please show us something. Anything.

7289~~~
This 

It's so easy to give up on players these days. When I remember how well Darmian, Schneiderlin, Memphis and Herrera were performing before joining United, I still hold hope for them. I do not regret us signing anyone of them but I regret them signing for LvG. Not only have they moved from a different league and that takes some time to adapt but they have moved to a club in depression and under the dictatorship of LvG. Almost like Kagawa in the Moyes era, some called him names like the worst player they had ever seen, similar to what many United fans refer to many of our players, he has gone back to Dortmund and he is performing much better in a happier environment. I will not be critical of them in their first year, and under LvG

7290~~~
Except Ronaldo had lots of moments where his talent was unquestionable. Same with Nani. And speaking for myself defensive weakness, lack of tracking back etc.. rank very low on the list of negatives. His impotency going forward and the fact that he looks plain shite is rather more worrying.

7291~~~
Let's hope we don't need to see this dickhead start one more game this season. He's the worst type of player I've ever seen. Both Nani and Ronaldo comes nowhere near the selfishness Memphis shows. I just HATE everything about him. I don't even celebrate the goals any more (not that there are many). Just what the hell is wrong with him. Two "mistakes" that would have made SAF boil over (that half arsed header back and the horrible play with no tracking back situations). I'm just thinking about a guy like Johnny Evans who was executed in public for not clearing the ball in a dangerous area against Milan (nothing happened anyway).

I know this opinion won't go down well with the Memphis club. Thing is your arguments are getting really thin guys.

7292~~~
A bleak evening for Tennessee, even Januzaj got the nod ahead of him.

7293~~~
Well to be honest, he had to give Januzaj some game time bearing in mind what happened at Norwich to Januzaj <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7294~~~
That left wing spot is gone now. 

Does he want to be a benchwarmer here? That's for him to decide.

7295~~~
People are nuts in here if they think Memphis will take over that left wing from Martial. And since he aint good enough anywhere else, so where exactly is he going to time?

7296~~~
Growing in those Harley Race mutton chops.

7297~~~
<span style="color: inherit">Probably the best performance analysis of Memphis.</span>

7298~~~
So Memphis ends his PL season with 2 goals and 1 assist from 16 starts and 13 sub appearances (1475 mins). Those two goals came from 21 shots inside the penalty area, while he failed to score from any of his 37 attempts from outside the box (in the PL). He created marginally fewer chances per 90 mins than Jesse Lingard; indeed Lingard out-performed him on most stats in PL matches. And then there was the header in the vague direction of De Gea at Stoke, which Squawka categorise as an error leading to a goal.

I suppose the relevant questions are:

- can he recover from such a shocking first season in english football ?

- should whoever happens to be in charge next season, even be giving Memphis playing time in the PL ahead of Januzaj or Pereira ?

- is Memphis mentally strong enough to cope with being cover for Martial ?

- or is there another position he can play for us, rather than left wing ?

- finally, keep, loan or sell ?

7299~~~
He's got talent but plays with no intelligence. If you look at Martial's assist today, he dribbled up to the defender, got close and then released the ball for a 1-2 pass. Memphis would probably just run into the defender and get tackled. 

If it is Mourinho that comes in then I don't know if he would have any patience with him (Quaresma at Inter).

7300~~~
Was the last straw for me. He's an idiot. 
Brought on with minutes to go & at one stage stopped running only for the entire crowd to jump in his back. Absolutely braindead. 
His shooting is unbelievably bad, they must have had some big-a$$ goals in Holland, or else they place them near the corner flag or row z. 
Young came off the bench and put Memphis to shame. He really has been a complete flop & I can't see him improving.

7301~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

7302~~~
He has been astonishingly bad. 

There must be some talent there, though, surely. I would keep him I think.

7303~~~
If he's not a vastly improved player when he comes back to training under (hopefully) the new manager, then he has to go out on a loan or sold with a buyback option.

7304~~~
It's his on the field attitude which disappoints me the most. Very few players can get a way with giving up and throwing their arms in the air when they lose the ball - this guy is certainly not one of them.

He's Van Gaal's signing so surely he would be getting chances if he was producing the goods in training. What a failure of a debut season it has been for him, and surely he has only got himself to blame.

Very frustrating player to watch. So far, from what I've seen, he seems like a more inconsistent Nani, with half the talent. He was top goalscorer last season in the Dutch league and player of the season, so there must be a talented player in there somewhere. 

He needs to sort his attitude out or he will be the first one to be shown the door, and I doubt many of us would give a shit.

7305~~~
sums up his season
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/9l40" width="560"></iframe>

7306~~~
Dropped from the squad completely.

He's done

7307~~~

7308~~~
Must be unfit

7309~~~
Doesn't mean much, more likely that LVG will be gone than Memphis. He's been terrible but he deserves another season. No reason to sell him anyway, we won't get our money back.

7310~~~
Can't really argue with that can he?

In a season when most of our attacking players have been terrible he's still managed to stand out in his awfulness.

I think he'll be gone in the Summer, even if Jose comes in. Can't see him liking Memphis.

7311~~~
Needs to just write this season off and start afresh next season under a new manager.

7312~~~
He knows he hasn't been good enough. Better to just get on with it the next season.

7313~~~
I didn't expect when we bought him that we'd get to the end of the season and I'd be way more disappointed that Cameron Borthwick-Jackson was being dropped for our biggest game of the season than Memphis.

7314~~~
One positive is that the chances of us having to pay the add-ons to the transfer are severely decreased after his dire season.

7315~~~
Season has ended, focus on next season. Very dissapointing, make or break season next year, and it's his own fault. Also shows that stats are so deceptive, 7 goals and 9 assists this season...You'd think he was decent.

7316~~~
Don't we all.

7317~~~
So...next season is make or break for him.

7318~~~
Definitely needs to be sold or at least put on loan next season. Is nowhere near the level to even provide decent squad cover next year. I never saw him in Holland but I'd love to know what our scouts saw in him, what attributes apart from having a decent shot when put under no pressure whatsoever does he possess?

We leave it another year and the potential for a £25m sale to China diminishes.

7319~~~
Are you including under 21 stats for those numbers?

Edit - seems like that number includes 3 assists for the under 21s. 

29 PL apps 
2 goals and 1 assist 
6 CL apps 
1 goal and 0 assists 
Europa 
2 goals and 1 assist (all against Midgyland I think) 
FA Cup 
1 assist which was against league 1 Sheffield United 
CL qualifiers 
2 games 2 goals and 2 assists (club Brugge) 
U21 
1 games 3 assists

7320~~~
At some point,I think we'll have to bite the bullet on the loss. 

If he flops next season,I'd send him on loan in Jan with a view to selling him in the Summer. It's up to him to prove his worth.

7321~~~
Look, he's been thrash, I'm hardly surprised. I definitely don't want him sold though, he deserves another season under a new manager.

7322~~~
Completely agree with this, if he doesn't improve and soon we will have to cut our losses. Just think he deserves a shot under a new manager at least.

7323~~~
Yes,that's why I wouldn't sell him this Summer. But I  would let him and his entourage know that this season has been unacceptable,and another one like this will get him canned.

7324~~~
Hopefully at a new club as well.

7325~~~

7326~~~
I think there's a decent chance both will be gone.

7327~~~
IMO, he's hardly going to play under Mourinho.

7328~~~
Thrown a full tantrum and refused to travel, according to Jeremy Cross. This'll get interesting.

7329~~~
Is this even that surprising? No way would I trust him in a final. The only way he'd have got minutes on the pitch would be if we were comfortably winning.

I'd like to see him given a second season but if the rumours that he's refused to travel are true then he can feck off. He's done nowhere near enough to be entitled to such a reaction.

7330~~~

7331~~~
It's the daily star...

7332~~~
He might have decided to drive down tomorrow and so he don't have to stay in a hotel over night.

Did CBJ get on the the coach?

7333~~~
I'd back him in a fight against Aloysius to be fair.

7334~~~
Lets see what kind of discipline Louis delivers to his illegitimate son.

7335~~~
We really know how to pick 'em. First Di Maria and now this guy.

7336~~~
Throwing a strop would be consistent with him being the new Ronaldo.

7337~~~
It might be a good idea to try and cash in on him this summer. With Martial playing brilliantly on the left, he's unlikely to get many chances because he can't really play anywhere else. He also has attitude problems. Considering we signed him for £30 million we might have to take a £15 million loss.

7338~~~
Can't think of a single occasion that Ronnie missed a football reality activity due to stroppiness? He was pathologically professional.

7339~~~
He was a bit stroppy at times when he didn't get the pass he wanted

7340~~~
The modern day footballer. He certainly won't be the last to throw it all away.

7341~~~
Players not in the squad have never traveled before, why would Memphis be travelling now?

7342~~~
Martial plays in his position. Sell him and get a right winger.

7343~~~
Where is NL_Max to answer these questions ?

7344~~~
Should we not wait for a half decent source before slating him?

7345~~~
He needs another season, LVG really does not know how to handle certain players. He'd have probably dropped Ronaldo because he was too greedy and alienated him from the club. His man management is shocking, sure you can talk about how the modern footballer is a prima donna, and even if that is the case, you still need to know how to manage them. This guy isn't a lost cause like Ravel Morrison, he's a talented young player who is frustrated at how his season has turned out. It would be a huge mistake to sell him already, we wouldn't recoup the money and he could still become a top player.

7346~~~
I remember Ronaldo walking off v Sunderland when he got injured. Just booted the ball off the pitch and walked off when it was 0-0. Didn't give us time to get a sub ready either. Not exactly the same but he was very prone to acting like a spoilt brat and obviously he got away with it.

7347~~~
Think they usually do for a cup final.

7348~~~
Whether it's true or not - is of no actual relevance. Anybody who watch us play this season saw that Depay is extremely unprofessional and uncommitted. He simply gets his huge paycheck and could not be bother really.
And clearly LVG methods are not working, with the exception of couple of solid games he was awful even when LVG finally dropped him. So LVG could not motivate him.

7349~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

7350~~~
Looks like you're gonna have to open another thread asking for a name change again!

7351~~~
Not that surprising since I wouldn't want him anywhere near the pitch myself. His signing and performance this season is another massive failure to lay at LVG's door.

7352~~~
Oh right, I guess they'd all go for the trophy celebration and all that craic.

7353~~~
Oh dear oh dear. Probably told he's not in the squad and he's flipped out, can't say I blame him for being upset.

fear that's the last we've seen of him. Crazy though as under a new manager it could be so different.

7354~~~
Can only hope he turns things around at the Euros and comes back with a clear head under a new manager. Still has youth on his side.

7355~~~
Mem-pissed off.

7356~~~
It gets your attention at first, then you realize that we're not losing anything by not having him in the squad.  He's been absolutely abysmal.

Now, whether or not it's LVG's way of doing things that's making things worse for him, or if it's an attitude problem, or if he's really just a shit player we spent too much money on, that will have to be sorted out by the club.  All I know is that he's acted unprofessionally and should be only watching tomorrow at home.

7357~~~
It's not funny that way.

7358~~~
£140m down the drain

7359~~~
Clearly there needs to be extra screening for tatted lads.

7360~~~
Netherlands didn't qualify.

7361~~~
The security guard might do a better job than Memphis to be fair.

7362~~~
Hopefully we recoup a reasonable fee for him this summer. No point keeping him another year as his stock plummets further.

7363~~~
Or when he didn't get a decision and just sat down moping for a while whilst the game went on.

7364~~~
That part puzzled me as well. CBJ has not travelled, so why would Memphis?

7365~~~
In the case of a late injury?

7366~~~
pretty sure i read that the entire team will be there, injured players and all... i can't imagine it any other way. i'd suspect that the players up for selection (the 18), would travel separately but i can't imagine we wouldn't have our entire team there.

7367~~~
And what happens when he gets injured or a striker and may want to push Martial up top?

Yeah he's been well below average this season but after one season people are ready to ship him off? Not too many creative players seem to thrive under Van Gaal at United, it's more in spite of him.

7368~~~
precisely. i'd love to see how great martial and rashford could play under a manager who understands that goals are an important part of the game of football.

7369~~~
Apparently everyone is going because it is a cup final. Makes sense I guess so they are all there for the celebration if we win even if they aren't in this matchday squad. 

We have one less on the bench, has happened to us a few times this season. It doesn't necessarily make sense, but it is the way it has been done.

7370~~~
Remember this time last year when we were already worried he'd be Madrid-bound in 2-3 years before even kicking a ball for United?

Wild optimism soaked in fear. Those were good times.

7371~~~
The bolded is why I'm so willing to let him go. I haven't seen a shred this season, particularly against semi-decent opposition that backs up that he's talented or that he could ever be a top player.

The closest he's come to either is making Lingard look like a very talented, potentially top class player by comparison.

7372~~~
Like Depay, deserves a proper chance under a real United manager.

7373~~~
I still have no idea what happened with him. He is definitely talented, I watched most of PSV games last season. But now, he looks like a different player.

He was also good taking freekicks, I hope he can improve next season. I think he would be better in a 433 because as far as I remember, he used to be more a finisher than a creator.

7374~~~
At least he knows he is shit and doesnt deserve to be there on merit. Like it, hopefully he feels embarrassed of himself and starts to focus. Make or break season if we keep him.

7375~~~
LvG specifically waited one year before signing him. Perhaps he should wait more... doesn't mean the player is finished here.

7376~~~
Playing without Shaw is the biggest reason.. It has nothing to do with LVG, playing in the PL was just too hard for him and without his LB, it became impossible. Hoping he can get some rest and comes beck all guns blazing staring pre-season..

7377~~~
Dont agree with that. Yes he's been shite but im sure he's as annoyed about that as anyone.

From what ive seen and heard of him in interviews he seems incredibly driven. Plenty of articles when we signed him about the work he does on the training ground and adamant about wanting to work hard to be the best player in the world. You can also tell by his incredible physique that this is a player that looks after himself.

He's young and in his first season in a new country. He's already admitted to struggling hugely with the speed of the game in england. He has the weight of a big money transfer, being hopelessly out of form and being in and out of the side.

I have my doubts with him but i dont think its a bad thing if hes threw the toys out at being dropped. Again it shows he cares, and contradicts what you're saying about collecting his paycheck and not being bothered.

7378~~~
I would rather Depay in the squad if we need a goal late on.I hope he keeps working hard over the summer, he is a talented boy. Maybe the attitude is the problem, more than likely lvg is the problem. He has shattered his confidence on the pitch. Hopefully tomorrow is the last of Van Gaal's decisions. A new manager and Depay could get a new lease of life, just hope he's still here and we reap the rewards.

7379~~~
Playing without Shaw doesn't give him a bad touch or make him look clumsy. I like Depay, but he doesn't look like he could be a top player at the moment.

7380~~~
It's clear that he is struggling against better players now that he has arrived in the Premier League.

The fact that we are playing a slow style isn't helping him as he is mostly suited to counter attacking football. 
But it doesn't excuse him for being too slow to react or making wrong decisions.

Should he get a chance next season? Probably, but Martial is the LW for now and the coming future and the idea of him playing on the right doesn't seem realistic because that isn't his position.
He could waste another year staying with us, and being the ambitious guy i think he is, maybe he will ask for a loan or to be sold.

7381~~~
<a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a> what do you say!!?? Lets take this curse off of him once and for all!

7382~~~
Nope, we're not letting you curse another player.

7383~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I know. Looks like i even jinxed Terry with my brief spell <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

7384~~~
Are you a sports psychologist?

7385~~~
You don't have to be one to see how bad his attitude was in the Arsenal and Chelsea away games

7386~~~
fixed

7387~~~
iamdebruyne?
Curse everyone else imo

7388~~~
Oh shit, completely forgot

Well, he'll have plenty of time to get his head on straight then

7389~~~
Just give him a normal name FFS, the Fecking curse. 

Just change his name to Albert, and have him stick with it.

7390~~~
It's a cup final though, doesn't the whole squad tend to attend?

7391~~~
"iammartial"... 7th January 2017 Martial gets sold to Stoke

7392~~~
You probably cursed United too.<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

7393~~~
Haha probably, I won't be changing my username to curse the next manager.

7394~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3601392/Memphis-Depay-cut-Manchester-United-squad-FA-Cup-final.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...cut-Manchester-United-squad-FA-Cup-final.html</a>

Depay done.  Not done delio.  Just done.

7395~~~
Not surprising though is it? He's clearly fallen way out of favour with LVG. 

Definitely something to this lad though. Early on him and Shaw were ripping it up down the left and although it was against minnows he tore it up during that Europa League match. Put in a seriously mature and dedicated display against Arsenal at home as well. He's had an abundance of shocking moments, abject displays and underwhelming sub appearances but for some reason I can see him succeeding here providing the next manager believes in him (and he puts in the effort).

7396~~~
I would send him on loan next season to another PL team.We need to see whether he can adapt/raise his game to play the PL but we can't afford to carry a passenger for another season.Both Lingard and Januzaj have shown more in the PL than him and we definitely are going to sign some attackers.

7397~~~
If the various articles are true, then he has an attitude problem.  He needs to adjust mentally and I don't think he has come around to the fact that this is United he is playing for and that he is no longer the main man.

7398~~~
Players have known about the team selection for 2 days according to van Gaal, unless Memphis has some off the scale cognitive problems then I'd suggest he probably didn't storm off.

7399~~~
Just give him "iamfellaini" as the final insult

7400~~~
There were a few stories/leaks sometime ago that Giggs was coaching him, one on one....
About a month later, there were stories that Giggs had given up on him.

For what it's worth, I never did rate him. His attitude is ridiculous, he has cost us several points and he hasn't seemed to have adapted his game at all

7401~~~
Was anyone else wondering why Memphis was wearing a high vis whilst passing his boots into the security guy's booth?  Took me about 1.4 seconds to screw my head on.

7402~~~
How do we know he was not collecting those shoes with a shiny new M7 on it?

7403~~~
His last performance was pathetic and so it cost him.

7404~~~
A lot of talk of Depay being finished at United due to being dropped for the final but is he really thought?

If LvG feels he can't trust Memphis to put in a performance, in what is probably his last game in charge of United, then no wonder he's not picked him.

7405~~~
Iamguardiola?

7406~~~

7407~~~
Killer beard!

7408~~~
Should be on the bench imho, if we need someone who can get a goal late on we're very short on options (not that he's a particularly good one)

7409~~~
What's with the fanny strip of a moustache?

7410~~~
So whats going on with Memphis....

7411~~~
He's in trouble next season now that Mourinho is joining.

7412~~~
He was on the pitch at the end of the game.

7413~~~
Any pics of him celebrating with the squad or anything?

7414~~~
Doesn't look disgruntled or pissed off here. Seems absolutely delighted for Lingard.

7415~~~
Hopefully he gets a chance next season. I do think having a competent LB will help him especially when cutting inside. Hes not as fast as Martial, but I actually think hes got a better shot on him. Think his confidence was drained from him this season, but hopefully a good pre-season helps him out.

7416~~~
Reckon he's the type that needs to be inspired, because he looked fecking uninspired on the pitch at times this season. Have a feeling Mourinho's the type get his blood pumping, really hope he has a good 16/17 season.

7417~~~
I think he's been mis-managed this season. Yes he's a flash little shite, but he's a bloomin talented one. I feel he lost his place, was isolated, benched, never given a shot to redeem himself and as a result his confidence went down the pan. Your not going to improve from the stands. This is a 21 year old kid that was the Dutch top scorer two years ago. This is the Premier League, a significant step up in quality, yes he's going to be inconsistent, yes he's going to frustrate, yes he's going to make mistakes but let him, it's called development. I don't rate how he's been chastised by the fans this year at all. Hopefully he gets given a chance to prove himself next season, I don't think Van Gaal gave him the opportunity.

7418~~~
Rubbish. Van Gaal started him plenty for the three months of the season and he showed absolutely nothing aside from a couple of good performance against Brugge who were abysmal. When he has played since then he has been awful and a complete liability. There hasn't been inconsistency. He has been consistently one of our worst players.

7419~~~
It was unfair to drop Young for Memphis early in the season, when he got plenty of chances. As season progressed, van Gaal even shifted Martial to the right wing to make place for Depay, who isn't capable of playing anywhere else it seems. 

Sorry but blaming manager for not giving him chances is absolutely wrong. He shouldn't be anywhere near the squad IMO.

7420~~~
Played him plenty for three months...that makes no sense. The season runs over 10. Again, he's a 21 year old kid that's just moved to a new league, the most competitive and hardest league in the world at that. What was you expecting, a world beater? No he hasn't been great this year, he's had horrendous performances alongside a couple very good ones but as I said I don't know how we expect him to improve from the stands. I hope he's given the chance to prove people wrong and show his capabilities next season, the boy has bags of talent but it's up to him to unearth it. I just don't feel giving a youngster a year to set the Premier League alight is realistic or fair.

7421~~~
A player with any discernible qualities apart from the ability to shoot adaquately when allowed to run towards goal unchallenged.

He has the Mourinho loan with option to sell written all over him.

7422~~~
He has more starts and more minutes than Ronaldo did in his first season. Sorry but to suggest he hasn't had chances is patently rubbish. He's got more chances than his performances have merited.

7423~~~
This is what I mean, early in the season. He landed in Manchester in June and because he didn't immediately adjust to the Premiership he seems to have been instantly written off. Don't get me wrong, you need to earn your place, and Memphis is no different. I'm not saying he should be a starter right now at all, he shouldn't, but the kid has barely kicked a football the best part of 2016. He's not going to improve if not playing and not gaining the experience required to be a success in the league. Perhaps saying Van Gaal hasn't given him any opportunity was slighly wrong, but in my opinion he hasn't given him enough. Giving him a couple months at the beginning of the season isn't significant enough for him to adjust. Just my opinion however. I hope he gets given another year to pull his socks up, get his head down and show the talent he has. He has a lot of work to do however.

7424~~~
He had three months to do anything that justified the hype around him which was plenty. He never once made an impression in the PL and Van Gaal rightly dropped him. What did you expect him to do? Play with effectively ten men for the entire season? After that he still had regular appearances on the pitch and still his performances didn't improve. I didn't expect him to be amazing but he has been so bad and I honestly don't really any of his supposed talent. Nani was inconsistent but you could see his talent, Depay isn't even close to that level.

7425~~~
He's not the first player who was surrounded by hype to come to the league and not carry on as previously shown. We've just finished 5th in the league, the whole team barring a few obvious exceptions have generally been bad. We've been abysmal as a whole. By all means no player should be starting if they are not merited and I don't feel Memphis should be given special treatment, but I have to disagree with you regarding not being able to see his talent. When we signed him last year his talent and potential was unquestionable and everyone was excited about seeing him fulfil it. After one bad year that hasn't changed for me. It took Nani until he was 25-26 to finally do something with his talent, why write off Memphis at 21? Granted he's had a bad start to his United career, but I don't see how isolating him will help the situation. He's clearly short on confidence, and when that happens nothing you try comes off. Give him another year, let him get the chance to redeem himself, if it doesn't work out....well we just Di Maria it I guess.

7426~~~
I'm not writing him off and I don't want the club to sell him as I'd like to see him play in a functioning team. Just disagreed with your statement that he didn't have opportunities this season.

7427~~~
It's utopia- impossible to give every young player a lot of playing time throughout the season. Like it or not, for club like ours either you show you're worth investing in or not. For me Januzaj and Pereira should be ahead of Memphis because I actually see a talent in them. Depay looks bang average, plus I'd question his attitude on the pitch. 

The point is how do you rate our youngsters, but considering Memphis can only play one position I'd say get rid.

7428~~~
Spot on. 

People writing him off and yet Januzaj should be playing and he's been far worse. Double standards everywhere in this place.

7429~~~
I'm not defending Januzaj but he has shown far more at United than Depay.

7430~~~
His poor season is on him. The LW spot is the one area where whoever played there whether it was Martial, Memphis, Lingard or Young got the freedom to take a man on and play attacking football. You can't use the LvG handcuffed them excuse for Memphis. He just wasn't good enough. Fortunately he's still young and has time on his side to improve.

7431~~~
The boy has a lot of work ahead of him if he wants to be a part of a Mourinho team.

7432~~~
No, same as you, and as i suspect you have nothing to do with football professionally. Does not exactly mean you can't judge whether a team or a certain footballer plays good or bad.
So it's kind of stupid remark really. And with a case like Depay not only does it not take a professional to pinpoint his problems, it does not take like anyone at all really. I mean most United fans would agree the guy has sever lack of discipline, dedication and professionalism.

7433~~~
Memphis has played 2,464 minutes this season, that is the 11th most in the squad. He has been shit against Premier League opposition and it sure as shit isn't because he wasn't given a chance. Andreas' 371 minutes and Adnan's 261 minutes are not chances, being the 11th most played player in the squad is being given a chance.

7434~~~
Half or more than half of those minutes were at the beginning of the season when he was actually doing well. He was scoring back then. Its the last 6 months or so where he hasn't played enough or been using primarily as a sub.

7435~~~
He wasn't scoring back then and he wasn't doing well outside of poor European competition where he continued to get to play in later in the season against Midtjylland. Outside of Watford away and maybe 1 or 2 other games he hasn't performed well against Premier League opposition at the beginning or the end of the season.

Since the start of February he has played 850 minutes, your last 6 months so start of December is 1270 minutes. That is more than half of his playing time in the last 6 months. His playing time since February is only about 10% proportionally less than would have been expected averaging his playing time across the season. He has played more since February than Adnan and Andreas have combined all season. 

So, no I will not accept that the 11th most played player in the squad can use the lack of playing time as an excuse.

7436~~~
Wait I wasn't complaining about his lack of playing time. I never used that as an argument. The only thing I did say was he started pre-season and the regular season brightly continuing his form from the season before. But as we started to struggle from end of November onwards, his struggles doubled as well. That coupled with the fact that Shaw was injured and the constant chopping and changing of players and formation didn't help as well. So what I am saying lets not be quick to judge him. No one did well this year except three to four players. So lets give him and everyone else like Morgan and Bastian another season before we judge them.

7437~~~
You said in the last 6 months or so he hasn't played enough. Sounds like complaining about a lack of playing time to me.

I never said anything about getting rid of him and I want him to stay next season. I am just against the excuse, which has been used by posters on the last few pages and other threads, that he hasn't gotten enough playing time or a run of games because it is simply untrue.

7438~~~
Sorry, I did few years of youth coaching so once again you have just continued in the same frame. You said, that he was extremely unprofessional and uncommitted. Unless you are his coach or you know him personally, how can you tell? Unless you are a sports psychologist which I asked in all seriousness but instead you just come out all guns blazing aimlessly. 

While I was coaching, we were always told to remember that players are human beings too and many struggle with confidence issues aside from lack of physical, technical and tactical ability. I did most of my training is strength and conditioning with some tactical coaching and I have seen a lot of young players give their everything in the gym, individually and with the team but still struggle to apply themselves on the pitch. I would not say that it was extremely unprofessional and uncommitted, which is extremely harsh unless you know the player or work with him. To say he has a severe lack of discipline, dedication and professionalism is just ridiculous when you are limited to what you see on TV or live. 

He's been poor, fine. He's been crap, fine. It hasn't worked out for him, fine. But you cannot say that he unprofessional. I hope you are not one of those that think fancy cars and clothes make a player unprofessional.

7439~~~
So does this suggest you know nothing about senior football?
Well if you've asked why i thought so, how could i tell etc i would have responded "seriously", but you asked a very ridiculous question. The question is actually more stupid if you think about it because even i was a world renowned sports psychologist, it would not mean i had sessions wih Depay and/or know him personally.

As for why i think so. For example we can take Lingard. Maybe even not the one in the second half of the season when he raised his game but before that. When given a chance, he tried, skill and talent is something you don't necessarily control, but work-rate is. In most of his games, esp when he was subbed on Depay's one was literally non-existed. In other instances he simply lacked concentration, like against Chelsea at OT. Again something that directly tied to one's determination and desire rather than a natural skill. And there is his tantrums, like the one he had before FA Cup final. If Depay was completely different and committed in training, LVG would not have dropped him. Moreover it's likely to manifest on the pitch as well. We can look at Fellaini, for all his shortcomings his commitment, his diligence could not be faulted. He had bad first half of the season with only some good games, was bad during winter, but he worked and worked and because of that he was given more chance and he was fine in the closing stages.
No but falling out with the manager on the eve of Cup Final kinda does.

7440~~~
it is going to be hard for him, unless somehow miraculously he improve with his form. he was signed as a LWF but LVG somehow tried him as a no.10 during pre season but started him on the wing for the first game of the season. and now the position is martial's to lose and i just could not see a way for memphis to get ahead of martial now. could not think of another position for him as well. playing on the right limited his chance of cutting inside, and he is not a CF.

7441~~~
Lets see what he does under new manager. The next season will be the real test to know if he has any kind of zeal to become a star on the pitch or his stardom ends with driving around in costly cars.
Anyways, is he is competing with Martial, he has little chance. 

But every season is a new season, where old heroes might not go ahead and old villians become new heroes. Let's see how it goes.

7442~~~
You are still recycling the same thing. You know nothing beyond what everyone sees on the pitch and what you hear in the media. If you can not differentiate being unprofessional and lacking concentration or ability, good for you.

7443~~~
He mentions the FA cup and how he wasn't in it. Doesn't seem to complain much about it.

7444~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's just video to gloat about the resort he is staying at.

7445~~~
do you not think Martial will be moved to a central position in the near future - bit like Henry.  That would open up the position for Memphis.  Not given up on the kid yet.  Might thrive under a different manager.

7446~~~
Do you want LvG's postcode, buddy?

7447~~~
I am pretty sure we wiLl be buying more attackes who will be instantly ahead of Memphis.

7448~~~
<a class="username" data-user="93460, @Adisa" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93460/">@Adisa</a> most likely yes, but i still think with the right manager and work his butt off he can become what we were hoping for.  Can't give up on a 21 year old player after just one season

7449~~~
Don't think LVG was the right manager for him after all. He needs somebody who can build him up and give him belief, rather than the tough love LVG effect.

7450~~~
Memphis was at his best in Holland when breaking with pace. Defenders in the EPL are faster and stronger, but it's not a stretch that he'd do better under Mourinho. His former club always played this way too. If he can beat defenders on the break, he's a good option off the bench and can build towards more.

7451~~~
Of course. I never disputed that. The thing you fail to understand is it is more that enough to judge whether he was professional or not.

7452~~~
We will just agree to disagree, which I have no problem with. I just don't know how a fan can call a footballer severely unprofessional, uncommitted, ill disciplined  and whatever else you called him without being privy to any inside knowledge or working with the player. You, like any other fan don't how much work he puts in the gym, how well he looks after himself, how much work he does individually, how much ambition he has, what his personal goals are, whether he is happy or not etc and yet with only a couple minutes a month you have more than enough to decide on his professionalism.
I'm not sure how he would have led his team to a league victory in the Eredivisie, be the best player in the league, make the WC squad and do reasonably well enough to earn a move to Manchester United. But after 9 months under LVG you have concluded on your opinion. Each to their own.

7453~~~
Because football fans are a bunch of conceited loudmouths who love nothing better than slagging off whoever is the current most hated person at their club.

7454~~~
Easy, when he was doing all that he was not getting crazy money.
And I have explained it at length. If a player can't even pt in work-rate, something that has nothing to do with confidence, level of play etc, it's obvious he is just not determined enough.

7455~~~
just saying it is going to be tough for him, never said it is definitely over.

7456~~~

7457~~~
Fair to say he doesn't seem to unhappy about it.

7458~~~
I would give Memphis another season. You don't turn into a shit player after such a good season with club and country. Lack of confidence can make or break these type of players.

7459~~~
We aren't selling a player that cost us 30m last year, don't see why people think we would. 1 season doesn't make or break a young player. Just because some fans have taken him on as their scapegoat.

7460~~~

7461~~~
I dont think it is a coincidence they bonded so quickly, both have the biggest butts in the squad. They probably squat together everyday.

7462~~~
While I just don't see him ever being world class, I think he simply lacks the football inteligence for that, he deserves a second chance under a new coach and show what he can do if has a manager that will give him some confidence in his ability.

7463~~~
Memphis and Luke, 
Playing on the wings
K-I-C-K-I-N-G
First comes a cross
Then comes a feint
Here comes the hat trick in the last minute!

7464~~~
Things have gone from bad to worse, if we believe the rumors his no 7 will be taken away from him as well, I can understand it, but it will demolish his confidence even more. Hope he has the drive to work his way back, otherwise he wont be here for long it seems.

7465~~~
If he doesn't improve next season under Jose, it's time to show him the door. He's got everything you'd want in a young wing prospect, except confidence. If he can't get back to somewhere near where he should be after a run in the side under Jose, it'll be time to cut our losses. Same goes for Januzaj, really. Ashley Young and Valencia are ready and waiting to take those backup winger spots.

7466~~~
fixed

7467~~~
Yeah this. I really want him to succeed. He needs another year. I think that goes for the majority who faltered this season, especially the new signings. Give them another go under a manager who won't totally sap all confidence out of everyone (at least I hope not) and see if there are signs of improvement. Hard to say if Memphis's future is here, but either way I think he is and will be a much better player than we saw this season.

7468~~~
iLike!!!

7469~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7470~~~
Are there rumours of that? It'll be ridiculous if they do it and frankly fecking childish. It is a number and people need to get over it. He has the number now and he should keep it.

7471~~~
When he gets turfed out of united I expect him to be just as gracious

7472~~~

7473~~~
Someone needs to have a word with him about that upholstery...

I think of all our players he is the one I will be most interested to watch develop (nor not develop) under Mou. I really want him to do well and like the fact he is a bit arrogant and deluded with his own image - I think you kind of need that to become a great player. Fingers crossed he will be.

If this message is being rerecorded this time next year, on your bike Memphis

7474~~~
That video says a lot to me about him. All these bollocks mottos and telling us how much he's dreaming, when the bottom line is he's been shit. He's all about his image. He's clearly not working as hard as he should be!

7475~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2016/May/memphis-depay-provides-strong-message-after-first-season-at-united.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...ong-message-after-first-season-at-united.aspx</a>

Hate to say it, but no, it was a bad year. Lots of improvement needed if he wishes to survive under Jose.

7476~~~
It's a given that he won't be sold this summer but I don't have any confidence on him turning the tide.

7477~~~
He's not a United player.....IMO

I think he's two ends of a bollocks tbh. Those recent videos reinforce my opinion

7478~~~
never bought the hype when we bought him and I've been critic of him, but i definitely want him to have more chances this new season. He is young and knows he has to do better. Sometimes shit doesn't come out the first try the way you wanted, but you keep trying.

7479~~~
Very terrible season but I'd give him another go. However, before memphis, I'd like us to give Januzaj a change. At least Janu has proved that he can do it on the highest level.

7480~~~
I disagree. Both ain't deserved any privileges. They both start a new chapter with the new manager. They need to impress him and earn the game time. There should be no order of who need the game time first, among those with unproven quality. Our priority is getting a strong starting XI and substitutes in order to meet / overachieve any expectations for this first season. Mourinho's not here to vindicate/criticize our past failed managers' man management or integrate youth, but to build his own team. I can't think of any serious team that change the formations and players every game like we was the last 3 years

7481~~~
He's arrogant and deluded (it hasn't been 50/50, more like 10/90), but it's good to see that his head hasn't dropped despite obviously falling out of favour with the previous manager. You need that arrogance to make it big - and despite what other posters say, I still think he is a talented player. He's 22, played under a manager that doesn't play to his style - lets see how he does under Mourinho - a manager that is known to be loved by players and getting the best out of them. 

Don't take the number 7 off him either - it's plain stupid and it's just a number

7482~~~
Not really. Martial doesn't appear to have that arrogance. Same with De Gea. Taking another extreme, Hernandez has definitely made it big, and has never had an arrogant attitude either. It works for some players, but it's not really a necessity.

7483~~~
He won't be sold but he's going to spend most of next season on the bench.

7484~~~
I blame LVG for much of the underperformance throughout the squad, but I fail to see how he held Depay back. Memphis is one of the few players who didn't look like he was being shackled; in other words, he appeared to have the freedom to attack and make things happen. He just failed miserably at doing so.

7485~~~
He will be an option on the right wing next season and rightly so imo. I think we missed a trick by not trying him there a bit more. In the second half against PSV away he played there and was our motm. 

He had a stinker of a season of course but I think he will be even more motivated under Jose and hopefully he can turn it around.

7486~~~
Unless he can change his mentality he has no chance.  Jose expects the very best from everyone and he'll see in training if he's not working hard.  I hope he can turn it around but I just don't see it personally.

7487~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

7488~~~
I can see him exploding under Jose to be honest.

7489~~~
Hopefully! Though I fear it may very much depend on who comes in this summer and what team starts the season.

I don't think he'll ever thrive from the bench, too reliant on form an confidence it seems. If he gets a good fullback behind him and a run of games he could be a player for us.

Would love him to start well and fulfill his talent with us.

7490~~~
I agree to some extend, he certainly did shoot a lot and it was horrible apart from a handful of shots, but as we know now that LvG sent his players e-mails in which he detailed all their mistakes, other players who had him before were complaining about that he sometimes endlessly treated around on any little mistake they made, constantly tried to correct them and while I'm sure he and his coaching staff did that to help his players improve it the constant criticism can have a detrimental effect on some players.

That being said I simply don't believe Depay has what it takes to be among the very best players, neither ability wise nor mentally. Somehow I get the same vibe from him that I get from Shaqiri, talented players but somehow it all doesn't really fit together to form a convincing package.

7491~~~
Should spend the summer purely working on acceleration and trimming some weight imo. He has the skill to beat a man, but it's pointless as he's not fast enough to use the space he creates.

7492~~~
Wonder how he will get on with Ibrahimovic. Can imagine being called out on his lack of effort and silly mottos if he doesn't pull his weight. If he really does believe everything he says hopefully he will step up next year.

7493~~~
I'm sure they do, you have to at a certain level but they don't display like Depay does. To become a top class professional, you have to believe in yourself, that you're the best etc etc..

7494~~~
Yeah, he was awful in the Premier League which is his bread and butter.

7495~~~
You kidding me, Ibra will come in like a father figure and convince him he can do everything.

7496~~~
Believing in yourself is not arrogance, it is confidence.

7497~~~
Hopefully Mourinho can Hazard Memphis up.

7498~~~
Absolute terrible so far, whats wrong with him.

7499~~~
Its arrogance when you can't back it up with performance

7500~~~
Confidence can easily become arrogance. You cannot be a top player if you don't have some form of ego and high self believe.

7501~~~
De Gea and Martial do just that.

But it hasn't with them (on the face of it).

And again, most people have some sort of self belief and ego. It doesn't mean they are arrogant.

Arrogant - having or revealing an <b>exaggerated </b>sense of one's own importance or abilities.

It's not really this big necessity. Humble players who are confident but arrogant have also been great players.

7502~~~
I'm basing this on no real proof but I'm 100% sure they are arrogant, I don't see it as a bad thing tbh. How they behave publicly can differ from player to player of course.

7503~~~
Netherlands could play with 10 men and not notice the difference.  He has a tendency to do things the easy way and that doesn't cut it on a level above the Eredivisie. He seems to have problems with focus and intensity. Nothing too problematic IMO. Should improve next season though.

7504~~~
A 2/10 performance... embarrasing really.

7505~~~
Still rather generous...

7506~~~
They certainly do, Memphis does not.

7507~~~
Why is that? Was there a period when he gained some confidence and played well? Have I missed something? 

I think that after "the Shaw" myth this cliche about condifence is the second I disagree the most with (no offence to you mate, just I can hear it often on the caf). He seems to have plenty of confidence and self belief, the more he struggles the more difficult shots or ridiculous driblings he tries.  He could be some player if he only had some skills.

7508~~~
A plus that he's not at the Euros. Take the summer (few weeks) to sort himself put mentally. Come back for pre-season determined and focussed. Prove yourself on the tour when, players like Martial and Rooney will be resting from the Euros, and earn your place in this team.

7509~~~
If he's smart, he'll come in lean and agile, not strong and bulked up. As I've been saying for a while, it'll work miracles for him. Whoever gave him the advice to bulk up is an idiot. That's not the type of player he is at all.

7510~~~
Getting slaughtered on Twitter. I simply don't think he has the talent to play at the highest level. It's nothing to do with confidence IMO.

7511~~~
I think a lot of its confidence personally, form is one of the biggest drivers in football and hugely understated

7512~~~
No, he's spot on. The 50/50 stuff was about the amount of games, and yes, he's started 27 games out of 59. Close enough.
He's probably talking from his own perspective, not yours... He's not just talking about how good he's been, but about his experience. Nothing wrong with what he's saying, actually I think it's good to hear that he's not too down about the season despite not doing well enough (which is his opinion too, you know) and reports of clashes with coaches.

He's basically saying it's been a tough year, it's been a new and difficult experience, but he's optimistic and he's going to work hard to get better. How is that used against him? I like the video, but he should probably stop doing them, because the fans will twist his words and used them against him, even when they're just making stuff up.

7513~~~
Is it the first time that a player has come to the PL and been told to <i>bulk down</i>? He has too much lean muscle mass and seems so laboured in his movements. Not very agile for a forward let alone a winger

7514~~~
Confidence could be a big contributor, but we could have another Nani on our hands or worse if his confidence continues to be this brittle. In saying that, I honestly think he deserves another season, and I'm looking toward to seeing how Mourinho handles him.

7515~~~
His confidence is absolutely shot. I'm quite sad for him. I remember watching him vs Spain - before he signed for United - and he was brilliant and deservedly won the MOTM award. I was really excited for him to play for us but it's been a very disappointing season.

I just really hope that with Mourinho next season he can improve and get back to the player he was before. He has talent but I just hope he can fulfill it. Not sure if it's LVG's fault or Memphis' or a bit of both, whatever it was, I hope he can improve next season to a good player - the player it looked like we had signed.

7516~~~
What position did he play tonight?

7517~~~
Nonsense, many less talented players have made a name for themselves in the premier league. He needs to take a break over summer and start fresh next season under Jose.

7518~~~
I prefer to read this kind of comments. Funny how people are defining confidence on the pitch by what they see off the pitch. It's one thing to force confidence from within its another to have confidence from your manager. What he does for his national team hold little importance. I hope José can get the best out of him.

7519~~~
This kid just need an arm around the shoulders and kick in the butt. JM should man him up a bit, too much stupid publicity and less focus in the game. He is only young and its only fair to give him another chance. I hope JM will play the kid to his strength. He thinks he is messi, somebody have to tell him to keep it simple so he can involve in the game a bit more. Jm is the man, or his staffs, our current bunch actually regressed the guy. Not that he is helping his own case, mind.

7520~~~
I feel for him, really hope Mourinho (sorry) can improve him this year. He's a kid in a new country and no one knows what sort of effort he puts in before, during and after training.

7521~~~
I think Mourinho should sell him or send him on loan. Too risky having him as back up next season because if he doesn't greatly improve he is completely useless. We need proper back up for Martial

7522~~~
I can just about tolerate someone like Rashford being referred to as a kid. Depay is 22 years old, he's not a kid that needs mollycoddling.

Idiot needs to lose muscle and realise he's not the next Ronaldo who can stroll around up front without putting any effort in.

7523~~~
The thing that frustrates me the most isn't is awful record at beating his makers but the lack of intensity in his game. The two might go hand in hand. Whatever you want to do do it quick. It's like he wants to do everything at his own pace then he expects defenders to fall for his tricks.

7524~~~
He'll get another chance to prove himself under Mourinho.  Doubt he has a long leash if he fails to impress though.

Losing some of the muscle he's put on in his upper body would serve him well.

7525~~~
Fair enough, good points. It’s actually good he’ll have the summer off, has to show what he’s capable of and work harder on the pitch, otherwise I feel he’ll be out by summer 2017.

7526~~~
If he really isn't a hard worker in training than Mourinho will sort him out by getting rid of him our change his tune. I think LvG would have done the same after this season.

7527~~~
He will rightly get another chance under Mourinho. He's clearly got the talent but his size and his lack of confidence are hindering him. He's not trying things anymore and when he does he is not nimble enough to pull it off. He set himself up for the fall by coming in like he was already a star but its still sad to see. Hopefully he will do a Luke Shaw over the summer.

7528~~~
In a nutshell that's it. He just does not possess the talent at this level. I feel a tad sorry for him because he's out of his depth and people are hammering him for it but what can he do if he just doesn't have the ability ? You cannot coach ability into a player, there has to be a basis to work from and Depay needs to head back to the Dutch league and carve a great career at that level. His level.

7529~~~
This is something I have never agreed to even while we still hadnt signed him. I dont see any great dribbling ability in Memphis. If I had to put money on one of Memphis or Young to beat their man, I'd put it on Young every single time and even he is no great shakes when it comes to dribbling.

I do agree that he needs to shed some weight though, seems to cost him his agility.

7530~~~
Playing in a far less passive style of football will help him great imo, he needs that little extra bit of space to perform and that's why we missed Shaw on the left, a genuine threat who could create him that space. Will need to muck in  hell of a lot more though.

7531~~~
I don't know about them but I have met successful people, as I'm sure you have, who aren't arrogant or full of themselves. There's no reason for it to be any different for footballers.

Obviously.

7532~~~
Spot on. I doubt people even believe what they are parroting any more.

7533~~~
Borthwick-Jackson, Rashford, Martial, Lingard all held their own in the PL, Memphis is the only one fannying around.

7534~~~
There are guys like him coming up every year from Holland. The fail rate is huge. We shouldn't expect him to be a first team player.

Just think about guys like Ryan Babel, Afellay and perhaps Wijnaldum. It's hard to find the best players!

7535~~~
Na I think it's plain to see! Look at him last year, he knew he was the big fish, he was settled and he had a team largely built around him... He was smashing on free kicks, goals from outside the box and scoring for fun.

In his Instagram, under armour deal and interviews he does come across as confident and driven with self belief but it's rhetoric more than anything, on the pitch it's definitely the opposite. 

Your right in that he never stops trying things but it's just the difference between it coming off or not, particularly the shooting. He hasn't suddenly stopped being good at hitting the ball, or lost the technique. He just can't produce it because he's over thinking, not confident and trying far to hard.

I also think he's being doubled up on by a slightly higher class defender, playing in a system that doesn't suit him and hasn't had a good fullback behind since shaw, which does make a difference.

He definitely has some skills, he just hasn't adapted how he thought he would and has stumbled massively, partly through being managed a little poorly but it's mostly just on him.

However given his performances in the early champions league qualifiers and midget land I don't see how anyone could think he lacks the skill element, for me it's 100% mental and a confidence issue.... Not just that he plainly lacks confidence but that he is putting too much pressure on himself and not playing a natural, relaxed game.

7536~~~
I hope Jose applies his quick and deadly counter-attacking style which he used in Real Madrid here.Yeah we may not have Ronaldo to contribute to them but still I think Memphis would be far better in a less possesion oriented playing style as probably every attacking player we have.Please Jose I want to see real football.

7537~~~
Anyone that says Memphis is a good dribbler has never really watched him. Even in his PSV days he wasn't considered a good dribbler.

7538~~~
His game last season was all about getting enough space to get his shot away. Usually a shimmy to the right foot and wham! And he took a ridiculous amount of shots. His average was higher than Ronaldo who also takes a ridiculous number of shots. 
He has never been a skillful player. His problem in England is that that space that was afforded to him in Holland isn't there and IMO, he doesn't have the technical capacity to create that space. He's not quick, his top speed might be decent but his pace over the first few yards is actually very slow. 
It's not a knee jerk opinion I expressed those concerns last summer. People looked at his goal stats and went "oh what a player" without having actually seeing him play and realizing what he was good and wasn't good at. 
As I said earlier, he definitely won't be sold but unlike most I'm not expecting any drastic improvement in performances.

7539~~~
Said this all along before we signed him last summer. One of the main reasons I never wanted him. Was quite blatantly not the type of player we needed.

7540~~~
Can some Dutch posters help out? Supposedly his attitude has been awful in training again according to this.

7541~~~
His recent behavior has supposedly surprised his national teammates. Apparently he didn't do the exercises properly.

7542~~~
To be more precise, during the warm up he missed out the last cone where as all the other players ran on to the final cone. This lead the news paper to conclude that his attitude is bad. Or as I myself concludes.. it must have been a slow news day for De Telegraaf.

7543~~~
Hopefully we will see it soon memphis

7544~~~
feck me. This current United squad don't have do some talking - Memphis seems to be the worst for it.

Stop yapping and do it on the pitch.

7545~~~
You are right, but he is probably being interviewed/asked about it, to be fair.

7546~~~
I really want Memphis to be the player we thought we were buying, one that is confident, scores goals and believes in himself on the pitch (rather than talking) but, I don't think having Luke Shaw will get him to that. He needs two things - first to get  his head down in training and show Mou to take a chance on him and then when he gets back on the pitch - the hardest part will be fight like hell even when things don't work out. Stop with the casual approach, do the simple things and then build back to the player that shoots on a whim or will take players on with little tricks and such.

Maybe if he can show Mou a real desire to work his socks for the team, he can be the right sided option that can be relied on to provide balance to Martial on the left.

7547~~~
Next season is make or break at United for him. I hope JM brings the best out of him but if he doesnt cut it or has a poor attitude, he'll be out soon

7548~~~
He's just so cheesy with his interviews.

7549~~~
Some report(s) saying Mourinho will ditch him along with Blind and Mata. Personally I think that would be a bad move longterm, as poor as he's been, he actually has talent about him, I'd give him another year unless his attitude his is bordering Ravel levels of disruption behind the scenes.

7550~~~
At worst I'd loan him out. Doesn't make sense to sell him given this past season might turn out to be the anomaly.

7551~~~
Can't see him lasting long here under Mourinho, Jose will get tired of him quick.

I can see him being sold this window already.

7552~~~
id say more blag artist

7553~~~
Memphis is a forward, rather than a winger so to speak. He inevitably drifts into central positions in the pursuit of goals, likes to take a shot on goal, and play intricate passes around the perimeter, like the way Martial constructed his goal against Everton in the Fa Cup Semi Final. He predominantly played as a left wide forward in a 4-3-3 for PSV in the 2014/15 season,  and during the World Cup for the Netherlands he performed admirably playing as a second striker with the freedom to roam in a 3-5-2 system. It's no coincidence that one of Memphis' best games for us, was against Watford, a game in which we played a 4-2-2-2 system, and more pertinently he was playing as one of the two most advanced forwards, essentially meaning he was playing as a wide forward. This is a position he is comfortable in, and showed no signs of struggling with the physicality, despite Watford having some physical players in Nyom (189cm & 91kg), Capoue (189cm and 80kg) and Cathcart (I mention these players in particular, as they were on the right side. In that match, he made<b> intricate passes in tight spaces</b>, a willingness to make <b>runs in behind</b> the defence and getting <b>shots on goal</b>, he beat Cathcart (188cm) in the air due to his incredible <b>off the ball movement</b>, and he was very, very unlucky to not have an assist to his name .

Memphis as a Manchester United player, has mostly played as a left winger in the 4-3-3 formation with the point forward, burdened with the task of beating players from stationary positions, and being an explosive dribbler in tight spaces.Whilst he's capable of being flamboyant by producing a bit of individual brilliance to get pass two players maximum, he isn't the type to consistently beat players, and this was certainly the case at PSV. In essence, he has some flamboyant tricks which work on occasion, but he's not a great dribbler, and most definitely wasn't one at PSV. So, LVG playing him in a system which relies heavily on dribbling, width, explosive speed and conjuring a piece of magic when the opposition have two banks of four was invariably going to be counter-productive. Moreover, I don't believe he was purchased to play in this role either, as Memphis was initially deployed as a shadow striker in the mould of Muller and Jari Litmanen who were goal threats whilst the speed and creativity would come from the likes of Findi George, Overmars, Ribery and Robben.  

The inclusion of an attacking full back in the starting berth is imperative to the way Memphis plays the game, as like I stated previously, he likes to drift into central positions. This is why he formed such a formidable relationship with Jetro Williems who would frequently maraud forward and provide that width for the vast majority of the game.  Similarly at Man Utd, we were beginning to see a relationship with Memphis and Shaw blossom, but unfortunately Shaw was subjected to a tibia fracture which ruled him out for 259 days. Consequently, this has had implications on the performance of Memphis, as he's often played with Rojo or Darmian who simply aren't on the same wavelength. Here you can see Memphis urging Darmian to move - <a class="externalLink" href="http://i.imgur.com/prfbiBO.gif" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/prfbiBO.gif</a>
It's no coincidence that Memphis' two best games from an individual perspective in Brugge and FC Midtjylland were when he had an attacking full back to partner with in Shaw and Joe Riley respectively.

I believe this game truly encapsulates the play style of Memphis

In addition, Memphis is capable of great ball retention when he uses his body as a shield to buy time for incoming teammates, as at PSV he would at times be the most advanced player given PSV often played counter-attacking football. Additionally, he's an instinctive player by nature so he often adapts accordingly by doing a flick on with consummate ease. And we've seen glimpses of this against top opposition like PSG and Barcelona in preseason, and also against Arsenal in the 3-2 victory

<a class="username" data-user="103492, @Rasendori" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/103492/">@Rasendori</a> kinda agree with the Shadow Striker point but that got scrapped before the lad got going.. The main reason I believe this season should be seen as an educational one and kick on. 
He is not my cup of tea but it doesn't mean he is not better than what we've been seeing.

I dont get why people keep questioning his attitude or mentality? Every interview and piece about him tells us that he's a hard worker who wants to become the best he can be. I get that his public persona might not be what everyone likes on this place, but the things he's actually saying is encouraging in my opinion. 

Anyhow, I would love to see him stick around for atleast another season as I'm sure we'll se plenty of from him.

Ideally, you want two players on either side who meet the profile of what Van Gaal values in his winger, whilst Young is quick, he lacks the requisite pace and creativity that Van Gaal values in a winger, and Mata certainly doesn't meet the profile which makes the inclusion of the shadow striker counter-productive. For instance, the presence of Ribery and Robben on either side meant Muller could exploit the space given to him in central areas, which is an inherently risky strategy from the opposition given Muller's off the ball movement is incredible. Likewise, with Jari Litmanen, Findi George and Overmars were threats, and like Muller he's a goal threat himself and when you have a threat from the left, right and central areas it's essentially a nightmare scenario. Unfortunately, Memphis had Young on the left against Spurs, who Kyle Walker had in his back pocket and not only did Mata complete 0 take ons, a look at his average heat map conveys he was playing very deep, and thus not putting a sustained threat on Ben Davies. Van Gaal scraped Memphis playing as a shadow striker after his performance against Brugge. What he should've done was find a player with pace and creativity to play on the  right, because if I remember correctly the 1st leg was on the 18th of August, and therefore he still had time to get a right winger/forward. Had that been the case, then we would've had a threat from both areas, but because that didn't happen, we ended up with Mata on the right. With Mata's tendencies to drift centrally, it meant the opposition could afford to prioritize the left which meant that area was very congested, which limited Memphis' best attribute .. his off the ball movement. Consequently, our main threat on the right was Darmian.

Good posts on Memphis. I have full confidence that he will step it up to a higher level with Mourinho in charge.

7558~~~
He has deficits in his game but also the natural abilities to become a productive player in the PL. Dribbling and shooting can be improved, if being worked on properly.
I can only repeat myself when saying that him losing plenty of weight and focusing on his agility is key for him.

7559~~~
Completely agree. Pardew said earlier this season you stop Martial you stop United. We would be so much more devastating if teams had to worry about 2 or 3 attacking players, preferably across the pitch. 

You can't put 2 defenders on every attacker. The key after that is moving the ball quickly and purposefully across the pitch.

Thanks Raoul, not bad for a recently promoted newbie then.
 Indeed, Bubz27.

You can't write a player off after 1 year under a manager who didn't play to his strengths and was ultimately in charge of a failed regime. In addition, more players looked worse than better under said manager.

If he can't do it under Mourinho, who is basically the modern equivalent of Sir Alex, then fine, we can discard him...but there's a whole year to wait for that yet.

If he turns out to be a flat track bully, then fantastic because smashing lesser teams is what wins you leagues.

7562~~~
A lot of good stuff from <a class="username" data-user="103492, @Rasendori" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/103492/">@Rasendori</a> there. I think it could be as simple as a counter attacking player being played by a manager that uses a counter attacking system. 

He clearly wants to be good and agree with others that the system under LVG just didn't suit him at all and he ended up getting in his own head. You only need to watch a highlight video of his PSV days to see that most of his goals came on the counter. 

I'd be really surprised if this time next year this many people want him sold.

7563~~~
Does it seem like he lost weight or is it the camera lens ?

7564~~~
Looks about right!

7565~~~
You are as skilled as the opposition it works on. It is far easier to embarrass a league 1 FB than Philip Lahm. All footballers have skills which they do on the training ground but they can't replicate them in games. Lampard said Joe Cole did Ronaldinho's skills with a golf ball, yet we know Ronaldinho had next level skills as he did them on the highest stage. Memphis may be a good show boater like Zaha but he hasn't demonstrated the skills for this level. in fact I am being harsh on Zaha as he completed more dribbles than anyone in European leagues

7566~~~
Lesser teams in the league shackled him rather easily........

7567~~~
I have no hope in him. So either I'm in for a pleasant surprise or nothing lesser this coming season. I've nothing to lose.
He'll come back early preseason. So enough time for the manager to evaluate him and make a decision on transfer/replacement if necessary.

7568~~~
Definitely look leaner.

7569~~~
Good to see him doing fitness work whilst on his holiday/break.

7570~~~
Erm. Pretty much everyone is at this point. Aren't they back in full team training in like a week or so?

7571~~~
Yeah, but isn't he still on holiday? I'm pretty sure he doesn't have to lift a foot until they're back in training, but it's for his own good, and he knows it.

7572~~~
Nice to see him putting the work In, he's going to have to have a seriously good pre season to get back into the first team I think. 
He's unfortunate really because he's a left sided midfielder and we have about ten of them. If he was naturally right sided he probably would've played more last season and improved on his shocking form a bit.

7573~~~
Pretty sure Rooney's "fitness" regime will consist of burgers and bear and he will return as fat as always at the end of pre-season.

7574~~~
Players dont do that nowadays. Just because you're on holiday doesnt mean players dont exercise. You dont want to turn up to training fat by not working out for a month cause you were on holiday.

7575~~~
But he doesn't <i>have </i>to. Pre-season is used to regain fitness.

I'm sure the club would advise them not to stuff themselves silly during their time off, but I highly doubt they'd all be given a workout timetable a month before returning to actual training.

Going by his recent posts on social media, he's on holiday with his girlfriend but still undergoing his own fitness regime - some players do it, some don't.

7576~~~
Hell yeah he is <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

7577~~~
Horizontal jogging?
