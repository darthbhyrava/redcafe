1~~~
He had a good season and now we hope that he shall continue on his development and become the best CB in the league. 

One of our most important players you would think.

2~~~
I hope he'll continue his good form from last season, avoid injuries. Whoever we bring as a new CB he'll partner Smalling.

3~~~
I still think LVG prefers Jones.

4~~~
The way he spoke about Rafael and Darmian, I doubt it.

5~~~
Me too.

6~~~
This is the season where the #SmallingPlusOne campaigns moves onto #SmallingForCapain <a class="username" data-user="69330, @Rozay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69330/">@Rozay</a>

7~~~
Definitely!

8~~~
All those years of Anderson have made me hesitant to say this but is this the season where he really can step it up to the next level?

9~~~
He the man!

10~~~
He is the undisputed leader in our defence now and has grown in stature and influence over the course of last season. I'm really excited to see his progression next season, as he will be playing alongside a defender a level above Jones and Rojo if we do sign Otamendi.

11~~~
Seconded! This is the new movement people! #SmallingForCaptain

12~~~
he already stepped up, he needs to maintain it. If he stays injury free he will be great. Having someone as tough as Schneidelrin in front of him will massively help too

13~~~
Same plan as last year then? Close our eyes, keep calling him a great defender & hope it actually comes true?

14~~~
I think he's been in good form. Stepping up would be one whole season being the heart of our defense (which personally I am expecting him to do this season)

15~~~
Hopefully having a proper right-back next to him and a more reliable partner than Jones will make his job easier. Is he going to be vice-captain now or is it Carrick?

16~~~
Still Carrick, he'll be third in line I reckon.

17~~~
If you open them, his performances will indicate that that claim is justified.

18~~~
Controversial suggestion right there!

19~~~
The massive overrating of Smalling continues I see.

20~~~
Baffling post.

21~~~
He's done nowhere near enough to warrant the superlatives thrown his way by people on here.
Years of poor play followed by 6 months of adequate performances doesn't equate to greatness. I want him to do well & keep improving but the way people speak on here you'd think he's already one of the best defenders in the world.

People need to reign it in......or they could just close their eyes & think the sun shines out of his ass regardless of how he actually plays.

22~~~
Rubbish

23~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

24~~~
I know you hate it. Are you going to throw the weight of your support behind Jones this season then?

25~~~
That was a bit of a silly post now wasn't it?

26~~~
You know I hate it?

27~~~
I don't think I'd exchange him for any centre back in the league.

28~~~
He was never poor. Comfortably the third best CB at the club from the moment he joined after Rio & Vidic. Just always lacked game time and a bit of experience - mostly due to injuries.

For example his rookie season for us is still better than anything Evans and Jones have produced so far. The following two seasons he was tragically wasted at right back or injured, and he's been our best defender for the last 2 years now.

Ability wise he's still the same player - there's been no mythical improvement in his defending apart from the leadership he displayed last season, and that's because he's just a lot more confident now thanks to finally getting a run of games. The rest of the package was there since he was 21- aerial ability, ground defending, pace, strength and decision making.

29~~~
Dr Baltar is having a mare here.

30~~~
Thought he looked a bit rusty. Got the armband though <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

31~~~
Captain Chris is a go.

32~~~

33~~~
Years of poor play? He was solid as a rock in the 10/11, 11/12 and 12/13 seasons. Had a semi-shite 13/14 like everyone else and suddenly he's always been bad??

34~~~
Glad we have Smalling think he will be top drawer this year.

35~~~
His passing is embarassing at this level.

36~~~
Its been said before and said again, <i>when played at CB, </i>Smalling has always looked solid. Fergie really didnt do him (or Jones) any favours by insisting on playing them both out of position for what felt like about 5 years. He handled the transition from Rio/Vidic really poorly it has to be said (same can be said about midfield), and both Smalling's and Jones' development were likely hindered a bit by that.

Now that he has started to get consistent gametime, Smalling has looked like our best defender and always has done. The argument that he is poor on the ball is valid, but it is worth noting that in his first couple of seasons at the club, passing and ball-playing was considered a big strength of his, and he was compared Rio in that regard (with Jones as the Vidic of the pair). Whether it was due to confidence, being played out of position or some other factor, we will likely never know why his on-the-ball ability seemed to deteriorate a bit, but the ability is definitely there.

 I think that with the responsibility he appears to be given of being our leader in defence and potentially even getting the captain's armband at some point, it will hopefully spur him on and give Smalling the confidence to really step it up another notch. He (still) has the potential to be a really complete defender (including passing etc).

37~~~
Hope you arent saying that based on the match, he literally misplaced one pass. Which was a good interception too.

38~~~
Pure fiction.

39~~~
I love the lad. Dr Baltar is on a WUM I suppose.

40~~~
His demeanour gives the impression he's not as good on the ball as he is. He's not Nesta but he's very capable with the ball at his feet.

41~~~
He's an excellent defender, and has been since he's been here. There has been no mythical 'post City' turning point, he was excellent just the week before against Chelsea for instance. 

He is as good as any centre half in the league, and virtually unbeatable one on one .

42~~~
Its not an illusion. Although not awful, he is uncomfortable in possesion when under pressure. His technique is far from fluid and he definitley doesnt have natural ability on the ball.

Of course being a CH his footwork doesnt have to be brilliant. Im glad we have him. Good character, good athlete, fecking strong and most importantly a great defender who's getting better all the time with his peak in front of him.

On the other hand if im being completely honest I do feel his potential has its limits and there will always be small group of CHs who are a level above him. We will need to find someone from this group if we are to acheive anything great in the near future in my opinion.

43~~~
Any chance of renaming this thread as Mike Smalling for a bit?

44~~~
"Mr. Mike Smalling". Now is the time, Mods.

45~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

46~~~
Mike Smalling sounds better than Chris Smalling anyway.

47~~~
Mike "The Chris" Smalling.

48~~~
Maybe LVG just calls everyone Mike...

49~~~
He took it well <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

50~~~
good lad <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

51~~~
I think it's fairly clear that this thread now needs to be renamed "Mike Smalling 2015/2016 Performances"

52~~~
I prefer Captain Chris to be honest.

53~~~
My favorite reply:

54~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

55~~~
Agreed. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

56~~~
Interesting choice to name him third captain, I'd have thought if De Gea leaves, Mata would get it.

57~~~
I think most of us on the caf have better captain qualities than Mata. The guy is too nice

58~~~
Smalling's one of those guys that most people who don't support United think is sh!t.

I'm sure we've been through similar scenarios at one time or another with the likes of Ferdinand, Carrick, Rafael etc.

Eventually it'll just be accepted that he is pretty decent, like with Carrick, and for all but pure ABU's Rio!

59~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

60~~~
I'd be so impressed if he came out for the Spurs game with 'Mike' on the back of his shirt. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

61~~~
I support United and I think he is very limited player and not good enough

62~~~
So, back to being third choice behind Jones and Blind? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

63~~~
He's such a strong defender and I think at Chelsea he'd be nailed on to start, but he is not very good on the ball and I think that will see him in and out under LvG.

64~~~
Nah im pretty sure he's just in the 2nd team so we can play the kids and not have Barcelona score a hatful. Remember he said he's 3rd choice captain

65~~~
Smalling will start against Spurs, he is currently our best defender.

66~~~
I genuinely think LvG sees Jones and a 'LCB' ahead of him.

67~~~
I think so too. And Herrera was in the second team with the same reason. Imagine midfield with Mata and Fellaini against Barca... As i said in other threads this "first 11" is not the one which will play against Spurs.

Smalling is class, better with every game. Saying that Jones was good too, i just hope they can stay injury free this season.

68~~~
Let's hope this is the case.

69~~~
Smelling played a really nice pass against barca. Overall looked solid.

70~~~
I assume he played Smalling because he was the third captain and our 2nd team needed a captain and leader. In addition, just to play youngsters at the back could have ended badly for us so they had a senior defender in there. Well, that's just my optimistic theory. I think Smalling will start most of our games if fit

71~~~
I think LVG doesnt rate him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

He even rates Evans more then him.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

72~~~
He's our best "defender", but not as good on the ball, he can improve that and I think he will become 1st choice again very quickly.

73~~~
Wouldn't really make sense to call Smalling his third captain though, don't you think? To me, that's an indication he's his first choice CB (and rightly so).

74~~~
Fletcher was third choice last season though, and he never played.

75~~~
Fletcher was vice Captain last season for a short time.

76~~~
That's a good point, though I would put forward that the context was different and that Van Gaal didn't have the benefit of a whole season behind him (and Fletcher looked ok in pre season last year, and I think was initially meant to be a starter until we realized he couldn't handle the pace of the league anymore). In this case, Chris is in this position with the benefit of 12 months under Van Gaal's management and I don't think he'd name him 'third captain' if he didn't view him as a starter.

77~~~
Glad Mike started. One of our better players this half.

78~~~
Kane's kryptonite.

79~~~
He's a rock, once again. Kane stands no chance against him.

80~~~
Love me some Jäger bombers!

81~~~
Very good so far! Hope he continues like that and if he does, he will start

82~~~
Without a doubt our best defender. Still not 100% there yet, but we just need to find a top quality player to partner him.

83~~~
Absolutely class all game.

84~~~
Is there a battle he loses?

85~~~
Hasn't let Kane have a sniff. Motm so far.

86~~~
Smalling <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

87~~~
He's such a great defender.

88~~~
He's carrying the defence, starting to feel like he has stepped up for good. Passing limited but quite consistent as well. Completely confident with him in the team, just needs a better partner.

89~~~
Beast Mode.

90~~~
For all the Herrera and Blind talk, the notion of dropping this guy for Jones was the real worrying one. Class.

91~~~
Chris you beauty

92~~~
Mike Smalling is just too good

93~~~
fecking brilliant.

94~~~
Brilliant all day

95~~~
Wow, that tackle.

96~~~
One of the only real positives from today along with Darmian and Shaw.

97~~~
Showing why he should be the #1 choice CB.

98~~~
He's a leader.

99~~~
May not get the headlines, but Smalling has been first class today. What an improvement he's made this last 6-8 months. He looks so solid and confident.

100~~~
He's MOTM with Darmian close behind.

101~~~
That tackle. Absolutely solid at the back.

102~~~
Rio-esque that tackle from Smalling on Chadli <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

103~~~
If we can just sort him out with a partner our back 4 is set for the foreseeable.

104~~~
Mr Mike Smalling.  Solid today.  MOTM.

105~~~
He'll become a world class CB. Just has to get better on the ball, shouldn't smash it away at every chance!

106~~~
Its a shame really, because Darmain, Shaw and Smalling are fantastic. Another centre half and the goalkeeper situation being sorted would make us a real force at the back.

107~~~
Can we just end the debate. Head and shoulders above any other CB we have. Just needs a solid partner(not Blind).

108~~~
Absolute rock today. Still think we'd be real title contenders if we got this man a proper partner.

109~~~
Like this was ever in doubt. He's fantastic.

110~~~
MotM for me today.

111~~~
Brilliant today and he needed to be because blind was a passenger.

112~~~
His quality really shines through in games like that. Put him in a situation where all he has to do is defend and he'll always do good.

113~~~
Did all the defending in the centre.

114~~~
Our best CB by a freaking country mile. Nothing new though and I'm not surprised. What a performance.

115~~~
His defensive abilities are immense, and have always been. The heart of our defence now.

116~~~
Motm, beast of a CB just stay fit Mike!

117~~~
Good game from Smalling but he definitely needs a ball player next to him. Tougher tests ahead for the Blind - Smalling partnership.

118~~~
I know he kind of stepped up last season, but this season will <i>really </i>be one where he can cement himself as a proper Man United mainstay defender. Also convinces me we don't really need a CB that bad.

119~~~
Mike was absolutely fantastic <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

120~~~
Get Mike a world class partner and he might be alright.

121~~~
I thought he was dreadful. Darmian was very good though, I agree.

122~~~
Need a gif of the tackle on Chadli at the end please. Especially the slow mo angle. That was incredible defending - ice fecking cold.

123~~~
If he could pass he'd be worth a fortune.

124~~~
Well played thanks Mike.

125~~~
Please Chris, just stay healthy this season! I'm still convinced that Smalling and Jones would become a fantastic partnership if they managed to stay fit and play together for a full season. It just seems like winning the lottery might be a more realistic hope!

126~~~
Mike's a helluva defender. He needs to stay fit, could be one of the best in the league if he does.

127~~~
Hopefully he stays injury-free. 
Now buy a proper (left-footed <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>) world class defender to partner him, and we'll do very well.

128~~~
Did very well today. A composed, calm figure. Don't think he and Romero can understand each other but they got through it to good effect.

129~~~
Beast today in his defending

130~~~
Solid performance from Smalling today. He read the game really well and managed to make vital clearances. Given that he had to deal with a makeshift CB and GK, he had a really good game.

131~~~
Class!

132~~~
our best center back right now.

133~~~
His voice! 


Sell him.

134~~~
Our best centre back and my choice for next Captain, I really rate him.

135~~~
Mixe best, never seen so many world class tackles from him in one game, his passing was little bit off but he needs to be trusted..

136~~~
He has been our best CB for the last couple of years.

137~~~
Proper defending by him.

Great performance

138~~~
Brick Walling.

139~~~
The question is where is Jones? left out of the squad or injured AGAIN?

140~~~
Very good today.

141~~~
Top defender. Barely noticed Kane much today.

142~~~
Absolute beast defensively.

143~~~
He has been last year as well, yes.

144~~~
Looked confident and showed the form that he did towards the end of last season. Great to see him barking orders and trying to calm the team down on the ball towards the end, looked like a real leader.

145~~~
His passing and dribbling was assured in the first half, but when Spurs really put on the pressure it was off, and that's quite understandable.

146~~~
Wow, a defender excelling at defending..

147~~~
MOTM, covered Blind when needed and made a couple of vital tackles, looks like LvG is easing him off having to run it out as well which is a good sign.

148~~~
New name? I like it

149~~~
He fairly bossed things at the back there today alright, saving our holes with last ditched tackles a few times. Easily man of the match.

150~~~
Very good performance from him today. He was MOTM IMO.

151~~~
Obviously man of the match for me, as has been mentioned already. A class act, not much more to say. This will be the season he steps up and confirms himself as one of the league's best CBs, if he can stay fit.

152~~~
What a tank, composed as ever. Made some vital defensive contributions that potentially saved us.

153~~~
That's how you answer the critics

154~~~
Right now I'd take an actual centre back next to Mike.

155~~~
Ron Atkinson is a nut, didnt even have him as a contender for MotM.

156~~~
Always was our best defender, just needs a proper partner, so hes not all time covering everyone elses mistakes

157~~~
I struggle to think of many better defenders in the league in 1v1 situations.

158~~~
Played very very well today.

159~~~
How many times does he need to demonstrate that he's our best defender before it sinks in?

I couldn't give a flying one about his passing, because the gap between him and the rest of our central defenders is huge. Defenders defend, first and foremost.

160~~~
Getsme on the #SmallingPlusOne train? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

---

He is our best CB and has been so for the last two years. We need a partner for him though, i still think Otamendi would be great, but LvG may feel that he needs a ball playing defender.

161~~~
This. In one on one situations today Smalling was superb. He is clearly a level above any other centre half at the club. Much like Rafael things Smalling did when he was younger have made a lot of people think he's not up to it. They stick with the impressions they had of him under Moyes or whatever, when in fact over 2014/15 he was one of our best players.

162~~~
He's rock solid.

163~~~
He was good under Moyes too, probably our best defender that season. It's just his stint at RB that's skewed peoples opinion of him.

164~~~
That was a proper good performance from him but I think it's quite clear now he's the best CB United has at the moment.

165~~~
To be fair I've gave him praise when he's deserved it, likewise I've criticised when he's deserved it. What I don't like is those who feel they have to criticise a certain player to praise another (if that makes sense)

166~~~
His ability seems to be continually overlooked.

Our defense is no where near as bad as is made out, fullbacks are fantastic and Smalling is a beast, even if we don't sign another centre back it's pretty solid.

167~~~
his future looks bright, just needs to avoid injuries...

168~~~
What a solid performance from the lad, consistency is key.

169~~~
Get Stones beside him and we're sorted for many years.

England too.

170~~~
Thank christ he started after all the worrying during pre-season. He's a rock at the back. More of the same this season please!

171~~~
The best defender at the club. The right side of our defence looks rock solid right now.

172~~~
He is a very good player.  I still get the feeling van Gaal isn't convinced by him though - hope I'm wrong and he does't get dropped when Jones is fit again.

173~~~
two words: PROPER POCKETRY

174~~~
I've been in the Smalling plus one camp for a while and it is performances like that which explain why. I felt he was our best defender last season and even though it's early doors he was definite man of the match for me today. I don't like him being partnered with Blind but Rojo / Evans / Jones next to him don't fill me with confidence either.

175~~~
Motm. Masterclass in tackling.

176~~~
Yep, great pace, height and strength. MOTM today for me.

177~~~
Well at least we know LvG isn't completely insane.  Or at least not all the time.

178~~~
Our best defender. Just hoping we could get another top CB to play alongside mike.

179~~~
Why is that?

180~~~
He look really well today. Strong, reliable and concentrated.
Add a new CB to play alongside him, and we could really get a great partnership

181~~~
Solid tackler, that red card from previous season made him focus more on his timing and he's looking fit and calm now. 

Risked a penalty few times today but managed to reach the ball cleanly. Made no doubts for the ref in his decisions which is a sign of promise.

182~~~
So Jones was injured. Scary how LVG could have had him on the bench today.

183~~~
Literally every neutral I talk to thinks he's shit too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. It's hilarious... Class defender.

184~~~
I had no clue this was even a debate. Leaps and bounds Uniteds best defender. I take comfort whenever he plays.

185~~~
Debatable, Darmain was fantastic today.

186~~~
Surprised and pleased by his performance but the real test will be against top forwards and he cant do it alone all season.

187~~~
Anyone find a GIF of that Chadli tackle then?

188~~~
Exactly, LvG seems to have forgotten how good Smalling was last season post-City.

189~~~
My motm then. Darmian was a close second.

190~~~
Great performance defensively. If he could keep possession of the ball better he'd be a far better player.

Darmian was MOTM for me though.

191~~~
Definitely nuts to think if it wasn't for Jones injury, Smalling would be on the bench and Jones/Blind would have started. Smalling needs to be one of our starting CB whenever available. Showed signs of leadership as well with him obviously being the director at the back.

192~~~
He deserves a quality partner though, doesn't he? Otamendi where art thou?

193~~~
Yeah there wasn't to much between them.

194~~~
If he stays fit and if LVG continues to play him (not sure which is the bigger if?) then virtually all the lingering doubts often expressed about Smalling will be gone by the end of the season.
The presence of Darmian will lighten his workload and allow him to fully focus on doing just his own job which should help as well.

A largely solid game, more than acceptable passing for the most part and always in the right place to snuff out danger in a composed fashion. Just edged MOM based on a few standout interventions towards the end.

195~~~
His voice still cracks me up.

196~~~
Looked total class today.

197~~~
Rock solid today. Did he just get the start because of the injury to Jones?

198~~~
Seriously, is there still anyone that <i>doesn't</i> think he's by far and away our best defender?

He's just a beast of a defender.

199~~~
Probably his best performance to date.

200~~~
I have to say I'm slightly surprised by how much praise he's getting. I haven't watched the match back since I got home but his passing didn't seem great to me today and it often invited pressure on Romero and the others around him. He did alright other than that, especially towards the end, but I had concerns. I'll watch the highlights later to be sure though.

201~~~
He was excellent today, as is normally the case. I still don't get this notion of some sort of turning point last season or whenever it supposedly was though, he's been outstanding since his first.

202~~~
Don't know. Arsenal away last 2 seasons and Chelsea home was more impressive considering the level of opposition.

203~~~
Fantastic again today, continuing on with his last seasons form. Utterly baffling how he prefers Jones, I'm actually thankful Jones gets injured so much or he would never have started. 

Hopefully that performance has given LVG a reminder that in the premier league defenders need to defend first, and play later.

204~~~
Some absolute mong on TalkShite was discussing Richards playing at CB for Villa and how Roy should be including him in the England team/squad. He said "most people don't watch all the games to see these sort of players shine" then, i'm not kidding, he went on to discuss how he should be above Jones/Smalling, saying both of them haven't looked promising for United and don't look comfortable in the positions they are being played in....??!?!? I mean, fair enough you can argue Jones plays CDM, RB & CB ad hasn't nailed down his position yet but Smalling is an out and out CB who's currently hitting great form.

But yeah, enough of that shite, he played great today. Hard to decide who was better between him and Darmian but both were wonderful.

205~~~
I think it may have more to do with last season being the first season where he played every one of his games at CB, which highlighted his consistency. He had some pretty awful games at right back, but I agree that his sporadic appearances in his actual position prior to last season have been good since the beginning. 

I never understood why Fergie, Moyes and Hodgson opted to play him at RB so often. Other than having pace, he wasn't suited to that position at all.

Glad he's starting to shut up his critics though, even some non-United fans are starting to notice him now.

206~~~
Towering performance against Kane today.  Thought he was clearly the best player on the pitch which was reassuring and disconcerting all at once.

207~~~
Another outstanding performance from the best CB at the club.  Puzzling that Jones started over Smalling in preseason but better late than never I suppose.

208~~~
He's nearly as good as Vidic 1v1, with the additional advantage of speed

209~~~

210~~~
Great as always.

211~~~
He's better than Vidic 1v1 IMO. He never gets beat for speed even against the really pacy players like Willian and Welbeck last season for instance. Torres and a few others punished Vidic more than once

212~~~
Yeah, like I said, his speed is a massive advantage over Vidic. Vidic did it against the best of the world over quite a significant period of time though, so I'm not sure we can say Smalling is better yet.

213~~~
To be fair, Kane was a top forward last season.

214~~~
Smalling is better than Vidic was 1v 1. He also, like Vidic, has proven it against the best over a long period, in that he’s been here almost 5 years and never been given the run around by any centre forward. He's had one off incidents where they may have gotten the better, but never has a striker 'had him' in a particular game, and that includes Tevez, Aguero, Van Persie, amongst other big performances in Europe.

He is virtually unbeatable 1 v 1, in the air or on the deck for that matter.

215~~~
Agreed. We messed around with Smalling for far too long.

216~~~
Up until that City game I couldn't even remember his last bad game.

217~~~
He is easily our best defender.

218~~~
He is easily one of the better defenders in the league. Needs a stable partner and to remain fit himself.

219~~~
Sure but i'm talking about established elite strikers like Aguero, Costa and the equivalent of those guys in the rest of Europe.

220~~~
With hindsight it looks as though he was played in the weaker sides in pre-season to shore things up for them at the back.

221~~~
Yeah, fair enough then. Have no doubt he'll handle Costa and Aguero just as well.

222~~~
He's handled top strikers before. It's not as if he's an untested centre back.

223~~~
This. He was bloody good when he came in 2011, just got to stay fit.

224~~~
He's not comparable to vidic, who is among the best the club has seen.

I think smalling is excellent. In pure defensive terms, he's one of the most talented around, and when you combine that with his physical attributes then it makes for a beast of a defender.

But he has a long long way to go to match someone like vidic.

225~~~
Was our best player yesterday imo. Needs a partner to really fly and build an understanding with his GK.

226~~~
Has to be the first CB picked when his fit doesnt he?

227~~~
A great display from Smalling yet again. He again showed how good he is and that he have a talent to be one of the best defenders in the league. It is testament how good he and similar Jones can be if they overcome injuries, hope Jones will do it to.

228~~~
Or Jones is injured so he got into the team by default. Still think LVG sees Jones as his number 1 CB

229~~~
If Smalling repeats what he does in the champions league and for a second straight season, it would be fair to label him World Class no?

230~~~
He has a long way to go before he can be  labeled World Class

231~~~
Jones was terrible vs PSG, like committed a foul every minute he was on the pitch and right after it Ogden wrote an article suggesting Smalling was moved to first X1 in 11 on 11 practice games.

232~~~
He's outstanding, but I'm not surprised. He just has to stay injury free, that's been his biggest problem for sometime now.

233~~~
Explain.

234~~~
He is nowhere near World Class level, he's not even first choice for his Country. 
Vidic, Foulkes, Rio, Stam, Pallister, McGrath etc were all World Class, Smalling is not on that level.

235~~~
Watching the game back and I still think LVG will have his reservations. He had to resort to hoof early on a couple of times early in because of poor control and he killed a break by failing to execute a relatively simple lofted pass. I really think it is those moments that fail to endear him to LVG.

236~~~
And this is where LVG needs to get his head out of the clouds because if he doesn't it will cost us points. Smalling + Rojo are our 2 better CBs and are balanced (right foot - Left foot), have played well together and have a decent understanding. Choosing CB/CM that are more comfortable on the ball rather than being the better defenders is suicidal.

237~~~
Are you trying to wind me up?
First of all,  Smalling is first choice for his country. Ever since he stepped it up and stayed injury free he has always been on the team sheet. Second of all, I said give me your reasons to why Smalling has a long way to go before he reaches world class, not repeat the same thing again.

For me, Smalling needs to go another season or two and this champions league displaying what he has readily has been showing. He also has to show some more consistency and quickness in his passing. 

Smalling has showed that :
he is great 1 v 1.
Very reliable player to break up counter attacks and dangerous situations 
A Damn good long range passer
A goal scoring threat in set pieces
Really.good.positioning
Kept very good strikers in the game quiet

Smalling needs to show that he can keep this high level of play over a longer period of time to prove that it is not some lucky run of form  while making small improvements to his game to justify World class status.

238~~~
Why

239~~~
you really ask? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

240~~~
Pretty obvious, but can you say that smalling has has one season of being among the top 3 defenders in the world, and staying injury free throughout, and won big titles as well? Granted it's a tougher phase for the club but that's where this current lot has to prove themselves capable of being mentioned alongside players from 06-09 and more recently.

241~~~
Trying to wind you up? Grow the feck up will ya. He is nowhere near the level of Vidic or Rio, have you watched football prior to last season? Even a 34 year old John Terry is better than him. The over exaggeration of Smallings ability in this place is cringe worthy, it really is. He’s a very good player, but not World Class.


As for being first choice for England, under Hodgson

Cahill – 28 starts 0 as sub (2198 min)

Jagielka – 25 starts 5 as sub (1938 min)

Jones – 11 starts 2 as sub (1075 min)

Smalling – 11 starts 3 as sub (994 min)


So going by minutes played he is 4th choice, not only that but he now has Stones to contend with.

242~~~
He'll be first choice soon enough. Cahill is wank another season like last season for Smalling it will be impossible not to make him the first choice IMO

243~~~
World Class is such an arbitrary term. At the minute in the league, I would only rate Koscienly and Terry (who is hugely benefited by Chelsea's system, too) as better CBs than Smalling. I don't know or care if that's World Class level, but he is top quality.

244~~~
Smalling is a great defender. I just think what holds him back is how awkward he looks. He's the Anti Rio Ferdinand. Baring the injuries, I think he's proven to be a reliable defender and I would say defensively he is world class. A tricky forward can always make a mug of someone. Other then being out powered by Benteke one time, it's not often Smalling get's beaten defensively.

Defensively, he reminds me of Rio and though he's not as polished - he's proven to be a great purchase by Sir Alex.

245~~~
Clearly the best central defender at the club. He proved it last season and it is laughable that he wasn't first choice before Jones had his shocker/got injured.

I often laughed at opinions on here where people judged centre backs by their ability on the ball rather than how good they are defensively. Unfortunately the United manager does the same!

As for the comparisons with Vidic, they are ridiculously premature. Vidic is one of the best defenders United has ever had. He even made Jonny Evans look good.

246~~~
Wow. Did I say Smalling was world class anywhere in my post? Did you even read it?
I said Smalling needs to prove that he can continue to make small improvements in his game and keep his high level of play for what longer period of time to reach such a level. John Terry was better than Smalling? He wasn't. In fact , I would bet that without Nemanja Magic who was arguable one of the best defensive midfielders in the world last season Chelsea's defence would have been in much more trouble.

In regards to England, once again ? Did you read my post? I said once Smalling stepped it up and stayed injury free last season, that was when he started being England's first choice. Notice how Smalling has started most , if not all of England's recent qualifiers and friendlies and I would bet that is how it is going to be from now on.

247~~~
Who knows, Stones will most likely be first choice before long if he keeps going the way he is.

248~~~
Stones as good as he is, isn't nearly as good as Smalling. He has potential but I don't see what potential he has that Smalling doen't

249~~~
Imagine if we did get Ramos next to him.

Darmian - Smalling - Ramos - Shaw.

That would be a fantastic back four and I wouldn't be worried too much about the keeper.

250~~~
It could still happen, the supposed unveiling of Ramos  and his new contract after the Audi cup hasn't happened.

251~~~
I wasn't open to losing De Gea for Ramos earlier in the summer, I wouldn't mind right now though.

252~~~
If Stones get his move to Chelsea and cements a place in the team he will be serious competition for Smalling. To say he isn't nearly as good as Smalling is way off the mark, put it this way, can you imagine anyone bidding £30m for Smalling? No, me either.

253~~~
You never know. He may struggle, if he plays with Terry then fine, if Terry can still handle it (had a poor game yesterday). However if hes partnered with Cahill then forget it.
Cahill isn't good enough and I wouldn't say Stones has the ability to make his defensive partner look good just yet (maybe he does you never know)

Whilst I like Stones I have seen him also have some shockers, he has bags of potential, but like I say Smalling is equally as talented in defending in my view.

254~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I'm struggling to think of a better defence in Europe than that. Can't see it happening though.
I don't think it's that far off the mark tbh, Stones is still very raw imo. Anyone paying that much for him is paying for potential mainly, rather than current ability.

255~~~
I would do a De Gea + cash for Keylor Navas and Ramos in a heartbeat.

256~~~
I'm in the same boat since Friday 10.30am (when LVG revealed DDG head is not in it).

257~~~
On the ball you mean. Defensively, he's extremely classy and elegant. I don't think I've ever enjoyed watching a player defend more especially when he's locked into a real contest.

258~~~
I actually can, but no one would as we're not a selling club when it comes to top class english CBs. Smalling will be worth  30m after this season I reckon. The only issue that held him back before was fitness.

259~~~
Everyone has their price.

260~~~
He'll be on the PFA Team of the Year this time around.

261~~~
Yes but I don't think anyone can say its impossible for us to get a bid of that for him. Hes young and english and a very good CB who had a very good season last year.

262~~~
It could happen, but I very much doubt it.

263~~~
Judging players on how much teams would be willing to pay for them is a really poor way of comparing them. Would anyone have paid £30m for Carrick in 2010? No. Does the fact City paid close to that for Milner mean he was better than Carrick? Obviously not. It's not just ability that sets the price for players.

264~~~
It won't for the same reason no one put in a bid for Rio, we aint selling!

265~~~
I know, but it's an indication.

266~~~
LVG's system requires ball playing centre backs to work properly. They are not just defenders, they are required to start attacks with passing. Smalling and Rojo doesn't really offer that so the team as a whole will suffer. There is a reason that he is making Blind his number one.

267~~~
I thought Blind is playing because Rojo isn't match fit.

268~~~
True, but what I think it really indicates is that teams are always willing to pay more for a player that is seen as more stylish or easy on the eye. Most of what Smalling does will go unnoticed, while Stones will stand out more due to his ability on the ball.

269~~~
Smalling was mostly good, but he lost his man for that Eriksen chance early in the game. 

Darmian had a flawless game by comparison.

270~~~
But compensated with what was basically a match winning tackle on Chadli at the end. Darmian was just as good.

271~~~
Must say, I have been a critic of Smalling in the past (something I still believe was right at the time). But he has really progressed in the last 6 months IMO. Yesterday was one of his best performances for the club, good to see.

272~~~
There is a reason why most would start him and he showed why yesterday. Every time it got dangerous, he was there to defend and clear (unlike Blind)

273~~~
He's immense, and if he can stay fit, a bona fide first choice Manchester United centre back.

274~~~
ignoring Real Madrid's occasional sniffing around, we only sell when we've made it very obvious we're looking to get rid.
Therefore, getting a market rate fee generally doesn't happen very often.

Smalling has to be better than Stones though.
based off now, not the "Potential"

we know very well how potential isn't always realised!

275~~~
He is only 25 too so hopefully he will improve even more. The right side of our defence is looking very secure for years to come.

276~~~
It was mostly blind and a little bit of Damian who were at fault for that chance created.

277~~~
Loved the way he dominated the aerial balls. There were a few in succession where he sent the crosses right back out before they had a chance to reach a Spurs player. Great to see that he's continued his form from last season despite not being first choice in pre season.

For me it's simple, he stays fit - he'll be a rock for us this season.

278~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fullmatchesandshows.com/2015/08/08/manchester-united-vs-tottenham-hotspur-highlights-full-match/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fullmatchesandshows.com/...d-vs-tottenham-hotspur-highlights-full-match/</a>
What? I love Smalling as much as the next guy, but at 47 seconds he goes from marking Eriksen to letting him get a free run into the box. Smalling ends up dithering in no man's land.

279~~~
Then his system is fecking stupid. I mean how many defenders are out there who both good ball players and also brilliant defensively? Vidic was worse on the ball than Smalling or Jones. He basically needs two Rio Ferdinands for his system to work. And because he cant get them you think it's fine to just play some average midfielder there. Blind's lack of strength and speed speed were a problem last season when he played midfield. Think how much of a problem it will be a CB. Some people on here will try to justify just about anything.....

Edit: Come to think of it would Rio even be good enough on the ball? Seemed to just lump it up field for his last few seasons. Yup Blind is definitely a better answer for LVG's masterplan

280~~~
Ah my bad, my stream was a bit bad and it looked like it was blind. I know I'm being a little bit nitpicky,but i felt Darmian shouldn't have chased him down and held his line, thus making Erickson offside. Smalling definitely should have spoke up faster or stayed with his man.

281~~~
Agreed and very few CBs are what you'd call world class at a young age- hopefully he can still go up a few notches and be remembered in the pantheon of Rio, Vida, Bruce, Pallister, Stam etc...

282~~~
Our best CB last year and this one so far.

283~~~
Considering how out of sorts he looked just 2 seasons ago he looks to be on the improve with experience curve.

284~~~
he needs a new top partner, just like when rio got vida back then to take him as a player and their partnership to a whole new level. 

blind is no CB, i don't think rojo is a top tier CB while phil jones, well he is already out for 3 weeks.

285~~~
He was fabulous yesterday against Spurs. The timings of his tackles was perfect. 

I really hope we can find a reliable cb to compliment him that can stay healthy. Otamendi is the most realistic option imo.

286~~~
It's him we are looking to upgrade and not Blind/Rojo according to Van Gaal. No wonder we aren't interested in many CBs as van Gaal admits it's tough to get someone better than him. 

Absolutely baffling though.

287~~~
He's played well against some of the best already, but you're right he'll need more help. I don't think Blind would contain a world class striker. Let's keep Rojo kicks on when he gets back to full fitness. Jones clearly can't be relied on. This whole right and left footed CB thing is kinda ridiculous to me, its never been a problem for two quality right footed CBs to play together

288~~~
Solid performance from him .Growing more and more into the roll.A case of Smalling and whoever will partner him.

289~~~
So he says its tuff to find someone better than him and in the same time you think he would just replace the best CB we have in the starting lineup?

290~~~
I'm pretty sure he didn't mean he's trying to upgrade on Smalling, just that if he were to buy a new Centre Back they'd have to be better than Smalling. Not exactly an outlandish statement to make,

291~~~
Ive read the Guardian interview, and it specifically makes mention of signing a right sided defender..and that he will only sign one if they are better than the right handed defenders he has now..he mentions all three, with that list including smalling..He doesnt talk about the left handed cb..

292~~~
He didnt have a problem with playing Jones and Smalling last year. So if we get for instance Ramos somehow I'm sure he'd use Smalling and Ramos. With Ramos he'd have one CB who's good on ball and given the fact Smalling is the 3rd captain and the best CB we have right now I dont think he would just drop him.

293~~~
He has gone on record multiple times that his preference is to have a left footed defender..he was almost forced to play two right footed ones especially with Rojo's injuries..He has emphasized that again this year , so it must be really be important to him..In the interview he gives, he makes it specific, that the signing of a right footed cb would be to replace a right footed one too..that is why he says he will only sign one that is better than Smalling, as he regards Smalling probably as his best right footed defender.

294~~~
He was asked if United are in the market for a Centre Back, and he said no but if one who was much better than what we have becomes available then of course we'd try and get him. Again, he's not trying to upgrade on Smalling but if a CB were available, they'd need to be much better than Smalling to be considered. Its something that applies for all positions.

A lot of the articles seem to be cutting out the fact that he replied "No" to the question of whether we're actively looking to get another Centre Back in for that position though.

295~~~
We played with Jones and Smalling last year even when Rojo was fit.

296~~~
From the article:

Notice that in mentioning the centre backs , he does not mention any of the left sided cbs such as Rojo or Blind..Only the right side, He mentioned the same concerns in pre-season too, whereby he mentioned that Smalling and Jones would be competing for the second spot..a third rb would be to compete with those as he has mentioned again.

297~~~
yes, I remember that..but Rojo spent a lot of time out..I think near the end of the season, LVG tried to play the same defense  each week in the run in in order to give it solidity..It wasnt a particular preference of his, and that is why he has emphasized that, and gone back to his preference since pre-season..

298~~~
He did only mention RCB players, but he also said that he's not looking for another player for that position <span style="text-decoration: underline">unless</span> someone much better becomes available. It's a statement which will apply to every position on the field. That's the point I was trying to make when someone said he's trying to upgrade on Smalling.

299~~~
Still looking solid. I just hope he's stay FIT! and hopefully Rojo gets match fit quick so he can line-up next to him.

300~~~
He specifically mentions that the new cb should be better than <b>them</b> though..the three defenders he has mentioned..From the reports of the interview both from MEN and the guardian, the question appears to be specifically about the rcb position, which when LVG when quizzed about earlier in preseason was not happy about..I dont know whether has a lcb target, but this looks specifically to be about a rcb one..

So far the only serious links we have had have been to right footed defenders too, Otamendi and Ramos, so its a reasonable scenario that could be the plan.

301~~~
He's becoming a beast of a player for us <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>.

302~~~
I heard Jason Burt, a guardian journalist, mention the same at least on two different occasions on Football today last season. I don't remember who the host was, may be John Dykes, who even corrected him, saying, "You mean a left sided CB", and he replied, "No, United will look for a right sided center back".

I dismissed it at the time as Mikey had been playing well and was recently appointed the "3rd" captain. Not sure now. 

I hope it's not true as Smalling has been excellent in the position and needs regular game time.

303~~~
i just live in hope more than expectation now to be honest.

304~~~
Read the post from <a class="username" data-user="96887, @K2K" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96887/">@K2K</a>. Van Gaal clearly states that the upgrade is tough to get as the incoming player needs to better than Smalling, his current RCB. 

FWIW, I am sure blind will lose his place eventually. Just that it will take time and the window will be closed by the time van Gaal relearns the lesson he learnt last season.

305~~~
LVG says a lot of things and its better not to hold to everything he says. I expect to see Smalling + new CB if we get him as soon as we get him.

306~~~
There aren't any top left footed CBs that we could get. Unfortunately, van Gaal 's solution to that isn't playing 2 top CBs but playing blind + 1 as if now.

307~~~
It was obvious from the interview LVG gave that if we are buying a CB, it will be for the right side of the central defence, and Smalling will be the one who'll be sacrificed. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever but it was clearly what he said.

308~~~
The only decent one I can think of is Chiellini..but we arent getting him

309~~~
The way it seems to me is that he says he's not looking to upgrade on them, but if someone much better than them becomes available then it is possible we'll buy them. It's always possible to interpret what LVG says 50 different ways though due to his English.

310~~~
Laporte would be an interesting one.

311~~~
That ship sailed when he extended his contract few months back. 

Yes, that's what he meant. The critical aspect in the comment is that the upgrade is being sought for the right side, not the left which is where blind/Rojo play.

312~~~
Not a huge release clause either for someone of his talent.

313~~~
35 million pounds and knowing Bilbao they won't sell him for a penny less. It's overpriced but he's the obvious left-footed candidate. He's not the experienced leader we've been looking for but I feel like Smalling is growing into that role.

314~~~
Ofcourse they won't. It isn't an extreme amount for someone his age and quality. High ofcourse but that's how the market is.

315~~~
I'd seriously hate it if we spent big on Ramos or Otemendi and dropped Mike. He is the future of the club and LvG needs to get this left footed CB idea out of his head. It's ridiculous.

316~~~
The strangest thing is he eventually dropped it last season and played Jones and Smalling, which was followed by the most solid defensive performances all season. LVG's decisions simply defy logic.

317~~~
Please expand....

318~~~
Well he struggled when playing right fullback  and opposition players kept forcing him on to his left foot. He was very poor on his left, completely lacked confidence in using his left  and often made mistakes when he tried to get the ball on to his right foot. 
He seems more composed and assured now in that respect which to me looks like improvement.

319~~~
He's always been excellent at centre-half though I think. In fact, he has also had some very good games at right-back in his second season in my opinion, but I agree, that isn't his role.

320~~~
The bit I really like is that he seems to me to be stepping up and I am hoping he keeps it up and ends up becoming one of our key players long term.

321~~~
To be honest, if van Gaal thinks the RCB spot is the weak link he needs to get his head out of his ass. Why replace a really good defender for someone who will probably be worse? Because they can pass? Well we might have more completed passes from defence but we'll concede more goals. This fetish he has for left and right footed players is weird.

322~~~
There's nothing wrong with playing right and left footed defenders, what's wrong with it is while having the better right and left footed defenders we choose to play with the weaker defenders because their passing is better and even that's debatable.
We could do with another CB but not to replace Smalling, Rojo or Jones we need someone to replace Evans. I'd really like to see Smalling and Rojo build a partnership (Rojo coming back off another decent tournament). I understand the need for experienced CB but I think Smalling is starting to step up and bringing someone like Ramos will only halt that, I'd rather we bring in someone young but he has to be very talented like Zouma, Laporte, Varane, Stones and I'd even consider the Dutch Rekik + he's left footed too.

323~~~
Its weird indeed, to the point where Blind and Rojo are being shoehorned into the team.

324~~~
The Vidic/Ferdinand partnership probably wouldn't have existed under LVG. That's a fecking scary thought.

325~~~
It would be Rio/Vidic fighting it out to play next to Silvestre

Fresh from a fine display against <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2015/Aug/Match-report-Manchester-United-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, Manchester United defender <b>Chris Smalling</b> took time away from a hectic training schedule to answer questions from Reds fans on both <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/manchesterunited" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.wechat.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WeChat</a>.

<b>Firstly, Chris, congratulations on Saturday’s win. How important is it that you've started the season with three points? Yes, it is, especially given what happened last season [against Swansea]. </b>We all knew we had to walk off that pitch having taken three points and, even though it wasn’t our best performance, we dug in. Our togetherness ensured that we came through it.

We’ve used a number of formations under Louis van Gaal, and you’ve played with several centre-back partners. Do you feel you’ve adapted well?Yeah, but I think everything takes time. There was obviously a big transformation last year for all the players, a whole year of change, but I think we’re quite set on the way that we’re going to play now. In our minds, it’s quite clear.
<b><b>
The new signings seem to have settled in quickly; how impressed have you been with them?</b></b>Definitely, they have [settled in]. I think it’s important that all of them, bar Sergio [Romero], have had more or less a whole pre-season with us. We got to know them for around two-and-a-half weeks and none of them looked out of place on Saturday [against Tottenham] at all.

With that in mind, do you think this squad can challenge for trophies this season? </b></b>That should always be the target. Last season was a disappointment and I think our start really stopped us from challenging for anything, but if we can get off to a good start this year then this club should always aim for at least one trophy per season.
<b><b><b>
<b>You wore the captain’s armband for the first time last season. How was that experience, and what does the role involve? </b></b>It was pretty surreal! When the manager said earlier that week that he was going to give me that role, and in such a big game too against Arsenal, it was something I really looked forward to. I don’t think I really needed to change my game at all; on the pitch I’m quite vocal anyway, so it was just a case of continuing that. Obviously there’s the added pressure of wearing the armband, but that was something I really enjoyed and it was a day to savour.
<b>

<b>How did it feel to score that header in the Manchester derby back in April? </b></b>It was a great feeling. I think that especially after what happened in the reverse fixture [getting sent off], to get the win here at Old Trafford meant there were a lot of emotions in my celebration that day.

What has been your best performance in a United shirt? That has to be up there, doesn’t it?</b></b>Yes, I think that game has to be up there! Also, when we played Chelsea a few years ago and won 3-1; I scored a header in that as well. It’s always nice to produce a good performance but to top it off with a goal is always a little bit special.
<b><b>
Have you set yourself any targets for this season? Could we be seeing you in and around the box more often, or are you focusing on clean sheets? </b></b>I think that, first and foremost, I have to concentrate on clean sheets and really making sure I cement my position and get a good run of games throughout the season. If I can improve on my four goals from last year, I’ll be a happy man.
<b><b>
We’ve all seen the news on ManUtd.com, but are you really the fastest player in the team?</b></b>Well, we’ve never really had a test as such, but I think I am definitely up there, whether it’s 10 metres or whatever. I think the longer the distance, the quicker I am, and I think our fitness coach Tony Strudwick would back me as well! Maybe one day we’ll have a test…
<b><b>
Who’s the most competitive on the training pitch? Ashley Young reckons it’s Wayne Rooney…</b></b>I would definitely agree, he’s very competitive. On a Saturday at Old Trafford, you can see that out on the pitch, and he’s the same in training. I’ll have to agree with Ash on that one.
<b><b>
What advice would you give an amateur player trying to improve their defensive skills in training? </b></b>Just keep on practising, especially on your weak points. It’s alright if you’re tall like me because it’s easier in the air, but it’s also important to work on your weaker foot, positioning and turning. Maybe at the end of each session, just pick out a factor of your game, do that every week, and even just for five minutes ping balls with either foot. If you do that, by the end of the season, you should see a big improvement. You don’t need to keep hammering it, maybe just hit 10 or 12 balls, relax and go again the next day.
<b><b><b>
</b>
Who’s been the toughest striker you’ve come up against? </b></b>Tough one! When I was at Fulham, probably Didier Drogba in his prime – he was a real handful! Obviously he was big and strong when I played against him last year, but he also had that pace at the time as well. I think Sergio Aguero is another, with his movement. Drogba is strong and can pin you, but Aguero really doesn’t like to get close to you, so as a centre-back you’re quite worried because you like to feel them and know where they are. He often plays on the shoulder, so it can be quite difficult.
<b><b>
What did you learn from Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic during their time at the club? I</b></b> think how they went about themselves on a daily basis; training was just like a game every time they did it. I also learnt to take that commanding position, in that you are the voice, eyes and ears for the midfield, so you really need to make sure you take advantage of that. I think they utilised the position very well and really helped the squad to keep pushing on. A lot of it was down to those two.
<b><b><b>
<b>Going back to earlier in your career, how did you feel when you knew you were going to be signing for United? </b></b>Wow, it was a whirlwind of emotion! I think we were playing away at Blackburn and were just getting off the coach. My manager at the time, Roy Hodgson, pulled me to one side to say they’d accepted a bid and Sir Alex Ferguson was going to come to the hotel in 30 minutes. I didn’t know what to do! I called my mum, Sir Alex was there in no time and it escalated from there. It was great to know that possibly the biggest man in football wanted me to play for his team, a great feeling.
<b>
</b>
Was he a major draw for you? What was it about this club that first made you think “this is where I want to go”? </b></b>Yeah, definitely [Sir Alex a major draw]. I think he is ‘Mr. United’; the club is massive, easily the biggest in England and one of the biggest in the world. But to have him as a manager as well, it was a no-brainer.
<b><b>
When you were starting out, did you always think you’d reach the top level for club and country? </b></b>I think it was always a dream of mine. There are obviously no guarantees – when kids are growing up there are no certainties – but I think even when I was in secondary school the dream was there, but wasn’t always realistic. I kept training and playing alongside my studies and I was lucky enough for it to work out, but you always need to keep your options open because nothing is guaranteed.
<b><b>
I’m sure you’ll agree that during the pre-season tours, you can really see just how big this club is. How important is United’s global fan base to its success? </b></b>I think it’s massive, and it’s great that we get to go to places like Asia and America; it just goes to show how big this club is. I remember the reception was big on my first tour, but each year it just seems to get bigger and bigger! It’s good that we get to go and see those fans because you play all the games over there but don’t always get the chance to see them. It’s great that they can come down to training sessions as well as games.
<b><b>
And finally, with that in mind, our Chinese fans want to know if you’ve ever tried Chinese food and, if so, what's your favourite dish? </b></b>I am a fan of Wing’s [laughs]. I do like salt and pepper chicken wings, though – that’s a favourite, or chicken and black bean sauce with some egg fried rice.

329~~~
Top man. If the boss drops him (unduly), I'll be furious. You always get the impression that his position isn't quite safe yet though, despite him being the best performer back there.

330~~~
Is this even remotely true? If so does that make him the fastest CB in the league?

331~~~
Both him and Jones are the two quickest CBs in the league. I genuinely can't think of anyone else as quick as either of them.

332~~~
But if he is the fastest in the team then surely he must be quicker then a lot of the CF in the league, meaning he'd have them in his pocket in a counter attack situation.

333~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i1.dailypost.co.uk/incoming/article2618915.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/pics-image-1-457014819.jpg" src="http://i1.dailypost.co.uk/incoming/article2618915.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/pics-image-1-457014819.jpg"/> 

at the age of 37 he is still faster then most of the players in the league, not only centerbacks.....my favorite moments are when someone new joins the league and tries to outpace this guy, its always the same outcome - me laughing my ass off and Distin winning the race <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

334~~~
He is quicker than a lot of the CFs in the league.

Have you ever seen anyone get the better of him pace wise? There's examples of him going head to head with the likes of Ribery, Muller, Sterling, Willian and Welbeck from the last couple of seasons and winning.

335~~~

336~~~
If I be honest with you I don't recall any of that but that's probably because I haven't paid much attention to it.

Will definitely watch him closely tonight against Gabby Agbonlahor. That should give us a good indication.

337~~~
Smalling has been our fastest player for years. Baffles me that fans haven't already realised this.

338~~~
Anyone still doubting his pace?

339~~~
Agbonlahor's not even as fast as he used to be anyway. Bulked up way too much. Between his pace and his reading of the game, Smalling should be able to handle him easily enough. The problem will be if he targets Blind - and he'd be mad not to at least try it.

340~~~
Only centre back I can think of who is as quick is Koscielny

341~~~
My best mate's little brother once told me, apparently without motive, that I looked like a white Chris Smalling. I wasn't best pleased.

But you know what, right now I'll take it. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

342~~~
Distin is fecking rapid. Only a handful of players can outpace him, but few can outmuscle him. 

About Smalling's pace - he's rapid.

343~~~
I actually think he's faster, but Onouha might just be faster than both.

344~~~
Agbonlahor is a proper sprinter, so in a straight race, there are few as fast as him. He has lost a little in the first few yards, I'll give you that much. Look at his strides and running technique, he's more of a sprinter than the likes of Sterling is and will probably beat him in a foot race of more than 20 yards every day of the week. He does lack a little agility though.

345~~~
This. While persisting Hernandez is absolutely rapid based on a stat used from the WC in 2010. I have never seen Hernandez leave a defender for dead with his pace or show that he is anywhere near the fastest in the league. CB's need to use their pace less and less, but even when Smalling gets dragged out into the wide positions he shows he can match anyone for pace. Definitely one of the quickest in the league and probably up there as our fastest player.

346~~~
Agbonlahor is not going to trouble him pace wise tonight.

347~~~
Did we sign a young Rio again!

348~~~
Defending like a tank. Just one of those days on the ball though.

349~~~
Defends like a beast but can't pass water.

350~~~
Absolutely top drawer so far.

351~~~
If there's a weak link between Blind/Smalling, it's smalling. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Hasn't played that badly thus far to be fair.

352~~~
His defending been great again.

His passing shit again which nearly cost us a chance too.

353~~~
Based on the back end of last season and these first two games, Chris Smalling is quietly becoming one of the best CBs in the country.

354~~~
That half is why Van Gaal has reservations. Hospital passes and suicide passes. He defended very well in fairness.

355~~~
He's still hit about 10 less shanked passes than Rooney so far.

356~~~
What?

357~~~
Just needs to cutout the shitty passing and maintain concentration when the tempo slows.

358~~~
Well it's fairly self-explanatory despite your ridiculous post. 

I'm referring to the crap people have been saying about Blind in pre-season and yet Smalling is the one passing to the opposition and causing problems for us. Unless you're not watching match and missed that howler. Blind on the other hand has been totally fine and assured.

As I said though, Smalling hasn't played badly at all.

359~~~
Smalling's been our best player in my opinion. A couple of good blocks/interceptions and his reading of the game means he's winning all the headers. Blind hasn't done anything wrong per say, but he's been outshone by Mike.

360~~~
Such a great defender. Mix of Rio and Vidic - can play a high line and defend on the front foot, but also defends the box like a champion.

361~~~
We should be linked with right-sided centrebacks the entire season. Smalling really stepped up. Maybe having a solid midfield infront is showing Smalling's true colors?

362~~~
Another brilliant performance from him. Though he had a few shaky passes near the start of the game, could really do with sorting that out.

363~~~
He's top.

364~~~
Was nearly faultless, apart from that weird ball he gifted the opponent at one point

365~~~
I think you could probably find bad passes from everyone out there tonight. He defended very well again, even had the beating of Gestede in the air when he came on.

366~~~
Might be a player in there....

367~~~
Smalling is becoming the defender he looked like he might be back in 2010/11. Really pleased by how he's taken it on as the senior centre half. His career trajectory reminds me a little of Rio's. The young Rio was always vulnerable to lapses in concentration but as he aged he became a beast at the back, Smalling looks to be doing the same thing. Since City away last season Smalling seems to have got rid of the brain farts that used to make him a liability. In terms of height, pace, power, poise on the ball, Smalling has all the gifts. If given time by United to put it all together I can see him nailing down a spot at the heart of our defence for years to come.

368~~~
He's a monster.

369~~~
Solid again. Very pleased with him.

370~~~
Beast. Shades of Vidic how he dominated those headers and crosses.

371~~~
He showed both his strength and weakness today: he's a very very good defender but poor with the ball. Not sure what LVG thinks of him today but again, when we had to defend he was usually there and did well

372~~~
His hoof balls were annoying in the first half but defensively he is an absolute beast.

373~~~
I think right now. He is probably the best English Center back. Cant think of who is better than him right now. He was just so good organizing and in possession and mopping up all those long balls. So happy we extended his contract

374~~~
Standard Smalling. Good defensively but can't play the ball the way Van Gaal wants us too.

375~~~
When they brought that big facker, Smalling won every header! Reminiscent of Vidic back in the day

376~~~
Didn't think he was as imperious in the second half. Obviously his passing is very fallible, but he struggled in a few 1v1's in the early stages in the second half. I suppose that's because I judge him to a very high standard, as he very rarely loses out.

377~~~

378~~~
A beast once again but is it really a surprise at this point? He was putting in these kind of performances last season too.

379~~~
As a pure defender I think he's putting himself right up there, LvG really should tell him to drop it off short into midfield more though.

380~~~
He absolutely nullified Gestede's aerial threat, though.

381~~~
Other than the suicidal pass, he was imperious tonight. Some of the aerial dominance reminded me of Vidic.

382~~~
Great performance and loved that interception in particular. Just needs to improve his passing but if we play with a midfield trio with Carrick/Schweinsteiger at the base instead of a 4-2-3-1, then I think his build up play burden will be eased up much more.

383~~~
People have been panicking a bit seeing blind in defence but with Mike next to him I'm really just not worried about it.
I think between him, shaw and darmian we have a pretty good defence whatever happens in the other two positions.
Especially with schneiderlin around.

Romero looks pretty decent too

384~~~
It's 7 or 8 months now of consistent quality performances we've seen from him. 

Post the silly red card against City he's been really good, he finally looks like he's becoming the defender we wanted him to be.

385~~~
Must be so easy playing next to him. Rojo's best run of form came when he was partnered with Smalling, same with Jones (apart from a few games at the start of the season) and the only time Evans started to look decent last season was when he got a run of a few games with Smalling too. He even almost got a clean sheet along with De Gea at the Emirates with Blackett and McNair partnering him. He takes on the bulk of the defensive responsibility taking pressure off his partners.

386~~~
I always favored Smalling over Evans/Jones.  He has the most promise with his build/strength/speed to be the next Vidic.  I actually like the pairing of Blind/Smalling.  Both of them enjoy bringing the ball forward themselves and their passing is only going to get better as time goes on.

I actually have a lot of confidence in the:

Darmian - Smalling - Blind - Shaw
Schneiderlin - Carrick/Schweinsteiger

It's just feels so solid.

387~~~
My favorite memory of Smalling is what I believe was his first start which came against City at OT in 10/11.  I believe we defended a corner and City had too many men forward leaving them exposed on the counter.  Smalling sprinted past everybody demanding a through ball that never came, but he would have been clean through on goal.

388~~~
Name me one 25 year old defender who can carry a backline at a topclub ? Smalling is a solid rock.

389~~~
Beast in the air and solid all round. Bar the slipups at the start of course. Still, best we've got.

390~~~
Fecking love Mike, leads by example. Dare I say it... Captain material.

391~~~
I'd prefer rojo but the rest is as solid as you can get really.
Think Smalling would probably be first name i'd put down in our first 11.

392~~~
Class act!

Has really stepped it up since the City away game last season

393~~~
Defensively great, yet again. If he played for Chelsea under Mourinho he would be talked up a lot more from the general media I think. Needs to play it a lot simpler with his passing though, especially with Blind there beside him. The long punts up field into the channels rarely come off. Just needs to find Carrick or Schweinsteiger and let them do that.

394~~~
Class performance, I'm really stoked for him that he's putting in great performances. He is a very very good player.

395~~~
Come on, Shaw and Darmian are very solid players too and both he and Jones now have a midfielder playing next to them to compensate for their lack of ability on the ball. Hardly carrying a back line is it?

396~~~
Who is he carrying exactly?

397~~~
Superb last night. I was a actually concerned that Gestede might cause us problems when he came on but Smalling completely dominated him. Didn't do much, if anything, wrong all evening and looks like he has the makings of a decent partnership with Blind.

398~~~
Me too. To say we can have....
.... As a line up and have Jones, Blind and Carrick as back up, Solid.

399~~~
Needs to work on his passing, otherwise Smallingbauer will never go viral.

400~~~
What was it SAF said about Vidic? "He just enjoys defending."

That's the thing with Smalling too. You can tell he loves breaking up moves, tackling, winning aerial duels. He relishes the physical side of the game.

401~~~
Was impressed with how he stepped up when gestede came on. Was like he'd been preparing for him all week and was determined to win everything.

402~~~
Along with darmian he was our best defender last night, has to attack everything now blind is part of the back four. If he can stay fit this might be the season he finally gets recognition he deserves and establishes himself as one of the leagues best centre backs.

403~~~
Same as Spurs match really, looks a rock at the back. His height will be a massive help when we have to deal with long balls into a target man, Gestede didn't get a sniff.

404~~~
If he can stay injury free, we're in luck. He's our best CB by a country mile.

405~~~
Was disappointed with his passing last night. Despite his technical deficiencies he's better than that showing.

406~~~
Yeah, he was a beast aerially, though he always is so it's not much of a surprise. Still, thought he was quite shaky for the opening 5-10 of the second half, but generally he was decent. Passing is obviously troublesome for us at times to.

Trust me though, I'm a massive fan of his. Just don't think he was quite as excellent as some are suggesting tonight. Probably goes to show the standards he's now setting that I'm deeming it just a decent performance.

407~~~
Could you imagine if we sold him to Arsenal when we "wanted" Vermaelen? I think that would have been possibly the worst piece of transfer business ever concluded in the history of football.

408~~~
There's a player in there and will get even better once we find an experienced CB for him to play next to

409~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that would have been insane

410~~~
I find it odd how little recognition he still gets outside of United fans. Even after his displays in the last couple of the games, the narrative in a lot of the media and on other fansites seems to be "Schneiderlin and Darmian are all the more impressive because they're somehow making Smalling look good"

411~~~
The point i was trying to make was in regards to his talent and which defenders from the same age (at other clubs) are comparable.

412~~~
Fergie said the same of Smalling in his autobiography

413~~~
Most underrated CB in the league at the moment? Maybe not amongst United fans any more, but the rest still seem to see him as a big lad who can't pass. Wenger's repeated inquiries show not everyone's so slow on the uptake, though.

414~~~
I'd bet good money Mourinho would be after him as well if we put him on the market.

415~~~
Most improved player in the country over the last year or too by a billion miles.
Still failing to get recognition from neutrals but that's okay. 
I'll admit even up till a year ago I was still 50:50.
I feel so comfortable when he's out there now though.

416~~~
His passing hasn't been great in the last two games. He needs to concentrate more and look for the short pass, instead of hoofing the ball up. I don't think anyone should care that much though, he'll always look ropey. What's more important is that he has the leadership and athleticism our other CB's lack. I don't think it's right to say he changed after the red card against Manchester City... he was reliable before then and was our best CB under Moyes, IMO. He's been our best CB for a while now and I don't see any reason why he shouldn't be considered as one of the best CB's in the league if he continues like this.

417~~~
I think LVG needs to just accept, Smalling will never be all that in possession and appreciate his other qualities. I certainly have accepted this.

418~~~
He won't, and why should he?

419~~~
Because he is an outstanding defender.

420~~~
Fastest player has always been Rooney you know

421~~~
I think he has a bit, he plays him every week when all's said and done.
But theres room for improvement there and van gaal will pick on it i think - it'll do him good though.

Never a doubt in my mind that he would, thought it was pretty funny that Gestede just started pulling off to Blind and Shaw after 5 mins. It was like 'nope'.
Then Blind started beating him in the air.

I'm going to regret saying this but his fitness has been better than evans and jones for a long time really hasn't it? It's never been that bad really (cue him getting injured)

422~~~
i don't think we ever would have sold Smalling to be fair. Especially for vermaelen who if fit is nothing more than good

423~~~
Doesn't mean LVG has to accept on his flaws. And he's a very good defender, not outstanding.

424~~~
This.

Its amazing how many people think Smalling can't pass. If that were the case why does Wenger want him so much? As the Gooners say 'Arsene knows'. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Smalling's long passing may not be Frank Le Boef level but he is quite good at running with the ball. He's got good physical presence and pace. What he lacks is not the raw materials but the decision making and confidence to use the ball really effectively.

When Smalling stretches his legs he's hard for a pressing forward to stop, what he needs to add to his game is a bit of cleverness in his passing. I've seen Smalling bolt past a forward and into midfield with the ball loads of times. When he gets there though he often looks lost like 'Ok, what now?' Often if one of the midfielders is about he'll just go sideways to them. If he can learn to use the space that opens up for him when the midfielders take players away from his run, he could become a real weapon for us stepping out from the back.

425~~~
He has seemingly accepted Rooneys wonky touch hasnt he. Smallings one and only weakness is his passing everything else he has.

426~~~
Yet Rooney gets crucified on here for it. It’s amazing what a fan favourite can get away with isn’t it?

427~~~
What/Who are you talking about?

428~~~
What? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

429~~~
Rooney is not a defender...

430~~~
Rooney, kinda obvious.
Try reading the posts, it helps.

See above.

431~~~
To be fair Smalling has always been decent. In his first season he had some great displays, Marseille away I remember he was brilliant. It's when he started playing RB people got the impression he is shit, because he is dodgy on the ball. The last year playing at Centre back he has become a really reliable defender.

432~~~
I remember in his early United career he put in a great performance at the Etihad, he scored as well that day I think.

433~~~
He started off fairly well as a youngster for us and looked like a real top talent. Even at RB in the early parts of the 2011/2012 season he wasn't too bad, even though it was clear he's better as a centre back. He kind of had a lull for a couple of years after that and disappointingly stagnated, but he improved a lot last season and hopefully will carry it into this season.

434~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

435~~~
By all accounts we did try to buy Vermaelen before we got Rojo. Arsenal asked for Smalling in return. Thank god we were wise enough to say no!

436~~~
What a beast. So happy he's stepped up.

437~~~
He gets his head to pretty much every single hoof ball that the opponent plays. He reminds me of Vidic in that aspect. Clearly our best defender and should start every game if available. Jones can jump in when Smalling needs a rest or if LVG stops being stubborn and plays two right footed centre backs.

438~~~
He has been massive today. Looks like a proper top class centreback in the mould of Vidic and Ferdinand. Every tackle he's made has been clean and he's been harrassing their centre forwards without fouling them. Those Brugges strikers must be wondering what hit them.

439~~~
Been a beast today but when he wins the ball getting irritating how he doesn't seem to know now what to do with it.

440~~~
Must be so demoralising watching your CF getting brutally dominated by him.

441~~~
Might just have to get onboard this Smalling strumfest

442~~~
How many strikers can Smalling fit in his pocket?

443~~~
Jinxed him.

Interestingly enough - his first yellow the City game last November.

444~~~
I still dont understand why we dont rate his passing?  He does everything he has to do very well; no more and no less.

445~~~
Sometimes he really misplaces a pass but generally its quite decent.

446~~~
Yeh i wouldn't call him pique or ramos but his interplay between blind is important in keeping possesion for the whole team.  When we play jones or rojo that all goes away.

447~~~
Absolutely flawless again. It was 'only' Brugge, but I genuinely do think he could be the real deal.

And no, this isn't just <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/chris-smalling-2014-15-performances.394006/page-17#post-16663871">bandwagon jumping</a>.

448~~~
Another fantastic performance.

449~~~
That was hilariously dominant. He made those two forwards look like a right pair of clowns.

450~~~
Any pressure on him and his passing is absolutely diabolical. You could pull a fella off the street who could play a sideways  15 yard pass to Blind. His technical ability is a huge weakness in his game and you are one of a very few who doesn't think it's his weakness. Defensively he's been brilliant.

451~~~
Poor Brugge forwards were bullied by him today.

452~~~
No way he is even as good as Jones or rojo in his interplay and passing.

453~~~
He takes the ball of attackers like a dad playing with his kids in the park. Starting to remind me of Ferdinand in how effortless he makes defending look.

454~~~
Has defending ever looked so fun? He's somewhat exciting to watch.

455~~~
Yup, indomitable

456~~~
I came to say similar sentiments. Could be the opposition but if this is how he is developing, we really got a steal over Wenger.

457~~~
Absolutely immense again. Sensational at the back. Reads the game well, pace to burn and is a monster physically.

458~~~
I might be one of the few who thinks the opposite but looking at van gaals career; i can see what he sees in him.  Thats enough for me.

459~~~
Yeah I think he's brilliant to watch <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

460~~~
He's stepped up his game. Watch his passing get better and better as confidence level rises as well. He was taking the piss physically today. 

Also, his partnership with Blind seems to blossom quite nicely. Building a fine understanding.

461~~~
Need a gif of him running over that guy like a tank. fecking hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Best defender in the PL

462~~~
Reminds me of Rio with his standing tackles.

463~~~
He's like an octopus, the way he just swallows up players with his legs and girth. The ultimate defender for a high line, lots of pace and when he gets tight to the man high up, he's unshakeable.

464~~~
Ya, an extremely good defender. It's just your praise of passing range that I found strange.

465~~~
He just likes taking the piss out of defending doesn't he? He makes it look so easy at times; Sergio who?

466~~~
He really had both strikers in his pocket, to an almost comical degree.

He misplaced the odd pass but put in a performance to be considered for MOTM, which is impressive considering Depay scored two and set up one.

467~~~
Absolutely bullied them tonight. Beast mode.

468~~~
There's also shades of Vidic in him with the way he dominates and defends the box. Not saying, he's as good as either obviously but he's just so, so well rounded which is why changing partners doesn't seem to effect him.

469~~~
Let him just pass it simply then. It was never a problem when Vidic did it. His defensive ability makes him essential

470~~~
Jesus christ he's amazing.

471~~~
Deserved the captain's armband from Rooney. Bossing performance.

Using less strength but more precision and timing should also help him avoid injuries.

472~~~
World class

473~~~
Rio : I love him in this mode

Gary : what mode?

Rio : .... Beast mode

Rio was born to be on the caf.

474~~~
Haven't seen any of our defenders plays this well in years!

475~~~
Just wonderful. He's 70% of our defense

476~~~
Agree totally, defensively he's a beast. He does tend to get pressurized high up the pitch against the better sides but he will improve technically I'm sure.

477~~~
I never said anything about his passing range.  I said he keeps the ball moving.

478~~~
Fecking beast. Never seen such domination. It was borderline assault.

479~~~
Beast. He's come of age in terms of defending this season. He's really letting it be known he's there not getting pushed around by stronger attackers. The Brugge striker didn't know what hit him. Smalling pressured him every single time he got the ball and won it fairly and cleanly.

Second week in a row I assign a 10 next to his rating, he's started the season really well.

480~~~
Great defensively. Some bad passes though, probably the main reason LvG did favor Jones over him at the start of the season even though I would argue that Jones passing isn't much better.

481~~~
Great game.

482~~~
Should have been reported for child abuse before they had to substitute that striker

483~~~
His improvement curve is just phenomenal. More names for Smalling's pockets.

484~~~
Might as well give him the armband already.

485~~~
Incredible how easily he was dispossessing people tonight. It was fantastic to watch.

Just a shame he's so shite when the balls at his feet, otherwise his potential would be limitless.

486~~~
Put a MOTM performance today as well. Rock solid at the back.

487~~~
That was hilarious. He was dispossessing and outmuscling everyone tonight. Their strikers haven't got a clue what hit them.

488~~~
very good match

489~~~
Groundhog day with Smalling. Monster performance and if he keeps this up, he'll be wanted by other top clubs. Still can't pass for shit though.

490~~~
96% passing accuracy, 9.2km distance covered which is a bloody lot for a CB.

491~~~
Ridiculous

492~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Did he really say that

493~~~
he's on fire at the moment. would've been my MOTM if it wasn't for memphis running the show up front being involved in every goal.

said this many times but I just hope he stays injury free.

494~~~
Three very good games in a row, I think him and Blind are showing signs of a promising partnership as well.

495~~~
Another great game for him tonight,he was just cleaning up at the back,I would have given him MOTM.

496~~~
He's going to be a wonderful captain <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

497~~~
He was fantastic again today, seems to be playing both sides of the cb roles at times in order to attack the ball or close players down and allow blind to be the spare man. Finally showing signs of fulfilling his potential.

498~~~
Where'd you get those stats? Link?

499~~~
I think it's clicked now. He's finally gone to the next level.

Please stay fit.

500~~~
Imperious.

501~~~
He's like an athletic wall of doom for attackers right now, love watching him play.

502~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2016/matches/live/index.html?day=-2&amp;session=1&amp;match=2015651" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsle...ive/index.html?day=-2&amp;session=1&amp;match=2015651</a>

503~~~
He did indeed <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

504~~~
Rio said it best he's in " beast mode" at the moment.

if a frontline of messi and ronaldo was running at him and he would steamroll them too, that's how confident he seems

505~~~
He sure did, made me laugh

506~~~
Can't see any striker in the PL being able to get on top of him physically. He's just so dominant. Keeps improving too, which is great. Really good performance.

507~~~
Maybe Lukaku/Benteke on their best days, other than that no one. We often think everything elsewhere is so much better, but you wont see Ramos/Hummels/Silva having such performances week in and out. They're just more consistent and better on the ball.

508~~~
Standard Smalling.

Great athlete, and hard to beat 1v1. Not great on the ball.

If he could be coached into improving that aspect he'd be superb. Surely one of the best athletes in the league.

509~~~
Their striker will be having nightmares

510~~~
Absolute monster performance defensively.  His passing isn't great, but he's certainly improved in that aspect and it seems to be something he's conscious of.

511~~~
I can't wait to see him against Costa, Benteke and Lukaku when he is in this form. Those duels will be absolutely great to watch <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

512~~~
He's handled Lukaku and Costa before (the 1-1 draw at OT) but Benteke's given him a tough time when they've played. I remember when Benteke shoved him to the floor for that goal a few seasons back, although in Smalling's defence he had just come back from illness(?) <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
Aguero is the only one in the league I've truly seen him struggle with, but then it's more because Aguero is so excellent at finding space and not really going one on one with a defender and just being a real all round nuisance.

513~~~
Overly used but well deserved title of ''beast'' today.

514~~~
He hasn't come across Costa yet. Was injured during both games against us - Drogba played up front in both. But yeah, a contest against Costa will be quite fascinating who's managed to wind up the likes of Ramos and Pepe. Chris is a cool customer though, no concerns.

515~~~
Need a vine of the Rio "beast mode" comment.

516~~~
Yeh it's Rojo we'd need to worry about being wound up. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

517~~~
MotM over a guy who scored two and had an assist...sums it up.

518~~~
Big Mike<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> What a performance. Keep it up and don't get injured!

519~~~
The guy that got subbed will be having nightmares of Smalling and Shaw. Got bullied every time he got the ball <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

520~~~
Made their strikers look like schoolkids, it was amazing.

521~~~
He bullied that one school kid for 60 minutes, then his big brother came on, and Smalling decided he'd bully him too.

He's actually a right bastard when you think about it.

522~~~
He wasn't playing in the premier league and, like the argument going on in the Memphis thread, it's premature but... I'll let it pass because he was absolutely excellent tonight. One of the most dominant defensive displays I've seen in quite some time.

523~~~
Have to add the obligatory; Brick Walling <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Would have been easily my MOM If not for Memphis's two sensational goals (that far post curler <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>)

524~~~
Terrific performance. I lost count the number of times he shepherded the poor Brugge back towards his own goal, then nicked it off him to start the counter. On par with Memphis on this night. Yes it was that good.

525~~~
Can't wait to watch him bully Cisse come Saturday. I am very intrigued to see him and Costa go one v one.

526~~~
Started this season like a man possessed.

527~~~
I like Mike.

528~~~
Man of the match

529~~~
Why do people say "good defensively but poor passing"? How many of those bad passes did he make today? I only recall one- when he kicked it out of the pitch.

Saying such things when he had 98% accuracy sounds like a cliché to me. He’s improving passing, that what needs to be said after this game, no more.

530~~~
And to me, that didn't even look like a pass. Looked like he ran out of options and just knocked it out for a throw (if we're talking about the one on the left wing).

531~~~
Chris Smalling stars in Magic Mike 3 - is that your centre forward in his pocket?

532~~~
Thought he was great as usual.  Another excellent defensive performance from him.  If Smalling was better on the ball, he'd be a world-class CB.  As it is, I'm pretty fecking ecstatic with him.  He's fast, physical, and reads the game well.  Hope these performances give him the confidence to really kick off into another gear.  Expecting really big things from him this season.

533~~~
His ability on the ball is poor for a top level player.

It isn't simply about how many passes reach their intended target. 

It is how long it takes a player to bring the ball under control and get the ball out of their feet to their teammate, the longer time a player takes on the ball, the more opportunity the opposition get to close down space all over the pitch. Smalling takes longer on the ball than you would like, especially if the ball is harder to control. You saw early in the game yesterday a pronounced example of this when he received a bad pass, failed to control it quickly and shanked it out of play under pressure. 

It is also about weight of pass. He played a pass back to Romero yesterday that had too much power on it so Romero had to take a touch to bring it under control before making a pass to a teammate, this was whilst a striker was closing down on him. Unlike Smalling, Romero is adept with the ball at his feet and was able to do this but it invites unwanted pressure.

Daley Blind has demonstrated the level of ability on the ball that LVG wants from his defenders in the past two games. His assist last night for Depay was fantastic, he read the run and executed the pass perfectly. He made a similar pass against Villa to Depay that took several of their players out of the game. This is a high level of ability on the ball for a defender but the level that LVG wants. Smalling is not capable of this by a long shot.

Not that I don't rate him as a defender, it was almost comical the way in which he bullied the Brugge forwards last night but I do feel that LVG would replace him if he could.

534~~~
It's fantastic to see how many people are now beginning to recognise him as a top class defender, I've been championing him for years and injuries barring he will continue to put in confident dominant displays against any team in my opinion.

His passing can improve, of course he's by no means perfect.

But frankly, I'm of the opinion that he's a defender first, and he's doing that job brilliantly. The responsibility of bringing the ball out from the back shouldn't rest solely with him, and the 'philosophy' isn't going to fall apart if he isn't the most proficient passer.

All in all I expect him to have a dominant season, and come the end of it he will be spoken about and respected as amongst the leagues best defenders - by opposition fans, not just our own.

535~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seems like he completely turned it around after his red card at City last year. Very impressive to see how strong he's becoming and how clean his tackles are.

536~~~
When talking about defenders, I've never understood it. It was a big topic about Ramos as well <i>Oh my god he's amazing on the ball!!..</i> Yes, but can he defend?...

537~~~
of course it matters. if you lose possession it's no use, or if you take too long to get the ball moving again it slows things down.

I think the lack of ability on the ball is something that will always be there with Smalling. He's a good defender, and a great athlete, but he isn't a top footballer.

He's started the season great though, and I think Blind compliments him well.

538~~~
If Smalling can finally stay fit all season and continue this level of performance, only  that's when he'll start to be recognised as a defender we can rely on. Until then, despite his ability, there will be contrinue to be doubts hanging over his head.

Delighted for him though, played another stormer.

539~~~
If you can defend zone, defend your man one on one and/or organize your team mates then I couldn't give a bollocks what you're like on the ball. Personally, anyway.

540~~~
It matters in Van Gaal's system because that how it works!

541~~~
That is why he's the manager and I am the fan. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

542~~~
Reminiscent of Vidic at his dominating best.

Chrissy Smalling woah woah.

543~~~
Don't have a problem with his distribution to be honest. Instead of trying to thread the ball through the eye of a needle he just gallops forward like a gazelle on steroids and inevitably puts himself into a position for a much easier ball, it's just as effective as passing from the back.

544~~~

Courtesy of <a class="username" data-user="90184, @Barnslig" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90184/">@Barnslig</a>, here's the clip of Rio on Smalling's "beast mode". <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

546~~~
As I had said in the "is Smalling the best CB in the league" thread, if he remains fit, he will prove that he is by the end of the season.

547~~~
Don't know where to start! I've always had my doubts about Smalling and when he got himself sent off against City last season for two stupid yellows, I didn't want to see him in a United shirt ever again.

Well, I'm happy to be eating my own words. Ever since that moment he has improved game after game, and this season he's proving to be immense. Scrap that, he's in God mode. Untouchable. In fact, I'm not sure we should be bidding for Harry Kane - he's likely to be suffering from emotional distress after the hounding that Chris gave him the other week.

Best chant of the night against Brugge was "there's only one Mike Smalling!"

I thought our defence was going to be our undoing this season, but in Mike we trust.

548~~~
Beast mode engaged! Love it.

549~~~
I hope for his sake he doesn't suffer any major injury setbacks at any point. If he continues in this vain he'll be starting for England next summer... justifiably so too.

I reckon him and Stones would make a grand pairing.

550~~~
Also he was given the armband after Rooney went off. I thought it would have gone to Schweinsteiger but great to see Van Gaal continuing to recognise Mike's efforts from last season.

551~~~
Lineker felt obliged to translate it for the non social media part of the audience <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

552~~~
It seems like he's been doing a lot of interviews etc since last season too - hopefully he's being groomed for the captaincy? I think he's the perfect candidate too - top professional, great attitude and comes across extremely well off the pitch. Plus the fact that he is British/homegrown would make him a preferred choice in the eyes of the higher ups at the club to be face of the club.

553~~~
Dominant and excellent performance. He is 70% of our back four when it comes to defending. Whenever it gets dangerous, he's there to clear the situation

554~~~
Rio is made for the Caf <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

555~~~
I'm absolutely loving watching Smalling "come of age". He's finally stepping up and its great to see

556~~~
That just sounds really wrong...

and yet I full agree.

557~~~
Hope he stay's injury free, and in some ways he's reminding me of Rio commanding his box and calmness yeah still a bit rough round the edges but once they are smoothed out will be at OT for many a year.

558~~~
Been wondering why, since his very first season, anyone saw anything other than an outstanding centre-half. Seems most United fans are now believers, although outside of the club, not so much. By the end of the season, I expect him to get the recognition her deserves. That will come from Euro and international performances. Roy gave him his break and is a believer, and I am sure he'll be an England regular if he is fit from now on.

559~~~
Me too. In terms of defensive attributes, he's basically the same player. Just a lot more confident, more of a leader - and that's just natural because he's the most senior defender at the club now (which is incredible to think as he's only 25).

560~~~
There was always more excitement on Jones, who's probably more of a 'typical' hard as nails defender, especially when you consider what SAF (or Sir Bobby?) said about him potentially being the next best player to play for the club. I don't know why, I wholeheartedly agree Smalling has been an elite prospect since the day we signed him.

561~~~
That Diaby guy for Brugge must've had nightmares about Smalling yesterday. That said, I can imagine most players who come up against him do. *cough* Harry Kane *cough*. 

Had another super performance yesterday.

562~~~
really starting to step into Rio's boots

563~~~
As I already said last season, it should be Smalling plus one

564~~~
Was brilliant yesterday, swept everything up without a problem, pushed their forward around and didn't give him a sniff... God I hope he stays fit. He really has it in him to become the undisputed best defender in the country and one of the best in the world, just needs to stay fit. Can say the exact same about Shaw.

565~~~
I've got a good feeling about this season; I feel we'll turn out to be a well oiled machine not really over-reliant on a single player... Except Smalling <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> Really need him to stay fit

566~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsDu0qv7NfM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Beast mode...he's no Xavi but his passing anit bad as people make out

567~~~
He's been very good since the 2nd half of last season but this season he seems to have realized just how big and strong he actually is. Men against boys is a phrase which gets used a lot but there have been times this season where he actually genuinely looked like an adult playing against children the way people have been just bouncing off him

568~~~
His every move tells his full of confidence right now. What I really like is his positioning and anticipating. Opposing player gets a pass but Smalling is already there and takes a ball of him in a second cause of his great positioning and anticipating where the pass will go. Or he presses so good attacking player is left with very few options with the ball.

569~~~
Think Harry Kane's still in his back pocket mate. Kane's probably pretty good friends with Rudy Gestede now since the two of them spent so much time there.

570~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

571~~~
I just have a smile on my face every time i watch Smalling play. He is showing up all the feckers who were making jokes about him, especially the media. He will make mistakes during the season, but any defender will make mistakes, no matter how good they are.

572~~~
The guys like a octopus when a striker tries to hold the ball up, he simply wraps his legs around and knocks it away. Watching him ease people off the ball the same way the school captain does to the chess club fill ins at house football was brilliant.

573~~~
Lmao, how many times did he put that striker on his ass with a gentle shove. Beast. 

I like that he isn't afraid to the play the ball forward and inbwetwen the lines i.e between two players rather than just going square. 

Also since LVG has come in, it's obvious he's been told to play with the ball more and he's shown more than a few times, that if there's space to maraud forward (when the strikers shepherd you to run past them into the 'danger' space through the middle) he will take it. Muppet mode but it's Lucio/Silva esque. It's a bit greedy to wish but I hope he can develop his forward game a bit where he will go box to box. That would be utter brilliant to see him deliver the final ball/have a go in the in/near the box himself.

574~~~
Been saying it for years that the lad is class and our best defender. I still think he can add another level to his game.

575~~~
Three games in, he's been comfortably our best player. Flawless, really. I was surprised to see Memphis rated higher than him for the Brugge game - two great goals, yes, but he wasted good chances too, whereas you could go back over Smalling's performance with hindsight and still struggle to spot anything he could have done better.

576~~~
Fantastic form so far. Looking forward to seeing how he fares against the likes of Benteke, Costa, and Aguero.

577~~~
Yeah, I have noticed the British media (finally) beginning to actually realise that the lad is a good defender. Even now it seems more like reluctant praise - "starting to show signs of becoming a solid PL defender" for instance.

578~~~
Probably the yellow card was his only blemish.

579~~~
First ever box to box centre back? Feck it, why not.

580~~~
This would be waaaaaay further down the line (with Smalling needing to improve a lot on that end) but having a defender, who's comfortable with bringing the ball out past the half way line would be a massive help to the team if we are being pressed by a very good team.

581~~~
Missed probably our easiest chance of the night. That said, he was outstanding again

582~~~
This run of form is like the English Boateng. Long may it last!

583~~~
Love it when he goes on those runs.

584~~~
The back four has looked a little more vulnerable today than the previous 3 games. He seems to be holding it all together though. Enormous presence. His passing has been great too.

585~~~
Had his best game on the ball for ages today, passed it well. Interested to see his pass accuracy stats.

586~~~
Excellent again today, such an excellent defender.

587~~~
Great game again from him, is there a team who he wouldn't start for?

588~~~
Some good passing. Got my MOTM. If he wasn't that then he was in the top 2 or 3 anyway. Another good game.

589~~~
Consistently been our best defender. If only that header went in!

590~~~
I might wake up the whole neighborhood when that header was blocked in the line.

Anyway, he's cruising his way up to become United captain.

591~~~
Almost won it for us at the other. Such a special, special talent.

592~~~
He's gotten so good and dominant in defending where the entire pub is cheering for his every move/tackle/header like Fellaini vs Valencia last year (when Old Trafford was out of line) but not sarcastically.  

He makes playing CB look easy, dare I say like a prime Rio <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

593~~~
Bin Rooney and Captain Chris will roam free

594~~~
A bit weird comparing him to a player that's younger than him.

595~~~
A bit weird focusing on age when everything else makes sense.

596~~~
A woman on fancam called him 'Smalldini'.

597~~~
He's really approaching that Rio/Vidic level isn't he? The games towards the end of last season & beginning of this have been excellent. Hasn't put a foot wrong.

It's been a while since I've seen a United defence under pressure during games & had confidence that one of them will just 'sort it out' so to speak. 

Genuinely nice bloke too by all accounts. Hope he continues his rise in prominence.

598~~~
No. It was a weird comparison. Comparing a player that everyone watches every week to a younger player in a different league that most people watch few times a year. Comparisons are made so it's easier to understand what you're talking about.

599~~~
Boating is a year older than Smalling, no?

600~~~
One of our most important players, if not the most important. Dread to think of him getting injured. We have no one who can replicate his dominance.

601~~~
England's best centre half right now. Cahill and Jagielka cant hold a candle to Chris Smalling.

602~~~
He is, mixed them up. Doesn't change my point but would have changed my wording.

603~~~
Would have been great if he had scored the winner. And so apt given his start to the season.

604~~~
Yeah, no worries man. Just had me google them quick because I was sure Smalling was younger. But I was surprised it was only by a year.

605~~~
He seems to be the only player who is bent on advancing the ball.

606~~~
As Memphis was about to take the corner, I said to my brother that Smalling would head it in only for it to hit the bar <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

607~~~
The player he promised to be in his first year seems to have finally arrived!

608~~~
Good point, although Memphis' was easier. To have got up and got to a header first in the opposition's box means you've already done 50% of the hard work. Putting it in the net is only half the battle. Whereas all Memphis had to do to get his chance was... be there. So his was easier.

Anyway, we're quibbling over nothing - that mistake aside, he was perfect.

609~~~
He's our best player.

No, seriously.

610~~~
After DDG, he's the only one who is putting quality performances week in and week out, he's set a very high standard for himself for this past year, compared to the likes of Rooney, Mata who can be quite anonimous often. Shaw, Carrick, Smalling are imo our most consistent players when fit, and consistent at a high level.

611~~~
First game all season he hasn't been in contention for our MOTM. Feels weird.

612~~~
He should have been IMO. Did everything spot on and is clearly the leader at the back.

613~~~
looks like fantastic four at the back so far, Smalling leading the line by example. People complaining about Smalling's technique - who complained about Vidic's technique which is most certainly inferior to Smalling's who can bring the ball out of defense like a king is also a beasty defender, dominant in the air and outsprints any player in the world. 

I think we have world class defender on our hands but probably we already know it, the player just needs to stay fit and consistent which won't be a problem as it seems at all, with Darmian looking very consistent and another world class talent Shaw, the only piece of jigsaw missing looks like the left center back but so far Blind showed he deserves the spot even long term he's still only a back up in my eyes.. 

Also with Schneiderlin in front of them it's easier to defend..

614~~~
Scared me a few times by half limping.

615~~~
If he can stay fit...oh man... Since the start of this season every time he is near the ball i am 0% nervous. Love to see that in a defender.

616~~~
Our player of the season so far, by far. I rate him as the best player at the club after DDG. He's been imperious since he was sent off versus City last season, and he has gone up several levels this season.

617~~~
He's brilliant. Along with Shaw, they've been our two best players this season. He's really picked himself up since the arrival of LvG.

618~~~
Does anyone know what the longest he's gone without an injury for is? Feels like this must be up there with his longest injury free run.

619~~~
Running out of comments for him now to be honest. Exactly what we've come to expect - another top class performance.

620~~~
Have to say? He did get caught out on some trough balls later in the first half, otherwise once again a rock.

621~~~
12 games straight. More than Jones (10) and Evans (7) going back to 2012

622~~~
Absolute titan. The balance in our defensive five is better than it's been since 2009.

623~~~
Hopefully he just keeps doing what he's doing and stays injury free. Should be one of the first names on the teamsheet

624~~~
What are the odds on an opposition player scoring against us before Christmas with Mike 'the beast mode' Smalling spearheading our defence?

625~~~
That isn't saying much. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Very true, though. It's the first time since Rio & Vida were partners that we have a settled, organised back four that doesn't make the goalkeeper look like he is in some sort of defence vs attack training drill. Smalling is at the centre of that.

626~~~
He's eating forwards alive, we need to put him in Carbonite between matches.

627~~~
Was hard to really judge him considering the stream I had was pretty poor. Glad he did well again though.

628~~~
Dominant yet again from Mike. He's been our best player this season so far, with Shaw a close second. 

Looks like this could be a real breakout year for him.

629~~~
Defence and the defensive play by the rest of the team is looking good, if not really tested by a top team yet. Only slight weak spots are Blind in the air and occasional loss of focus from Romero but good to see a stable back four at last. Compare to last season's nonsense chopping and changing and back threes and injuries is huge.

630~~~
He was my MOTM, doing a hell of a lot work for 3 players today.

631~~~
Did the job of two centre backs today. Blind was exposed, and they constantly went for that left channel. It's not a criticism to Blind, but when you've got a player like Gomis, you're going to do that. Smalling was sweeping up everything. His marking could have been better for the first goal, but getting back into shape on the counter is very difficult, and it's something we did do very well for nearly the whole game. The one time we didn't, they scored.

632~~~
He's a beast really. Him and Shaw our 2 best players by far today

633~~~
Couldn't do much more today - he had to do Blind's job whenever the ball was played to Gomis, and also had to cover for Darmian on occasion. He could have done better for the first goal, but I think he and Blind should share the blame on that one. The worrying thing is that it was Ayew vs 2. They seem to work well together, but I can't see it being very fruitful long term. He's been our best player this season alongside Shaw, but he'd benefit so much from having a real centre-back alongside him.

634~~~
He was in beast mode at times today, especially when he would just take command and get across to help Blind (Darmian tucking in also helps and him and Smalling have a great understanding there).

Want to see more of him and Rojo tbh.

635~~~
Him and Shaw were our best IMO. They've been the standouts all season really.

636~~~
Get Rojo alongside him and we'll be fine.

637~~~
Rojo has so many mistakes in him.

638~~~
This season.

639~~~
How many mistakes he made last season. 

Anyhow I might be in a minority but wasn't he at fault a bit for 2nd goal, he let Gomis run behind him and just watched the pass to him.

640~~~
They said the same about Smalling......

641~~~
The keeper was coming for the ball and IMO he left it for him but, oh well

642~~~
Yeah but striker was behind his back, and was first to the ball. Then again it should have been an easy save for Romero.

643~~~
In terms of he season I'd add darmian to them... All 3 have been great. The best in the league in their positions, or will prove to be if this is too small of a sample size.

644~~~
Yep in the positives thread I named all 3. Darmian is a bit behind the other two though. All three have been pretty fantastic.

645~~~
Yet another peerless defensive performance from Smalling, I can't see how anyone can question his ability now, he's an absolute rock.

646~~~
How many MOTM awards/performances can one man have in just over a month?

647~~~
He plays for Manchester United, that is reason enough for most non-United fans.

648~~~
Always backed him to come good and turn into a top class defender. So pleased with this form and finally putting the "Phil Jones is better" brigade firmly in there cages.

He has everything in his locker. We just need to wrap him in cotton wool in between games.

649~~~
There isn't a better CB playing at the moment. He's absolutely on fire.

650~~~
Him and Shaw are absolute tanks for us and England.

651~~~
Mike is improving massively. But that yellow card was so silly from the referee, Mike got the ball clearly. Also deserved MOTM.

652~~~
He's really kicked on, and is unarguably turning into the best English centre-back.  I still think Jones has the potential to be of a similar level, albeit a different type of player.  And that they could turn into an awesome pair - Would love to see the pair of them anchoring United and England for the next 6 or 8 years!<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

653~~~
Him and Luke will be a big part of the England defence for years to come and United's. Proud ofthem both.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

654~~~
And with Shaw on the left!

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

655~~~
Unless Phil practices with his left a bit more it'll be a rarity.

656~~~
Yeah, thought that after I posted.  We actually should have got Clyne just for shits and giggles.

Or we get a manager who isn't so obsessed.

657~~~
I'll be honest, when I saw this bumped and because this is an international weekend, my biggest fear was  an injury.Im glad he's just played well, although that really isnt a suprise anymore.

658~~~
If he wasn't here, everyone would be jumping up and down to buy him. It's always amazes me how we sometimes don't rate our own players. It's daft to think there were many on here that was campaigning to sell him. Maybe we should trust LVG a little more. If we can get Jones fit, maybe there's a player in there too....

659~~~
Took a knock at the end, hopefully it's not serious.

660~~~
Glad to hear he played well again. Benteke will probably be his biggest test so far this season, I'm confident he can deal with him though.

661~~~
Luke Shaw and Chris Smalling are absolutely top of their profession right now.

662~~~
Well, he wasn't obsessed with it last season, so perhaps, like 3-5-2, he'll drop it.

For someone who everyone calls 'stubborn' all the time, he isn't hesitant to adjust things.

663~~~
Starting to get the recognition he deserves.

664~~~
It's amazing the transformation under LVG's stewardship, seems a different player, and England's best defender at the moment.

665~~~
To be fair, he just started to show form towards middle of last season and has continued this season.

666~~~
He's always had it in him IMO - of course lvg deserves credit but what held smalling back was vidic/rio and injuries.

667~~~
And Fergie temporarily deciding (and unintentionally convincing media) that he was a right back.

668~~~
Always had the potential, he joined in 2010, now realising that potential.  Looks a different player to me under LVG, for whatever reason.

669~~~
Yeah absolutely. Though that could've been because of Rio/Vidic? And our struggles to find a decent, fit, right back?

670~~~
Our most important player now?

671~~~
I think he just needed consistent game time at cb. Which was rarely afforded to him. Let's hope he keeps it up. One thing missing from him is distribution though. When he improves a bit more, he's going to be one of the top CB's in the world. Hell at this current rate, he'll be one regardless.

672~~~
Nah, IMO Kane is better than Benteke and Gomis is a similar standard. Strikers who rely on their physicality play right into Smalling's hands.

673~~~
He has some really good attributes, but most importantly for me he looks like he owns his area and takes control of situations. He seems to have a bit of Vidic and Rio.

674~~~
Smalling Shaw Darmain all we need now is Stones and Kane!

675~~~
I agree with those saying he always had it in him. He's been putting in some dominant displays for a while, they're just quickly forgotten about in amongst the injuries, poor form of team etc. This is what age and experience brings to a defender though, most players in fact.

676~~~
Can't we just focus on the quality of his performances without having to take the opportunity to denigrate another member of the squad? 

They both play in the same team, Smalling just happens to be in the midst of the best football of his career so far. He's been excellent this season. Jones doesn't really need to be part of the conversation.

677~~~
He did play well tonight, wasn't really tested that much but dealt with things fine

678~~~
Funnily enough for a team terrible defensively last season we have the best GK, LB, CB and RB in the league, add a world class CB beside Smalling and it could be Rio, Vida, VDS, Evra all over again <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

679~~~
It just feels like outside of United fans it's been slow going for him to get some media credit he's merited for close to 10 months.

680~~~
Any team without a settled back four will struggle. We have that so far this season.

681~~~
Can people see yet that the guys is passing the ball much better?  We are a premier league team and we cannot have complete ball playing defenders everywhere. 

In that problem; smalling arrives as the best you can get when adding collosul strength and a decent ability to find a pass.

682~~~
Fergie always did taht to give squad players games, especially young ones. He did it with Fletcher, Evans, O'Shea. even Wes Brown became a RB through playing out of position.

I've always rated Smalling above Jones so it's good to see he's proving it by most importantly staying fit and getting the game time he needed to keep developing.

683~~~
Been a monster for us and now country too. Can anyone post his highlights from the England game? Would love to see it.

684~~~
Also, it's high time Jones learns a thing or two from Mike!

685~~~
Yeah. agreed with that.

686~~~
Pleased to hear he did well again.

687~~~
Yeah, its Blind I'm worried about.

688~~~
He is the meat in a Smalling - Shaw sandwich, he basically has nothing to do.

689~~~
Amazing how far he's come in the last 12 months. If Jones could achieve a similar improvement our central defence would be sorted for years

690~~~
Touch wood, it's because Smalling has managed to stay fit for the past 6 months. I'm sure if Jones managed to stay fit for an increased period of time, you'd also see improvements in his game.

691~~~
Our Mike was pretty beastly last night.

692~~~
In fairness to the lad he had been superb this season, if he can maintain his form and find a decent partner then we have the makings of a solid back four.

693~~~
Or 2010, depending on which way you look at it.

694~~~
Needs to stay fit, I'm sure he can improve if he does.

695~~~
To an extent I actually agree with you and I'm fully in favour of him playing there. 

The way I look at it is that we play a system that is in essence 3 defenders at the back. The way we set up to accommodate that is Darmian naturally covering inside for Smalling who operates as our only genuine centre back and covers Blind's space. Blind has the permission to carry the ball out and also the responsibility to cover Shaw who has license to press forward. 


So as a unit we cover from right to left with Darmian, Smalling and then generally speaking either Blind or Shaw in the back line. The reason we can do this confidently is because of the cover provided by our 6, be it Schneiderlin or Carrick. 

As a unit it's excellent and works very well and would be appreciated more if the front 4 were operating as well, with more dynamism and actually putting away chances.

696~~~
Player of the month nomination. Fully deserved.

697~~~
Very deserved! Keep it up Mike <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

698~~~
I doubt they will give it to a defender though. Gomis or someone will get it. Is he the only defender nominated? Who is our last winner by the way ?

699~~~
Probably de Gea at one stage last season.

700~~~
I expect Mahrez will win it, but its good that Smalling has been nominated, hope he keeps it up. Looks like he can stake a claim to be the no1 English CB

701~~~
This is the key for me, for all the we don't create enough bollocks, I have seen so many chances fluffed.

702~~~

703~~~
But he's only been good for half a season! 

Obviously stats aren't everything but this highlights that he's had two full seasons of good performances now. Even the other seasons weren't bad, he just didn't play that often and a lot of his games came at RB.

704~~~
Dont think he was any less than Darmian tbf, he and Shaw have been our best players for a while in my opinion.

705~~~
Smalling showed a lot of promise even in his first season. I think it was that 2-1 win v City with THAT Rooney goal where Smalling just dominated Tevez all game. Did annoy me when fans were screaming for him to get sold because of his performances at RB and his injury worries, I'm so glad we kept him.

706~~~
He had very good performances under Fergie as well. He's been immense since the City game last year.

707~~~
---------Schneiderlin-----------
Shaw--LCB--Smalling-Darmian
-----------De Gea--------------

Looks very defensively solid and athletic, too. 

We probably should have just paid for Otamendi or another good CB and tried to win every game 1-0 this year with our variation on parking the bus where we always have the ball.

708~~~
Captain Chris can't be stopped

709~~~
Mike is going places here.

710~~~
I get scared when this thread gets bumped.

711~~~
My local paper always has reports on craft shows at near by village halls and the awards they hand out are clearly made up on the spot just to make sure anyone who turned up gets a trophy or certificate. "Best floral display without the use of an orange flower" or "best painting by a left handed female in the 54-57 age category". 

I'm pretty sure the same thing is happening here.

712~~~
He should get Mike on the back of his shirt. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

713~~~
I'm pretty sure you've never heard of the Guiness World records book then, what do you think how they are able to fill that much pages? There's a whole lot of bullshit in there, and Chris certainly doesn't top that list.

714~~~
Aw shucks his record has been matched.

715~~~
The best CB in the league at the moment, IMO.

716~~~
He's bloody mega. Shame about that super freak goal, him and Blind emasculated Benteke for most of the game.

717~~~
From now on this thread should just contain post after post of "BEAST" after each game.

718~~~
He's pretty spectacular, isn't he?

719~~~
I love Smalling, but it is possible. Chelsea did it with Carvalho and Terry.

720~~~
He seems to be permanently stuck in beast mode.

721~~~

722~~~
It's been a long way but Mike finally proved his worth. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

723~~~
Another rock solid game. MOTM for me.

724~~~
Me too. Again one of the few positives in an otherwise miserable performance.

One thing I did like in this game, which I've never noticed before, is towards the end he kept making forward runs when we had aimless possession around the halfway line. He'd make an advanced run behind the striker, but every time we'd just pass backwards again, despite the fact we were losing. I like to see that attacking mentality but it's a shame no one passed to him because we're not prepared to take risks. He was visibly and understandably frustrated when his runs were ignored.

725~~~
He's an absolute animal. Looked like a proper leader on the pitch tonight.

726~~~
Pretty good today again today.

Even did his best to try and drive forward.

727~~~
That run on goal he made was probably the highlight of the night, Memphis's goal aside. Brilliant play.

728~~~
Would have loved to have seen him score from his bouldering run, it took me a moment to realize it was him as he was so far up the pitch in a non-set piece situation. Excellent defensively again and suits the Captain's armband.

729~~~
His ball playing skills just keep getting better and better.

730~~~
I thought he wasn't as good defensively as he has been in the last few matches. Maybe that is because he had a new CB partner. Still pretty good though.

731~~~
Class defender.

732~~~
I see no reason to break him and Blind now. They obviously have great communication built up.

Think hes a beast and is getting better. LVG has done him right imo.

733~~~
Immense.

734~~~
We need to protect him as much as we can because I worry if he were to pick up an injury.

735~~~
Needs to play with Blind. Blind suits him a lot more than Rojo did.

736~~~
Love him as our captain. This lad has come a long way and is really among top defenders in the league. Given that horrific thing that happened to Shaw, I beg to whoever almighty that he may continue uninjured all season long. 

Also, maybe somebody can help me remember - is him& McNair a sensible pairing? I remember Paddy being a great prospect.

737~~~
beast mode is right, he's been throwing forwards around like rag-dolls all season
Utds POTY so far, long may it continue

738~~~
MOTM for me. Deserved the armband as well, think it suited him. Having born leaders like Schweinsteiger around can only help him with that.

739~~~
If only he'd have scored from that darting run <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

740~~~
It doesn't matter who he pairs up with. All our other CB had their best games pairing up with Smalling last season, even Evans.

741~~~
I knew he would't score. looking back, it was a big miss.

742~~~
He is my player of the season so far comfortably. <i>But</i> my one criticism of him as a captain on Tuesday was that after the Shaw injury while there was a break in play, I would have really liked for him to get the players together, give them a little pep talk, try to ensure that the injury doesnt affect the team (as best as he could, obviously there still could be some impact).

To be fair, the cameras didnt really show what our players were doing at the time, so it is quite possible that he was doing all that stuff anyway.

As a leader of the back four I think Smalling has come on leaps and bounds - you can see that he is more vocal and authoritative. Basically he is much more confident in his own abilities, and he can project that to those around him. The next step for him if he is to be a club captain (I say "a" rather than "the" because you can have more than one leader in the squad) is to become that leader not just for the defenders but for the entire team.

743~~~
Good point

744~~~
I remember having numerous dicussions in the Hummels thread whereby I was dead against signing Hummels as I thought it was obvious to anybody who watched Smalling at centre half that these types of performances where in them.  This got plenty more potential in there too improve further and long may it continue.

It has certainly helped him having blind next to him as Blinds ability on te ball takes the responsibility away from Smalling to "build up the playfrom the back".

Last season I was all for Smalling Rojo being how first choice partnership.  However, with the shaw injury I hope Rojo goes in at left back and we keep smalling and blind together

745~~~
He's played really well and i'm happy that he has proven me wrong, never thought he could play this well consistently let's hope he can keep it up. Not sure about him as captain though.

746~~~
You could briefly see all the players doing various exercises in the background to keep warm. 

I don't think it's possible for fans to know who's suitable as captain.We don't know them well enough or how they interact with the rest of the squad.

747~~~
Think it's pretty clear that despite Smalling wearing the armband Schweinsteiger was the leader on the pitch.

748~~~
According to Keane he still hasn't proved he is worthy to be a United player

749~~~
I understand, but our performance suffered after the Shaw injury and it clearly affected the team. Im not blaming Smalling (or anyone else) for that, but rather I think in the aftermath it would have been the ideal time for the captain to bring the players together and rally them.

750~~~
It's all the same to these former players. The majority probably still see him as a liability, and would sit there saying selling him and Jones should happen because they've not 'shown enough'. And if they were to get sold they'd bang on about how we're losing our identity like with Welbeck

751~~~
Imagine being Keane's kids.... You'd stand no chance of ever impressing your dad. 
I was just replying to the part where you said the cameras didn't show what the players were doing to be honest. I get your point.

752~~~
Any sentence that starts 'according to Keane' is always going to end with unmitigated feckwittery, but this is out there even by his standards.

753~~~
A couple of outstanding performances against the big teams and I think we can confidently call him the best CB in the world (top 5 at the very least).

Of course, he is English and he plays for United so this is not going to bode well with others.

754~~~
That run he made recovering for Darmian,who was all over the place, against that quick winger of theirs showed one of the things why he is so important. His recovery pace is amazing. Weird then that Rio said no defenders has that ability to recover. All our defenders, bar Blind, are fast.

755~~~
I'd say he's been the best center back in the league so far this season.

756~~~
I don't get it why he's spewing so much utter nonsense. What is the point? Is he ever following up his reasoning, particularly when he's slating players who quite clearly are good enough to play for United?

Silly old man.

757~~~
Guardado set to miss 6 weeks over this:

It didn't look that bad then. What a tragic game that was.

758~~~
According to Keane, Churchill was an average leader.

759~~~
Had a lot to do today as things to his left were calamitous.

760~~~
Only centre back who knows how to win a duel against a good player. He cannot go into every duel in and around the box. Rojo was better than Blind though.

761~~~
I don't think a revolving door of centre back partners will help him. That last 15/20 minutes next to McNair were the shakiest he's looked all season

762~~~
Oh I agree, my comment wasn't meant as a negative, without Shaw there to help Blind it made Smallings job on the physical side of things that much harder.

763~~~
The shakiest he has looked all season.

764~~~
Agree that he didn't look as good today, but Southampton were arguably our toughest test so far for periods of the game since they often looked dangerous in attack. I'd say that Smalling still looked better than Blind today.

765~~~
I thought he was very disappointing for the first goal.

766~~~
I thought he was alright, but nowhere as good as other recent games.  I'm not sure how much Shaw's absence will affect his play.

767~~~
Yeah, he should do all the defensive work the team has to do all on his own and stop relying on his team mates.

768~~~
Yes, you are right.

769~~~
I don't think that's what he meant.

770~~~
That was probably his worst game of the season, which speaks volumes as he didn't actually play that bad. Made a feck load of clearances.

771~~~
Not really sure what he could've done tbh, it was Blind that lost Mane.

He was terrible for the Pelle chance that hit the post, other than that I thought he was good.

772~~~
His worst game of the season. Pelle was on fire early on though and he did a better job than Blind at handling him. Think all the change around him is going to impact upon his form.

773~~~
Read over on Scott from RoM gave him a 5 rating on ESPNFC, stating he was at fault for both goals. Not really sure what that's about. McNair should have been on Pelle for the 2nd and really not sure how Smalling was at fault for Pelle getting on the loose ball for the first- at that point everyone was running back and reacting to the cross.

774~~~
Didn't take responsibility, there were a few times in the second half especially where a defender like Vidic or Terry would have clattered through about 4 players and eliminated the danger but Smalling was far too passive.

775~~~
Magic Mike!!! Another strong performance after a nervy start. Controlled the game and his touch under pressure was quite soothing to watch. I like it when he does not go and try to head the ball out of the defense every time. He reads the play and if required chests or controls the ball to ensure we do not give away possession. Just the CB LVG loves!

776~~~
I also thought that he was not as commanding and in control as in the past few games. Doesnt help if LVG doesnt play a settled back four

777~~~
He's grown into such a commanding figure at the back, I never imagined having so much confidence in him to deal with what ever comes his way.

778~~~
Boss man.

779~~~
Mike the beast <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

780~~~
Mike is bombad boss man! 

He really is an imposing defender these days. I've argued that he is a great talent all the way, but now he is superb.

781~~~
Mike is definitely the better Smalling. Been immense ever since they switched them at that press conference.

782~~~

783~~~
That article says Arsenal bid again for him this summer. Another one that got away, eh, Wenger? <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

784~~~
Arsene can lick Ed's balls. He doesnt give up, fair play to him, but Evans was the only CB who was available. Maybe if he asked nicely, we would have loaned them Paddy or Blackett, but thats as far as we would go to solve their defensive mess.

785~~~
Just so dominant.

786~~~
Best defender in the league

787~~~
Beast mode.

788~~~
The boss at the back, his psychical attributes are now being married to composure and confidence.

789~~~
The obvious future United Captain. He's fast to become the collection of excellent CB United has had.

790~~~
England's best CB by a mile. I love how he bullies strikers nowadays, so dominant.

791~~~
One of the best center backs in the league (maybe the best). I loved it when was facing the Sunderland player (who I forgot) and he just led him wide into the corner flag and then tackled the ball of him. Brilliant.

792~~~
Fletcher.

793~~~
He's really taken up the mantle after the old guard left. A prospect a couple of seasons ago to being one of our main leaders on the pitch. What an excellent defender he's developed into.

794~~~
People were laughing when the thread about him being possibly the best CB in the league was made. Have said it since they both joined the club, for all of Jones's hype, Smalling will end up the much ore accomplished CB. Absolutely excellent.

795~~~
That run in the first half, with the pass to Rooney [who messed up] was properly beast mode.

796~~~
Please stay fit.

797~~~
Some of the names nominated that were allegedly better than him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

798~~~
Yeah. Just wait for him to get sent off again so that we can write off everything and start from scratch again.

799~~~
Steven Fletcher must have felt something rotten today. Bullied.

800~~~
Very, very solid. Loved how he indicated to the rest of the defence to play their right-winger offside when he ran past Smalling. Just completely in control of the situation. The dispossessing of Fletcher was very smart as well.

801~~~
Beast today.

802~~~
Had Borini in his pocket all game, and then Fletcher after him. I honestly don't think there's a better centre back in this league, which is a credit to his development at United.

803~~~
He's looking amazingly confident. He always had that touch of class but it was almost as though he didn't trust himself enough. Whatever LVG has tried to help him turn the corner, if it is the managers input, then it has surely worked.

804~~~
Loved that little backheel flick he made to Blind in the second. Real sign of confidence.

805~~~
Delighted at how LVG has helped him develop. A great character and a credit to our team. Hopefully a future captain.

806~~~
Although his passing has been getting better for some time there's been a marked improvement in more recent matches. It seems like he's cut out the more ambitious stuff and is more comfortable playing into the feet of the midfielders through the lines.

807~~~
I think having Blind next to him helps massively all round. As opposed to trying to find that long pass he just has to square it to Blind who can and has played some absolutely fantastic balls over the top in the last few games.

808~~~
One thing I am enjoying with Smalling now are those bursting runs with purpose. Before he would burst forward from defence into a nice position occupying the midfield area, look around and then pass backwards to his defensive partner and it frustrated the fecking life out of me. I used to watch thinking, yes Smalling, go on lad! Then in the next breath I'd be screaming, ffs Smalling, you could have made that pass from the position you were in before, why bother?

Now he seems to burst forward and look for a forward pass, which I'm sure is what the whole point of him making a great run forward in the first place. This added to his already great defensive attributes and he is looking the real deal for us this season. Hope he can stay fit!.

809~~~
Apart from 1 half mistake he was spotless yesterday.

I wonder how.much is he worth in todays market? 30 mil?

810~~~
He's stepped it up another level this season, he's been excellent in almost every game . Feel so confident with him now, it has got to the stage where I'm surprised if he is beaten.

Mangala cost more than that, put another £20m on for Smalling <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

811~~~
If Everton are valuing Stones at ~40m and Managala was ~36m 
I'd put him above 40m easily.

812~~~
Deserves the armband. #SmallingForCaptain

813~~~
I wouldn't consider selling him at all even if we were offered £50m. Great defenders suitable for the Premier League are a real struggle to find/sign at the moment and we have a gem in our hands. Homegrown and hopefully captaincy material too <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

814~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I can see him being captain for club and country in a few years. Definitely has the quality and he's really starting to show the leadership skills too.

815~~~
Agreed, and with his style of play, he can continue until mid 30's comfortably, that's at least 8 years. I wouldn't sell him for any price <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

816~~~
He's averaging 8+ every game so far, an absolute beast in every sense. Physically dominating, but also positionally and decision making is top notch. He's also much more comfortable on the ball these days, but that's always only been a small doubt of his. 

If he can start scoring a few more headers he will be the complete centre back. Absolutely love Smalldini

817~~~
He's incredibly mobile for a centerback his size. Near impossible to beat in 1 v 1 situations.

818~~~
Getting to a point where I just expect Smalling to have a great game. Up to now, he hasn't disappointed.

819~~~
He's been nothing but incredible this season. A real dominating presence about him.

820~~~
Best CB in the league, hard to argue against it now. Even his weakest part of his game (his passing) is looking assured.

821~~~
The beast in action 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3JGeDGO29s?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

822~~~
Brick walling is now scoring too <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Could've had a few more this season going by the earlier games!

823~~~
This guy.

824~~~
He's become a really excellent player, I'm delighted for him.

825~~~
After the goal just absolutely brilliant once again, it has become his standard it seems and its great to have him !

826~~~
Boss level G.

827~~~
I love Mike so much.

828~~~
Can see him being our next captain.

829~~~
Rio-like and that's the best compliment I'll give a centre back at United.

830~~~
Probably deserves some of the blame for their goal for getting dragged out of position so much, although the majority of the blame lies with Valencia. Very good besides that though and a very nice finish for the winner.

831~~~
Absolute beast.

832~~~
As his predecessor aptly said before : "beast mode".

833~~~
#CaptainChrisPlusWhoever

834~~~
Can't say enough good things about him. Great defending, fantastic goal.

835~~~
MOTM for me. He's in incredible form. I'd go as far as to call that his best performance this season.

836~~~
Just imagine how good he will be when he reaches Sakho's level.

837~~~
Got a sneaky feeling he injured himself out of the Arsenal match today. Hopefully not as he was a beast yet again.

838~~~
Really happy for Smalling. Guy is just getting more and more confident. Obviously good he's taking on board whatever's being taught. Keep it up Mike!

839~~~
Standard performance from him, it's like he woke up one day, realised how hench he is and decided to bully people. Just don't get injured!

840~~~
I doubt he would have went on that run right at the death if he was seriously hurt.

841~~~
That last 15 seconds perfectly encapsulated why I love big Mike.

842~~~
Beast mode!

843~~~
Incredible once again.

844~~~
The level he has been performing at over the last 6-7 months is around the level of Rio Ferdinand in his prime in my opinion, if not even better.

845~~~
Hopefully you're right, just a sneaky feeling I've got.

846~~~
Chill out <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's been great, but lets not be ridiculous.

847~~~
That is the highest praise I've ever heard about big Mike.

848~~~
nearly shat myself when he landed awkward. Hes a fecking legend at the moment

849~~~
For the love of God please stop.

850~~~
To think Van Gaal was going to start with Jones and Blind at the start of the season.

851~~~
Yeah was the biggest scare of the night. He's arguably our most important player at the moment - he glues our defence together single-handedly in the middle. We're fecked if he's out.

852~~~
The poster must be higher than the praise because it's going completely overboard. Rio is United's greatest ever defender imo.

853~~~
He's getting 7's and 8's by the caf week in week out. Rio's ceiling wasn't much higher than what we've seen of Smalling lately, but the challenge is to maintain this level for several seasons, which is something Rio did and is therefore considered a legend. If Smalling continues the way he has been playing over the last couple of months for 7-8 more years, I'm sure he'll be rated as highly as Rio.

854~~~
Becoming more and more one of the best centre backs in Europe. Future captain at this rate.

I hated his stupid red card against City last year but he's improved ten-fold since.

855~~~
How was he better than Vidic? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

856~~~
Shit myself when he went down. 

My favourite part was the last minute. Took control, engaged beast mode and took us over the line.

857~~~
Unless Rooney manages to keep his place in the side for years to come, I think Smalling's nailed on. Strikes me as a leader, has been here for a while, and is developing into a crucial player for us.

858~~~
Great performance, has to defend for both himself and blind a lot and really important goal as well. Hard to think how we will cope if he gets injured.

859~~~
Imagine him with a really top class partner, Darmian and Shaw out wide and De Gea in goal..... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

860~~~
He needs to work on bending his legs when he lands. Otherwise a great performance.

861~~~
Smalling has been sensational this season, coming off the back of a great end to last season. Since that red card against City actually, he's been incredible.

But let's calm down with the peak Rio comparisons. Rio Ferdinand at his best was the best defender in the world and the best i've ever seen at Old Trafford. As great as Smalling has been, he's not there yet.

862~~~
My MOTM, would have gone to Mata, but considering we were under the cosh for such a long period in the second half, had to give it to the big man.

863~~~
Best defender in the league this season by a distance, add Jones beside him and we might have a solid pair for years. It's crazy how highly Jones is rated by opposition fans, he's only 23 too!

864~~~
1man defence, he's not our best defender.. he's our best player now, fullstop.

865~~~
What a player.

866~~~
He was.

867~~~
I'd generally opt for Vidic out of the two myself, although a lot prefer Ferdinand. He was probably a better overall footballer than Vidic, to be fair.

868~~~
BEAST MODE!

869~~~
ITV deciding tonight that actually he was a bit shit, and always has an error in him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

870~~~
Just give him the armband Louis! Another imperious performance, like most here a clenched my cheeks when he landed awkwardly.

871~~~
Really it should be him or BFS as captain

872~~~
Big Mike is an absolute colussus of a defender. Always has a goal in him, he is irreplaceable for us and worth gold at this moment.

873~~~
our best defender by miles.

874~~~
Been a beast since the name change

875~~~
Big Mike mom for me

876~~~
Mike was in beast mode once again tonight. He was colossal in those last 15 minutes chasing down every ball.

877~~~
One of the best defenders in Europe.

878~~~
Gif of the "right guys, I've decided the game is over" moment?

879~~~
Just seen it. Ridiculous.

880~~~
He was a bit guilty of chasing the ball for their goal when the better choice would have been to hold his position but it was pretty much his only error and even then I doubt it would have made much difference as he was left 2v1. Very strange to pick him up on it considering it was the least of a few mistakes for the goal and he was so influential at every other point in the game.

881~~~
My favourite player atm. I always knew he'd turn out good eventually. Best defender in the PL.

882~~~
Brilliant player. Best centre half in England.

883~~~
Well done Chris another great performance, proving a lot of people wrong including me. Hope he can keep it going.

884~~~
I think it was part of his fault in Wolfburg's goal but other than that, Mike was exellent. If it was LvG , i would fecking give him captain band right now. No one deserves it than him.

885~~~
I think he's started to believe that he's actually Mike Smalling and forgotten the things that were holding Chris Smalling back.

886~~~
Captain Mike!

887~~~
Cafe underrates him massively.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/foxDifQ.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/foxDifQ.png"/>

888~~~
I am glad people start to give him the credit he deserves. I remember a lot of stick I was getting when I said that as a defender he is better than a certain player (not a better player, but a better defender). Finally he is proving it.

889~~~
Stepped up a gear this season, i think we've got our Rio replacement now.

890~~~
I suppose it depends on what attributes you prefer in a CB but I've always preferred the ones who use their great reading of the game to stop situations before they have a chance to become dangerous rather than ones who use their great tacking skills in last ditch attempts. I rated Vidic very highly too fwiw, just thought Ferdinand was more complete.

891~~~
Not only Utd's player of the year so far..But the  best player in the Premiership  now Silva is injured...Love him to bits!

892~~~
Dont be ridiculous, 9.5 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

893~~~
So you decide on who's the best player by your personal preference on their style? That's ridiculus.

894~~~
First off since this is the greatest hits tribute thread, tonight Mike was fecking boss.

Secondly I agree with you on that part about reading of the game and no doubt Rio was a more rounder footballer but imo I think Vidic was the better player.

It's not a case of 'oh Vidic made more defensive tackles and was generally seen as more active/busy' but.. ok yes that is a part of it but also I think the 'intelligent' players are sometimes too happy to sit and dictate than be pro-active and strange as it sounds not just take part but impose themselves in the game.

I've be a big critic of Carrick and he basically sums up what I mean, a lot of ability, doesn't/hasn't used it to impose himself enough. It's why we love Schweinsteiger, he's displayed all the class of his reading of the game but never shies away from trying to force the issue. With Rio, I felt Vidic more than carried his side of defensive duties and even when he wasn't playing with Rio, he carried whoever his partner was.

895~~~
I think he was at fault for losing Caliguri for the first goal, but other than that he's been very solid.

Going along nicely, hopefully Jones can make a similar breakthrough this season and we'll have the best pair of CB in the league as predicted years ago.

896~~~
That finish was nice too. Not easy to slide in like that with the outside of the foot.

897~~~
of all the players involved he was the least at fault for the goal, he did make a small mistake but compared with others its minimal...
Pathetic defending from Blind and Schneiderlin + Valencia was 5 yards behind everyone else in the defence! Smalls should of stayed more central and not be dragged to the ball but at that point they already had us on toast.

898~~~
<a class="username" data-user="88551, @Pentame" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88551/">@Pentame</a> That's not what I'm doing, did you miss my last sentence where I said I thought Ferdinand was more complete? He was faster, better on the ball, better at reading the game and just as good a leader. Vidic was better in the air and probably a batter tackler and stronger but it's not as if Ferdinand was weak or a bad tackler himself. But Vidic struggled badly with pace even at his best, while I don't think there was a certain type of striker that Ferdinand ever had a weakness for.

<a class="username" data-user="95602, @criticalanalysis" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95602/">@criticalanalysis</a> I could have misunderstood your point but if you're saying Ferdinand needed Vidic next to him to be at his best then I disagree. He first reached his best level next to Vidic but don't forget he also played very well with others next to him. Him and Evans in the second half of 11/12 for example and also in 12/13. 

This isn't the thread for this discussion though tbh, we should probably drop it now.

899~~~
Vidic wasn't that slow in his prime. Ferdinand was just extremly quick which may have made Vidic look slow. Vidic was quite a lot better defensively in my opinion, but obviously wasn't near Ferdinand at all when it comes to technical abilities. But in their prime, Vidic was overall the best out of the two, I'm sure most would agree with me on that.

900~~~
Woke up and saw Mike had scored <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. My favourite player nowadays. Absolute beast. What is this about an injury concern? I really hope he isn't out of the Arsenal match. I want to see him put Walcott in his pocket and leave him in his dust in a foot race!

901~~~
He's fine, he just landed hard on his foot but he carried on fine.

902~~~
He is on an altogether different level than the team and helping Blind flourish with him. Monster!!!

Someone needs to teach him how to celebrate goals. Been shitty!! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

903~~~
The new Rio?  And still only 25. Long may it continue!

904~~~
Vidic wasn't quite a lot better defensively than Ferdinand. Quite a lot better than Evans and O'Shea, perhaps, but not Ferdinand. That implies gulf-like differences in defensive ability, which was never the case.

Anyways, I love seeing Mike getting praise. As someone who's been a fan since he arrived, and who've spent the last five years defending him from criticism, I love seeing him living up to his potential. Potential legend in the making if he continues like this.

905~~~
I had something similar playing a game of fives, ended up with a tibial plateau fracture.

Happened when the Femur hit the top of my tibia hard, he's lucky not to get injured with that one.

906~~~
I was his biggest critic, but thankfully I'll eat humble pie all day. He's lost the nerves he used to carry into every game, began to utilise his size and strength, he believes in himself, which has transformed him entirely.
Could be player of the season if he keeps this up!

There's only 1 Mile Smalling! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

907~~~
Best centreback in the world, there I said it.

908~~~
From a neutral - yes he's playing well, and is a great player.  But the best?  No. just no.

909~~~
He is the best in the PL, but not so sure about the world. Mind you, I don't watch enough of the other leagues to even have an opinion of whether he is the best in the world.

910~~~
I disagree. Vidic was a tank and I enjoyed his fearlessness, but overall Ferdinand was the best with no question in my mind.

911~~~
Amazing what an injury-free run can do, as well as playing alongside someone like Blind who is so good on the ball, and Darmian on the right has helped him. He's looking like the best CB in the league atm.

LvG deserves credit as well. Long may it continue. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

912~~~
Not the best in the world and I'm a massive fan. On ball game lacks compared to the likes of Boateng and Ramos, and he doesn't obviously have their pedigree yet in Europe. I think he's got the talent to get there though, ridiculously talented defender.

913~~~
Smalling's only problem is that he goes on a run, shows good form, then gets injured and is then in and out of the team. The only thing holding him back is these constant injuries he seems to get. He is due one. When he fell on his leg yesterday, i was fearing the worst. MUST stay fit if we are to mount a serious title challenge. Losing Shaw and Smalling would in my opinion be a massive dent to any title hopes we may have. Looks world class at present.

914~~~
He was majestic yesterday. In imperial form. His anticipation, strength, and desire is second to none. His reading of the game has gone up immeasurably, and his confidence is sky high. Future cap't right here, me thinks, and if he continues in this form it won't be long until he's winning Player of the Season awards. He was awesome yesterday. As Rio would say, 'Beast mode'. Just shows what a consistent run in the first team does for a player's game.

915~~~
imo hes better defensively than both Boateng and Ramos, of course I'm going to be biased though <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

916~~~
His ball playing ability is what has impressed me the most. I used to bring up the fact that he was quite good at RB for us in his debut season, pointing to the ripping of Kolarov in the CS, but his ability to burst through the back has been so good. Keep up the good work Smaller **.

917~~~
I am not sure there is a better CB out there in the world right now. I literally don't know if Blind is really that good at CB, or is Smalling making him look a world beater?. IF you put him in any top team in the world he wouldn't look out of place. If he keeps this form up for the rest of the season he is our player of the year.

918~~~
He's brilliant. 

Loved our fans singing "there's only one Mike Smalling" after he scored!

919~~~
I has hoping for this too. <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> ?

920~~~
It really is amazing to see how he's become a fan favourite after years of injuries and being almost-there-but-not-quite. It wasn't so long ago that I would have gladly gotten rid of Smalling and kept Evans.

As for comparisons with Rio, well I don't think he's there yet, but it's always better to see the caf in an unreasonably positive mood than being unbearably negative.

921~~~
need the time <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

922~~~
He's not..the problem with the caf is the extremes, if he plays poorly then they will be cries to sell him..see the reaction after the City game less than 12 months ago. 

He is in phenomenal form though and if he remains this consistent, he will be counted among some of the best soon enough.

923~~~
Chris has been a colossus.

924~~~
It was literally the last action of the game.

925~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/nlz4" width="560"></iframe>

926~~~
This is negative. Even last season he suffered less injuries and time off than all our other senior CBs. He's now started 12 consecutive games, which is more than Jones and Evans started consecutively (Evans best for 4 seasons was 7 consecutive before he left).

927~~~
Nice to see some of the other players acknowledging his performance at the end, didn't notice that last night.

928~~~
What a player

929~~~
I'm biased but meh, still think it, I just don't ever expect Smalling to be dribbled of beaten in the air, ever.

930~~~
This sudden Media narrative of 'Oh wow where did this Smalling come from?' is so annoying. One of the journos even asked in the press conference today what LVG Had done to Smalling as his 'progress has surprised a lot of people'.

Sorry, but anyone with a brain cell who has watched Smalling since he signed for us could have been his obvious talent.

931~~~
It's clear that he's always had plenty of potential, but to be fair his game has improved massively in the past year.

932~~~
Defensively he seems pretty much the same to me. More physical and confident though thanks to actually getting game time in his best position.

933~~~
His defensive ability is perhaps fairly similar, but the physicality and confidence aspect can be a massive factor which affects a players game. He's also a lot more reliable: not that he was too error prone as such, but he's ironed out most of the weaknesses and errors which we perhaps did occasionally see.

934~~~
His ability on the ball and his confidence have improved (although that is to be expected with age). But he's always been a fantastic defender. Everyone could see that from day one. Its really not this huge massive surprise that as he gets more experience he's developed further. But its not like this big massive shock thats come from nowhere.

935~~~
Yeah people on the cafe have said that for years now. The majority of oppostion fans I know still think Smalling is clueless and braindead so it's no surprise the media think the same. 

Considering Smalling is 25 and Jones 23 I'm starting to wonder if he will also prove himself to be a formidable defender

936~~~
Lee Dixon last night - 'Smalling is the kind of defender you always think has a mistake in him'. 

They clearly don't actually watch us, and just run with the preset narrative. Sadly, most people follow what the media says.

937~~~
Yep, Smalling has been in good form since before that Man City red card but the media has largely ignored it. I myself at the time thought he was useless/stupid after the redcard but now looking back I can see that it was only a blip in form. It's a shame that people getting paid for this analysis can't be bothered to look back and accept they might be wrong with their initial opinion

Anyway it seems Smalling is finally getting the praise he deserves

938~~~
I am still waiting how can Jones improve if he can stay injury free for a long time. I think he is even bigger talent than Smalling.

939~~~
Nice to see so many supporters with Smalling 12 shirts on this season too. Shows how far he's come.

940~~~
Take my hat off to him, he has been fantastic this season.

941~~~
Don't know what else he has to do to convince opposition fans and the media, he's been fecking colossal for some time now and yet you still get those sorts of comments from pundits like Lee Dixon and oppositions fans smirking and laughing when you try and discuss Smalling. 

Doesn't matter really, as long as he keeps performing the way he is doing I couldn't give a feck what they think, it's our defence and team that will benefit.

942~~~
Even jackass Roy Keane said something similar just recently

943~~~
His talent and ability was obvious years ago. Yes he was prone to the occasional glaring error, but most young defenders are. Then came the injuries. He's now finally getting a proper run in the side, and he's putting it all together. 

What's surprised me though, is how he's picked it up psychologically. He now plays like he truly believes he can lead the Manchester United defence. That was something that Evans, for all his experience and undoubted talent, could never do.

944~~~
This! He certainly is the bigger talent but needs to stay injury free and apply the same consistency and discipline Mike has shown. Before his injury, I was really looking forward to see to Smalling - Jones CB pairing this season.

945~~~
Yeah. I still genuinely believe that without the injuries, and a little of the old ruthlessness from Ferguson, Smalling could have and should have been doing this two or three seasons ago.

His defending is visibly more aggressive right now, in part due to confidence, but Smalling's actual ability to defend has never, ever been in doubt and I've been convinced on that since his first derby game against Manchester City.

This form hasn't surprised me in the slightest.

946~~~

947~~~
I really doubt it. Point is, I always thought that Smalling is the more talented of two. If you look at Smalling's debute season, he showed there much more than Jones has ecer shown. Then, it was a combination of injuries, playing as RB and suddenly getting behind Evans in pecking order which made Smalling's career not progress that much. But for as much as defending goes, he was always very talented. If he plays like this for the entire season (which I think he will barring injuries) then he would be accepted as the best defender in the league.

On the other side, Jones has so many basic problems with his defending. At times, he is as naive as Valencia. Obviously, the defenders generally peak in their mid/late twenties so there is still time, but Jones need to improve even basic defending things, something that Smalling never had to cause he always read the game very well.

948~~~
He really, really isn't. He's a great athlete which potentially makes him a great defender. Smalling is a freak of an athlete. Athleticism wise there is no contest between them.

Then you look at their games, Smalling's has always been far more polished than Jones - ever since he joined the club as a 21 year old. Stronger in the air, cleaner on the ground and his positioning has never been suspect. Unless Jones suddenly develops into a Pique/Ramos on the ball, Smalling's defensive talent will always make him the superior player.

949~~~
Smalling is a better athlete, but Jones was the better footballer. However I'm not convinced that's the case anymore.

Smalling has came on so much this season. He's improved on the ball a lot, and his defending/athleticism was never bad, but he's improved upon that and presses higher.

Jones has a higher potential ceiling but due to injuries it's doubtful he'll ever reach it. He can't stay fit, and he'll struggle to break up the Blind - Smalling partnership.

950~~~
I agree, it's obvious that Rio was the better player.

951~~~
Everybody were creaming themselves silly on here after Jones's debut. Injuries and his own temperament have held him back but to claim his ceiling is less than Smalling is very disingenuous.

I still have hope for Jones. As frustratingly stupid as he is most of the time, his tenacity makes the lad very endearing. Hopefully he can shake off his bad luck as he matures, and kick on at Utd.

952~~~
Center backs mature little later than other players IMO, you always tend to play experienced players at the back, leaders like Vida/Ferdinand/Evra are gone so there should be someone to take over and express himself and that's what is Smalling currently doing. He had always big potential but you can't bench Ferdinand and Vidic while completely omitting Evans and start him every game, that's why he spend a lot of playing time as RB, he was slowly gaining that experienced and probably developed some skills which are useful now. He brings the ball forward really well. You can argue that it slowed him a bit down but he was always getting there. He picked so many injuries and more experienced players were ahead of him which is the cause he bloomed little bit later than one might expected, he's still has a great career ahead of him and thanks to his athleticism he can play on top level to his mid 30s.

Jones stagnated a lot but if he can overcome injuries and get back on track he will hopefully progress as well. He lacks a bit of brain as athletic type as Smalling but he still can reach the very top if he stays fit, he won't be as great distributor as Blind but much better and more aggressive defender forming potentially great understanding with Big Mike.

953~~~
thats not true. Majority of cafe always said Smalling was the better defender but Jones was more talented(able to do a lot of things except defend).

954~~~
I've never thought Jones was better than Smalling, I still think Smalling is the better defender, smarter & overall more polished. Not surprised by his recent performances as the only thing that has held him back was his constant injuries. He's a fantastic center back, hope he stays fit for the majority of this season, and continues his impressive performances.

955~~~
I'm usually very positive towards our young players. But I really can't see Jones will turn out to be more than ok-ish to good player for us. At least, not as a CB.

And agreed with others opinion on Smalling. I grew up watching Serie A 90's, and since he joined us, Smalling really reminds me some of those Italian CB hard bastards. Physically, he's got it all. And his man marking has always been very good.

956~~~
This is my take, and so far this season he has shown an increased desire to bring the ball out of defence when the situation arises - which I have no doubt is something LVG has instructed him to do.

But Smalling has always been an excellent defender. His time at RB and not getting consistent gametime didnt help his development (injuries also a factor) but when he first joined I remember games where he looked extremely confident not just defensively, but on the ball as well. He is now getting the consistent gametime he needed, and the confidence has come as a result.

957~~~
Thats what most said about Smalling a year ago. It's amazing (but not really) what regular football in their best position can do for a player.

958~~~
It has been a very welcome development, and something of a surprise for me too. It always felt like in the fabled Jones/Smalling combo, Jones would be the leader - the vocal one, putting himself about, screaming and making crazy faces. Smalling is starting to look very like a young Rio Ferdinand however in the way he is orchestrating the back four. As you said - that was not something you ever really associated with Evans, who I think is a similar case to Ben Foster as someone who simply didnt have the mentality to really be a starter for a club like United, despite being talented.

959~~~
He's been superb. Best defender in the league at the moment.

960~~~
Smalling's problem was command and presence. He was perfectly capable of his performances if he had Rio or Vidic to lead the way. Now he's got the look of a leader, someone who leads the back line and can work together with DDG (who has also grown into leading vs taking instruction). They've stepped up tremendously into the void left by the likes of Rio, Vidic, and Evra.

961~~~
The way he took both Blind and the Wolfsburg out was just beautiful. That is heart of a player that wants to win.

962~~~
He's taken Blind out a few times this season. Not only does he have to fend off a big CF in the air, then Smalling just comes in and takes them both out. Poor Daley <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

963~~~
It may have been said before but he has some attributes of Vidic and Rio combined. He seems to have the speed of Rio so he can recover when players put the ball behind him, but also seems to dominate in the air like Vidic. He has the presence now that you want from your cb. Ability wise he seems to have it all, but if anything he sometimes lacks concentration and possibly the reason why we conceded on Wednesday. For me the best in the league and he is still improving too.

964~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/how-good-is-chris-smalling.337985/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/how-good-is-chris-smalling.337985/</a>

After his first season - which was the last time he got regular game time as a CB before LVG. Those years in-between where he was wasted at RB really misguided some people on his ability. He's just picked up from where he left off.

965~~~
I think it helps that LVG has a clear system with an attention to detail. Smalling knows exactly what is expected of him.

His growth has also coincided with the return of Carrick from injury and the subsequent purchase of Blind, Schneiderlin, and Schweinstiger. 

Just like John Terry can look terrible without the proper midfield protection, I think Schneiderlin makes the central defender's job much easier for them.

Having more settled fullbacks has helped as well.

Has Smalling been great? Sure. But his personal improvement is due to the team understanding around him as well.

966~~~
Having Blind next to him has also helped; both of them seem to have developed a great understanding. Well done Van Gaal, I'm sure his attention to detail and positioning has greatly benefited Tall Mike.

967~~~
This always bemused me.

Why is it the default opinion that Jones was always better or has greater potential than Smalling?

I've never bought it, and I'm the least surprised that Smalling is performing the way he is, it's been clear to me for years that he had it in him.

968~~~
Well it is just my opinion. I always liked Jones and he can be really rock at the back at times. Plus he is for a defender quite good on the ball which is very important in our team.

969~~~
Has a rougher time with Smalling then any striker he's come up against this season

970~~~
I agree. Jones has never shown the same quality of Smalling, he's more of a gung ho defender and I think that style makes people think he's better than he actually is.

Smalling has actually shown dominance like this in periods before, he just usually ended up injured or shifted to fullback.

971~~~
No it's fair enough that's your opinion I just wanted to know why you felt that Jones was better?
I've personally never seen him display anything Smalling hasn't and I can't remember a game he's dominated for us for quite some time. The only one that stands out was when he played for Blackburn at home

Precisely, Smalling has shown his quality before plenty of times he'd just be injured afterwards, I'm trying to think of genes where Jones has done the same for us

972~~~
Jones is the new Duncan Ferguson and John Terry rolled up in one don't you know? Future United and England captain and all, the new English hope. He reminds people of old school English centerbacks so naturally he has the 'higher ceiling' by default.

973~~~
He is much better on the ball, better passer and is better in caring the ball from defense to attacking positions.
He is also quite good in defending, sometimes a little rash but if he can improve his positioning he can be at least just as good in defending as Smalling is.

974~~~
Yeah big fan of Jones as well. Let's hope he can get a consistent run of games under his belt. He's got the lot, apart from being too rash but that can be worked on with a run of games.

975~~~
best player we had

976~~~
Yep. Hard to believe we conceded three and I don't think our centre halves did much wrong.

977~~~
He did well considering the shit show going on either side of him.

978~~~
Hard to really say any defender had a great game when we conceded three, but Smalling didnt really do anything wrong on an individual level. Had it between him and Martial for MotM.

979~~~
Not really at fault today, the third goal you just have to applaud Sanchez there.

980~~~
Don't see why he was our best player. Don't remember him doing anything to stop the barrage.

981~~~
Terrific second half performance when he nullified their attacks almost single handedly. In the first half, it looked like the Arsenal did everything they could to avoid him.

982~~~
The match was over by the second half. In the first they played around him as much as they were everyone else. Didn't see him intervening .

983~~~
Hard to judge really, the rest of the team basically let Arsenal come charging at him and Blind in that first 20 minutes and there wasn't a great deal they could do and after that Arsenal weren't really interested in attacking and we kept possession without much effort.

984~~~
Neither did you, other than setting up every counter attack against us

985~~~
The over praising of Smalling annoys me when talking about him on here, he wasn’t great today, he wasn’t even good, he was as bad as the rest of them.

986~~~
Totally agree, I said before the season the club badly needed a top CH. I think Smalling is the best there is ATM but still doesn't totally convince me.
The jury is out on Jones and I don't think Rojo or Blind are the answer.

987~~~
Smalling has been very good for around 12 months, I'd struggle to name many better centre backs in the league in that time. He'd benefit from having a specialist centre back next to him enormously rather than Blind out of position. Today it was obvious Wenger targeted Blind and there was not much Smalling could do in that situation in fairness, the midfield cover from Carrick and Schweinsteiger was non existent at times. Swansea did it in a slightly different way but also had success with Gomis bullying him. I was surprised Benteke didn't exploit that weakness in the backline when we played Liverpool at home too.

Jones doesn't convince me. He has good moments but I always feel as though he's seconds away from some sort of disaster moment and he's not progressed in the way we'd have hoped- although he does have time to get it right still. Rojo was given a run of games in central defence both at the beginning of the season and after he came back from injury after the new year but he didn't seize the opportunity to cement his place in the same way Smalling did. He's similar to Jones in that he can also be quite erratic at times and whereas Smalling currently offers some level of consistency it seems as though with Jones and Rojo you can almost flip a coin as to whether they'll be very good or very poor. Unfortunately he seems to be another defender we've bought that's injury prone.

988~~~
It's one thing not wanting to praise him after a match like this, it's true he didn't single-handedly stop all of the opposition's attacks (for once). But if you're not convinced by Smalling's performances over the last 12 months, I'm not sure what would - he's been outstanding.

989~~~
Most of us know you don't rate Smalling. The basic praising annoyed you too last season when you kept bigging up your boy Evans. You also rate Jones higher than him. We know

990~~~
I don't rate Smalling, where have I said this? Also where was I bigging up Evans? But yes I do think Jones has a higher level of potential than him, so you got one out of three, well done.
Do you think Smalling played well today?

991~~~
Smalling definitely did well second half. Was our only competent defender. He was the one nullifying most of Arsenal's attacks.

992~~~
Probably our best player in the second half. Don't think he was at fault individually in the first half but he has to take responsibility as part of the collective.

993~~~
He is the defensive captain and I guess the 3rd choice captain. He has to take responsibility for defensive failures.

994~~~
For sure. I agree with that.

995~~~
in the fisrt half he was all over the place, trying to cover for absentees in the deference.

996~~~
Broadly speaking I thought he done ok yesterday. That said, I'm disappointed he didn't get over and help darmian. It was clear he was having a tough time and I would have expected Smalling to get over and, for lack of a better phrase, roughed Sanchez up given half a chance just to give darmian a bit of time to get his head back in the game.

997~~~
How many of his defenders is he meant to help/cover? He's spent the entire season covering for Blind in the middle and Darmian was playing well enough to cover Smalling. That right side combination has been one of the most functional parts of our team. Nobody was expecting Darmian to collapse like that.

It was basically a repeat of the Everton away game last season except Arsenal are a far better and more clinical team.

998~~~
Didn't do too much wrong but wasn't great either. Maybe could have been a bit vocal and calmed the rest of the team down, after the way Arse started and conceding the first goal we should have parked the bus and waited for things to calm down, conceding the second goal so quickly was fatal. We needed someone to stand up and tell the team to calm the feck down esp the midfield, I think this is the part he needs to improve on esp if he is going to be our long term captain. Rio & Vidic were great at this.

999~~~
I thought he was very good. In his attitude as much as anything. He really stood up when the rest of the team was crumbling apart.

The "he has to take responsibility for the rest of his defence" argument is ridiculous. He didn't sign Darmian, or decide to pair himself in central defence with a midfielder who's rash and can't cope with pace or strength. Pretty sure he doesn't sneak sleeping pills into Carrick's pre match meal either.

Van Gaal takes responsibility for picking inadequate players, not Smalling...and yesterday Smalling had three inadquate defensive partners and an inadequate defensive midfielder to contend with...against some world class attacking players.

1000~~~
Another aimless long ball from Smalling was the basis of losing possession for the second goal, if he really is the best defender in the league then he should know that just after conceding the important thing is not to give away possession again cheaply.

Also, for the second goal if Blind is on Walcott then who is Smalling meant to be marking? Considering he's the closest player to him before he scores I would say Ozil.

1001~~~
Don't disagree with any of that but it was the right hand side where the danger was in the first 10 mins. All I'm saying is in times gone by, we've had players who have helped out in that manner. Smalling has been a revelation this season and wasn't at fault yesterday, I just would like to have seen him help darmian a bit more.

1002~~~
Bollocks.

1003~~~
It was an exaggeration but not entirely wrong - there have been numerous times this season when Smalling has had to cover for Blind (and others), noticeably so.

1004~~~
Likewise others have had to cover for Smalling. It's what teams do.

1005~~~
Im not claiming that Smalling is perfect by any means, however for me at least it has been noticeable that he has often been the one to have to bail out other defenders after they have made errors. I am sure there are some, but I do not recall any instances of Smalling making an error that Blind (or someone else) had to rectify, this season.

1006~~~
I'm all for giving Smalling credit for an excellent season but I'm not having it that he's been playing Weekend at Bernies all season and carrying some deadweight alongside him.

1007~~~
He somewhat reminds me of Rio in the years before Vidic came along. Had a few gaffes (Yakubu at Riverside anyone?) but more often than not he was the one marshalling the back line with Silvestre and Heinze in the mix.

1008~~~
He is in the form of his life, he has been by far our best defender this season but there seems to be a necessity on here to criticise others to further praise Smalling.
Up until the Arsenal game Blind was having a superb season, no one in our back line covered themselves in glory on Saturday, but yet again the age old posts of Smalling is covering for everybody else and can do no wrong posts are popping up again.

1009~~~
Eh? Almost every single time there's an aerial ball to contested on Blind's side of defence, Smalling has been dragged out of position to win it for him. It worked at the start when Darmian plugged the whole left on Smalling's side, but it was never really going to sustainable long term. It happens multiple times every single game.

1010~~~
Its fair enough that Blind has been exceeding expectations at CB for most people, but the trend in virtually every game we have played has been for opponents to look to target Blind as a weak link, as he isnt particularly fast and isnt particularly good in the air either. He has done well but there have still been question marks about him being a CB for us in the long term.

1011~~~
Another incredible performance today so far. Not giving Lukaku an inch.

1012~~~
It's ridiculous how good he is becoming. In a football world which is short of world class centre backs, there aren't too many you'd take ahead of him right now. Complete defender.

1013~~~
One-man defense. He's literally everywhere. Every time there's a dangerous attack and we stop it, it's him.

1014~~~
Is this his best performance of the season so far? Keep playing like this and it'll judge edge out the Spurs match for me.

1015~~~
There's really not a lot you can do as a striker if you're up against someone bigger, stronger, quicker and more intelligent than you. Monster.

1016~~~
use that second center back as extra striker, we don't need two, Smalling's enough, best center back in the league by far..

1017~~~

1021~~~
There's good, bloody good, and then there's Chris Smalling.

1022~~~
He's simply brilliant.

1023~~~
Looking at the replays he definitely didn't mean the assist <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1024~~~
Best in the world atm

1025~~~
Him and Jones are great together, don't know why it was broken up. Never lost a game when they've been the CB partnership have we?

1026~~~
Ridiculous defender.

1027~~~
They've probably played about two games together at CB.

1028~~~
Played quite a few last season. Including that run of Spurs home, Liverpool away, City home.

1029~~~
Was a joke but yeah, I'd like to see them two there consistently.

1030~~~
Monstrous display thus far.

1031~~~
What I like the most about him now is that he's never afraid to take charge of situations, he's taken on the role as a leader at the back after Rio and Vidic left.

1032~~~
Beast mode. Engaged.

1033~~~
<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/> What a player. Always love it when our CBs bully an opposing striker, especially one like Lukaku, who was being an absolute bitch today.

1034~~~
He literally looks unbeatable at the moment.

1035~~~
I love the lad to bits

1036~~~
I've been pro smalling for time now, always knew he had this in him and just needed to stay fit. Long may it continue <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

1037~~~

1038~~~
An absolute colossus. Positionally, aerially, in the tackle and now he can get it down and play a bit too. Beginning to feel safe with him at the back.

1039~~~
Absolutely brilliant so far this season.

1040~~~
I'm obsessed with him, I'd marry him if I could <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1041~~~
My MOTM, dealt with Lukaku superbly.

1042~~~
Way too important for us to rest, has to start against Moscow.

1043~~~
As I said, he' our Rio, Pallister, Bruce and Stam all rolled into one at the moment....just needs a partner of the same stature....

1044~~~
Always had faith in him - he was excellent in 2011/12, and that talent didn't just disappear - an it's great that he's now cemented his place as a first choice centre back.

1045~~~
He is becoming a dominant CB ala Vidic.

Was superb today.

1046~~~
Top class performance

1047~~~
What can I say that hasn't already been said? Just truly amazing. 

Think playing against Lukaku, and maybe Benteke, who he's already pocketed, won't get much harder than that, in terms of physical battles, and he certainly passed the test.

1048~~~
Didn't play against Lithuania. Has had a full week off. Cheers Roy.

1049~~~
Superb again.  My MotM.  Handled Lukaku brilliantly.  Is he now the best center back in the league?  Certainly in with a shout.

1050~~~
I think it's quite clear he's the best CB in the league. It's brilliant to see him fulfill his potential. I really hope Jones can stay fit and follow in his footsteps.

1051~~~
Deals with every situation so intelligently, and has the pace and strength to back it up. World class atm.

1052~~~
He's a beast. His talent was never in doubt though.

1053~~~
He was once trashed on these boards and has developed into our best center back.

1054~~~
Amazing again from Smalling, dominated Lukaku all game.

1055~~~
MOTM candidate in 95% of our games. You can't name 5 CB's currently better than him in the top 5 leagues.

1056~~~
He has it all doesn't he? Hes just been majestic all season (bar Arse) and just keeps on delivering MOTM performances week in and week out.

The bast part is, he is only 25. As defenders go, that's a tender age for such a player. Imagine how hes going to be in two or three years if he keeps improving <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1058~~~
Still 25 too.

1059~~~
Just wanted to highlight his nice little pass to Martial in this GIF.

1060~~~
In a match where we had some very good performers he was my man of the match.  His level of play over the last 12 months has been phenomenal.

1061~~~
He is everything I wanted us to buy in the summer! Really stepped up this season, long may it continue.

1062~~~
Just make him captain already. Another good game. Clearly leading the defense, and he'd be a much better representative for our club than Rooney. (Obviously I don't expect this to happen...)

1063~~~
As long as he remains injury free, we could have a top CB for 5-7 more years.

1064~~~
I honestly thought whenever Lukaku got him pinned he had him worried and Jones dealt with Lukaku better. Just a shame Lukaku was feeding of absolute scraps because everyone else was shite.

1065~~~
Monster of a performance. Just colossal.

1066~~~
Iron Mike <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1067~~~
A question for the English fans, does Roy play Smalling as CB for the national team? I have no idea whether he is actually first choice (which he should be).

1068~~~
He's the best CB in the league, no question. Beast.

1069~~~
Another Smalling-esque performance. Any defender who has a solid game we should start commenting, "He did a Smalling there!". Has really grown leaps and bound in his performance and confidence under LVG. I had my doubts after his red card against CIty last season and really thought he might not cut it under LVG regime but I am glad he has proved me and many wrong

1070~~~
As many have said. Best in the league.

1071~~~
He's not even having just 'good' games anymore, he's completely smashing it. I honestly had forgotten how it felt to have a dominant presence in defense since Vidic.

1072~~~
His form this season has been world class and he has built on last years form in a big manner.

1073~~~
our player of the year so far.....

cool, strong and becoming a leader

1074~~~
He must have pockets like Mary Poppins bag to fit so many strikers in there.

1075~~~
Impressive so far. I said it 3 years ago that he's hugely talented and never doubted his quality

1076~~~
What is impressive is that Lukaku is having a good season and had been bullying defenders. Made him a small boy yesterday.

1077~~~
Footballs crazy, start of the season most on here would have had him sold. Always amazes me how little including myself how much we don't know about football....

1078~~~
He's the best CB in the league, I'm quite confident about that. Who else comes close on current form? Not Company, that's for sure. Cahill? Nah. Koscielny? Don't think so.

1079~~~
Been our best defender since late last year. I don't think anybody here wanted him sold this summer. Last year would have been more apt.

1080~~~
Good! Long may it continue.

1081~~~
I remember it differently. Still lots of talk in summer about needing 2 centre halfs on here and in media.

1082~~~
Man of the year our Smalling

1083~~~
Strong.

1084~~~
If he can stay fit all season, I think he'll be recognised as one of the top three CB's in the league. Right now, I'd have nobody else in the league.

1085~~~
There was literally no talk about replacing Smalling, it was all about finding him a suitable,long term partner.

1086~~~
I think that was more to do with concerns over his injury record, rather than his ability when fit.

1087~~~
Absolute monster, if we afford the same patience to Jones who is similarly talented just a bit less ...shall we say "refined" then we are sorted.

1088~~~
Every fan from other teams thinks Smalling has only been good this season, completely forgetting that ever since the Man city game, he has been one of the best centre backs in the league, maybe even the world.

1089~~~
Superb, keep it up Mike.

1090~~~
He and Cahill have pretty much solidified themselves as the first choice partnership now. Jagielka, Stones and Jones will be competing for the remaining 2 CB slots in the squad for the Euro's next year.

1091~~~
An absolute revelation since he changed his name. Mike > Chris.  Best centre half in the leadgue for me rght now. Bosses his way through games. I think him and Jones (if he stays fit) can give is a Bruce/Pallister  Ferdinand/Vidic pairing. They are still both relatively young and definitely have the talent.

1092~~~

He's our lowest rated CB on fifa <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Tbh I thought he was doing very well last season as well, and before that was mostly affected by injuries. But under LVG he's thriving. Long may it continue.

1094~~~
I have been his fanboy for years and been laughed at by my mates..  This is just so great to see him boss players week in week out.  Our best player this season always one of our top three players every game.

1095~~~
And under Moyes, he did very well. Which tends to get overlooked IMO. Definitely one of our best players in that horrible season, and it can easily be argued that he was our best CB that season despite not playing consistently in his best position. Obviously he's on a completely different level now where even his composure on the ball has significantly improved and he's being mentioned as one of the best CBs in the PL (definitely up there with Koscielny), but I think some people downplay his performances pre-Van Gaal a bit too much.

1096~~~
I don't think there was a single United fan watching the game who was at any point concerned when Lukaku went up against Smalling. Pretty much everyone knew he was going to win the contest easily.

1097~~~
That is why you shouldn't judge players based on fifa rating...

edit: many people do this unfortunately.

1098~~~
Of course they do, especially non United fans and the media.

This narrative that Smalling has been rubbish up until now, and this season has suddenly been a revelation, is just such utter nonsense. Its clear he's had all the tools to be a great defender from the first game he played for us. He's just been held back by injuries, being played at right back and Rio/Vidic.  

LVG has made a massive contribution to his play on the ball, no doubt about it, but his defensive game has always been there. He just needed to put it all together consistently.

1099~~~
I remember being laughed at last year when I said to a colleague, who is a United fan, that Smalling was our best defender and, actually, wasn't total shite.

Then again the same guy told me that he thought De Gea was 'dodgy' at the start of last season.

1100~~~
His passing is class IMO for the player he physically is.   In all honesty,  i dont think this league can host ball playing defenders all that easily & smalling has the ability to find the right pass out of trouble atleast.

1101~~~
I'm struggling to think of any defender who has been as good or efffective as him over the past 9-12 months.

1102~~~
He is turning into a great united defender, a trusted leader at the back. I said before the season started that I had lots of faith in Smalling.

1103~~~
I wonder if LvG was trying to buy Hummels to replace Smalling, it's not that LvG can't see he is a good defender, but he just rates ball playing defenders very high and defending becomes the second most important thing or so it seems at times.

He has been our best defender the last 3 seasons imo, right now i wouldn't have anyone over him and that isn't overrating, he sweeps up everything that comes at him.
I'm not sure he will ever be a CB who can ping accurate long balls consistently, but with the right partner that shouldn't be a problem, although sometimes it does hinder your team in a possession style of football if your CB can't make those passes.

1104~~~
He's added a lot more aggression to his game in the last year/18 months. He reads the game well and snuffs out danger early, a bit like Rio in that respect.

Quite underrated by non-United fans it seems, not that I could give a shite.

1105~~~
Thanks for that.

1106~~~
What do your friends say now? I have a Smalling shirt and im proud of it

1107~~~
I always rated Jones ahead of Smalling, especially in terms of talent, but Smalling puts in the kind of performances only a true world class player can do consistently. He's not just been doing few mistakes and kept it simple, he has dominated the game and that isn't easy to do as a centre back. If he continues on this form, which I wouldn't count on, then I think he's good enough to be labeled world class.

1108~~~
You basically couldn't ask for more of a beast physically at the back. Thankfully he's finally gotten past the injuries like we all said he needed to do. Honestly think Jones can make a similar improvement once he stays fit, as he's also an excellent defender at his best and is only 23. That's a big reason why I think Van Gaal hasn't been too keen on buying a center back. He knows we have a top class one in Smalling, and a potentially world class one in Jones, and both are still a few years from their prime probably. 

Ever since that red card a year ago, Smalling has cut out all the things that usually hold back young defenders, like the lapses in concentration, silly mistakes, and injuries, and over the past year, he's been as good as any center back around really. Not just the premier league. Definitely the best in the league overall though. This season he's finally started to get the recognition he deserves and he's been thriving since the start. You can see how confident he is in every game, basically dominating every player and bullying opposition players. He looks a lot more confident on the ball as well these days, and it'll only get better. Hopefully Jones stays fit and can form a partnership alongside him, because if so, then those 2, with Shaw at left back, should be 3 of the back 4 for England for a long time. Maybe Stones rotating in there as he has huge potential as well.

1109~~~
In general (unlike Jones) he hasn't shown any big defensive weaknesses, even when playing RB. He was good backup to Rio and Vidic, maybe he didn't stand out like Jones and Evans did at some points, but he's always been at least a good defender. Since the City red card though, he's gone up a level.

1110~~~
The last part isn't even hyperbole<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1111~~~
He was made one of the captains. It's clear that LvG rates him very highly and wouldn't replace him. He has even played every game this season.

1112~~~
Yeah I think Hummels and Ramos were both targeted for the right side of central defence. Think his belief is if you have the ball, the opposition can't score.

Smalling has sort of made himself undroppable though. What with Jones playing ahead of Blind as well it looks like he may be stopping this left footer with a right footer at the back.

1113~~~
The thing with Jones for me is, he's always just one unfortunate tackle away from getting injured. I've always liked him though. Just hope he could stay fit and less injury prone.

1114~~~
Bang on.

1115~~~
I've grown tired of trying to convince people that there was no 'post-City turning point' at all, but given that even many of our own fans seem to think so, then I doubt there is hope. The media never got it with him, but I have maintained that he is our best centre-half for a few years, even in the latter years of our legendary pair.

From his very first season he has been outstanding at centre-half, pretty much every single time he's played there. He's had big games against big teams, and apart from Benteke once where he pushed him over to set up a goal, I've never seen a centre-forward get the better of him in a game. He's unbeatable on the deck and in the air, and has been since he was proving it against Drogba in a Fulham shirt. People are just getting it because the media are absolute idiots, and also because United have been shite for most of his time in the first team here, which means all of our players except the ones who have performed at 'big international tournaments' are not good enough either.

1116~~~
Well it´s very difficult to have anything bad to say on Smalling these days. So they never talk about him, in other words they just shut the feck up!

1117~~~
I think that Duncan Edwards tag given to Jones put the idea that he would have some sort of meteoric rise, and because of the comparisons made - a lot of fans at United at rival clubs automatically assumed Jones to be better than Smalling straight away - that's just my theory.

I can't speak for everyone, but I've rated Smalling over Jones since the first season they had together, Jones has always had more raw potential, but Smalling is a different kind of defender, in the same way i've always preferred Rio to Vidic - he has certain attributes that are natural and you can't teach.

1118~~~
I don't even understand this tbh and its said a lot. I always thought Smalling looked more polished than Jones in defence, and that Jones was just more of an old fashioned English CB who threw himself at everything. Why exactly does Jones have more 'raw' potential (then and/or now?)

1119~~~
His man-marking jobs on Fellaini and Ronaldo, while playing in midfield, were pretty clear evidence that he's more than just an old fashioned English CB. As is the fact he played in midfield under every manager he's played under at club and international level.

1120~~~
O'shea did a job for us in midfield as well, even more than Jones. Midfield is not Jones' natural and best position and not one you expect to seem him play in anytime soon so what does it add to the argument that he has more potential than Smalling?

1121~~~
Smalling is clearly better right now but Jones' potential and talent is seriously underplayed on the caf in the midst of all the "OMG He's sooooooo reckless lol" type of posts.

Midfield is not his best position, no, but unlike many others I never thought he looked out of place when he played there. Seemed to me Fergie agreed as well give he even played Jones as an AM as well at one point.

Jones has it in him to become a seriously impressive defender. Just a question of getting it all together and staying fit for a length of time.

1122~~~
Ok, so what marks Jones out as the bigger talent? Smalling is faster,stronger, better in the air and better one on one and also reads the game better.

1123~~~
You e said it in the second sentence and I agree, Smalling has always looked more polished than Jones, maybe his style of defending in comparison to Jones.
Jones has always come across as having mkre rough edges that needed to be smoothed out.
Like I said to me, Smalling has more  attributes that can't be taught easily - reading of the game, calm in a tricky situation etc, which would mean his potential isn't as raw as Jones

1124~~~
It seems almost unfair to put him against Smalling. I can't really think of a defender in world football that matches Smalling in any of the first four areas you just mentioned. His physical attributes are insane.

That said Jones is a very quick and strong player in his own right. He's a bloody talented defender too. It just seems to me that a mixture of injuries and internet memes have turned him into a punchline at the moment. I think unfairly. He was playing very well at the start of last season before injuries took over and he finished the season well. The potential is definitely there.

1125~~~
I wasn't arguing anything of the sort. I was just refuting the suggestion he was just your typical English centre back. O'Shea playing there under Sir Alex means little given Rafael also played there among many other very strange choices. Jones on the other hand was picked to play there in a variety of roles by every manager.

Capello even compared him to Baresi in part because of his ability to play in either role and because of his reading of the game. I suppose he was just misled by Jones' last ditch tackles like all the other Neanderthal-esque British football fans.

1126~~~
Agree with everything you've said here.

1127~~~
I think this might be true currently, but I think Jones has the potential to be even better in this regard. I am a huge Smalling fan but early last season Jones was leading the league in interceptions I think. Sometimes he misreads situations and gets himself out of position but he is still a bit younger than Smalling, in time I think he will be better in this attribute.

1128~~~
Statistically the best defender in the league last year. Highest interceptions and tackles of all the defenders with Clichy and Zabaleta I believe but I just had a quick look right now.

This year Smalling has more successful tackles than Jones and Jones has more successful interceptions while Jones statistics are a bit off I think due to how they count sub games as full games. He's made 10 tackles/interceptions in 124 minutes(The available stats) which would in reality be 7.29 tackles/interceptions per game then if I didn't get it wrong.
Obviously nearly useless to reach for straws when he's only played so few games this season, but he's continued on the track of last season at least.

Smalling has played full matches so unless they are wrong there too for some other reason he is averaging 4.6 tackles/Interceptions per 90 minutes.

Which of course doesn't at all mean Smalling is better or worse, personally I really like them both and I am just happy we have them at the club.

1129~~~
Lukaku did not know what hit him...Dayum!! The best part about his game is that he dominates strikers but is not aggressive or arrogant about it. Does not get wind up and just kills the confidence of the opposition through his game and not his aura. Although I would like to see some mean streak in his eyes the way Vida had.

1130~~~
Smalling is better than Jones in every aspect of the game and always has been. I agree with you

1131~~~
Jones doesnt come close to Smalling imo, he'll remain the 'talent' for a few years remaining. But defensively Smalling is better in everything with a decent distance.

1132~~~
You'd have to convince me too. I remember that I had grown pessimistic about Smalling by the time the City game came, and in fact lost all hope when he stupidly got the red card. In fact it was true for many others here. Smalling had seemed to regress a bit during the Moyes season (tbf, everyone did) and till the City match. This was very similar to Evans except that Smalling had the mental strength to learn/grow out of his slump whereas Evans didn't (obviously having more natural talent helps too!).

I don't disagree with your second paragraph as I have always believed in his natural talent. But he hadn't applied it consistently and excellently, even when he played CB. For example, he showed he had great strength but never was consistently dominant against strikers, he showed he could tackle but was never so impregnable as now. Most importantly, he had lost all confidence while being on the ball, which was then a big problem as teams were pressing our CBs into submission all the time. Like somebody said, its only after the City game last season that everything came together for him - including staying away from injuries.

1133~~~
He was excellent just the week before  (the City game) against Chelsea.

He was excellent in the Allianz the season before in our biggest game, and has generally always been unbeatable in my view.

1134~~~
You might be right, but if there's anything that Smalling's success has taught us, it is that we need to be patient with young, talented players. Jones is both young and talented, and if he can stay healthy, he may well follow in Smalling's path. Then we'd be sorted for the next 5-7 years at CB.

1135~~~

1136~~~
If he knew how to organise a defence like Vidic or Kompany he'd be world class, his individual defending is as good as anyones now.

1137~~~
There's a quick easy way to answer who's better. Who would we miss more, Smalling or Jones?. 

Smalling by a landslide. I do like Jones and think him and Smalling could make a great partnership for years to come, but Smalling just has everything now. He has really matured and his concentration/positioning has come on leaps and bounds. I feel he now believes he is the "leader" of the defence, the added importance has taken him a step beyond.

1138~~~
He is already quite good at organising the defense. In fact LVG alluded to his defensive leadership while making him the 3rd captain and Neville also pointed this out in his fantastic analysis of last season's win against City. Plus playing with Blind can't harm his organisational/intelligence skills! 

Obviously Smalling is a better player <i>currently</i> than Jones. The question is about potential, and who might end up being a better player. Jones being younger than Smalling could surpass him as CBs can mature and develop rapidly even till 25-26 (as Smalling attests to). Imagine how good our defense would be, if that happens.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1139~~~
Agreed. I've maintained a similar stance on this for years now.

1140~~~
Honestly think smalling has the bigger potential anyway, he's taller, stronger, quicker, arguably tackles just as well and is very good 1 v 1. Jones won't be far off and I think they will both be amazing, but his ability to injure himself in nearly every game will hamper him a bit. He needs to learn when to stay in position and when to try and intercept, but apart from that he doesn't have many weakness. He will improve that wreckless nature with experience.

1141~~~
Are there any CBs stronger in a one on one with an attacker? I've said it for a few seasons now but I genuinely think he's the best at this now. I never worry when a pacey or tricky forward (if he ever gets the chance to) isolates him. He's always in control of the situation. I remember the GIFs from last year - Willian, Sterling etc...

1142~~~
Now, if only good old Phil could have a similar turn around.

1143~~~
I think because he's so quick he can basically shepherd them to an area he wants and say "go on go passed me". Many cannot though.

1144~~~
He might be "quite good" at organising defences, but that isn't the level you aspire to at a club that wants to win the league or CL. You only have to look at the impact Kompany has on City when he's fit or what Terry did to Chelsea last year despite being way past his best. A few confidence boosting quotes from LvG and one of Neville's analysis (anyone remember his "silent destroyer" nonsense on Rooney?) doesn't change the evidence we see on the pitch every day. 

We should be looking for an organiser next to Smalling if we want to take our defence to the next level.

1145~~~
What evidence are you talking about, and how do you judge ability of his organisation skills, which are very subjective? Our defense has looked quite organised this season (barring Arsenal - which was a more midfield issue IMO, and anyway a one-off game). We have let in 1 more goal than the lowest goals conceded in the league this season till now. And I wouldn't comment on our inability to judge somebody's impact on defense when missing games, so as to not jinx it!

1146~~~
Our continued defensive fragility when we're actually forced to defend. We keep clean sheets by keeping the ball, when we're actually defending we rely lots on Smalling and De Gea's individual brilliance. Our defenders are guilty of doing their own thing in a similar way that City do when Kompany is out, it was particularly evident against PSV and Arsenal but it's true other times. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/pF0w9Xj.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/pF0w9Xj.png"/>

This kind of shows what I mean on the defensive front, we defend by keeping the ball because we're not great when we don't have it. That's clearly not because Smalling is a bad defender, it's because we're bad as a defensive unit.

1147~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
The chart shows absolutely nothing of what you are saying. Shots against us are low because we are effective in defense and in any case we are so close to your ideal City.

I disagree at so many levels from your point of view, so I would just list them out:

1. I don't think we rely on individual brilliance of Smalling and De Gea. Blind, Shaw, Darmian and the holding midfielder have been very good, though not as good as Smalling obviously. 

2. We aren't fragile when not in possession. I think you are going by the Arsenal game a bit too much. 

3. Our possession game itself lends us to be a bit more vulnerable to counter attacks, due to the high line and playing our from the back. But that's a trade off we have chosen and the evidence is that its working.

1148~~~
Is this meant to be a negative?

We face less shots per match, therefore we concede less goals per match seems like common sense to me, and a good foundation to build on. And we're in the same company as the league leaders - who many are calling the strong favourites to win the title.

This chart doesn't necessarily mean we only defend by keeping the ball - because as someone mentioned earlier in the thread our CB's have a high number of both interceptions & tackles - which backs up what this chart shows that we don't face many shots, because a lot of the time the opposition doesn't get a chance to shoot. And if they do, then we've got a World Class GK in DDG for them to face.

I wouldn't call that fragile, considering at the start of this season we conceded the fewest amount of goals by any team in the league since November last year, and it took a few games to concede at all in the league - we're not fragile by any means.
We're difficult to break down, and even harder to dominate.

1149~~~
No, it's called playing to your strengths.

1150~~~
Vidic had far more to work with. Edwin, Rio and Evra were organisers themselves.

Smalling's by far the most senior defender at the club as a 25 year old. He's got a long time to develop the kind of organisation skills that Rio and Vidic displayed in there late 20s and early 30s.

The evidence so far is extremely encouraging. Every single one of our defenders have looked far more comfortable playing next to him than anyone else - including the likes of McNair and Blackett.

1151~~~
You misunderstand me. 

I don't see how the chart shows anything negative, and I definitely don't see how it shows that we're defensively fragile.

1152~~~
City aren't an ideal, Kompany hasn't started since the middle of last month. 

1. Individual excellent performances don't disprove the issue. How many times was Shaw MotM in a game we lost?

2. We are, we consistently dominate possession and we concede goals at a proportionally higher rate relative to the amount of defending we have to do. The Arsenal game wasn't the clearest example, it was just a very obvious combination of a tactical failure and our actual issues. Southampton, PSV and Swansea were the ideal examples where our defensive organisation let us down when it was exposed. 

3. Arsenal play in a similar (if not more so) high style and yet cope far better. This is because as a defensive unit they're more cohesive.

1153~~~
It shows that we're in the bottom half of teams when it comes to conceding goals when we allow teams to get a shot off, consider that we have by far the best goalkeeper in the league as well and you see that when our defence breaks down it's usually fatal. It's good management that we use our ability to retain the ball to limit teams opportunities to actually attack us however, which is why our defensive record overall is good but with notable blips.

1154~~~
This part is normal and the chart that you provided shows that most teams on the right of the charts are also on the bottom half, Crystal Palace are real freaks.

1155~~~
I disagree with what this chart is saying tbh, or actually what you seem to be extrapolating from it.
So we don't face many shots per match, but of the shots we face we conceed quite often, fine.
That doesn't mean we are poor as a defensive unit though, that is a very big leap in terms of an assumption made.

As a defensive unit, I think we are actually one of the better teams, (we do go to shit from time to time) but off the ball we are generally well organised.

What you need to see is the quality of chances we conceed and how often we conceed them, vs how often we don't have posession of the ball. For instance I believe vs Everton we had less posession than they did? Or it was pretty much even or something (I may be wrong here)

1156~~~
Vidic did this when paired with Evans and others, as did Ferdinand. We happened to have 3 natural leaders at the back at the time, doesn't especially detract from the point when there are far more obvious examples (Terry last year) of individually inferior players having the same effect.

Hopefully, would have if he had a consistent partner, that's for sure. But as for him making others better, how many times has a central defender played alongside anyone who wasn't Smalling this season? It's difficult to make comparisons.[/QUOTE][/QUOTE]

1157~~~
It's not normal for a team at the top of the league. Ideally you want to be in the top left of the graph, it's no surprise that those on the right are in the bottom half. Only City pre-Kompany were actually there though, which is unsurprising given the Premier League so far this season has been defensively a relative shambles.

1158~~~
Haha, love that.

1159~~~
We had marginally more possession, but the Everton game was a notable shift in our tactics. We switched to having Jones at the back and playing in a more conservative shape, in recognition to the fact that our "keep-ball" tactics failed against Arsenal and have been ineffective against Everton and other teams who move the ball forward quickly before.

1160~~~
<a class="username" data-user="50019, @Dion" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/50019/">@Dion</a> there is something interesting about your charts, at the exception of Chelsea and Norwich all the team on the right half are also on the bottom half of the possession ratio stats, Crystal Palace are two freak teams, Chelsea are clearly dreadful defensively, but Crystal Palace are interesting because they concede a lot of opportunities, can't keep the ball( or really don't want to) but don't concede often, they either played against weak teams or the goalkeeper is exceptional.

1161~~~
And what if you are just preventing teams from even taking shots, that why I find the chart a bit odd. It assumes that many shots that do not lead to goals shows defensive organisation and competence, when actually it could mean something completely different like having an incredible keeper or teams just taking pot shots from outside the box often.

If we have a game where the keeper has nothing to do, this chart penalises such a team. Its a bit silly IMO

1162~~~
Exactly, when you concede 17 shots per games you are not competent and if your opponents can't score they are themselves incompetent.

1163~~~
Keep ball didn't fail vs Arsenal since vs Arsenal we didn't keep the ball. We were just a shower of shite in that game with no organisation defensively or in the midfield, which actually was a bit of a red hearing when you look at our season.
Usually Shaw, Darmian, Smalling and Blind make a very high number of interceptions and tackles in games, especially in our first few. It wasn't just the keeping of posession which won us games, which is why in those games most of our MOTM went to defenders.

1164~~~
That's kind of the point...

1165~~~
I'm aware of that, my point was that 1. The arsenal game was a red hearing. 2 There were other things in our game wrong like the lack of coordination in pressing etc. Again vs Arsenal I believe we won the posession.

The point really is that how can a team be competent defensively be shown by conceeding more shots and the keeper having to work more often. Surely it should be the other way round.

If you want a chart to prove your theory regarding posession, then you should be looking at minutes without the ball, vs chances conceeded.

EDIT: We may find with the correct chart your point is proved right (I doubt it) but that chart you posted does nothing to support your arguement IMO

1166~~~
No, it punishes teams whose keepers don't keep out shots. When ours is De Gea you see the problem is elsewhere as he's hardly one to throw them into the net. 

Actually if you're conceding 17 shots per game and conceding the same number of goals as a team that only concedes 9, it shows that you're better at restricting the areas that opposition teams can play in and limiting their ability to move the ball into dangerous areas. We fail to do when our primary tactic of keeping the ball breaks down because we have good individual defenders but a relatively poor unit.

1167~~~
Or it could show that the other teams were just incompetent in finishing chances... Basically you are making far too many assumptions. There is a chart that could prove your point though, that one you posted just isn't the correct one

1168~~~
We won possession because Arsenal went 3-0 up and then played on the counter. And as I said, the Arsenal game isn't a great example because we came up against much better players. Better examples are the games I listed.

It's not a graph of shots on target, it's a graph of shots. Keepers who face 18 shots don't have to be particularly busy.

Except that doesn't actually make a difference because you're all playing the same teams over the course of a season and the only constant in those games is yourself.

1169~~~
I know that, but it doesn't make any distinction, which means it making assupmtions and jumping to conclusions. Which means it doesn't actually show what you are saying it shows, since there could be another plausable explanation.

1170~~~
But we haven't played the same teams yet, at the exception of Tottenham.

1171~~~
And we know how that went down.... 0 conceeded vs ...

1172~~~
We've played 9 essentially random teams from a pool of 19 selected teams, that trail of argument is a stretch.

1173~~~
We played five teams from the top 10, they played 3 and we conceded less goals. It's not random random, the teams aren't equal. This chart will be interesting at the end of the season, he will still be useless by himself but still interesting.

1174~~~
Consider the majority of the goals we've conceded.

A 10 minute blitz by Swansea, a 30minute domination by Arsenal, a wonder goal by Benteke in a game which we otherwise dominated, Pelle's first goal which came off a save by DDG that happened to land in front of him.

Arsenal game aside - the goals we've conceded were hardly because of a weak defence. 
We switched off against Swansea & Liverpool in matches we otherwise dominated. 
And Pelle's goal could have went anywhere after it came off DDG.

I'd argue that the Arsenal game skews your point, because without those three goals we haven't been the inferior team in any game, or lucky to win. Our defence has been great, not because of last ditch tackles or amazing saves - but because the opposition rarely gets a clear goal scoring opportunity.
DDG has had hardly anything to do this season in comparison to last, and I think he could've done better on a few of the goals we've conceded.

1175~~~
And for every goal a team concedes there are 3 others where they don't for similar reasons. De Gea doesn't have much to do and yet when he does it's far more dangerous.

1176~~~
Our defensive structure is excellent, from front to back, ingrained from the work carried on the training field. I think that's been fairly obvious since the turn of the year. 

Leadership at the heart of defence is a peculiar thing to judge from a terrace, moreso from the comfort of an armchair.

From an organisational front we're in the best defensive shape we've been in since we won the double in '08.

1177~~~
<a class="username" data-user="50019, @Dion" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/50019/">@Dion</a>

While your arguments are contrarian and interesting, the data still doesn't support them. Your point basically comes down to saying that United are too fragile defensively and concede too many goals, <i>given the little amount of ball the opposition sees </i>(and therefore our defensive performance is down to possession, which in itself isn't a bad thing though). But here is a comparison of the top three teams in the league:

1. Manchester City --- Average Possession: 56.7% --- Goals conceded: 8.
2. Arsenal --- Average Possession: 57.3% --- Goals conceded: 7.
3. Manchester United --- Average Possession: 57.0% --- Goals conceded: 8.

They are absolutely similar in terms of possession and goals conceded. So your criticism of United should be valid even for Arsenal. The only team you could really look, statistically, at is Tottenham who have conceded 8 goals despite only having average possession of 52.7%.

1178~~~
I've already said I consider Arsenal and City without Kompany poor this year. Those stats simply reinforce the principle. In fact the defensive standard all round has been pretty average, City were looking exceptional until Kompany was out and then it all went to shit

1179~~~
There are far too many variables for that graph to used as any kind of evidence.

1180~~~
This just proves how some stats in football just do not work. It isn't that clear cut.

1181~~~
Not his best tonight, solid enough on his less favoured side of the CB partnership but his passing wasn't as good as it's been recently.

1182~~~
Why has he been shifted to LCB now Jones is back? Not a huge thing but I think he's always looked more comfortable on the other side.

1183~~~

Do it now, we're all ready.

Would love to see him as our captain. Just feels right <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Another article on Smalling. Not sure I agree with the praise over the Arsenal match, definitely don't think that has been his best performance this season.

I'm a little disappointed Aguero isn't playing this weekend. I wanted Smalling to convincingly control him just to further re-assert his case as the best CB in the league.

1186~~~
LVG 
"He also has the talent to speak. That makes him easy to coach. Because of that I made him a leader of the team.

"He has made steps and also in a tactical way. When you give instruction in terms of organisation you need someone to understand that."

1188~~~
Great video.

We'd be seriously buggered without him.

1189~~~
Still playing well but I think his passing has slipped a bit since having to play on the left side of the partnership.

1190~~~
Playing like a cpt should be this season.

1191~~~
Wasn't really tested today, was unlucky with the volley not too score.

1192~~~
Not sure why he has shifted to LCB. Pretty sure Jones always used to play on the left.

1193~~~
I prefer him on the right and Jones on the left but still a good performance from him.

1194~~~
Pretty sure because LVG trusts Jones on the ball more than Smalling. The heatmaps showed that he played more towards the rightback position when Valencia pushes up, so he actually saw a lot of the ball.

Smalling is the better defender currently,  it is more important that he defend the central areas.

1195~~~
Hopefully rested for this game.

1196~~~
Couple f sloppy passes early on but other than that mopped everything up, oddly seemed to be out defending the fullback areas quite often.

1197~~~
We're going to run him into the ground aren't we?

1198~~~
It's really annoying that we had no choice but to play him for 120 minutes in a game where we didn't even go through.

1199~~~
Another vote for Smalling as captain. What a player.

Have to be honest and say that I didn't believe he would come good, I'd personally written him off after has idiotic sending off against City last season, but I'm glad to have been proven wrong. The man's already becoming a legend and he's bossing our defence.

Just hope LVG stops shuffling him around from left centre back one day to right centre back the next. Keep him in one position and find him a consistent partner!

1200~~~
Beat the crap out of Kike all night.

1201~~~
Not his best game today but I do feel he was hampered by having to constantly mop up after Darmian.

1202~~~
He has played almost every minute of our games this season, looks a bit knackered.

1203~~~
think it was more because of 120 minutes against Boro.....

1204~~~
He has played every minute in PL and CL, and he had to play even that game ffs.

1205~~~
We better give him some days off before we lose him to the red zone.

1206~~~
He should take the internationals off but there's a starting spot at the Euros up for play.

1207~~~
Hodgson would be nutty to not realise Smalling is his best CB. He's been so for at least a year now. Let Stones and Cahill have a couple games to see who plays beside him.

1208~~~
Hodgson is an idiot. Cahill has got that spot nailed on because of his incompetence, and it's Smalling and Stones having to fight for the other spot.

1209~~~
It's something I've wondered about a lot. Hodgson was the one who actually bought Big Chris at Fulham, no? If he saw the talent then, surely he should see just how much better he is than Cahill.

1210~~~
I am a big fan of Smalling, but his lack of ability on the ball is a problem with the style we are playing.
Watching Boateng at Bayern and it's amazing what a ball playing centerback can add to a team, pinging the ball wide and even spotting runs from the striker and actually hitting the target.

I'm not saying he should be replaced, but i'm not sure either that being an amazing defender is good enough nowadays.

1211~~~
Boateng also flopped massively at City, so it's not all roses.

1212~~~
Definitely should get a rest. He seemed a little sluggish against Palace. I actually thought his passing was quite good though. Played some nice balls in between the lines early on.

1213~~~
Blind is much better on the ball and his distribution doesn't really help us <i>that</i> much.

However, Smalling has improved a lot, and I really mean a lot in that regard. He isn't great, but at least he cut out those silly long balls and giving away possession because of his overhit passes. And he actually plays one or two decent passes per game and makes some decent runs in midfield with the ball winning space. Today he had one very good situation when he won lot off space and passed the ball wide for Martial which left him running one on one with a fullback with lot of space behind.

1214~~~
He might as well be trying to find Rooney from the Allianz for all that matters in our team.

1215~~~
He actually had 2 or more of those long balls that didn't come off today and i've noticed in recent games that he has failed with them alot. Blind has had some crucial moments with his passing this year that resulted in goals. Also Blind tend to get pressed more on the ball where usually they don't press Smalling because most of the time not alot comes out of him having the ball.

I just think it's an interesting debate if we wen't down in defending and upped the ball playing abilitys would it be better overall for the team? It would mean better possession, more penetration and therefore more chance creation. Of course the two defenders doesn't have to both be good on the ball, so a good ball playing partner next to him would be fine.

1216~~~
Mike is a colossus.

1217~~~
What a beautiful man.

1218~~~
Sensational

1219~~~
GOAT.

1220~~~
That save/clearance. I think I am in love.

1221~~~
Have we got a best defender in Europe thread yet?

1222~~~
Absolutely world class.

1223~~~
Fecking love him. He should be our next captain.

1224~~~
Unbelievable how far he has progressed. Captain material.

1225~~~
It wasn't just his save, his overall performance was once again outstanding.

1226~~~
He should be our captain right now. There's not a single better candidate in the squad. He's sensational.

1227~~~
Honestly think we have the best CB in the league. Its ridiculous how good hes become.

1228~~~
crazy recovery

1229~~~
Just saved our Champions League campaign.

1230~~~
Just need Rooney to feck off so we can consolidate his power in captain of United and England.

1231~~~
Motm

1232~~~
He is surely undeniably the best CB in the Premier League and one of the top CBs in Europe. What a rise.

1233~~~
Huge moment in our season really. Another good performance too. Some of his headers back to DDG in the first-half were a bit average though.

1234~~~
Thank heavens Ferguson signed this lad.

1235~~~
He's been stupidly dominant this season. That clearance off the line was a result of a really poor decision from Smalling though.

1236~~~
If Young didn't slip he would have had it covered. But great block Vidic type stuff.

1237~~~
Love him.

1238~~~
The chance was actually his fault.

Dominating performance for the most part, though.

1239~~~
Jesus, how he transformed into absolut beast of a defender

1240~~~
I actually gave MotM to De Gea, since as <a class="username" data-user="28685, @Cina" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28685/">@Cina</a> said the chance was at least partially Smalling's fault, and he also got beat down the right by sheer pace. Still a good performance all in all, and I echo most of the sentiments in this thread.

1241~~~
Looks like that block has really inflated his ratings! There were better players on the pitch, not saying he was bad though.

1242~~~
True, he was foolish to charge in like that. It's like he wanted too much to be decisive and to break the attack himself. Still happened, to be fair.

1243~~~
Man's a beast.

1244~~~
Yeah he does that now, keep him interested, make a horrendous mistake in order to make up for said mistake with ridiculous tackle/block.

1245~~~
Vital block, his consistency has been so important whilst we've been firing blanks up front.

1246~~~
My man of the match. Totally different player now is Captain Mike<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1247~~~

1248~~~
Wouldn't swap him for any CB at any club. A boss. 

You can see how much de Gea appreciates him as well. A proper commander of his box.

1249~~~
The boss at the back!

1250~~~
Indeed. Very proud of the boy. He could have let his head drop after that red card at City last season. But somehow he's hauled himself kicking and screaming to his current standard. Thanks to the coaching team for helping him but mostly thanks to Chris for obviously taking on board whatever he's being taught.

1251~~~
Such a big player for us now. Someone gif that block!

1252~~~

1253~~~
Did he actually say Michael <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1254~~~
Absolutely world class. Would be the team captain if it was my choice.

1255~~~

Poor Chris - his boss doesn't know his name!<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1256~~~
Danny Taylor is saying he did too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1257~~~
I think the reason he was at fault for that chance is because he underestimated just how quick Doumbia and Musa are. It's understandable, I mean, 90% or so of the forwards he has/will come across this season will be slower and weaker than him, but he musn't get complacent in these situations. His physical abilities will get him so far - and he's really utilising them this season, hence the increased dominance/agression but he needs to keep using that brain and time things as he had been doing earlier in his career.

1258~~~
Block on the line was pure class. As good as a goal.

1259~~~
A defender being amazing at defending isn't enough? He's fine in possession for a CB

1260~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1261~~~
He's just joining in now!  Doing it for lolz

1262~~~
Best CB in the Prem this season imo

He's become a colossus.

1263~~~
Granted, but at least he kept playing and made the block. Huge contrast between him and Blind who just stopped and didn't even bother trying to get back to help.

1264~~~
I couldn't believe that, smalling bust his ass off and got the game winning block, blind just walked back watching?!?

Thank god for Mike though, he really is an absolute colossal defender

1265~~~
Smalling is really benefitting from his graduation into top dog since the old guard of Rio, Vidic Evra and Evans left. 

You can visibly see he feels responsibility as an essential first team player and leads his back 5 brilliantly as well as deliver world class performances at centre back.

He was sensational in his defensive duties tonight epitomised by that lunge to save a certain goal in the 2nd half. 

Actually he has been sensational all season, probably our player of the season so far.  And yet its also clear that he still has potential to become even better.  Certainly one player who has benefitted from the LVG philosophy.  

Ive struggled for a while to identify who best personified what Manchester United stood for but now Im very clear:  Its Chris Smalling.

1266~~~
I love him but, if you're looking at every club, I think Boateng is better. He hits long balls like Blind (and we saw again today how key that can be) and defends almost as well as Smalling.

Smalling is brilliant, though. Thought he was fantastic today at winning the long balls and clearances CSKA played out. He looks more assured on the ball, too. Shaw, Smalling and De Gea is a fine start to a truly fantastic defensive unit.

1267~~~

1268~~~
At times he looks like he is playing around with opposition strikers, incredible how dominant he can look. 

Also, again, he deserves more praise for improving so much technically and passing wise.

1269~~~
What a beast! His desire to win every header and every ball is just immense. 

No weakness to his game, just a top class natural defender.

1273~~~
It gets bandied around a lot as a term, but is Mikey now world class? I can't think of any other defenders I'd rather have and think he is at a higher level than others who are de facto 'world class' defenders.

1274~~~
Amazing what a name change can do.

Maybe we need to rename all of our forward players. Marouane Rooney.

1275~~~
At the level he's currently performing at, I don't think you could describe him as anything other than a top class defender. I've no idea what world class even means these days, but he's got to be close.

1276~~~
He is without a doubt the best cb in the PL by a mile, he is absolutely incredible, strong as feck and technical when required and has developed vocally, he is a leader at the back.

1277~~~
Mike outpaced???? Haven't seen that before. By whom?

1278~~~
Now watch that block with the superman music playing. Mikes a player and a half.

1279~~~
I was as surprised as anyone, I think it was Musa, or may have been Doumbia - one of the two though.

1280~~~
Didn't watch the match. Was Fellaini that bad?

1281~~~
Hope he doesn't burn out. He has played every single game so far.

1282~~~
Another heroic  performance, cant think of many better defenders in the world.

1283~~~
Born to defend.

1284~~~
Great performance again.  Captain material.

1285~~~
He could well turn out to be LvG's United legacy.

1286~~~
It is impossible to find faults in his game nowadays. Has grown leaps and bound since that City away game. What a turning point that was in his career. Really looking forward to a solid Smalling-Jones partnership.

1287~~~
He is great on the ball, and makes some runs at the opposing goal. Maybe a few more goals from setpieces to really round out the package <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1288~~~
Good job Mike!!!

1289~~~
Not to forget he needs to work on his goal celebrations too. Seems to me he doesn't know what to do when he scores goals. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1290~~~
He's played every minute of every game hasn't he? Maybe missed one match. Hopefully he doesn't burn out.

1291~~~
What a player he is turning out to be. Amazing this season.

1292~~~
When you make a block like he did tonight (and Young must get some credit for his great effort as well) it's just as valuable as scoring a goal.

1293~~~
He has faults, one being how long he takes to pass it when he wants to hit it hard. Takes an extra few seconds.

1294~~~
Mike pre-season, now Michael - wonder who it is that he's confusing him with? 

Something's definitely sticking in LvG's enormous forehead … going to have to change the thread name soon!

1295~~~
Please correct the typo in title of this thread. 

The correct title is: Mike Smalling

1296~~~
Is Michael Smalling and Jupp Van Gaal

1297~~~
Great block but it was initiall poor defending from him to let the striker in

1298~~~
I honestly think if he was a great passer he'd have the potential to be the best defender in the world.

1299~~~
He won us match with THAT tackle, couldn't believe it how he managed to pull that one!

1300~~~
If he takes a defence with Daley Blind as his CB partner and without Luke Shaw, to a CL final he'd put himself right up there despite all his on ball deficiencies IMO.

1301~~~
Both are properly fast though,but he has had agbonlahor and ribery in his pocket in the past. One wrong step and those fast players will get you though. May be a bit tired now as well. He has played every match.

1302~~~
I always think he's mixing him up with Carrick for some reason.  Both English.  Both leaders.  Both have played at CB...that's about it really but its all I've got.

Still, well played Mr Mike Smalling.

1303~~~
Michael Smalling and Danny Blind. Good CB Pairing that is.

1304~~~
Its gotten to the stage where I don't expect anything else apart from complete domination from him, in incredible form and rising to his potential he showed in his first season. Our player of the season so far

1305~~~
We need a poll; change thread title to "Iron Mike" Smalling?

1306~~~
Same, for me that defines a world class player when you expect nothing else but a quality performance.

1307~~~
Same, for me that defines a world class player when you expect nothing else but a quality performance.

1308~~~
Yeah, that point can't be emphasised enough.

1309~~~
Has probably been said 1,000 times already in this thread but cannot believe the transformation in this guy. When Moyes was here he was seriously poor and on other threads of players I wanted shipped out, he was pretty high on the list (along with Young who redeemed himself last season too!). LVG has made this guy as good as Rio was when he first joined us. And if Smalling has as good a career as Rio then we'll have one of the best CB's in the world for years to come. 

He always struck me as the sort of player who needed the much older, wiser head next to him but his composure on the ball, passing, tackling is all as good as I've seen from any CB this season....in any league! 

Keep up the good work Mike!!

1310~~~
All hail Mike.

1311~~~
His level has raised so much that such dominant performances are average for him now.

1312~~~
Dont think he's ever been poor, just injuries and matches at RB (but he even put in shifts there at times). He's showing that defensively he isnt any less than the likes of Ramos/Hummels etc, which got ridiculed past summer.

1313~~~
This version of Smalling doesn't surprise me, said it all along that he just needs to stay fit and he'll reach this level. Immense CB and our best player atm.

I think if he was a better passer of the ball, he'd go on to be a contender for the best CB in Europe if his form continues like this into next season. However, when he has the likes of Blind, Carrick and Schweinsteiger around him, he doesn't need to be able to play anything more than a simple pass. He is an immense defender and has become my favourite CB (who is currently still playing). 

I know its easy to say now, but I've always rated him as our best potential from when he first signed. Now that he's seemingly over the injuries (although he's missed far fewer games in his time here than everyone seems to think), it is as clear as day that he is head and shoulders above everyone else in terms of defending and his physical attributes. He is definitely the stand-out performer and has improved massively under LvG (can only say that for maybe four or five players in our squad).

1315~~~
For me world class means performing on the biggest stages against the best players. If he continues this form in the latter stages of the Champions League and in the big domestic games then we can start asking whether he is world class. For now though, lets just enjoy his performances.


Edit - the Euros next summer is a huge opportunity for him to put his name up there. Bizarrely you will still find the majority of opposition fans who don't rate him

1316~~~
Mike is gonna stick to him but yeah..he's great.

1317~~~
I said years ago that he's one of my favourite United players, even when he was on the bench. Just has that professional demeanor about him. Knew he'd be an immense defender for us one day, and now is the time. I can't believe he's only 25. Within 3 years he went from Maidstone United to Manchester United via Fulham. What a brilliant pluck from Fergie.

1318~~~
Just make him captain now. Let him be captain and the face of the club for the next 5-10 years.

1319~~~
Totally. His only ever criticism was his distribution out of defence and the occasional brain fart. His defensive abilities have NEVER been in doubt from day one in my opinion.

He has a perfect stature and physique for a CB, and just constantly bosses the defence, elegantly gliding attackers off the ball. Beautiful man. Wouldn't swap him for any defender in the world.

1320~~~
I touched his shoulder almost five years ago, naturally I take fully credit for his form.

1321~~~
The day we see captain Chris Smalling with vice captain Luke Shaw is going to be a beautiful day <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1322~~~
Always knew his class and quality would come through.

Just need Jones to come out of the red zone and he'll be the same.

1323~~~
Michelangelo Smalling is brilliant. So dominant, don't think he lost any duels yesterday?

1324~~~
Just seen the highlights after i missed the game. Chris fecking Smalling. Enough said.

1325~~~
Imagine we had done that rumoured swap deal for Vermaelen.

1326~~~
Him beside Koscielny would probably the best CB pairing in the world.

1327~~~
After the City red card.

1328~~~
The optimist in me insists on pointing out that the first and last options there effectively split the 'sane' vote, while the 'moronic twat' vote only had one outlet for their rage.

1329~~~
I like how no one wanted him fined with one week's wages but 6% were fine with two weeks' wages.

1330~~~
Someone posted this on one of the football threads on the Guardian. I think we've cracked it.

#smallingplus10

1334~~~
Even BFS is calling him Mike now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1335~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzJbpyPntz4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Indeed. What's German for troll?? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1336~~~
Completely off topic but how the feck is Thiago not in this? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1337~~~
Would he start for every premier league team we think?

1338~~~

1339~~~
Can't think of any team that wouldn't start him. Maybe City if Otamendi and Kompany are both playing well?

1340~~~
One of the comments. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1341~~~
So Finn did not become a Jedi after all?

1342~~~
He's better than Otamendi so I think he would start in my opinion.

1343~~~
Of course, any of us here would have done the same.

1344~~~
Comfortably.

1345~~~
I'm struggling to think of a team in the world in which he wouldn't start in going on current form

1346~~~
Athletic Bilbao.

1347~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1348~~~
Fergie knew how to spot a defender.

1349~~~
So who is actually better than him in his current form, that he has almost had a season of under his belt now? Ramos? Ceillini? Thiago Silva? maybe Boateng? the difference is marginal.

1350~~~
Shout out Buttner.

1351~~~
Which is no surprise given he would rotate everyone but Evra. Evra played until his legs fell off.

1352~~~
In all seriousness, I don't either.

Though he's been performing at such an incredibly high level for so long I think it's safe to say that it isn't just form, it's that he's actually become a world-class CB.

1353~~~
Head onto RAWK and they think Sakho is the best CB in the league.

1354~~~
Exactly. At some point we will all have to stop tacking 'how he's playing now' onto the end of these observations. This has gone beyond just a purple patch.

And yep, you can find a place for him in any team in the world. He'd start for Bayern ahead of Benatia or Martinez. He'd start for Madrid ahead of Pepe or Varane. He'd start for Barca ahead of... well, arguably any of their CBs given some of Pique's dodgy games this season.

Obviously some will disagree because it offends their sensibilities and determination that English players and English teams always be worse than everyone else no exceptions, or because I've just mentioned their team. But Smalling has been all-but-flawless this season.

1355~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1356~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Definitely going to have to use this one at some point

1357~~~
Involved twice so far and doing both actions in a decisive, commanding fashion. Loving this new side of his game. Much more authority about his work so far.

1358~~~
Yep. He's a monster.

1359~~~
Dribbles more than anyone else in the team.

1360~~~
This post deserves a lot of green <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1361~~~
Had Rondon in his pocket, standard procedure this season really.

1362~~~
The black Gandalf.

1363~~~
He makes an arsehole out of opposition forwards. Rondon had a stinker.

1364~~~
Chris "Rock" Smalling

1365~~~
Would still prefer a Cahill-Jagielka partnership for England at this international break. Its best for everyone.

1366~~~
I just expect him to have a brilliant game every week now.

1367~~~
The most consistent player for us this season. Solid performance 
.

1368~~~
If he was better on the ball, he'd have potential to be the best CB in the world imo

Still for me, he's the best CB in the Prem.

1369~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's playing with such authority these days. Watching him defend is as entertaining as any trickster attacker.

1370~~~
Seriously, he embarrasses opposition strikers week after week. It must be a pain in the ass playing in defensive team on break against Smalling.

1371~~~
Yup. Such a clean yet dominant defender. You never worry when he commits into a challenge because he's almost certain to win it.

1372~~~
Just an absolute tank these days. Such a shame Shaw got injured as we'd have the best defence in the league by a distance when he's fit, having the 2 of them basically being beastly in every game.

1373~~~
Wish we could blend some of Blind's passing into his game.

1374~~~
10.0

1375~~~
You'll be wishing for a long time.

1376~~~
Dominant performance.

1377~~~
It's no longer form now, he just is top class. I do not know what happened to him after that red card at City last season, but it seems that that flipped a switch.

1378~~~
Got a run of games at CB for the first time in his career to make people forget about his underwhelming RB performances, that were so far in his career overshadowing his talent at CB.

He was always a terrific CB.

1379~~~
This, it did seem like he turned a corner after that City red card but I remember Smalling playing really well in his first season at United. I'm so glad United kept their faith with him like I did <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1380~~~
Not even surprised that he played well again it's become the norm for him, big part why we are one of the best defences in the league.

1381~~~
This x100000000

1382~~~
LVG deserves a lot of credit, showed a lot of faith in him and hasn't let him down.

1383~~~
And just a week before the sending off where he put in one of his best performances of the season against Chelsea. People love a narrative though.

1384~~~
the future EPL player of the season if JV9 stops scoring of course...

1385~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Wow.

1386~~~
One thing I've noticed is he's more assured on the ball when playing it out as the RCB than when he has to play as LCB with Jones.

1387~~~
its really weird as chris spent a season or two covering for Rb, so he's very natural there but aas soon as jones back in the team, smallings on the left<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1388~~~
Defended well, just the standard for him. I was more impressed with how often he brought the ball into the midfield area. He didn't always find a brilliant forward pass but I thought it really helped the mentality of the team.

1389~~~
Very much agree with this. Mike's got way too many threadmarks in this thread,  he definitely needs a little breather.

1390~~~
Iron Mike

1391~~~
Magic Mike XXXXXL!! Absolutely beast as whatever he does at the back. Made Rondon look small and irrelevant.

1392~~~
He can't burn out, he's at the best age for a footballer. At this age, his body recovers quickly. He can play every game for the next four years fitness permitting and he will be fine.

1393~~~
Absolutely fantastic.

He deserves even more credit than he's receiving having to play with different personnel consistently. Just needs to find some magic in his feet to improve his passing.

1394~~~
I doubt he's ever going to become a great passer, but he isn't that bad on the ball. He's showing some nice feet at times.

1395~~~
Haven't enjoyed watched no a CB play this much in a long time. Absolutely bossing it. Must be hell for a striker to line up against him these days.

1396~~~
What's really terrifying about him is his pace.

Like Vidic you get the sense that he absolutely relishes defending - winning physical battles, competing in the air, shoving people about, tackling, blocking - and like Vidic his head is like a magnet in the box. 

But then he's got pace as well! I mean, Torres wouldn't put on the afterburners and get away from him, he'd be caught and then taken out by his huge frame.

Basically unless he cocks it up with the ball or are very badly positioned you're not, ever, going to get a clear cut chance vs him. Must be frustrating for the strikers.

1397~~~
Reminds me a lot of Wes in that he's so complete. Scarily, he's even bigger, stronger and faster than Wes.

1398~~~
I am a fan of LVG, but why should he get credit for Smallings play? Smalling was very good before, his first season was really good, after that he was more than OK, but played as RB and had a lot of injuries. Under Moyes he was our best CB when played as one and now he is just progressing and fullfiling his potential, thank God.

1399~~~
It's difficult to say how much is down to him, but I think LvG should be credited a bit for Smalling's fitness this season. I remember that van Gaal spoke of his track record with injuries at his other teams. Now, that the players have been calibrated to LvG's training even Jones have been fit for quite a while (blood cloth doesn't count obviously).

1400~~~
I do give credit for that, as it seems that all players are less injury prone, but when it comes to Smalling and his abilities, I think that it should have been clear before what his potential is and that he is starting tu fullfill it. He is not even 26 yet and people apparently didn't understand that when they have criticised him before.

1401~~~
He deserves credit for not fecking around with him and letting him play at CB. So far he is the only Manchester United manager to realise you shouldn't waste the most talented English CB around as a RB.

1402~~~
I don't know, if not for Phil Jones' blood clot Smalling would have probably started the season as a sub. That was certainly the way it seemed to be heading during pre-season.

1403~~~
As founder of the #SmallingPlusOne movement I'm claiming this one. Been saying he's our best centre half since before Rio and Vidic left. Since his first season he's been unbeatable.

1404~~~
He's definitely looked the real deal since his first season, it was only his fitness/RB stint that held him back imo.

1405~~~
Haha but I made the 'Smalling is the best in the league' thread. However I only turned at the end of last season. So happy for him though. He was the world class centre back signing we all wanted in the summer.

1406~~~
Again, people forget his age. SAF left when he was 23 and we still had Rio and Vidić in the team, so him playing there wasn't a huge problem, especially as he had injury problems (one was an impact injury when he got a concussion and one was tonzilitis, where both kept him away for a long time). 

Whom did LVG played yesterday as a RB? Jones, isn't it?

1407~~~
Actually a great point. When speaking about the best CBs in the world even though defending isn't glamorous it's usually a joy to watch someone who has perfected the art. Last time I think I enjoyed watching a defender was Vidic.

1408~~~
I think it's half and half, LVG isn't responsible for Smallings ability or development so much but he is responsible of using his strengths to get the best out of him. Smallings key strengths is to bully 1v1 situation outside the box from standing, jumping or running with/after the ball and the way LVG has changed United's play from possession and team positioning means that 90% of Smallings defending is 1v1 outside of our box.

1409~~~
Rio was playing regular football as a CB at 23. His RB stint damaged his confidence and peoples perception of his ability, which he's still fighting against now. He was ready at 21 and should've been trusted, and we would've seen this a lot quicker.

At the age of 23 Rio was starting in World Cup 2002. Smalling missed out in place of the likes of Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill.

1410~~~

1411~~~
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's a bad defending in the box, he's bloody brilliant but I think he's best art is the 1v1, there's been countless times this season where he's made clean shit of a player 1on1.

1412~~~
He's so good one against one. Dreading the day he gets injured because he's just too important now.

1413~~~
Of course, I do agree, I am just saying that he is also good in the box.

1414~~~
Emphasised by the way we play. We camp in their half and as such are often faced with a counter which sees Smalling tracking one player. As you say, he relishes this. 

I'd be surprised if any player in the world can dribble faster than he can run so it's incredibly difficult to get the better of him in a 1v1 situation.

1415~~~
Has a bit of Rock of Kampen about him these days. Rio and Vidic are more recent players, but Smalling's game resembles the Dutchman's the most out of the three. More of a stopper, maybe not as great of a passer as Rio; but he has Stam's quickness (quicker still?), is a tower of strength (not as frightening though), seems natural in 1v1 marking (Stam obliterated just about everyone if they dared to face him head on), and is radiating this aura of being an unassailable 'one man defense' - as Cruyff termed Jaap. Very happy to see the progress he's made. Has Stam's no-reaction look on his face too, just stands there nonplussed after making a fool out of opposition attackers for the umpteenth time.

1416~~~
His anticipation is also Rio esq, he always knows exactly the right time to make the tackle when he's being dribbled at. Never forces it, just waits for the right moment. There was a great example yesterday and the one against Chadli in the season opener was about as ice cold as it gets - in his box, end of the game

His attitude and mentality is the most impressive part of his game for me. Sent off vs City, came back like nothing happened. Dropped unfairly in pre-season, no strop whatsoever and has forced Van Gaal into making him unstoppable. 

During a game as well, if a striker rarely gets the better of him it never seems to phase him. I remember Ings gave him a bad time for about 40 minutes vs Burnley last season. Then from about 50 odd minutes, he got a hold of him and basically took him and their attack out the game.

1417~~~
Wouldnt it be nice now if Phil Jones can turn into a rock as well so we can just plug them both in there at CB for the next 10 years or so?  Is that asking too much?

1418~~~
6 years or 7 years at a push seems more reasonable.

1419~~~
I got a lot of stick from friends claiming that Smalling was good enough to replace Rio and Vidic, and that he was our best CB during their twighlight years. Now everyone has shut up. Have to say it feels good to be right <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1420~~~
This. This. This. Distinctly remember a group of 3 laughing in my face when I talked up Smalling saying he just needs time and experience. Now he's doing all the talking on the pitch.

1421~~~
Because he's the only manager we've had who has given Smalling a huge run of games at CB, whereas Fergie and Moyes never gave him a fair chance in his best position. Can't really blame Fergie for that, but Moyes definitely deserves lots of blame for not dropping Ferdinand/Vidic. And some blame obviously lies with Smalling regarding his fitness issues over the last few seasons. Lots of our fans tend to overlook his performances under Moyes where he was our best CB in the league IMO. Even then though, he never had this amount of dominance. He made basic positional errors and his passing was terrible. His long passing is still terrible, but Van Gaal has improved his confidence and that's subsequently had a massive impact on his composure on and off the ball. Which Van Gaal can't be credited enough for.

1422~~~
Similar situation against Arsenal this season. The whole defence was sub-par but Smalling was quite good in the second half, didn't give Walcott an inch.

1423~~~
Do we really think he was dropped? For me, it was more that VG knew 'Mike' was his #1 defender and was fiddling about to see who would be the **.

1424~~~
The scary thing is, imagine how good he could have been if he wasnt plagued with injuries and Ferguson insisting on playing him at RB in his younger years...

1425~~~
I actually think playing RB probably helped him

1426~~~
Would you care to elaborate on this? I think it was a significant hindrance myself.

1427~~~
Scarier still to imagine if we'd handled his development from age 13-15.

1428~~~
Its a different type of defending, and understanding a different type of space, but it gives you a more broad understanding of how to depend different spaces, and how to defend one on one too.

Its a little bit like a striker, playing on the wings for a bit, understanding what goes through the wingers mind when crossing, passing, looking for the striker, can improve the strikers movement.

I think he played RB for too long, also I think under Fergie when Vidic/Rio were on top of their game, playing Smalling at RB was a good choice.

1429~~~
I normally appreciate the value of playing a player in a different position, in terms of learning and development. I think you are partially right in that <i>some</i> gametime at FB was probably beneficial (in the sense of teaching Mike how to be a better CB), but as you said he was really overutilised in that role such that it stunted his development a bit.

1430~~~
Still get some absolute mongrels who fail to realise what a good player he is. Had a few people at work crediting Schneiderlin for our solid defence this season, despite him not actually playing that often.

Our possession game helps in regard to not allowing the opposition many chances and obviously we've got Dave in goal, but Smalling has undoubtably been the best aspect of the teams defensive game this season. He's barely given any striker he's faced and inch.

1431~~~
Ability on the ball aside, I don't think it'd have made much difference. When you think about it, for a player with the lower league education that he had, his game is very unconventional of that type. He has buckets of pace and is very physically dominant, but really he only just started to utilise them. For the most part, his game - here and at Fulham - has always been about reading and intercepting play, very rarely needing to drop to the deck, and being insanely dominant in one-on-ones when isolated. It's probably why he managed to stand out at Maidstone. Other English defenders - Cahill, Jones, Jagielka et al. are way more lionheart in what you'd expect from that type of CB.

1432~~~
I got slated in the summer on here for saying that id take smalling over hummels and varane.  Just saying

1433~~~
I can't think of a CB I'd rather have in world football right now, that's how good he's been this season. I actually think he's our only current defender that will get close to the level Rio and Vidic were at in their prime. Jones still has time, mind you.

1434~~~
The clouds of smug are making this thread hard to navigate!

1435~~~
I agree with your point in terms of his defending. As you've noted, it's the ball-carrying aspect of his game that I'm sure would have been cultivated much better.

I don't agree with the idea that he needs to be exceptional on the ball to be world class in this climate. Even so, I doubt he'd be uncomfortable on his left side, for instance, if he'd come through. It's silly to think about it now anyway considering the form he's showing.

1436~~~
It didn't. It almost bought him a one way ticket out on his arse to somewhere like Leicester.

The only reason Smalling has improved is because he's playing regular games at centre half; a run of games he should have had aged 22, not when almost 26.

Ferguson was too busy rotating the old guard to really force the issue and allow Smalling the trust his talent merited. I argued this back then and I still maintain it now.

1437~~~
Yes! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He looked like an excellent defender very early on and it wasn't exactly the prediction of the century to believe in him!

1438~~~
it wont be long before there is a similar LVG thread

1439~~~
Spot on - he isn't getting injured and is playing where he should be now - no coincidence.  There's no doubt for me that Ferguson hindered his career a bit - or stinted / slowed it down anyway.  Same as Jones.

1440~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Named in The Guardian's team of the season (so far).

Really good article on Smalling here:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/10062204/how-chris-smalling-became-man-utd-and-england8217s-best-defender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/football/n...became-man-utd-and-england8217s-best-defender</a>

Cba to copy paste as it's long.

1443~~~
He's just played an extra half hour of football with a strained hamstring.

Absolutely outrageous.

1444~~~
Where you getting that from?

1445~~~
He pulled up in the 60th-or-so minute. I'll be absolutely livid if he's out. Hodgson is an inept fool.

1446~~~
Because he pulled up holding it about 60 minutes in. Irresponsible and outright fecking stupid of him.

1447~~~
For playing fit players? Hardly.

EDIT: just realised he continued with an injury. That is ridiculous.

1448~~~
What are you talking about? If he pulled up, he was obviously no longer fit. This is what substitutions are for.

Edit: Just saw your edit.

1449~~~
Nice edit.

1450~~~
The player always wants to play on, I'd expect more from Smalling [if he was in any serious pain or realised he had tweaked something] but he's no different from pretty much any other player in that position. They all think they can run it off most times. The manager ought to have intervened. It's a pointless friendly and he had adequate replacement on the bench.

1451~~~
It's Mike's responsibility to tell the bench if he's got an injury, but it's the England bench's responsibility to be continually monitoring their players.

Hopefully there's nothing in it, but if there is I'll be absolutely fuming.

1452~~~
We're going to pay for not getting cover at CB, we all knew it was coming.

1453~~~
Great Uncle Woy doesn't give a sh*t about united players.

1454~~~
Blaming the bench? He's a grown man. He knows this is a friendly and he knows how important he is to this United side.

If you tweak your hamstring you get off the field immediately. He should know that.

1455~~~
Not his fault if Smalliing didn't put United first.

1456~~~
Yours wasn't bad either.

(This is the edit appreciation society.)

1457~~~
Please tell me he is not injured.

1458~~~
Hodgson just said he was limping at the end

1459~~~
feck our luck

1460~~~
You have to laugh.

1461~~~
Decent performance from him once again - the Smalling and Jones partnership seemed to be England's biggest positive tonight. Hopefully' Chris's limp was just a knock, and both will be rested for Tuesday.

1462~~~
One of the few positives of our season so far.. i'll be freaked if he's injured!

1463~~~
Hope it's a minor one. I'd be livid if we lose him for a long time. Bye bye clean sheets.

1464~~~
I don't think it's a serious one. It's nor reported in many places. Plus we have Watford next. Maybe rest him even if he is fit. Play Jones and blind

1465~~~
because its watford id want Smalls in there! They are a physical side and they have Ighalo and Deeney up front so its pretty important that we start with Smalling and Jones as Deeney would easily got the better of Blind.

1466~~~
Full week to recover.

1467~~~
Nah Blind is more stronger than we give him credit for. He has been beaten yes but the strikers he has dominated is more than the vice versa. Benteke Kane Gestede etc.

They should be able to deal with Watford at least.

1468~~~
Exactly. If he's out, the blame lies solely with him. Absolutely daft.

1469~~~
Can't wait for LvG's rant

1470~~~
Didn't Jones do exactly the same playing for England .... pulled his hamstring, played on,  subsequently  out for over a month.
It looks like the players have been ordered to leave their brains in the changing room when they play for England, especially by the way they play! ( shite)

1471~~~
We have more than a few to be fair?

1472~~~
What irritates me is that this was a meaningless friendly. 45mins tops for each player imo. These games are absolutely pointless.

1473~~~
There's too much media pressure, even over a friendly. Forces Hodgson to play his best XI when the team would benefit more from rotation, and players are afraid of getting hammered in the press if they are seen to be letting their country down.

1474~~~
So, this is our defensive line:

Darmian (bad form)
Valencia (injured)
Smalling (injured)
Blind
Rojo
Shaw (injured)

Have I got this right?

1475~~~
Jones

1476~~~
We have Jones as well, Young is pretty much a defender as well.

1477~~~
Martial, De Gea staying, Luke Shaw being world class before our luck ran out. That's about it <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1478~~~
2 points off the top, looking good in Europe, teams fearing us again, having a solid defensive set up, the immergance of exciting youth talent etc etc.

1479~~~
Oh ffs, why would he play on in a friendly if he felt something? Incredibly stupid if he did.

1480~~~
Morgan has been a very good addition and we now have the best midfielder in the league in Bastian. Darmain looks a good addition and Jesse has stepped up well in the last few games. Plus we are sitting 2 points of the top of the league and top of our champions league group. I'd say that's quite a few positives.

1481~~~
He gave an FA interview after the game, plus I have not seen a single report on his injury. I don't think it's serious. Maybe a week rest should be given even if he is fit so that he doesn't get burnt out

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2015/nov/chris-smalling-spain-v-england-fatv-reaction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thefa.com/news/england/2015/nov/chris-smalling-spain-v-england-fatv-reaction</a>

1482~~~
Sorry, was talking about players. Good shout with Morgan and Jesse though.

1483~~~
When are we stopping rating people based on their name? Schweini hasnt even been our best midfielder, never mind best in the league.

1484~~~
But, But he is BFS? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

<span style="color: #ffffff">White text</span>

1485~~~
Yeah but Rooney is still named Rooney as well, doesnt mean he's as good as he once was. On his day Schweini still shows laods of class, but things have to be optimal to him and until now against quite weak opposition. Dont think he's that much better than Carrick in that role btw.

1486~~~
BBC in their ratings said Smalling is "slowly but surely stepping up his claim to start next summer in France".

Smalling is England's best player by a country mile at the moment. He is further ahead of any English centre back than the next best option is ahead of me.

1487~~~
He's easily been our best midfielder not sure why you have to think I am going on his name? I couldn't care if he was called Djemba Djemba but fact being when I watch United (every game either at the game or on TV) he sticks out a mile. I can't think of a better midfielder in the Premiership? Who do you think is our best and who is better than him in the premiership?

1488~~~
He hasnt been better than Schneiderlin, Cazorla, Coquelin, Fernandinho on top of my head, he hasnt done anything significant, playing it far too safe on consistent basis in the PL. On par with Carrick for me who plays it even less safe and more deep.

1489~~~
BBC are about a year behind when it comes to football stuff tbf. I'm more shocked they haven't asked where Lescott is these days.

1490~~~
So no word of him dropping out of the squad for Tuesday, that has to be a good sign right?

1491~~~
We should really take this to the Bastian thread but you're having a laugh saying he's not been better than any of the above. He's certainly been better than Schneiderlin, Coquelin and Fernandinho, Cazorla has played well but I know who I'd have in my team. For me Bastian is the best midfielder in the league and I'd have that opinion if he was playing for City, Liverpool whoever and playing this way. The way he controls matches is a joy to watch, yes he's not hit top gear but he's still way ahead of anything in the league imo.

1492~~~
fecking hell where have they been for the past year?  Maybe it's someone who just writes about International football and doesn't watch club football.. that's the only excuse I can think of.

1493~~~
Lets agree to disagree then, dont think controlling the game makes you the best midfielder in the keague while that's the main reason we're so poor in attack. Lack of pace, urgency and depth in passing. Has got run ragged a few times as well.

1494~~~
He's pretty much locked in for United player of the year isn't he? And if we're topping the table by February, he would have to be one of the favourite for the PFA player of the Year awards.

Then again, defenders don't seem to get much recognition. Vidic should've walked it in 08/09.

1495~~~
On current form there isn't a defender anywhere I'd take ahead of him.

1496~~~
DDG ? It would be some feat to win it for a keeper.

1497~~~
DDG won it last two years. And to be fair as great as De Gea is, he missed the first 4 games of the season while he was fecking about and we still kept 3 cleansheets. Only Smalling has been the one constant in our impressive defense so far this season - with Blind, Shaw, Darmian, Schneiderlin all missing various games for one reason or another.

1498~~~
I forgot the word "again" obviously. DDG has impressed me more than Smalling because after his contract issues, he just came back and showed everyone he was the best in England again.

1499~~~
This. There is no centre back in world football I'd swap Smalling for now.

1500~~~
It was their chief football writer. They're woefully inadequate nowadays.

1501~~~
Reminds me of Lucio a bit with those marauding runs up field.

1502~~~
He probably needs to score a long-range screamer like David Luiz for everyone else to put him in the top bracket as that clearly counts for more than being a fantastic defender. Honestly though he just looks so confident like nobody could possibly get past him.

1503~~~
Smalling deserves it this year for his form, de gea has been great as usual but nothing out of the ordinary of his high level. Smalling though has stepped up massively, if he keeps it going he gets my vote.

1504~~~
Didn't have a great game today, but made a difference at the other end today at the end. Such a threat from set pieces if for once we put the fecking ball in!

1505~~~
Just usual Smalling really. Almost scored the winner too.

1506~~~
Those backheels. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

He is now trying to emulate Ronaldinho.

1507~~~
Had a good game and was a big part of our push for the winner on those 2 corners.

1508~~~
That tackle before DDG's save was top drawer.

1509~~~
Need a GIF of that beautiful backheel strike

1510~~~
Don't think he was as dominant as usual at the back tbh.

1511~~~
Solid as per usual

1512~~~
Standard dominant Mike Smalling performance, nothing to see here.

1513~~~
In the air it was pretty 50/50 between he and Deeney, but he wasn't really troubled at any point. As mentioned above he made a brilliant challenge just before that fantastic #DaveSave. Wasn't 'dominant', sure, but good enough in a very forgetable game.

1514~~~
I'm probably being quite harsh, but that's the standard he's set for himself (IMO) on the back of the last last year and especially the last few months.

1515~~~
wasn't as dominant as always but solid performance overall.

1516~~~
Don't think I've seen many players improve as much as he has in their mid-20's.
I've always hammered him on here & even when people were going over the top about him last season I wasn't on board. Never ever in a million years thought he would be good enough for us but I'm happy to eat my words.

1517~~~
He seems to be possessed by Ibrahimovic at the end of the game there. Not complaining though.

1518~~~
Was a little bit poorer than his recent high standards I thought. Was still decent enough though.

1519~~~
I don't think he's really improved too much defensively. He's managed to say fit and piece all of the raw materials together, but all of the good things he does are things he was always capable of. 

Depends where you stood before this season, I suppose. I wanted to let Rio go about two seasons before he left because I liked Smalling so much. For me, he's just reaping the benefits of regular football and a little bit of trust.

1520~~~
He's always been class. People just figuring it out now are like kids in class figuring out the homework answers 4 years later when the solutions have been released (I.e. he's getting praise in the media from at Sky/BT etc). It's not Smalling's fault.

1521~~~
The injuries were an issue but his positioning wasn't as good as it is now & he used to make a lot of mistakes. Dropping too deep, silly fouls, rushing into tackles etc. 
He definitely has improved. Maybe the standard set by Rio & Vidic didn't help when he first came here but people that say he's always been great are re-writing history. Second half of last season & this season he has been very good, before that he wasn't anywhere near the level he is now. Jonny Evans was preferred to him for quite a while & rightly so. They're a similar age & whilst Evans didn't improve at all from 21-25, Smalling has improved a lot which is why one plays for West Brom & one captains us.

1522~~~
He's a colossus.

1523~~~
I think the people who always rated him, such as myself, saw that he had all the tools needed, and that most of his faults were of the kind that usually goes away as a player gets more experienced. It could certainly have gone either way for a while, but he never really managed to establish himself as a clear CB choice, either through injury or by being shunted out on the right. For that reason, I always felt that he deserved more time and proper run as CB to prove himself.

1524~~~
I didnt think he was any worse than normal today. I dont think he is as well suited to a back three though, as it necessitates better ballplaying abilities from the central CB I think.

1525~~~
He's becoming our Rio and Vidic. The guy has grown in stature amazingly this season.

1526~~~
This is brilliant. I didn't think it had got so big that he'd know about it yet!

1527~~~
Hes shocking with the ball at his feet <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Not that we should have to rely upon him of course, and hes a beast at the back. But wish he wouldnt get a nose bleed once he travels to half way line with the ball.

1528~~~
PSV clearly targeted him as the weak link in possession and we're happy to let him have the ball. 

He's improved leaps and bounds and defensively he's great. Some of his defending tonight was great. 

LvG needs to do something about this, because playing the ball is never going to be his strong point, and neither Blind nor Schweinsteiger were available enough for him to play the fast simple ball to get us moving again.

1529~~~
He's not particularly elegant with it as such, but I quite like it when he goes forward: he seems to have a purpose and directness that our other players often lack. He sometimes felt like more of an attacking threat than Schneiderlin in the second half.

1530~~~
Yet to see a shirt with "Mike 12" on it yet though...

1531~~~
Good defensively and works well under pressure more so than any other player we have.

1532~~~
Apart from one really good pass forward (think it was to Memphis), he does this thing where he runs and either does a long ball or passes it backwards. Im not saying he should be bursting through like Rio used to (or Jones does) but wish his passing was better (and kinda like deer in headlights)

1533~~~
Agreed, it's why I was very glad to see Blind getting a chance this season, especially so in games where teams park the bus. 

Smalling really needs to develop this side of his game to really be up there with the best.

1534~~~
I thought this as well. He reminds me of me when I was playing - shite on the ball, but if there is space in front of you then you carry the ball forward until someone actually comes to stop you.

1535~~~
It kind of reminds me of how David Luiz can be when he's playing in defence sometimes. With the difference being that Smalling's very reliable in defence at the moment as well. He's playing with a lot of confidence too, which certainly helps.

1536~~~
He's able to carry the ball forward because opposition don't feel the need to press him because his lack of ability on the ball. If the likes of Blind went charging forward he'd be closed down. 

Teams keep there shape and make it hard for us to do anything because we play such a slow possession game.

1537~~~
He used to be, but he really isn't know.

He was probably better with the ball than either of our midfielders in second half.

1538~~~
I didn't think he was too bad on the ball actually. He had one or two bad passes but aside from that he was positive. He was driving the team on at the end and looked like he wanted to win. Improved after a slow first-half I thought.

1539~~~
Better than Morgan tonight TBF.

1540~~~
I felt for Smalling today, it's not his game to take the ball forward like that, but he shouldered the burden because there was no one else, and he tried his best. 
Where the feck were the midfielders? They weren't there to take the ball off him, yet they weren't there supporting attack either. It was a shambles, but it wasn't Smalling's fault, he did his primary job of defending well, as usual.

1541~~~
Yeah it was pretty ridiculous. Only player bar the man behind him who really seems to churn out performances (I don't really want to say it but) <i>worthy of the shirt. </i>Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger and Fellaini were all spineless and content in giving him the ball to pass forward. He made a fairly good pass to Memphis at one point, who should've done better.

1542~~~
I felt for him too.  It seems the Central midfield is bypassed by our defenders coming out with the ball, its like they're only there to make 5 yard passes to each other and go backwards.  Smalling looked like the quickest player on the pitch with the ball at his feet and that is very worrying.

1543~~~
I actually think they don't press Smalling because it would be hard to take the ball off him and stay back because they want him to make a mistake and attack the space he leaves behind i.e as he's the only one they would fear 1-on-1. It's the same with Kompany, teams invite him to go forward because they want him out of the game so to speak. 

Imo if he actually had more competent defenders behind him and a team that he trusts/can rely on to retrieve/rush the ball IF he loses, he would go forward much more because his stride and ball carrying can cause a lot of problems (obviously nowhere near that level but think Lucio).

1544~~~
Pre-season:

4 goals conceded, only 1 with Chris Smalling on the pitch.

Season so far:
22 games (full minutes bar 20 vs Ipswich)
14 goals conceded (9 in the league, 1 in CL qualifiers, 4 in CL group stage)
13 clean sheets

1545~~~
Very good defensively as always. Won't be the last time we play a team who scheme to deny Blind the ball and give Smalling tons of time and space. He shows flashes of competence but generally is poor on the ball. He needs to improve his passing to make them pay or switch tactics. Good ball to Memphis at one point but other than that nowhere near enough of it.

1546~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

I can't believe people are even mentioning his passing when even our midfielders can't pass for shit these days. Only Carrick in our midfield seems capable of quality passing yet somehow Smalling should be the one taking responsibility, even though he is playing behind Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger who are actually responsible for that. And it's not like his passing is bad, it's just isn't that creative(which is standard even for CBs who are better with the ball at their feet than him).

For example, he passed the ball 17 times to Schneiderlin which is our second highest pass combination in the game yesterday. In comparision Blind passed to Morgan "just" 14 times. Schneiderlin passed the ball 21 times to Smalling. Blind played 14 passes to Smalling, and Smalling passed it to him just 8 times. Yet somehow Smalling is the one who is uncreative.  He also played just 9 backward passes. 45 forward succesfull passes. These are chalkboards of him, Schweinsteiger, and Schneiderlin, his variety of passes looks actually even better than either of those, yet somehow he is the one who is "shocking with the ball".

This must be one of the weirdest and most unfair complains I have seen to one of our players.

1547~~~
Would make him permanent captain to be honest.

1548~~~
Smalling did create a very good chance when he hit a ball along the ground to Memphis from the half way line, which cut straight through PSV. Memphis cut inside but spoiled it with a bit of a tame effort on goal.

Some of his forward passes were excellent. It can sometimes be a little inconsistent, but it wasn't last night. Him and Blind were our two best players by a distance.

His passing and dribbling have improved immeasurably since he first arrived.

1549~~~
You're all wrong...

1550~~~
Michael Owen, football genius

1551~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck, man. How can somebody be so wrong about football?

1552~~~
A beast at the back again. Did brilliantly to catch up with Vardy near the end.

1553~~~
Ridiculously reassuring. Solid game from him.

1554~~~
I thought he paid Vardy too much respect at points today and there were some needless hoofs clear.

Other then that a pretty as expected Smalling performance.

1555~~~
I don't think even the likes of Douglas Costa and Neymar could take him in a one-on-one. Fantastic player.

1556~~~
He is so much better in his position than our any other outfield player in their position it's embarrasing really. We would be seriously fecked if his injury problems continued this season. Surprisingly, he looks like one of the fittest players in league this season. He actually deserves lot of praise just for being reliable in terms of injuries.

1557~~~
Best defender in the league. Comfortably so, too.

1558~~~
What a man.

1559~~~
Beast. Love the lad to bits.

1560~~~
Shaw is right up there too IMO.

1561~~~
Good performance, not really tested though that much. Has to be one of the best centre backs in the world now.

1562~~~
League - yes. World - no. Doesn't have to be a ball playing CB, but has to be a lot more comfortable on the ball than he is  right now.

1563~~~
Who's better than him? He's in the top 5 in the world for me.

1564~~~
Defenders who have been playing at a high level for longer. Koscielny, Pique, Pepe, Ramos, Thiago Silva, Godin, Bonucci. Kompany at his best is better but Smalling has been the best cb in the league this season. Terry has declined now. He just needs to maintain this level. But he has been quality.

1565~~~
You are basing this on reputation, I'm talking about now. And Smalling has been consistently brilliant for over a year so I think that qualifies him for discussion about this.

1566~~~
Not reputation, performance. These guys have been playing at a high level for longer. None of them have declined and as good as Smalling has been I don't think he has been good for long enough to be mentioned with this group. He's in the next group for me.

1567~~~
Give him the armband.

1568~~~
That beast of defending against schlupp was ridiculous, gif please

1569~~~
Loved that. Effortless.

1570~~~
Absolutely. He's far more vocal these days. Every aspect of top defending he's got.

1571~~~
That was great, and I just expected him to win the battle too. I didn't at all think Smalling would have trouble diffusing the situation.

1572~~~

1573~~~
Don't really feel the need to praise him much anymore.

Have come to simply expect those kind of performances from him.

1574~~~
World class. He's reached the level of 8/10 performances every week. He and de gea are head and shoulders above the rest of the squad.

1575~~~
He's our best player.

Its got to the point where I just expect him to play well every game.

1576~~~
We`d be fecked without him , that`s for sure .

1577~~~
His pace and strength is such a huge asset at the back.

1578~~~
Unlike some other people I still enjoy watching United play every time, the problem is it's about 70% due to Smalling and De Gea.

1579~~~
Pretty solid performance again. Wish we had two of him so he could have covered their counter from the corner.

1580~~~
Vardy is quoted as the fastest player in the league this season, but twice Smalling bettered him chasing the ball. He really is ridiculously fast when he gets going, not sluggish off the mark either, mind you. The way he dealt with Schlupp was also brilliant - looked like a PL defender dispossessing a twelve year old off the ball. 

It's a shame DDG and Smalling has to be our best players match after match.

1581~~~
Defending can be sexy - as can good goalkeeping. Sexy in the way of football-sexy, like football-philosophy, not actual philosophy, right. Felt the need to explain myself there.

1582~~~
Good, solid, expected performance. Same again next week.

1583~~~
Almost boring, isn't it? Consistently good, pff, unheard of. I'm guessing the other players have him and DDG eat at another table.

1584~~~
His anticipation has improved so much. He doesn't need to enter into physical battles anymore because he gets to the ball quicker than most strikers. He reminds me a lot of Ferdinand in that aspect.

1585~~~
I dont see in any way shape or form how Koscielny can be rated higher than smalling in this form right now.

1586~~~
I laughed when i saw the comparison above.

1587~~~
Blind has hardly been putting a foot wrong either. 

Defensively sound and has actually been setting up the occasional goal and some of the few chances we make a game. 

But yeah only really those three performing consistently well.

1588~~~
He's been pretty flawless throughout 2015. At what point do people stop saying this is a good spell of form and admit that he's the best defender in the country?

Can't remember who the Leicester player who yesterday - Schlupp? - but he went one on one against Smalling and was swatted away with minimal fuss and complete authority.

1589~~~
That's was absolutely brilliant, just bullied him out of the way.

1590~~~
Form my a** I say, the dude is class. He's come undone *Robbie Williams*

1591~~~
That's a good question.

1592~~~
Many months ago.

1593~~~
He's good but I won't rate him until the media and THE LADS say we only win games because of him.

1594~~~
Was struck by how much organizing and instructing he was doing for our attacking corners and set pieces. Everyone on our team seemed to be taking their direction from him. Impressive to see.

1595~~~
Were you the originator of Smalling + 1?

1596~~~
Nah, I think that was <a class="username" data-user="69330, @Rozay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69330/">@Rozay</a>. I've been a Chris Smalling stan for many years, though.

1597~~~
Yeah right!!

1598~~~
Yes. The commentator said Vardy must be tired since he didn't go straight at DDG. I'm absolutely certain he checked back because he saw who he was up against and just knew there would be no point trying.

1599~~~
Some say Schlupp is still having nightmares.

1600~~~
I think we should call him Smalldini by now.

1601~~~
Michael fecking Owen couldn't analyse his ass from his nose. If ever there was a commentator who couldn't smell his own bullshit, then that's Michael Owen.

There are plenty of times when Smalling is marshalling the defence. When he's dominating opposition in the air. When he diffuses situations before it even happens. 

Does the system have something to do with how many chances we concede? Sure. But, to take away all the merit that Smalling has achieved this season and put it solely on him playing in a defensive system is ludicrous.

How many attackers have made good pundits? Shearer? Shit. Owen? Shit. Henry? Mostly Shit. Ian Wright? Mostly Shit.

Strikers have never been great analysers of the game. Very few of them can do it well because their involvement in the defensive aspects of a game and the build up and control of a game is minimal. This is why so many defenders and some sensible midfielders understand the game far better. Gary Neville, Carragher, Alan Hansen, Paul Parker, Martin Keown (biased, but he has his points)... let's go into management shall we? Guardiola, Van Gaal, Diego Simeone, Bill Shankly, Bob Paisely, Carlo Ancellotti, Klopp (striker first, then became defender), Arrigo Sacchi, Allegri... the list is endless.

I am not for once saying that strikers haven't made great coaches. Look at Sir Alex and Heynckes are examples that defy that rule. But, they are few and far between.

Much like goalkeepers, strikers are individualistic players whose skills bring less to the team in terms of defence, build-up, hold-up, counters... they rely on midfielders to do work with them. The midfielders see it best and so do the defenders who have to analyse the entirety of the game to understand how best to defend or attack. 

So Michael Owen's comments are par for the course. They're those of a myopic bird brain who can't fully see the game for what it is. Feck off you toad.

1602~~~
So, which is it: bird or toad?

1603~~~
Owen's words are bonkers. It totally undermines all the good that Smalling has done this season. He's made defending look easy. He's won almost every aerial duel, every one on one battle. His recovery pace and his anticipation have been near perfect. He always knows where to be when a ball is taken off the ground. Smalling's short passing to the midfield is only a fraction of what he does on a pitch.

It's bizarre though, because Owen has constantly praised Smalling when co-commentating United games on BT. Then he just retracts it all and reckons his job a piece of piss. Garbage.

1604~~~
Hello.

1605~~~
Haha we should, he has been outstanding this season.

1606~~~
It was you that I was looking for!

1607~~~
He is definitely top 5 in the world. Do any of you guys watch Ramos, Pique, and Kompany so far this season? They suck, and frankly they are going to continue to decline while Smalling is approaching is prime. It is time to stop looking at reputation and actually start paying attention to what you see in games.

1608~~~
It's me...

1609~~~
It  was me actually

1610~~~
Pretty sure it was me.

1611~~~
Toad with a bird's brain.

1612~~~
I've seen Pique and Thiago play this season and I think Smalling has been comfortably better than both so far. But then again I would consider what Smalling is showing to be form rather than his permanent level. A lot of players has a great 6-8 month period in their career and what separates the best players is that they can keep a similar level for years. 

Vardy and Mahrez have been great this season as well and as they aren't our own players I doubt people consider that their average level when judging them. Last season Kane showed some incredible long lasting form as well over a season and that doesn't mean he was all of a sudden one of the best players.

I think Smalling will continue playing at this level and I sure hope so as well as he is so dominant that he has become one of the most entertaining players to watch for United in my eyes.

1614~~~
Smalling Plus One was all me.

1615~~~
Great video. He was brilliant in that Everton game.

1616~~~
Him and Vardy have been the 2 best players in England this season.

1617~~~
Just running our defence by himself at the moment. Absolute beast. Dominated Carroll.

1618~~~
at least we can be proud about some of our players like Chris, hope hes shortilisted for epls best player of the year, he currently is top4 surely with ozil, mahrez/vardy combo in the mix

1619~~~
Just so reliable these days and our best threat on set pieces.

1620~~~
Chris Sm-<b>ALL-IN</b>-g.

1621~~~
Carroll just kept bouncing off him. He is immense.

1622~~~
This thread deserves more posts. Unfortunately he will get more "recognition" if he has a bad day then a good day (like most players here).

He really is a one man defence given the way hes playing. Still think hes needs to work on his distribution and become the extra man in midfield (ala Rio), but in defence, the best in the league.

1623~~~
Standard dominant performance from him, I forgot Carroll was playing at times.

1624~~~
Yup, I've noticed this also. When he goes forward he is one of the few that looks willing and aggressive enough to really go for the ball.

1625~~~
He unsettles the opposition with that aggression, even if he doesn't connect with the ball we tend to get a shot off in the scramble he creates.

1626~~~
No doubt Blind will get all the blame but Smalling has been all over the place, fecking shite. I guess we do need two defensive midfielders.

1627~~~
Been dreadful. Needs to get his shit together.

1628~~~
That equalizer was avoidable. Easily. How can you concede via a free kick from there?

1629~~~
I'm not really sure what's happened. He's all over the shop tonight.

1630~~~
Bad time to be having his worst performance of the season.

1631~~~
Came to post exactly this. Could not have chosen a worse day to have an off day.

1632~~~
very poor tonight.

1633~~~
Worst game of the season for him and he couldn't have timed it worse.

1634~~~
I don't think it's so much of an offday as it is a game in which he hasn't been offered enough cover by the midfield. A crap defender can look very good with the right cover and a great one can look poor with no cover. Smalling has done very well this season, but he was also helped by better cover.

1635~~~
It was never a case of Smalling relying on cover, though. He's had fantastic individual performances all season. It's just a pretty bad off day tonight.

1636~~~
Lack of cover will keep you exposed, force you to make more big decisions and will inevitably lead to mistakes. I'm not taking anything away from his performances this season, just saying this is the like of a defender.

1637~~~
Probably injured now

1638~~~
Feck.

1639~~~
Christ, we won't have a defence soon.

1640~~~
feck sake. fecking feck sake.

1641~~~
Probably means Phil Jones will be back now.. Can't be having them both fit at the same time.

Just hope we're not doing more damage by leaving him on.

1642~~~
We've chucked him back on, no doubt this will exacerbate the issue.

1643~~~
I would rather play with 10 men to prevent further damage,

1644~~~
I am sitting here in a rage as I can see extra weeks of injury being added as the minutes go by.

We will need de Gea to be god like again.

1645~~~
Should have been taken off, if he is out for any length of time we have huge problems.

1646~~~
Very poor performance. He struggled to cope with Wolfsburg's impressive attacking play, and looked a bit flustered.

1647~~~
We need Smalling fitness news <b>URGENTLY</b>.

1648~~~
So stupid putting here back out there when he was clearly injured. Better to just cut your losses at that stage. Even more ridiculous when he was till on near the end after it was clearly all over.

1649~~~
Not his best night but all I care about is an injury update, I am surprised LvG got him to back on to try and salvage something we threw away two weeks ago, he's usually ultra cautious with injuries.

1650~~~
Superb season to date but a shocking performance tonight. At fault for their first goal. Several errors that weren't punished. Could have scored near the end.

1651~~~
He wasn't <i>that </i>bad tonight - more a consequence of the incredible level we are now used to.

1652~~~
Nah, it was a really poor game. He looked a bit all over the place and seemed very flustered with some of their more dangerous attacks. Not as bad in the 2nd half as the 1st half, though.

1653~~~
He was very bad, couldn't get a hold of either of their forwards. Of course, it would help having a proper CB next to him on tough nights like these who can help him out a bit.

1654~~~
He's been our best player by a mile this season but He was poor tonight. 

There have been many claiming he's one of the worlds best but I've said previously to make claims like that he needs to perform on the big stage, and he didn't tonight.

If he's out for the Xmas periods we are in trouble

1655~~~
Had a bit of a nightmare tonight it has to be said, can easily be forgiven after the season he's had though.

1656~~~
He was wank today, still I'm worried about this injury. Him playing on could have fecked him up.

1657~~~
First poor performance of the season. Just didn't seem have the control that he normally imposes over opposition players. Looked a tad confused with his positioning. Shame for it to happen in such a big game.

1658~~~
Yeah, I'd agree with this. The way we approached the game today was probably a bit foreign to what he's been used to this season.

1659~~~
Such a shame that he gets more posts in his thread when he has a bad / off day compared to the one or two posts (seemingly in comparison) when he tends to, more often than not, have a good game.

I think he was exposed badly.

1660~~~
Groin injury, doubt for Bournemouth.

1661~~~
We might be able to get away with Bournemouth (A) and Norwich (H) without him.

Will need him back for Xmas.

1662~~~
Poor game. Just a bad night made worse with the injury too. 

Not really sure what happened tonight. He just seemed to lack composure and concentration. Maybe the pressure got to him? Or maybe it is the constant changes around him in the defence? Either way it is a shame to lose him. Hopefully the performance was a one off.

1663~~~
His worst game this season IMO. Gutted he's injured though.

1664~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wx9UAiOp1ww?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1665~~~
he's played every minute this season.

With history of injuries, including last season, thats beyond careless.

1666~~~
He needed this injury to get some rest.

1667~~~
He needed a rest with the Christmas schedule coming up. Had a poor night last night unfortunately, but he'll back.

1668~~~
This gets better and better.

1669~~~
I dont blame him, Wolfsburg played with pace and at times Barcelona-esque stuff. Their 2nd goal was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1670~~~
Groin injuries are usually 3 weeks

1671~~~
Should have dealt with the first goal though as should Carrick have done better on the third. Second was a lovely goal I agree. Those are special goals that can beat any defence.

1672~~~
Unfortunately for him he was really exposed yesterday. Blind was poor on the battle yesterday, Darmian wasn't good, and Bastian left the defensive side. Wolfsburg throught their diagonals founds huge spaces in our defense.

1673~~~
Hopefully he isn't rushed back if we are struggling because then he will continue to break down and the cycle will just repeat.

1674~~~
I didn't think he was very good last night but I don't think he was anywhere near as poor as some are suggesting.  Wolsburg's first goal was an incredible finish.  The forward got barely half a yard on Smalling and volleyed it right into the corner... an incredibly difficult skill for a ball coming in from that angle.  Whilst it may be admirable to find defensive fault with every goal you concede, sometimes I think you should just hold your hands up and say, 'well... that was fantastic play, really difficult to defend against'.

I can understand him wanting to stay on as well at the end even though he was injured.  It just showed how desperate he was to win the match.  I just hope we aren't without him for too long.

1675~~~
Paddy would have to step up now.

1676~~~
I think Rio said something similar to this statement on BT Sport during half time, which I agree with. Their first two goals were fantastic and any defender would find it difficult to stop them going in.

1677~~~
this is how people exaggerate, how was he shocking? this comments is intended to sound shocking. because there is nothing between superb and shocking  like decent, okay etc.. he was okay, he is partially at fault for the goal but the non existent midfield and the fact that fellaini cant head the ball cost us the game..

its like the game against arsenal, smalling was decent that game, the only defender who showed up that game but despite that people called him shocking because they looked at the overall performance of the team, thats shocking, we are in the thread of Chris Smalling performances ffs.

hope he`s not injured for long

1678~~~
He was poor yesterday. Got caught out several times and was directly at fault for their first goal. He just had a bad day at the office. No shame in that as it happens to the best.

1679~~~
He was shit last night. One of our worst players, if not the worst.

It happens to everyone, shame it had to be in this game, but he's been fantastic until now and nobody is perfect.

1680~~~
He's progressed a lot but last night showed that he's not quite at the level people think he is yet. I still think he needs a more experienced defender next to him which would help him to reach the next level.

1681~~~
He wasn't great last night, but the whole defence was isolated by having little to no defensive midfield presence. Fellaini launched down the wings and Schweinsteiger was trying to get forward as he normally does. Varela especially was in no mans land with no protection from the midfield.

Schneiderlin has been as equally important to us as Smalling has. The job he does often slips under the radar. We've missed him in ou two toughest games this season and been walked through.

The amount of home games we've played against relegation fodder with two sitting midfielders, then the one game we don't do that and go more attacking, it is against one of the toughest opponents we've faced this season, away from home, in a must win CL game. It's bizarre.

1682~~~
No Christmas miracle...

1683~~~
I wonder how much worse the injury was made by making him carry on.

1684~~~
We'll probably rush him back over Christmas with all the fixtures.

1685~~~
Definitely. And he'll keep getting injured.

We missed him against Bournemouth. Blind looked way less solid than he does next to Smalling.

1686~~~
Huge miss today, the vocal organizer and easily our best pure defender.

1687~~~
Average today and never looks as comfortable on the ball when asked to play as the LCB.

1688~~~
His technique and passing continues to frustrate me, in modern football defenders have to be part of the attack.
He has some good runs up field though, but still.

1689~~~
Was at fault for the second goal tonight. Played the final man onside and given his speed he could easily have covered the ground to make the tackle. Felt like he wasn't fully fit at all.

1690~~~
His speed is the key word here. He was easily outpaced by Jerome today, and that would never happen under normal circumstances. If LVG is playing him whilst still not fit that is (another) cause for concern. He was poor for his standards today, but better than Jones.

I don't quite get why LVG has to be so bloody smart all the time; Smalling plays well on the RCB position, move him to the LCB position. Martial plays well on the left and as a 9, move him to the right. It's frustrating as hell and quite disconcerting going forwards, schizophrenic almost.

1691~~~
He looked nowhere near fit today to me, didn't even try to challenge for either goal, that was nothing like him.

1692~~~
The first goal: He would have won the run against Jerome (though Jerome is fast and strong), and if, a big if, he hadn't, he would have busted his ass getting back and slide in before the shot. His running style was just off today and he wasn't fit - simple as.

1693~~~
Didn't look match fit, and alongside De Gea and a couple other players - didn't look fully arsed.

1694~~~
He looked a shadow of what we've seen for most of the season.

1695~~~
Definitely didn't look fully fit to me. Or he was but he was distracted about possibly getting injured again. Just looked slow (to react and his overall pace) and made the wrong decisions.

1696~~~
Never look as comfortable on the ball or in the channel when playing as the LCB.

1697~~~
Nope, and everyone can see that bar LVG - make room for Jones, he must.

1698~~~
Why was he swapped with Jones ?

1699~~~
Because Jones has a receding hairline and Smalling does not? I can't think of a better reason.

1700~~~
For a guy who obsessed as much as he does about the left footed CB thing it's amazing he's so oblivious to the fact that this happens every time Chris goes to the left. We could have just played Jones at RB and Young at LB if he didn't fancy using Varela.

My guess is because Jones struggles positionally even when playing on his natural side.

1701~~~
You know you are right here, but few would have known that Jones would be as shocking as he has been the last couple of matches.

1702~~~
Jones doesn't look natural anywhere.

1703~~~
What I dont understand is he went into the season with Smalling and Blind, and tbf, they forged a good partnership. Why did he break it? Injuries happened but its not like this has worked, why not keep your spine the same and just have people who are natural the position (but young) there? I thought that was the point of having a small squad, to promote youth in positions where needed (not put people out of position). I also dont think Jones is fully fit and looks to have been rushed back.

1704~~~
Smalling is our best defender, and arguably best outfield player, playing as the RCB. Jones comes in and van Gaal then moves Smalling to the LCB (where his weakness on the ball is exacerbated). Why?

1705~~~
Because Van Gaal is a massive fecking idiot.

1706~~~
Jones's positioning is awful and Van Gaal just played him in his natural role. He has a horrible tendency to drift too far right (and to go on aimless charges forward for a ball he can't win). Simple as that. Also it is nice to note that having a good/natural left footer at left centre back is important, as people didn't believe that before...

1707~~~
Back at his best today, no coincidence that he was also back at RCB.

1708~~~
Wouldn't say he was back to his best but he has certainly looked worse.

1709~~~
Positive fecker, aren't you?

1710~~~
I try.

1711~~~
He looks a bit disinterested in the last couple of games. Over/underestimating things (flight of ball, pace of an attacker...) due to overconfidence, pushing up to high to win the ball quickly etc... I don't think he has been as focused as he normally is. I don't think he's been bad, but at his best he is absolutely fantastic, and like <a class="username" data-user="80030, @ADJUDICATOR" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80030/">@ADJUDICATOR</a> said he does look a little far from that.

1712~~~
He started poorly I thought. But the 2nd half he was certainly back to his best.

1713~~~
He looks half the player since the switch to LCB. He was much more dominant on the right.

1714~~~
I honestly think he should be playing every game with Blind and that shouldnt change at all (id rather our fullbacks swap). all this changing is not helping him or the team.

1715~~~
He should be our main defender again and play on the right hand side. Don't like this switching all the time

1716~~~
I thought he did well considering the constant reshuffling LvG did with the back 4 today.

1717~~~
His form has dipped recently. Not sure the move to LCB has helped him, and the constant change of partner too.

1718~~~
Nothing wrong with a dip in form. Has been fantastic this season. Wouldn't even call it that much of a dip in form, just hasn't been as great as some games have asked him to be.

1719~~~
Our new Pele <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1720~~~
that alone got him another three months in charge, that's a real shame it's not working on the pitch as well, moments like this makes me like Van Gaal again but then comes weekend and we play fellaini - sweinsteigger in midfield and lose to norwich at home etc..

1721~~~
Took care of Sheffield's 2 agricultural forwards and tried to drive the team up the pitch, the real Captain.

1722~~~
Yeah I thought he was great today. Sheffield didn't have much threat up front but when he needed to step up he did so. 

That one chance he fluffed up though, bloody hell.

1723~~~
Yup. He was one of the better players today.

1724~~~
Easily the best player on the pitch today.

1725~~~
Wish we could merge Blinds passing into him.

Just a beast at the back, he honestly plays so much better on the right and when paired with Blind.

1726~~~
The Norwegian commentator got excited at one point simply because Billy Sharp received the ball with Blind on him and not Smalling.

1727~~~
Remember that one. Also laughed when one of them tried to run past him.

1728~~~
My MOTM. Imperious.

1729~~~
Piss easy game for Smalling, and came out with MOTM by a country mile.

It was helped by Sheffield United having a terrible attacking game-plan and literally playing to all his strengths... which I'm sure was great fun for Big Mike.

1730~~~
Sure, easy game against not exactly the greatest forwards in the world, but the way he wins 1-on-1s (either on the ground for pace or physical ones where the forward tries to hold the ball up) is amazing. Every time I think "that's annoying, good pass into their forward and they'll be able to keep possession this time" up steps Mike and we're on the ball again a second later. Beast.

1731~~~
Horrible today.

1732~~~
Bad game for him but considering he's been one of our best this season he can be forgiven. Just hope this is a one off

1733~~~
Truly poor. He's human after all.

1734~~~
Gets away with murder on here. He's been pitiful since the Wolfsburg game. I guess they all have though.

1735~~~
Was he that bad today?

First goal: Was correct in his initial position, was correct to close the space on Wijnaldum, got beaten by an unpredictable turn of pace
Penalty: Got penalised for something defenders do (to him) week-in week-out with no punishment.

Not his best game but didn't do loads wrong in my opinion.

1736~~~
I don't think he's put in a decent performance for a good month or two myself. No idea why he was all over Mitrovic today, he's shite.

1737~~~
Was at fault for every single goal we conceded today.  Had a rubbish evening

1738~~~
He's decent, but has no intelligence. Thick as pigshit. Always a mistake him.

1739~~~
Terrible from Chris... he seemed to want to win every single ball himself today, which led him to be out of position/doing the wrong thing quite often.

1740~~~
He's been great this season but had a disaster today. Bad day to have his worst game.

1741~~~
Horrendous today. His performances have definitely dipped recently.

At first I was fine with our CBs but now we need another, badly.

1742~~~
Other than contributing to every one of their goals (3)?

1743~~~
An evening to forget for Mike tonight.

1744~~~
Terrible performance. Also another reason why we struggle to play an expansive game. Either our defenders aren't good enough or we are poor transitioning into defence. Smalling needs an experienced head beside him when we are playing on the front foot.

1745~~~
He was involved in all 3 goals scored against us. Last one was harsh though.

1746~~~
His positioning was all over the shop today. Lost Wijnaldum twice in the same position and let him get behind him. DDG bailed him out the first time but he got punished the second time.

1747~~~
Very poor. He's worryingly suspect when we're up against it at the back.

1748~~~
Weird game from him, moments where he looked his usual strong self, and others where he was in full clod mode.

1749~~~
If i had to cover Blind all season, i would go to a mental hospital. This being said, he has had much better games.

1750~~~
Well I've already given my view on two of them. To criticise him for the third is very silly.

1751~~~
Like watching Phil Jones in a Chris Smalling costume.

1752~~~
Exposed in an open game. Like any centre back with two defensive midfielders sitting in front of them they have an easier job and look better.

1753~~~
Had a complete meltdown.

1754~~~
He cost us the game today.

1755~~~
Spot on.

Someone send the search party for the real Chris Smalling before Sunday please!!!

1756~~~
He was due a poor game. He's barely put a foot wrong in over year. Poor from him, but not really too concerned. It was such a scruffy game. No discipline from either side. The game never settled down. It was as if neither team were playing any sort of formation.

1757~~~
How about those who have to play with a midfielder pretending to be a CB, who's also extremely unathletic and incapable of winning anything about aerially? How many of them look good?

1758~~~
He has always been very fortunate with some of his shirt pulling on set pieces. Now he got the short end of the stick. Actually thought he was being ripped down with force but brainlessly he also couldn't let go of Mitrovic's shirt. So he left the ref with a decision to make.
Away from home, having already gotten a penalty, you have to be clever the home team will press for every decision.

1759~~~
He's been doing it far too much recently, I'm sure I pointed this out a while back; over/underestimating things (flight of ball, pace of an attacker...) due to overconfidence, pushing up to high to win the ball quickly etc... I don't think he has been as focused as he normally is. Physically he can dominate most forwards and his pace gets him out of trouble a lot but he's relying on that sort of style too much recently. It's more Ramos in his brainless stage (near enough most games) and Kompany (in his mare season) than other defenders with great pace and strength like Boateng at the minute.

1760~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1761~~~
I agree.

1762~~~
Thought Blind was pretty good actually and has been all season. Handled Mitrovic far better than Smalling did.

1763~~~
I guess we'll allow him the odd bad game considering his average performances this season. The lack of cover he seemed to be offered by the midfield 2 today seemed to cause him a world of problems. 

It does makes you wonder how many of his impressive performances have been him, and how much has been LVGs solid defensive set up.

1764~~~
Oh yeah, he's been the one holding our defense together all season, while it was clearly Smalling who needed the protection from midfield to look good <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1765~~~
I think he hasn't been the same since the Watford game. feck knows what's happened to be honest.

1766~~~
Happens with all centre backs in those types of systems. Look at Mourinho's Chelsea or Inter or the current Athletico Madrid I agree though if we play like that Jones is a better partner than Blind.

1767~~~
To be fair to him... if he was surrounded by other people who could actually defend, he probably wouldn't feel the need to have to win every ball by himself all the time

1768~~~
Just get him a proper partner, so he doesn't have to be in stupidly good form for us to have a hope of a clean sheet. His form has suffered since the Watford game and we've kept 4 cleansheets since then. 2 of them against a dreadful Chelsea team and one against a league 1 team. 

I'm sure he'll eventually get back to form, because he's far too good not to but we're far too reliant on him individually.

1769~~~
Has dipped lately, but it happens.

I think he could do with a rest. I don't think the midfield today did him any favors either.

1770~~~
He's had a great season, whilst not perfect it's undoubtedly been very good. Tonight was a horror show though, at fault for the first 2 goals and never looked comfortable. Hoping it's a flash in the plan and he's back on it by the weekend!

1771~~~
Smalling was carrying Blind at the beginning of the season, but since November, Blind has been comfortably the better of two.

1772~~~
Blind's often been the more suspect of the two, but I thought he was mostly fine tonight. Smalling was easily the bigger liability.

1773~~~
Been quiet good for most of the season, bad tonight though.

1774~~~
His poorest game of the season tonight, but he's allowed an off day.

The so called defensive midfielders ahead of him were about as useful as chocolate teapots. They did nothing to protect him.

1775~~~
Nah, Blind is not good at actually defending. Most of his good defending comes as a result of him making up for some shit defending he's done moments before it.

There's a reason Smalling is now running around like a crazy person trying to do all the defending himself... because the blokes who are around him aren't very good at it.

1776~~~
Needing protection certainly had nothing to do with conceding that penalty though, and his arguably being out of position for their first certainly wasn't the midfielders fault. Hell, it was even Fellaini who covered him!

1777~~~
I don't think the lack of cover in front of him is that much of a problem, physically he can compensate with anything in front of him. 

The problem is he has defensive liabilities literally left right and centre. Right/left back, central defensive partner AND a non existent midfield. Watch how eager/assertive he is to cover space ACROSS the penalty box whenever opposition players pass our full backs on the inside or outside. It'll take experience and a solid partner to help him overcome that.

Of course things it's ridiculous to expect everything laid out on a plate for him but I think he absolutely deserves praise for his performances and deserves every chance to continue being a stalwart for us.

1778~~~
They haven't been good enough all season, but his run of form from the start of the season was unbelievably good. It was probably just foolish expecting him to be able to continue in the same vein for the entire season, without a noticeable blip.

If he had a competent partner who's able to step up, it would've just gone through this run without being noticed.

1779~~~
True I guess, our midfield was just porous in general throughout!

1780~~~
True, that certainly didn't help. Schneiderlin was anonymous, and Fellaini's always poor positionally.

The thing is, Blind is quite good at defending. Since when we applaud defenders trying to do all things by themselves, isn't that considered bad (Phil Jones)?

Not that stats tell everything, but I looked at it and well: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2015/2016/daley_blind/165/165/7674/0/p|premier_league/2015/2016/chris_smalling/165/165/584/0/p#tackles_won/successful_take_ons_%/aerial_duels_won_%/aerial_duels_won/fouls_committed/interceptions/blocks/clearances/total_passes/successful_passes/total_score/attack_score/defence_score/possession_score#total" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...ck_score/defence_score/possession_score#total</a>

Blind is better at tackling and not making fouls while being quite better at posession/attacking score. Smalling is better in the air, interceptions and clearances. Blind is better in any attacking/posession attribute and in total ranking (whatever it means) is comfortably the better player. Forget about the last thing though (total score), but the other points stand.

I think that Smalling was brilliant at the beginning of the season, but for the last two months or so, Blind has been quite better than him. Which is kind of surprising, with our defense getting less protection, I would have thought that it would have been the other way around.

Anyway, he has been here almost Welbeck-overrated, so he might play every day like this and Blind can be Baresi, and people will still claim that he is carrying Blind. For whatever reasons, a lot of people got this idea that Blind can't defend despite that he has been doing a solid job here and at the very worst case, is our second best central defender.

1782~~~
Blind never taken responsibilty from smalling, chris just hasnt been as dominant as before past coupe of games, Blind makes two reasonable errors per game, how can anyone claim that he's been better, this game also people will talk about smalling but Blind made another two big mistakes which people didnt even notice as they only see big man

1783~~~
Smalling's mistakes were ultimately the ones that cost us goals though, so he's always going to come in for more criticism due to that.

1784~~~
Any CB playing behind Fellaini in midfield will struggle..  Had a bad game tonight but so did many others..

1785~~~
and for today's game I agree with you but it would be quite a nonsense to claim that blind has been better in recent weeks as he certainly hasn't

1786~~~
He does this quite a lot to be honest, going to the edge in the penalty area, especially at corners. He always grabs the opponents shirt. Honestly, I'm quite surprised that we haven't conceded a penalty earlier in the season because of it, always thought it was just the english game or the referees let him pass due to domestic bias.

1787~~~
Blind is good at defending the way any defensive midfield of his mold is good at defending. In that, he does roughly the same job that a 25 yr old Carrick would do at centre back. He can make a tackle when and where he needs, will do a good job at reading the play and will obviously be excellent in possession.

BUT because he isn't a centre-back (and he really isn't a centre-back) then he will constantly struggle with defending that is suited to a natural centre-back. Matching players runs, intercepting the ball, staying with your man, heading and - the main one - positioning. Blind often finds himself in the wrong position when defending, quite simply because he's not a centre back.

Example, there was a point against Sheffield United where there striker had the ball with his feet, was running down the wing, and Blind manged to get himself in-between him and the ball to push him off the ball and effectively regain possession. Thing is, the only reason their player had the ball at his feet and was running down the wing in the first place was because Blind got caught the wrong side of him, so attempted to win the ball before him and completely ballsed it up.

Another example... late(ish) in the second half, Blind again did well to get the right side of Mitrovic and win the ball back from him when he had the ball in a dangerous position. The reason he had the ball in a dangerous position? A high ball was dropping down and Blind completely spooned his clearance, giving it straight to Mitrovic.

It's little things like that with Blind. He will generally be okay/good in most defensive moments... but because he isn't a centre back, a lot of the time he'll find himself in the wrong place or doing the wrong thing - and when we find ourselves under the cosh/pressure, and the amount of defending back there that he has to do increases, the more he struggles and the quicker he gets found out.

1788~~~
The issue today was Blind was a 4/10 performance the entire game, Smalling was 7/10 for 93 minutes and 30 seconds and a 1/10 the other 30 seconds. When you feck up that badly you're going to concede.

 Thankfully it's a very rare occurrence nowadays, it's just frustrating.

1789~~~
That penalty was pure and utter stupidity, and was 100% Smalling's fault. If Blind had done it people on here would be a lot less forgiving.

1790~~~
Next time we should get Blind to mark the 6'3 striker. We'll see how it goes...

1791~~~
I don't agree. I think that Blind is really good at defending. For example tackling that you mentioned. He has more tackles in less minutes than Smalling, while also having a better percentage of successful tackles. So that isn't just 'he can make a tackle', but it is 'good at tackling'.

Being excellent in possession is extremely important for CBs in modern football. Actually, look at any top CB nowadays and you'll find that they are great at possession. It is becoming as important as being great at defending.

Mascherano isn't a CB, but has been one of the best in the world in that position for the last 4 seasons or so.

Example, there was a point against Sheffield United where there striker had the ball with his feet, was running down the wing, and Blind manged to get himself in-between him and the ball to push him off the ball and effectively regain possession. Thing is, the only reason their player had the ball at his feet and was running down the wing in the first place was because Blind got caught the wrong side of him, so attempted to win the ball before him and completely ballsed it up.

And yet - in my opinion, you don't have to agree - Smalling has been struggling more than him in the last two months (it was completely different in the beginning of the season). There is something wrong here. Either Smalling isn't that great, or Blind isn't that bad. Or both are decent with neither being great (which in my opinion is the closest to the truth). In my opinion, Smalling has some mistakes in him while having a shit technique, Blind has a great technique but lacks physical attributes. They are doing an alright job, but either of them is far from a top player. And in my opinion, during the course of the entire season they have been around the same level.

Saying that, I never got the Smalling hype (similarly how I never got the Welbeck hype when he was the new Henry), and found ridiculous how people thought that he is the best in the league/world class defender after like 5 great performances. I think that he is a very good player and maybe can become the best in the league, but still many aspects of his game needs to be polished to be considered a top defender.

1792~~~
Horrendous today. Hopefully all the praise he's been getting hasn't went to his head because he's been poor last two months.

1793~~~
He had to put in his worst performance of the season tonight just when we needed him most. Such a shame because he's been brilliant for us this season.

1794~~~
The cleverly won penalty aside where he was pulled onto Mitrovic by the neck and shirt like like two wrestlers in love, there were times when I was wondering what the hell he was doing.  

I'll chalk it up to mental fatigue from the festive period.

1795~~~
Poor for the last two months?

1796~~~
A lot of refs will stop play and sort it out before allowing the corner to be taken. From what I saw, Dean could just as easily given us a free kick instead of awarding them a penalty.

1797~~~
What is this shit? Red Cafe is the worst place to be straight after a loss.

Anyway, really really bad performance. His form has definitely dropped but I am not sure when it happned. I've only started to notice it after he picked up the groin strain. He's trying to do too much and it is backfiring. The penalty was brainless. They were both pulling and holding but Smalling was more obvious and probably doing the worst of it. Terrible game and he needs to pick it up again ASAP.

1798~~~
Looked like he was fatigued. Still not a good excuse for that performance. He hasn't been at his best recently, but I do think he's having good games with bad spells, as opposed to being flat out terrible. He's not in his early season form, but he's played 31 games this season. Last season, he played 29 games in total. And the season before that, he played in 38 games.

1799~~~
Had an absolute stinker.

1800~~~
He could have got sent off today the way he handled mitrovic. He wasn't thinking straight. It wasn't the rock solid smalling today. It's the way he was committing fouls. Already on a tellies card and he was literally wrestling with mitrovic in the last minutes. That's insane.

But as i said in another thread, if anyone can be cut some slack it's smalling

1801~~~
I think his overall performance wasn't helped by the midfield in front of him. 

He took on too much responsibility for the first goal and stepped into midfield to try and neutralise the threat of Wijnaldum but was punished for it. 

He also seems to be finding himself further up the pitch every game trying to start attacks off for us. I like that he's trying to help but it clearly isn't his natural game and he should stick to what he's good at.

The Mitrovic thing was just completely daft though, can't excuse that. Hopefully he learns from it.

1802~~~
Was uncharacteristically poor yesterday, deserves the benefit of the doubt as he's been one of our best players this season.

1803~~~
He's shit, Memphis is shit, De Gea's shit for letting 3 goals in, everyone's shit, let's buy a new team every season or why not pick a new team to get behind....Jesus...fs

1804~~~
Been poor for the last 3 weeks now. I just hope that the good form he showed wasn't just a false dawn.

1805~~~
He needs a natural CB to partner him, Jones are Rojo are unreliable and it's looking like it was a mistake not to bring one in last summer. Blind isn't the long term answer there and I'd actually like to see him again in midfield.

1806~~~
Literally nobody in this thread has said he's shit because of yesterdays performance though...

People should be allowed to say our players have had a crap game when they have crap games though... otherwise, whats the point?

1807~~~
He's looked a little shaky since that injury in the CL game. I wonder has he been carrying a knock.

1808~~~
What's this BS with blind being better of the 2, I don't get it, does Smalling need Fellaini to do his defending too?
What people need to understand is Smalling will never be at his best until we get a proper CB next to him so until then he will look like he's having defensive lapses. There was nothing wrong with him stepping out yesterday for the first goal, he has every right to if he feels that's the right thing to do, his partner should be able to cover him but he's not able to, not in the way he does for them. For example if we were to take Rio and Vidics partnership in the same scenario, Smalling being Rio and Blind being Vidic, even if "Rio" did step out do you think for a second that the ball would reach Mitrovic? Hell no, "Vidic" would have headed the ball, Mitrovic and Fellaini to the half way line, that's the problem here, he needs quality next to him. It's frustrating to see him gets so much shite over 1 performance, he's been 1 of our best player this season. I guess its the usual jumping on the bandwagon as posters do after every game.
The second goal was never a penalty, that happens at every corner in the league, Mitrovic made a right meal of it and the deflection was just unlucky, on another day it would have been classed as a block.

1809~~~
Very uncharacteristically poor game from him yesterday, real shame as we were finally good upfront. He's been solid for about a year or more now, every player has an off game now and again. Sometimes it can be hidden somewhat thanks to the other defenders (who were also poor last night) or midfield (which was non existent), but yesterday it was cruelly exposed. He'll bounce back with no problem though.

1810~~~
Absolutely awful. Cost us two points through carelessness, stupidity and a lack of conviction respectively on the 3 goals conceded.

To be fair to him, he's had a brilliant season so far, it's just a shame that he made so many mistakes all in one game today.

1811~~~
Yeah every top defender will have bad moments. But he has to make sure his bad games don't involve a mistake each on three goals.

1812~~~
I think its very harsh blaming him for their first. He's basically doing Fellaini's job because he's decided to drop into centre back for some reason, even then we don't concede if A) Fellaini manages to head the ball like a normal human being or B) Blind realises that Fellaini has gone for the ball and doesn't go for it as well. He deserves a bit of blame for losing Wijnaldum too easily, but I really wouldn't pile in on Smalling first.

I'm not really sure he did a huge amount wrong for the third, either.

1813~~~
Poor game today but it was Wijnaldum that caused him the most problems with his movement. He handled Mitrovic very comfortably apart from the penalty brain snap. Those blaming him for the 3rd goal . . . . .

Bad games happen. He's still had a great season and is easily the best defender at the club.

1814~~~
Fellaini decided to drop back into centre back to provide some cover because Smalling wasn't there. I wouldn't give him too much blame for the goal admittedly, because it was very well worked by Newcastle.

1815~~~
Playing next to a midfielder pretending to be a defender, winger, and a questionable defender in Darmian as his defensive colleagues, and a midfield in front of that terrible defensively and hadn't any control of the game, he was always going to be exposed, even Vidic wouldn't be able to defend in that kind of environment. He was poor, I am not denying it, but blaming him for all three goals is ridiculous, he can't be one man defence in every game he plays. 

He was at blame for the first goal, but we are talking about a situation in which Fellaini and Blind can't win a header together against one Newcastle player. Smalling covering was poor though, no doubt about it, but with decent defender around him who wins that header that would have never been a goal. The penalty situation is harsh, foul on him was more evident than the one he made, poor refereeing. As for the third goals I have no idea how he could be blamed for that, he won a header and Schneiderlin and Young(where is everyone else) were really poor to react to block the shot, blaming him because the ball deflected off his arm is harsh.

Anyway, poor game, but doesn't deserve more criticism than anyone else around him keeping the defence.

1816~~~
He left the guy who scored unmarked when he was right infront of him making a run into the heart of the box, didn't he? I'll have to see replays but when you're not marking anyone and you can see the opposition team's best player bombing into the box for a knock-down and you're closest to him, you have to track the run.

The third goal, again, I should see the replay, but his header seemed so weak. He needs to win those. He's our main physical defender and needs to be our Terry/Vidic in the box rather than our Blind/Mascherano.

1817~~~
I don't think he left him unmarked, I think Wijanldum just sprinted away from him. I'm not sure he even made a mistake, he reacted quickly to the turn and ran after him immediately but simply wasn't as quick over that distance. Even then we don't concede if Fellaini does absolutely anything else than knock the ball down perfectly.

As for the third, I think he gets as much on the header as he physically can. He's under an awful lot of pressure and the balls in an awkward position. I think the main reason we concede that is because Young doesn't react and just watches the ball go to Dummett. In comparison Schneiderlin comes closer to blocking it despite starting further away.

Second one I have no defence for him, I think it was incredibly harsh that he got penalised the second Mitrovic put his hands around Smalling's neck and choke slammed him, but if you're going to start the wresting match like Smalling did then I guess its your own fault if you get punished for what happens during it.

1818~~~
Cheers. I'll have a look at that in a bit as I'm just presently reacting after watching the game.

1819~~~
Fellaini <i>did </i>win the header though. It fell straight to a Newcastle player who Smalling was struggling to keep up with. Again, I won't give him too much blame since it was a genuinely well worked goal, but I think there's a danger that we're arguably trying to excuse for Smalling's mistakes/poor performances by trying to highlight those around him. Yeah, he's probably not got the best defence, but that was often the case last season when our defence was probably our weakpoint, and it's not as if it's suddenly changed in recent weeks. Smalling isn't helped by who he has around him, but he still had a poor game, and that's on him.

1820~~~
Smalling has been brilliant this season but he was way below par last night. Not surprising, though, when you consider that he has been holding our defence together single-handedly for the majority of our season. That in itself is some feat, particularly when you take into account our excellent defensive record.

He desperately needs a proper centre-back partner to share some of the burden. Blind is filling in but clearly isn't a long-term solution. There's no certainty Jones is going to step up to the plate. Rojo still has plenty to prove.

Going forward, Shaw - ? - Smalling - Darmian, could be a very good back line and Smalling would lead it well, but that question mark is a big hole.

1821~~~
I am not sure that counts as successful header except in stats. If you asked Wijnaldum what kind of header he expected from Mitrovic I am sure he would say he wouldn't have asked for better than he got from Fellaini. 
Also, what was the point of Blind then if Fellaini was there to challenge for a header? I am really not sure what is the point of Blind in many defensive situations tbf, quite often he makes more mess than he is actually being helpful. 

Btw, as I said, Smalling is most at fault for that goal, I am not saying I am not blaming him, just saying that mistake would never happened if we had defender around him who is actually decent defender and can win a simple header. If he is asked to do more job than any defender is expected to do, of course he is going to make mistakes, that's why I am highlighting those around him.

1822~~~
I'm not saying it was a successful header or anything, but even if you've got a taller centre back than Blind to win the header, then it's still probably going to a Newcastle attacker. Smalling's still caught mildly out of position for that one, and I don't see what having a better defender beside him had to do with it. Same with the penalty, unless Blind temporarily possessed him.

1823~~~
I actually thought this was probably the worst bit of defending from Smalling last night:

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x3m3jcm?width=500&amp;hideInfos=1" width="500"></iframe>

It's as if he doesn't trust Young to be able to defend against Sissoko himself, so instead of backing him up, tries to read what Sissoko will do and intercept himself - when really he should leave it to Young and be behind him if Sissoko rounds him.

Goes back to the idea that Smalling is either a)trying too hard to do everything himself or b) doesn't trust the defenders around him to do a job because they're not natural defenders.

1824~~~
Well I doubt that, we are not talking about defending against Crouch here, and even if it's Crouch, the defender still has to do his best to at least disrupt him from bringing down the ball perfectly.

1825~~~
The height of the player has nothing to do with it. The reason the attacker had any space whatsoever was because Smalling was out of position. That's why Fellaini came back, and why he had to bother making the header at all. Again, an excusable mistake for a well worked goal, but I'm not sure what having a better defender has to do with it.

1826~~~
Blind was on Mitrovic in that situation, Smalling isn't supposed to mark Mitrovic wherever he goes because Mitrovic was on Blind's left side in that situation. How exactly is Smalling supposed to defend left side of the defence too?

Smalling should have just kept his space, he shouldn't be coming out for Wijnaldum, that was his mistake, Fellaini coming to help Blind winning the header against Mitrovic has nothing to do with Smalling. The problem is that we are expecting our tall players to babysit Blind and challenge for duels he alone should be challenging for alone.

1827~~~
Watch the highlight package I posted above. Thats not what happened. Fellaini drops back onto the Newcastle defender, as a result of that Smalling pushes up onto Wijnaldum in order for him not to be able to receive the ball under no pressure whatsoever. It's only after Fellaini drops deeper that Smalling pushes up.

1828~~~
He should study some footage of Rio, who knew exactly what he could and could not get away with in terms of free kicks and cards.

1829~~~
That's just childish.

People can criticize players without wanting them sold.

1830~~~
He needs a rest, other than the period he was injured, he's played every minute of all the games he's been fit.

With his history of injuries, that just asking for problems. 

We need to rotate more.

1831~~~
We do. But with Jones and Rojo constantly injured it isn't really possible.

1832~~~
We need reinforcements.

We lost two CB's in the summer in Blackett and Evans (both  are poor, i know), but we should have brought in at least one in. I simply dont trust Jones to stay fit.

1833~~~
I agree, we do. Maybe van Gaal thought McNair would have developed more than he has and didn't think cover was necessary.

1834~~~
Solid performance and wrongly booked IMO, he's dipped a little in the last couple of games I feel.

1835~~~
He looks a bit at sea when he plays a high pressure, attacking side. Sometimes he's a bit off positionally as well.

1836~~~
His passing has improved.  Finds those crossfields with ease now. Defending has regressed.

1837~~~
Been off the boil for months, now. I really don't know whether he's actually good or not.

1838~~~
Needs a rest but we just can't give him one atm.

1839~~~
He <i>is </i>definitely good. He's progressed massively in the past year or so as a defender, and is one of our key players. I do think that the last month or two has exposed him as being a wee bit overrated though: he looks a lot less composed and capable when he's actually put under pressure.

1840~~~
Thing is, his progression has been from garbage to good. Agree with your post, he still has to improve to be considered a top defender.

1841~~~
When the feck was he garbage as a CB? What a ridiculous post!

1842~~~
I've never really viewed him as garbage, to be honest. Always thought he had plenty of potential that he struggle to fulfill for a long period. He's went from sometimes good to very good, in my eyes. He's now got to make that step up and try to reach a world class level.

1843~~~
I thought he was a bit off the pace again. But Liverpool playing without a striker helped

1844~~~
Not even easy trying to position yourself correctly when the other centre back can't even judge the bounce of a ball. Smalling can never assume that Blind wins a header, because even though his stats are quite decent, he mistimes so many bounces that he loses them without an opponent present. Subsequently, Smalling is forces to play both sides at CB whilst having to cover for Darmian/Young who are both all over the place positionally. 

Thought Smalling was good today. The booking was pathetic from Clattenburg considering all the shite Lucas got away with.

1845~~~
He does look half knackered is what I think. He needs a rest, but as someone pointed out above, we can't give him one.

1846~~~
Think he's just lost a bit of focus. It is still worth remembering how young he still is for a Cb, so he's still approaching his peak in terms of consistency. 

Secondly,  if he's off his game it's so clearly noticeable because those around him aren't good enough. I reckon,  the likes of Rio and Vidic also had slight off patches individually that were barely noticeable because the rest of the unit was very competent.

1847~~~
<a class="username" data-user="62774, @Rossa" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/62774/">@Rossa</a> Should have worded it better. I was taking into consideration his constant knack of picking up injuries when I rated him as "garbage". I've always felt that he's been decent for us. I'm just not convinced he's a top class defender, just yet.

1848~~~
Very true. If Rio was off the boil there was always Vidic and vice versa. Also, they had a solid Neville and world class Evra as fullbacks, rarely injured. The extent Smalling has to cover for the right back is ridiculous - isn't that normally what midfielders do? I'd much rather he stays in the box.

1849~~~
Well then you definitely worded that wrongly if that is what you meant? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Agree that he struggled with form through injuries and being shunted out wide, but as a centre back, he has been mostly very solid. He needs a top class defender next to him. Blind struggles with any type of player. Rio had Vidic who struggled with pacy players, so he would cover for him (also, you had the rocket that was Evra next to Vidic), and Vidic would take the biggest brute off Rio's hands. Smalling has to take on all of them, and he can't trust Blind not to get skinned by any attacker, and thus Smalling has to cover his position and Blind's - I can't see that Blind's defenders can't see that.

1850~~~
He was much better, not quite as imperious as he has been at times this season, but I agree with those who say he looks tired and thought that could have explained Tuesday's showing too. At least we have a week before our next game now.

1851~~~
I feel as if Blind is actually a good partner for Smalling. I think their differential skill set compliments each other really well. People are still expecting Blind to give way, at some point, but he's still going and is far from a weak spot in our defense.

1852~~~
Looked very leggy today and all over in terms of positioning.

1853~~~
I thought he done ok. It's not fair pairing him with a CDM (No fault to Blind). We need a ball playing LCB for them to share responsibilities i.e. aerial duels etc

1854~~~
He needs a rest but we cant afford to give him one because weve put ourselves in a position where we will struggle without him (and the other options are injured or 18)

1855~~~
I'm standing behind what I said after the Newcastle game - He looks much shakier without Schewinsteiger or Carrick in front of him. The Schneiderlin/Fellaini partnership doesn't offer anything like the same cover, so too much is asked of him.

1856~~~
What a load of drivvle, whenever he has been played at centre back he has looked the business bar a handful of games. Right back I will give you but I hope you don't need telling that he isn't a RB.

1857~~~
I've already owned up to my mistake, don't expect another one.

1858~~~
It's the fellaini part, he leaves his central partner complete on their own.

1859~~~
I don't agree. Blind is repeatedly making mistakes that midfielders do, such as mistiming the bounce of the ball, which isn't that dangerous if you play in midfield, but it's very hazardous in defense. Smalling has to cover that so often that it is no wonder that Smalling tries to go for all headers - there is just no telling with Blind. He is of course a very good passer, but too slow, too weak, too small to play as a centre back.

1860~~~
The bolded part is the essence: he has to play as two centre backs and fullback. No wonder he sometimes run as much as our midfielders. He has been superb this season, and without him and his athleticism we would have struggled immensely at the back. Our positioning at the back today was shocking. Darmian in particular was all over the place in the first half.

1861~~~
Has Smalling had even a single game off all season?  One or two at most, I would think.  The man needs a rest.

1862~~~
Listed at 1m80; lots of legendary CBs have been less than that. His problems are a lack strength to win duels, and his defensive positioning which is sometimes very naïve. The pace thing is also an issue, but specifically to our (normally) pretty high defensive line under LVG.

1863~~~
He isn't in great form like in first half of the season, basically, since the injury, but he is definitely asked to cover too much space on his own. We have questionable fullbacks, and even those fullbacks are rotated too much from side to side. Then we have Blind next to him who isn't natural CB and doesn't do his share of aerial and physical duels at all, and our midfield is far from great when Schweinsteiger isn't playing. When you look at it, Smalling is pretty much the only one capable of winning headers in our defence, only Darmian is decent for a fullback from the other three defenders.

I would give him a rest one game or two as soon as Jones comes back for his own good, I am sure it would do him wonders, he could come back refreshed and full of energy again. He is probably overplayed, apart from one game he has played every single minute in PL this season, and every single minute in CL this season, plus few cup games.

1864~~~
I'd say it's the lack of a proper ball player in front of him which makes him panic. There is just no outlet.

With Carrick, you might not have the ground covered, but if you give him the ball you know 99 times out of 10 it's going into the feet of a forward player if we're playing from the back. With Schneiderlin, it's probably going to Young or Darmian.

1865~~~
I think that's fair too, but you're talking about when we're on the ball. I was talking about when the opposition are on the ball and attacking.

1866~~~
He was alright. Still a bit below what his level has been. Would like to see him get a rest.

1867~~~
Thing is, the quality CBs who were listed at 1.80m, were all very athletic; fast, strong, great in the air. Blind has neither of those, and therefore at the defending aspect, Smalling can't trust him and needs to cover for him as well as trying to keep his position. Also, the number of times he lets the ball bounce over him is getting ridiculous.

Smalling covered the fifth most distance in our team against Liverpool. He was also our fastest, and the pitch's fastest player. Considering he didn't venture often beyond the centre line, too much is asked of him in defense, covering for too many and having to take too many duels.

1868~~~
He really has to take on every challenge in that defense, doesn't he? It's ridiculous at this stage. Everyone else shies away from every duel there is, so he has to come flying in from right back to left back getting the ball off the attackers.

1869~~~
For fecks sake, he is always pulling at someone's shirt when defending corners. So risky, and cost us against Newcastle.

1870~~~
Pretty much like every single premier league defender.

1871~~~
Skrtl says hello. Every defender does that.

1872~~~
It happens at all levels of football, it's hard to believe anyways who's played or watched football for any extended period of time hasn't realised that yet.

Something like Newcastle was over the top though - where he took the man down.

1873~~~
It was over the top, but it was a free kick the other way around. The Newcastle player looked to rip his head off. On another note, Smalling looks the only defender likely to win a challenge.

1874~~~
It is getting more and more attention now and we might concede more pens from the shirt pulling.

1875~~~
If he has a proper partner in defence, he wouldn't have to do everything. Blind is not a central defender.

1876~~~
Actually think Blind's been doing better than him lately.

1877~~~
On today's performance Smalling is a ballon d'or contender whilst Blind is a contender for best championship defender, don't let his passing fool you into thinking he's good at defending

1878~~~
He has so much ground to cover back there, I thought he had a solid game and won some important tackles and headers, even if it was for naught in the end.

1879~~~
He was back to form today, hopefully he keeps it up now.

1880~~~
Smalling won 3 out 7 aerial duels, Blind won 3 out of 4. Smalling made 2 out of 4 successful heading clearances, Blind made 5 out of 5. Shane Long beat Smalling in the air on several occasions.

1881~~~
Blind's passing was also pretty awful today.

1882~~~
He was a bit better than the last few weeks. He still looked absolutely knackered to me at times, needs a rest.

1883~~~
Well, he sure aint getting one.

1884~~~
He needs a proper LCB next to him. Somebody like prime Vidic.

Stats are deceiving, Smalling one 2 really good defensive headers which bailed our defence out. Two of the aereal battles he lost, im pretty sure we got the ball from it because Long stretched to head it with nobody around but our players.

1885~~~
They also prove that he has a partner that did something.

1886~~~
Yes and no, as I said stats are deceiving. There is no context in terms of how he won the headers or cleared them. Regardless, Blind was one of the worst players on the pitch today whereas Smalling is one of the best.

1887~~~
People cant see past their prejudices most of the time.

1888~~~
Its just the same shit every match about Smalling and his one man backline and how Blind is a midfielder, despite playing as defender far more than midfield in his career.

1889~~~
I just hope he cuts out holding on to players shirts it's doing my head in!

1890~~~
Every defender does that in the box in the PL, why is it blown out of proportion when it comes to Smalling?

1891~~~
Because he gave away a penalty against Newcastle the last time he did it perhaps. Referee's will soon start taking note of it more like what happened with Shawcross.

1892~~~
Don't you dare revert to early Smalling Utd days Mike.

That Derby goal was all his fault. Snap out of it Mike.

1893~~~
His concentration seems to have slipped a lot during the season, occasionally prone to the brainfarts that we were used to from the Smalling of old. His top level hasn't dipped, like that excellent tackle just now, but he seems to switch off a bit more.

1894~~~
Bit harsh, you can't blame him for their DM running past our whole midfield to get in behind. If they don't track they need to at least alert our defence to the threat.

1895~~~
He failed to win the initial challenge. Then decided not to fall back into line after it was lost. Then charged across to the left hand side, and in front of Blind, to fail to win it again. Thus leaving the gaping hole that was then exploited by Derby.

So yeah, he's pretty accountable in my eyes mate.

1896~~~
Thorne ran through from defensive midfield, he should have been picked up. And Blind was beaten far too easily on the header but that's what can happen as he isn't a CB. Collective fault.

1897~~~
Terrible on the goal, 90% his fault IMO.

1898~~~
The only criticism I have him tonight was when he was too chicken to pass the ball forwards between the lines to Mata when he was wide open. Passing the ball forward is the same principle as passing it sideways Chris!

I thouhgt the goal was Schneiderlin's fault.

1899~~~

1900~~~
Eh? See post above.

1901~~~
The goals not his fault imo. 

Yeah he could/should win the header, but we shouldn't concede a goal every time he doesn't. Blind needs to drop off when he goes for it and Schneiderlin needs to not lose his runner.

1902~~~
He was at fault for the goal but the fact that Blind isn't even aware that there is player behind him is quite impressive awareness from him.

1903~~~
What should he have done differently in your opinion? 100% Schneiderlin's fault imo.

1904~~~
Not bothered pushing out to compete for the header, then we can post 100% header win rate stats after the game.

1905~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1906~~~
After he lost that header drop back into position instead of running out chasing way out to the left side, leaving the middle of the pitch wide open? Standard defending really.

1907~~~
Smalling didnt need to go after the ball when he lost that header. 
Schneiderlin didnt follow the run of Thorne.
Varela didnt cover for Smalling, awful positioning.

1908~~~
The goal was on him. But others are also culpable, Varela and Schneiderlin especially.

1909~~~
If he'd just turned round and run back to position then the Derby player on the ball would have had a free run at our back four. Schneiderlin should have noticed Smalling had no choice but to close the man down and filled in. Alternatively Schneiderlin or Fellaini should have been there shielding the back 4 so Smalling didn't have to.

Most of Smalling's mistakes this season have come from him needing to be in 2 places at once. If other players did their jobs properly, like they were doing earlier in the season when Schweinsteiger was fit, Smalling would be looking like a world beater again.

1910~~~
In fairness he used to having to scamper across to the left to cover Blind's grass when we are facing an attack, I thought he made some important challenges today, he needs to get back his first half of the season form though.

1911~~~
I thought he played well. Made quite a few very important challenges. I blame Schneiderlin for the goal personally.

1912~~~
I think the blame for the goal can be pretty evenly divided among two or three, Smalling included. His concentration and decision-making has definitely dropped recently. Still doing some things quite well, but not others. I suppose his mind is not used to having to concentrate for 90 minutes every week, usually his body has failed him three or four times in the season by now.

1913~~~
Don't think there's a need to blame anyone for the goal. Derby did nothing in the game before or after the goal. It was a blind pass perfectly in the line of the attacker who controlled it perfectly. It was a ridiculous goal from that side.

1914~~~
I saw he made the top 4 in the MOTM vote, I didn't think he was that great, maybe I have just raised the bar to high in my expectations of him. He was solid though, just needs to be a bit more careful when surging out IMO.

1915~~~
He got my vote for MOTM although i think it was a close one with Martial. He was an absolute rock today against crouch who is a menace to deal with for many defenders. Also made a couple of vital blocks and interceptions and i thought he drove the ball out from the back in fantastic fashion. Hes had a dip in form last few weeks....right back to the top CB in the division today!

1916~~~
He did well and was solid tonight. Shame he's not better on the ball though. I think he would be knocking on the door of world class if he was. The opposition regularly seem happy to let him run into their half as they know very well that he'll stop dead and pass sideways/backwards. Imagine if he was a genuine threat who needed to be closed down <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1917~~~
Calm and solid. Shame he always has a brainfart in the final third when he runs forward with the ball though

1918~~~
Likewise. He handled Crouch's aerial threat brilliantly.

1919~~~
True that. Strange to see actually, they're not worried at all, but to be fair why would they be? Just once though I hope he catches them by surprise and tries to go all the way, he's got the pace if not the technique, Carrick's got his back, no worries.

1920~~~
When is Mike going to get some rest? He will be knackered soon if LVG keeps playing him in every game.

1921~~~
He's done well against Costa today

1922~~~
FFS

1923~~~
Not blaming our defense for the goal, we let to much pressure build and that is because no one from the midfield can bring the ball out, meaning our forwards get deeper and deeper, you can't counter like that.

Smalling was good today.

1924~~~
So it's your fault. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

But seriously, where was he for the goal? Was he caught out of position wrongly, or was he actually busy with someone else? Other than the goal I thought he monstered Costa for most of the match.

1925~~~
He ended up swapping positions with Darmian in that play.

1926~~~
Him and Blind don't seem to work in partnership with each other at all. It's like they each defend on their own and hope it coincides with what the other is doing

1927~~~
The only time the partnership works (defensively) is when Smalling decides to become a monster and just do it all by himself - like at the start of the season. 

Shame Jones is a complete crock, because I think they're class as a partnership.

1928~~~
I think that he was skinned a couple of times from Costa and Hazard, and like Blind was nowhere for the goal (although, the blame there goes for CBJ who played Costa onside). I don't think that neither him nor Blind was that good, today. The defense has clearly failed when the keeper has to make a lot of crazy saves.

Actually, Darmian was our only defender today who know what he was doing.

1929~~~
That is quite correct. In fact, I thought that they were coordinated well in the beginning, but the more they play together, the worse their coordination becomes.

1930~~~
It's ridiculous how many games he's played without any rest. 200 minutes more than anyone else this season, and already more minutes than any of our outfield players played for entire last season.

1931~~~
Yeah,  that's down to Blind lacking defensive instincts due to him not being a defender. Points to LVG's poor squad management again. It's a situation that should have been rectified a while ago. Blind at centre half should be for emergency only, not all the time.
We need to get Chris a proper partner, it'll help his game develop even more and the answer isn't fecking Rojo.

1932~~~
One thing that i find really irritating with Smalling is his side ward passing. He's brilliant at winning the ball or taking a ball and driving into the opponents half, but it's like he gets to a certain spot and thinks 'holy shit what am i doing it here" and passes it sidewards. 

Lost count how many times he's driven us forward from the back quickly, got deep into Chelsea's half, ignored the forward ball and just slows it down by meekly playing it to the side.

1933~~~
I thought he was fantastic yesterday & I felt if he was in the center of the box, he would have organized that offside trap better & stayed with Costa. We need to sign a reliable CB to play next to him though.

1934~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6gfTvR4VAI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1935~~~
Am I the only one who thinks Smalling really just hasn't been good in the 2nd half of the season, been at fault for so many goals.

1936~~~
Reverting back to type? He's been absolutely terrible today, and if we're honest, hasn't really been very good for the past few weeks. 

Needs a leader next to him to yell at him.

1937~~~
He's really good at wrestling. Been shit since November.

1938~~~
Smalling is living off the mint performances at the start of the season, he's slowly returned to his own retarded self. He's far too thick to consistently play well, has the brain of a possum

1939~~~
Back to his old self. Form has dived since Wolfsburg

1940~~~
He's been dog shit since the Wolfsburg game, but he usually gets away with it because he was so good before that.

1941~~~
Been quite poor for a while.

1942~~~
No, you're not the only one. It's been some time since he last played well.

1943~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1944~~~
Yep, been shite for the most part starting with that Wolfsburg match.

1945~~~
I was especially disappoint at how poor he is in attack. So many opportunities in good positions but he just doesn't win headers.

1946~~~
surprised how he's given stick here, he's done pretty well this game and somehow ppl only remember a few mistakes and suddenly he is worst player in the world, laughable..

1947~~~
He needs a proper partner to settle him down. He tries to do the job of others and it is causing problems through the whole back four.

1948~~~
yeah also wanted to add this, he's beast in the air, his defensive headers are great asset of his but when comes head the ball to the net he's terrible, he must do better in this part of his game

1949~~~
The commentator was making him out to be much worse than he actually was. He was good for most of the match, and the complaints about his efforts in the opposition box were ridiculous (the first one was a good half a foot above his head, the second the defender positioned himself perfectly so the only way Smalling would get to it would be by fouling him...worth noting not a single other attacker even tried going into that area). In saying that, he absolutely fecked up for the second Sunderland goal.

1950~~~
He's our best defender and that says it all.

1951~~~
Nope. Have been saying it for months now.

He's an okay defender, who raised his game for 2-3 months, and now is back to his usual form.

1952~~~
He struggled today. I think the change from Defoe to Ndoye feck him up a bit as well.

1953~~~
Considering that Blind has outperformed him for half of the season, it is difficult to say that. When Jones tries to do other people job and fails, the consensus is that he is shit (not that I complain, he is shit indeed), but when Smalling does it, he needs a proper partner, other players are leaving him down, yadda yadda. Lets call a spade for what it is.

1954~~~
Poor game today, he needs a rest but unfortunately no one else can come in and Europa is starting back up

1955~~~
He needs a spell out of the team to refocus, but there's no one that can take his place.

1956~~~
He was shite today all right. What the hell was he playing at for Sunderland's winner?

1957~~~
A poor game from him, and he's had a few of them in the last couple of months. It doesn't reduce him to being a bad player though. He's been in our top 3 players this season comfortably. Given the unbelievable inconsistency of the whole team all season long, I think it's fair that he has 2 or 3 poor ones, and today was a terrible team performance. Very difficult for him to stand out on his own, as a centre back.

The midfield is garbage, he's been flanked by a revolving door of full backs. Seriously, how many fecking full backs have we fielded this season? He's got Blind next to him, who I do rate, but in tough physical games like this, it's clear he's not a centre back, and that leaves Smalling on his own in a back four with 2 kids and a midfielder-cum-defender.

deserves a bit of credit for only missing one game in all competitions this season, playing the full 90 in all but one. He must be running on empty.

He's the least of our problems, and still one of the best in the league. Everyone was shit today.

1958~~~
Really? If anything Blind has been a better defender than him over the course of the season IMO.

1959~~~
Switching off in key moments now and then, needs to get his self settled back down.

1960~~~
And that post is up there with the worst for the season Brain of a possum...

1961~~~
I really rate Smalling defensively but he really is atrocious on the ball.

He's incredibly clumsy and constantly invites pressure to our defence by being cumbersome and indecisive. He also has no left foot which makes him hoof it out any time the ball is on his side.

Blind gets a lot of criticism but the only reason he's in the team is because Smalling cannot be trusted on the ball for a possession based team.

He's 26 now and becoming an experienced player and I'm really surprised that he's still so poor technically.

1962~~~
Smalling, Martial and DDG are the only players who have managed to stand out in our team when the other players are rubbish. Smalling was no worse than the rest of the team today, and he still has to adjust to playing next to someone new every second match. Give him stability and he will flourish. Darmian was absolutely rubbish today, which didn't help things, and whatever happened to Schneiderlin I do not know. 

One might argue that Smalling is at fault for the goal, but it looks like the whole defense was sleeping there.

1963~~~
He's in the team as he's our second best centre back! Yet he is not a centre back, that sums us up at the moment!

1964~~~
Very true.

1965~~~
There is no argument to be had, he was completely lost.

1966~~~
He keeps getting into these unnecessary tangles with defenders when the ball in the air which almost always results in him not winning the ball. He needs to be much smarter and stronger with his challenges.

1967~~~
Does he close his eyes when in attacking positions? He gets into so many good positions but then just misses the ball completely. Like hes closing his eyes swinging at it.

1968~~~
He's gone well off the boil recently, such a shame considering he's been excellent for us most of the season.

1969~~~
Why is he on the Voice UK?

1970~~~
<b>
</b>


He's in the team because he's the only other player in that position who can stay fit. 

Your criticism of Smalling is way over the top also

1971~~~
He badly needs a rest, been saying it since the New Year. It's ridiculous really how much he is playing without any rest. 

Blind has outperformed him in about 4 games in last two months. In first half of the season Smalling was basically one man defence bullying opposition strikers and for the rest they were both average/poor.

To say that Blind outperformed him for half of the season is laughable, even if you don't rate Smalling at all.

The difference is quite clear really, during Smalling's good spell we hardly conceeded any goals in first half of the season, once Blind started "outperforming" him we are conceeding like crazy.

1972~~~
This. He's only missed the Bournemouth game, and has played the full 90 in every game in all comps except for the game against Ipswich where he came off after 70 mins. It's an enormous amount of games with no rest, especially for a player who was considerably injury-prone prior to this season. He needs a rest, but he just can't have one as we have nobody else.

1973~~~
Even if the others were fit Blind would be first choice for most games. 

Opposing teams don't even mark Smalling when he has the ball because they know 95% of the time he will feck it up. I've lost track of the number of times he's run into a sea of space left by the other team's midfield only for him to drive into that space and play a sloppy pass with no pressure whatsoever.

I'll say it again, defensively he's as good as there is in the league but his ability on the ball is bottom half of the table standard.

1974~~~
Totally agree. He's been making mistakes consistently for a number of games now. Not that we have anyone challenging for his place so he'll just play anyway.

1975~~~
I agree, but I don't really think it is a major issue, especially if we can finally ditch the possession football once LvG is (hopefully) binned. Vidic's dribbling and distribution was ropey as well, often pretty awful. Smalling, like Vidic, is a pure defender. Nothing wrong with that. I don't think every centre back needs to be a ball player.

1976~~~
Agree. All the defenders are suffering from the chopping and changing because of frequent injuries or tactical switches by the manager.

1977~~~
Poor error. He has been making more and more lately. I think he needs a break. I said it a few pages ago but he has never played this many games in a row so I think he is struggling mentally to maintain the focus that is required.

1978~~~
He is a protected specie on here. He plays crap and everyone wants Blind replaced. Blind has been very good in that position all season. Smalling was great for the first half of the season but has dropped off badly. I would rather see Smalling replaced and Blind partnered by a top centre back. A player that can defend and play out.

1979~~~
I'm still not convinced by him.

He's nowhere near the quality we're used to at CB and he never will be - the same can be said for the majority of players on our team  though.

1980~~~
His form has fallen off a cliff. Coincided with our midfield going to pot and offering far less protection.

Nice while it lasted...

1981~~~
Rio and Vida? If so, you should get used to it.

1982~~~
Not just the two you mentioned. Our defence the worst I have ever witnessed at Old Trafford.

1983~~~
Has looked a bag of nerves recently and the composure and assurance have gone 

I think he needs a more experienced and dominant partner

1984~~~
You can't remember the days of Silvestre and Wes Brown as our CB partnership? Not that long ago...

1985~~~
I'd take them two over the bag of shite we have currently.

Smalling and Shaw are the only two defenders we have with any promise. It's a little early to judge Jackson, but the rest are crap.

1986~~~
Smalling has played almost every game this season and almost every single minute of those games.  He's a very good defender, but his body and mind need rest.  Badly.  

But who do we turn to for a CB to pair with Blind...Carrick?

1987~~~
What happened to this guy? He was an absolute beast first half of the season.

1988~~~
He's being tested more often. Granted, he's still a very good player and it doesn't help that he's in a team so low on confidence, but he's probably not as good as we thought he was.

1989~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> looks so nervous complete opposite to how he was a few months ago.

1990~~~
Can be excellent but not consistent enough and ALWAYS has a big mistake in him every game, no matter how good his form is. Soft a shit too and every ref knows he's a shirt pulling in the box feckwit.

1991~~~
Not in the top bracket of centre halves for me. He needs a leader beside him. We really messed up not buying a replacement for vidic

1992~~~
He has to defend for himself, the rb, the other cb and 2 cdms at times.

He his tired and needs a rest and a CB to partner him.

1993~~~
Another top performance from Smallingbauer.

1994~~~
Come on, he needs quality around him. Even Messi would look shit in this team......

1995~~~
I honestly see Blind as the long term CB out of the two. Bring Stones in and let him and Smalling battle it out.

1996~~~
Disappointed in him tonight, it might not be ideal having Love and McNair either side of you but this is where I'd hope to see his leadership potential kick in, instead he just looked overwhelmed by the responsibility..

1997~~~
Woeful.

1998~~~
when he was protected by 2 holding midfielders?

1999~~~
It's a miracle that a guy with his injury record has managed to keep himself fit for 38 of our 39 games this season. He gets points for that only from me. 

Form has dipped dramatically since the Wolfsburg game. Needs a rest, a better CB partner, and a settled defense. He is good but not a "top, top" player.

2000~~~
Needs a rest tbh but we cant afford to give him one cos we (United / LVG) fecked up by not getting suitable competition for places.

2001~~~
Why is he wandering off? Not the time to keep playing shit Chris if you want to go to the Euro's.

2002~~~
Another really poor game from Chris... 

Our defensive communication is astoundingly poor.

2003~~~
Better attacker than Depay.

2004~~~
Mike's back everybody!

2005~~~
Clinical!

2006~~~
That's our Smalling!

2007~~~
Strong 90 minutes after a wobbly spell. I still think he has to come out to help the RB too often, that needs sorting out.

2008~~~
I know it was only a League One side but that was the best I've seen him play for a few weeks.

2009~~~
Great to see him score, I couldn't help but laugh with the finish though, it was like a bouncing bomb heading for a German dam <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2010~~~
He waited an age for it to bobble around, and then he gave the sloppiest technique toward the ball. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> One off, I'm sure. I remember a goal he finished expertly with a trained stretched leg in his first(?) season against City. Think it was the Charity Shield when Nani scored twice.

2011~~~
Not regarding yesterday's match but in general, Unpopular opinion and I may get bashed a lot. 
Any good CB pairing needs a CB that is brave, hard tackler and another who is comfortable on the ball, basically a central defender and a ball playing one. A vidic and a rio. Smalling isn't that physical beast , atleast doesn't play that way to be a Vidic. And his game surely resembles more like Rio. But the thing is, today there are multiple CB's who are as good defenders as him and are better on the ball. Laporte, Marquinhos, Hummels, even Blind(with a stronger CB might make a great pairing) for example. There is no lack of Rios today and it makes me wonder if we can achieve greatness with Smalling as a CB. Sure we have have bigger problems which need to be dealt with before this and this shouldn't exactly be a concern, but considering Laporte seems to be a primary target today, should be even not consider buying a CB who can complement qualities of his partner instead of buying a player whose style is similar!

2012~~~
What...you want to find a partner for Blind? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>
Put Hummels alongside Smalling and we'll probs have as good a partnership as Rio and Vidic as we can possibly get.

2013~~~
I actually think Smalling is more Vidic than Rio if you want to pigeonhole him into one or the other. He's much quicker than Vidic ever was, but other than a good reading of the game I don't see many similarities between him and Rio.

2014~~~
There was a stat after 75 minutes that stated Shrewsbury had only had 12 passes in our final third.

2015~~~
Smalling is more Vidic than Rio as pointed out by 2MM above. Also, Rio wasn't just good on ethereal ball while not being a top defender as is the case with someone like hummels. He was an amazing defender and good with the ball on top of that, that's what made him one of the best of his generation. None of the ones you mentioned are close to his level atm so I'm not sure why you believe there are a lot of Rios running around.

2016~~~
One of the biggest Myths around. Thuram/Cannavaro, Stam/Nesta Adams/Bould Pallister/Bruce Maldini/Nesta Baresi/Corstacurta Ferrara/Costacurta just to name a few from my era. Don't remember them guys being any Maverick Rolls Royce types

2017~~~
He sure likes a good old shirt-pulling every now and then, it's very visible and I'm amazed he isn't penalized more often. You'd think the Newcastle penalty would teach him a lesson but it doesn't look that way at all. It needs to stop, it's almost Skrtel'esque now.

2018~~~
This, can't believe he's not been warned to stop with it, will get him in the trouble again.

2019~~~
He was awesome yesterday which was good to see cause I think that he has been quite disappointing since November.

However, he should practice two extra hours each day on passing and running with the ball. It is amazing to see how a good defender he is, but at the same time how shit he is at basic footballing skills like making simple passes or not running in out.

2020~~~
Half of the players you mentioned (if not more) were very good at passing.

2021~~~
Not saying Rios per se, I mean there are better players on the ball than Smalling. 

No, all I said was, we consider Smalling to be a top class defender, but he isn't that great. 

Again 2 defenders who are no nonsense types. Two central defenders, not ball playing ones. What we are actually having are  defenders who can't bully the strikers.

If anyone lists top 10 defenders of say last 20 years, there is a high probability around 8 will be those bullies, the remaining 2 may be great readers of game like Terry.
Smalling IMO is someone who can get the ball front, not someone who can put his head on the line to block a shot point blank, or maybe get into a strikers read or jump all around say Costa. I mean, he isn't in the same mould as guys like Vidic, Shawcross (not saying Shawcross is better than Smalling). He needs to instill fear that he can break your leg in 2, but never break it sort of guy

2022~~~
Ofcourse there are. Smalling is very average with the ball so I'm not sure why that's up for debate.

2023~~~
I'd say exaggerated passing ability. People seem to think just because someone is calm on the ball, they are a CB playmaker. These are a load of bullies and excellent readers of the game more than anything.

2024~~~
Depends what you mean by 'bully the strikers'.

Smalling regularly bullies the strikers in the sense he wins almost every physical duel. Whether it's in the air or a shoulder to shoulder battle as they go for the ball. He's simply bigger, stronger and faster than the vast majority of players out there, and he uses those gifts to go around quietly winning the vast majority of physical battles.

However, as you alluded to, there's no 'dirtiness' about him. The strikers can get frustrated by him winning everything, but they won't be scared of him. Attackers knew that the likes of Vidic, Terry, Stam, etc would happily go straight through them if they felt they needed to to get the ball. Whereas Smalling would stay on his feet and 'gently' overpower them to push them off and win the ball.

2025~~~
A lot of revisionism going on here. Smalling had every attacker, big or small, strong or fast, in his pocket up until November. Since then he has been about average top six standard in the league. 

He showed he is as fast as Vardy over distance, stronger than Lukaku and better in the air and had him in his pocket till the player looked to give up. The same has happened to pretty much any forward. Lately, however, he has seemed a bit frustrated and knackered at times. No wonder, seeing as he often covers more ground than 80% of our outfield players. Looking at yesterday's match that is understandable, because Blind loses every single header to a normal sized attacker. He may have decent stats, but that is because Smalling takes all of those duels. It must be both frustrating and exhausting. On top of that, he has to cover against every runner as he knows Blind is easily outpaced.

Yesterday's match was perfect for a defender like Blind who is great on the ball, but even then, he lost a couple of unnecessary headers that Smalling would never have lost. 

Even a Liverpool supporter I know thought Smalling was a great defender.

Rio was great because he outpaced the fastest of strikers and anticipated play very well. Smalling is better in the air and stronger in a tackle, but Rio was smarter and technically a couple of leagues above. Smalling is probably a hybrid of Rio and Vidic. When people compare Rio-Vidic to any defender, they should know there isn't a center back pairing close to them at present.

2026~~~
Not in training? 

Wave goodbye to a clean sheet for the next few games if he is injured!

2027~~~
Has an injury been confirmed or is he just being rested perhaps? Imagine facing Arsenal will McNair/Blind at CB

2028~~~
Sky Sports says an injury.

2029~~~
If McNair starts any of the next two games we will lose. Would rather Blind & Carrick together at the back if Smalling is out.

2030~~~
lovely

2031~~~
Typical. He's needed a rest though.

2032~~~
Valencia, McNair, Rojo, Blind?

2033~~~
Three at the back versus Arsenal seems a given, then.

2034~~~
Bloody hell not another injury.

2035~~~
No, Rojo and Valencia are still injured. Darmian is back in training though.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/epl_injury_table.php#c14" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/epl_injury_table.php#c14</a>

2036~~~
Valencia trained today.

2037~~~
Guess physioroom aren't reliable anymore then.

2038~~~
fecking typical.

2039~~~
Reliable, yes. Updated, no. To be fair to them, this is the first we've heard of Valencia and Rojo back in training.

2040~~~
I guess then it's a question of fitness, if we play them and they're still unfit and get injured against Midtylland again, would be pretty annoying, a gamble LVG has to consider.

2041~~~
Depends on the importance placed upon the Europa League.

2042~~~
LVG's wet dream that, one right footer and one left footer and both great passers.

2043~~~
LVG said he'd like to win it, so...

2044~~~
I'm sure he'd like to be fourth in the league as well, and look at how that's turning out.

2045~~~
No update on Smalling? Hearing he's out for quite a while

2046~~~
They said it was a shoulder injury on commentary, any word on how long he'll be out?

2047~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/news/leicester-jamie-vardy-names-man-utds-chris-smalling-as-toughest-opponent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.teamtalk.com/news/leices...-man-utds-chris-smalling-as-toughest-opponent</a>


<b>Leicester hot shot Jamie Vardy has named Manchester United defender Chris Smalling as his toughest opponent so far this season. </b>

Vardy is the Premier League’s top goalscorer this term with 19 goals – three more than his closest rivals Harry Kane and Romelu Lukaku.

Few defenders have been able to shackle the former non-league centre-forward but Vardy has named the defender who gave him the toughest time.

“On a personal level, Chris Smalling,” he told Betfair. “He’s always tight and always around you to stop you from doing your bit on the ball or getting turned.

“It makes it very difficult for you to bring your team-mates into the game as well.”

Even Smalling could not snuff out Vardy’s threat, with the England striker notching his record-breaking goal against United when he scored in his 11th consecutive Premier League game in November.

2048~~~
Official website posted today that he hopes to play tomorrow, so it surely can't be a serious one.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2016/Feb/Chris-Smalling-talks-to-United-Review-ahead-of-Arsenal-match" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...talks-to-United-Review-ahead-of-Arsenal-match</a>

Also says he's an Arsenal fan. Didn't know that. Drop him.

2049~~~
Any word on his availability today?

2050~~~
He gets little rest and he is a beast again, kind of expected.

2051~~~
Best player on the pitch. Only post here. Right you are.

2052~~~
agree but to be fair both Rondon and WBA are pretty shit.....

2053~~~
We've got to focus on the whingeing first. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

But I'm so glad he's back in the line-up. He's been a rock.

2054~~~
Yeah but when you are one man defence...

2055~~~
yeah, thats also fair <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2056~~~
Did really well against Rondon who isn't shit at all, he's not a silky forward but he's big and powerful and has an engine on him, those type of strikers present their own problems and Smalling did everything to keep him quiet, not his fault he's got no help.

2057~~~
Our only good player today. Still the best in the league. Hope a big club like Leicester or Spurs don't take him from us.

2058~~~
Back to his best again. Always keeps going, it's a shame he plays with a bunch of gutless cnuts.

2059~~~
Deserves a proper partner at CB.

2060~~~
Only positive today.

One of the only positives in the entire season. Him and Martial and De Gea are the only players who have regularly been of Utd standard.

2061~~~
Looked like this time out has done his form some good. The only positive to come out of todays game really as we will need him for the games coming up.

2062~~~
Thought he was a beast today. We'd have probably been beat 3 or 4 nil without him

2063~~~
He was very good up against Rondon today, can't fault his performance at all.

2064~~~
I don't think he was good today.. His tendency to be defending the man and not the space creates unnecessary problems for the defence. 
If he is not charging into midfield, he getting dragged wide by the forward. Half the time Rondon was heading to the corner flag, wouldn't it have been better for the shape of the backline for him to just stay in his zone and let people just do their job. 
United is the only team where the midfielders spend more time covering the CB area than CBs themselves. We wonder why our CM always look limited.

2065~~~
Would have been at fault for 2 goals if it wasn't for De Gae

2066~~~
Absolute donkey

2067~~~
He's been dog shit for 3 months now.

2068~~~
Our first choice defender and that says it all how poor our defence looks.

2069~~~
Why does he head the ball so awkwardly?

2070~~~
He's not top level. He's good but his recent form means you'd need to have some serious rose-tinted glasses to rate him more than that.

2071~~~
He is bound to today.. No one to wrestle with, these smaller types just keep dragging him out of position as usual.

2072~~~
Exactly and I've said it all along. He's a good athlete but a rubbish footballer.

2073~~~
Wtf was that piece of defending was when he tried to make a stupid header ? Why not just boot the ball ?

2074~~~
What he was doing trying to head that cross away anyway was fecking idiotic but to just completely miss it?

Shambles.

2075~~~
Lol. Just came in to post that after watching the replay. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2076~~~
He is supposed to outwit and outsmart attackers, not batter them into submission. People have been praising him for doing all the wrong things and now he's been found out.

2077~~~
He feckin slipped, he didn't do it on purpose ffs. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2078~~~
Disappointing tonight.

2079~~~
He should be rested next match (FA Cup). Whole point of having a squad.

2080~~~
Rested for who? 

McNair?

2081~~~
He is more confident with his head than his his foot. I'm not even joking.

2082~~~
Mcnair? TFM? Basically if they are in our squad, they should be used and rotated especially for cup matches like this.

2083~~~
He has just missed three matches. He shouldn't be worrying about a rest but rather figuring out how to pull his head out of his ass.

2084~~~
TFM hasn't played CB for the first team. McNair has been awful.

2085~~~
Watford.

2086~~~
He has. Partnered Blind vs Watford

2087~~~
Been really poor lately.

He is so poor on the ball too. Barely progressed in that aspect.

2088~~~
The most overrated player in the history of this forum.

2089~~~
Meh, when he was great, we acknowledged it. When he lost his form, the praise stopped, and he was criticized quite a lot lately (and rightly so)

2090~~~
Carrick.

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2091~~~
Has always been overrated here, decent defender, at times even below-average.

2092~~~
jesus

2093~~~
Not sure. Still think that would be Herrera. Smalling at least has shown a very high level of form to warrant the praise at some point. His form has dropped considerably though, definitely.

2094~~~
Doesn't help that he plays alongside Blind and Rojo. Even Rio or Vidic would struggle alongside them. In fact Rio wasn't great before Vidic and Evra came along.

2095~~~
Is he available?

2096~~~
That was so stupid, he had to contort himself basically to make the header. Sometimes I wonder what goes through our players' minds.

2097~~~
He was by no means good yesterday, but what kind of defense are we playing? Look at their second goal, why is it Smalling who is trying to block Firming's shot? When Rio and Vidic played they had an understanding, and they defended as a unit. Smalling has to defend all over the shop because Blind won't win any battles.

2098~~~
Smalling got beat to a cross by fecking Lallana. 

Blind is a much better centre back than him.

2099~~~
If Carrick could do regularly what he did against Arsenal, he'd be a fine option. Far better than TFM and McNair fo shizzle.

2100~~~
What about what he did against Liverpool?

2101~~~
They have not been playing like a partnership. More like two defenders trying to outdo the other, for that I rate them both as shite.

2102~~~
That's just rubbish. Smalling did once what Blind has been doing all season - being beat by all sorts of attackers. Then Smalling stumbled once, but once again, Blind was found wanting whenever there was defending to do. We have to play Fellaini because there is no presence in the air with Blind. He is just so poor in the air. Smalling didn't have his best match, but once again he had to try and carry the defense on his own.

It says it all when you think Blind is a MUCH better centre back than him - he's not even a qualified, even average center back.

2103~~~
I really like Carrick, but this season he has been well below par, unfortunately. One can still see the quality is there, but he makes too many mistakes and looks battered after 30 minutes of playing. His passing is still the best in the team though. However, recall the times when Carrick facilitated Scholes' passing? That says it all really - although he is a good passer, he is not close to say Scholes.

2104~~~
Decent performance but I often feel he has too much ground to cover.

2105~~~
Solid performance and it looks to me he also did most of Blind's defending job today. Carroll, Emenike and Sakho couldn't win anything against Smalling. Varela and Smalling are my MOTM. Can't do much for the goal as it was Blind who gave the foul and it was also a brilliant free kick from a long distance as well.

2106~~~
That's what happens when you have to cover for your fellow cb all the time. 

For God's sake get him a proper CB partner.

2107~~~
He's gonna be even more beastly with a proper CB next to him. Good game from him today, loved when Sakho went physical on him and Mike just pushed him away.

2108~~~
He's made a fair few costly mistakes in recent times and looks nowhere near as flawless as he did in 2015. Shame.

2109~~~
Just been poor since the new year imo.

2110~~~
He's been solid tonight.

Has had Sturridge in his back pocket, as well as bringing the ball forward well on several occasions.

2111~~~
I think the worst thing about Smalling is how he complete lack of passing ability harms us as a team. It has been very apparent tonight. He has almost always taken the easy option. Lingard or Rashford were screaming at him for a pass and he bottled it, he tried it later on a completely fluffed the pass.

Still a very strong basic defender but I think we need more.

2112~~~
Probably could've helped Varela there. He was marking no one.

2113~~~
Solid first half and probably best player before half time. Poor second half.

2114~~~
I doubt he can do much in that situation.

2115~~~
Was okay. Been ages since he produced a brilliant performance though.

2116~~~
He really wasn't. Carrick ran the game for us. Smalling defended OK but was poor on the ball. Safe passing. I much prefer Blind at centre back to Smalling. I now understand the appeal in having a David Luiz type centre back over an old school English type one.

2117~~~
Looks shaky and clumsy during the second half of the season. He is decent and can be good but is a step down from the top defenders we used to have.

2118~~~
Steadily returning to his real level ? I think so.

2119~~~
I would say both Carrick, Smalling and even Fellaini are our best players in first half. Smalling won almost every challenges in first half to me. Blind was the worst player in first half too many error but much better performance in second half. David Luiz is not a good centre back. He looked good only if he has good centre back alongside him. Smalling ahead of Luiz to me.

2120~~~
He's been awful the last 3 games, really not convinced he's cut out to be a top defender without someone far superior next to him. His passing is abysmal.

2121~~~
His ability on the ball is fecking shocking.

I fail to see how he's been at United for six seasons playing at such a high level and has shown no improvement whatsoever on the ball. Its completely embarrassing and it will hinder him from becoming a top defender.

His poor passing, hesitation and shite touch continuously put us under pressure or waste opportunities.

2122~~~
Had a strange night. 

Passing was the worst it's been in ages, but 1 on 1 he did really well. Few times he got his positioning wrong though which cost him a couple times, but had an average game really.

2123~~~
I don't think he's awful against West Ham. He was one of the best player in that match.

2124~~~
He's been way short of his early season form recently. He's probably in need of a rest period.

2125~~~
Meh, I didn't think he had all that much to do tbh. He just completely panics when the ball is at his feet and recently (maybe not against West ham) he's just been getting bullied; which was pretty much his only good attribute.

2126~~~
Hoping Mourinho comes in and straightens him back to the standard we're used to. Dip in form is starting to become pretty concerning.

2127~~~
I don't know what game did you watch, he was bullying Sakho, Carroll and Emenike all the time and covering all Blind's defending job.

2128~~~
Horrible use of the ball and looked twitchy when Liverpool's quick little forwards were running at him.

2129~~~
Put a CB beside him that can actually pass the ball and it would hide the issue somewhat, I mean Blind isn't bad but Blind isn't a CB.

2130~~~
Exactly

2131~~~
Exactly how I saw it too.

2132~~~
Eh? Blind is actually quite good on the ball. How about Smalling not be as thick as rock?

2133~~~
Anyone else notice him grt caught out just ball watching several times tonight?  

Think he would be so much better with a top quality partner alongside.

2134~~~
On the whole overated on here, was awful tonight.

2135~~~
Hes a great penalty box defender imo. His ability on the ball is terrible, and tonight there were times he just...stopped. He looked shattered after 55 minutes as well.

2136~~~
His distribution is the worst of all the CBs I have seen playing for us, including O Shea, and that says something.

So unnerved when he gets pressed, I am amazed.

2137~~~
Another shithouse

2138~~~
He is simply not intelligent enough to play as a CB. For all the right physical attributes, he lets himself down by his poor decision making, panicking, and reading of the game. Yet I am often astonished by the praise he gets here. He is neither commanding, communicative nor intelligent enough to be a starting CB for a top club. He's a bit like Liverpool's Sakho

2139~~~
I agree Smalling is not the most intelligent defender out there but what does he do that doesn't classify him as intelligent?

Smalling does very well in 1v1 and counter attacking situations, probably the best in the league in that regard, so how exactly does he panic too much?

The Sahko comparison is way out of reach and totally unfair IMO.

2140~~~
The things he says after every single bad game or before every crucial game is more infuriating than his performances. Just Shut up , Mike and get on with it.

2141~~~
He has shown this season that he can do all of the things you've said he can't do though. At his best he is a commanding and dominating defender and is far from being the problem in our team. He has has to play most of the season with a makeshift defence, almost always with a partner who is not even a centre back and with a team that is struggling and playing below the players' actual ability. With a good manager and a good partner he will be fantastic, he's already one of our best players this season anyway

2142~~~
His 1 v 1 is not bad but for a premiership defender he gets dragged out of position too often. Both him and Blind have a tendency to go for a stroll when we are being attacked. 
The number of times a midfielder has to drop into defence to cover for them is abnormal, no wonder the CMs look clueless half the time. 
Does it not baffle people how other defenders manage to mark strikers without engaging in a wrestling contest or chasing them into their own half. The more battles he engages in the more chaotic the defence becomes. Too busy defending as individuals those two and complicating things for the 5 players around them.

2143~~~
Firstly, his 1v1 defensive work is a lot better than 'not bad' - he rarely loses duels. Secondly, having a RW as your RB, or a kid who has barely played a game, or a signing who looks absolutely lost, is going to mean you have to cover for them. Similarly, having a CB partner who is not really a CB means you are probably going to accept extra responsibility and try to help him out a lot. He needs a solid three defenders with him before we can judge if his positioning is that bad.

2144~~~
He gets dragged out of position because he is often covering ground for his other teammates, these are unfortunate circumstances that are always going to happen when our defense consistently gets involved in the attack.

As for your statement about "marking",  we should keep in mind that 1V1s are part of the game. When a defender loses his man, or gets beaten off a run, or we are on the counter attack they are inevitabe. The fact that Smalling is always there to bail our other defenders or our players is pretty damn  good and I can bet my life we would have been screwed had he not been in position to stop those attacks.

Our defensive organization has not been perfect, much like Smalling's form right now, and his ball playing skills still need to improve, but lets not act like he isn't one of the main reasons we have conceded only 27 goals in 29 games in the league.

2145~~~
Like the rest of the team he has been shit for the last few months, but impossible to blame him considering that the team has more problems than just individual players playing badly.

What I can blame him though, is that he is just a terrible footballer. While a defender's first job is to defend (and Smalling is actually quite good at it), his all round play (passing, running with the ball not in out) it is really shocking for a player who has been playing in this level for half a decade.

2146~~~
Sahko btw was at fault to all 3 goals Liverpool conceded today vs Southampton(Surprise Surprise!!) and prevented a Liverpool goal because he was unnecessarily offside.

Lets not compare a championship defender to Smalling again please.

2147~~~
He is having poor second half of the season but his movement and our defensive shape lately is ridiculous, I seriously think it's down to the tactics, they are instructed to chase various players and leave their positions all the time, there's no way he is doing it because he thinks that's the way he should defend. We had some ridiculous defensive shapes already and we are just 13 minutes into the game.

2148~~~
Defensive shape I agree but he has looked great second half.

2149~~~
Has he fecked a member of Michael Oliver's family?

2150~~~
Fantastic game.

2151~~~
His brainfarts annoyed me but he was very solid for large parts, excellent towards the end.

2152~~~
Monster today! Good day to step up!

2153~~~
Was excellent the last 20 minutes

2154~~~
Yeah really good today... he's been due a strong performance... though he was a bit lucky to not see red.

2155~~~
Think he has all the physical skills and he needs to up his game intelligence.  Thought he was getting that red after tripping Kun Aguero.  Needs to play smarter and he will be fine.

2156~~~
Watching his interview illustrates hes a pretty intelligent human being. I dont understand how he can be so stupid on the pitch, at times...

2157~~~
Getting a lot of praise on Swedish TV and deservedly so, him and Blind were immense at times.

2158~~~
Great performance. Blind was good too.

2159~~~
Same in Norway. He was brilliant today.

2160~~~
Great performance.

2161~~~
Rock today, was disappointed with the comments in this thread over the last few weeks, forgetting that he saved our bacon time and time again in the first half of the season.

2162~~~
Absolute animal today (didn't see the first half). A few times when City were piling on a bit of pressure he was the one back defending everything and I was sat watching giong "honestly.. Where is Blind...!?" must be horrible to play beside somebody who is positionally very poor. 

Should have been off for a second yellow mind, but we are due a bit of luck this season.

2163~~~
I love Smalling and think he has been fanastic recently despite the criticism. But he didn't deserve MotM today due to the rashness.
He's immovable against the big strikers but players of the Aguero ilk can sometimes cause him problems. If I were an opposing manager I'd sit one of these players on him but there aren't many left in the league (Vardy, Long?). Good job he's rapid.

2164~~~
Beast mode. Should have probably got sent off, but because the ref didnt give us a pen, he didnt have the balls to send Smalling off.

2165~~~
Should have been sent off but other than that had a very go game, him and Blind have to do a lot with no legs in the DM role and dodgy fullback either side.

2166~~~
Lucky not to be sent off but other than that a great performance and deservedly MOTM

2167~~~
Not sure he was lucky not to be sent off. The first yellow was a weird one for Oliver to give considering the way he didn't give out another yellow for worse offenses after that. Blind is a good partner but, can see him becoming even better with another top defender along side.

2168~~~
Kinda lucky today. I actually thought his first booking was harsh compared to the one he didnt get. He was chasing Aguero too much but other than that, he was rock solid. Made some really important blocks and read the play in the box really well.

2169~~~
Could have seen red alright. Good performance and a much needed one as I don't think he's been that good lately. Our defence as a whole is still poor; if Aguero hadn't of had such an off day and Bony wasn't complete shite, we could well have been easily beaten.

2170~~~
The first yellow was ridiculous considering Mangala didn't get one when tossing Rashford out of the pitch on a break. Silly ref.

2171~~~
quite stupid to get that yellow early on but he was immense for the rest of the game, did great to stay on his feet and tackle aguero to get the ball from him in the box in added time..<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> vintage mike

2172~~~
Didn't think he was anywhere near as good as some, and Aguero got by him one time just far too easily.

Really needs to improve on the ball.

2173~~~
He was immense

2174~~~
One of his best games all season, can you imagine when he is paired with a solid CB next season how much more he would shine?

2175~~~
Is he growing out a Hitler stache? Or am I the only one who noticed that bum fluff

2176~~~
Must be a fancy dress party coming up.

2177~~~
Was going to say this. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

As long as it's intimidating attackers I'm all for it.

2178~~~
in last few games he started following strikers very deep and that opens our defence big time....other then that he was good.

2179~~~
Surprised at the comments today. I thought he had a poor game owing to the fact that he should have been sent off in the first half. That said, he defended pretty well although City were dire in attack from pretty much the moment we scored.

There were also times when he pursued Aguero right back practically over the half way line. If City's other attackers had better movement they could have potentially exploited that.

2180~~~
That has to be directions. It was extreme against Liverpool. Not only does it open our defence, it removes the defender who is usually sweeping up the mess.
What?


Maybe that was the plan? As long as we've got a handle of Aguero, the rest of the team can easily handle the rest of them. Turns out it was the case.

2181~~~
He was my man of the match.

2182~~~
Yeah, but he wasn't and that doesn't negate the other good things he did rest of the game.

2183~~~
Really feels good that we have a player that can be considered one of or own looking good enough to carry the mantle and become a regular. A team always needs these players who grow with the team like Vidic, Evra, Carrick ... . That next batch of Cleverley, Anderson, Jones have been disappointing to say the least but at least one of them should be a regular for us and ensure some sort of identity in this team.

2184~~~
Perhaps its just from me spending too much time in the Fellaini thread listening to "should have been sent off" type comments every week, I dunno. I find it hard to say a player had a good game when they only remained on the pitch due to the ref utterly bottling it.

2185~~~
Fair point, was very lucky to remain on the pitch and I was frustrated with him for parts of the game, but I think he managed to make up for it overall with his resilient defending towards the end.

2186~~~
Easy. Think of a forward that could have been sent off that goes on to score a couple of goals or a goalie making a great save. Might not be MOTM performance for you, but harsh to brand it a poor game based on something that didn't happen.

2187~~~
Would have been a bit soft for him to be sent off, really. His second foul wasn't that bad at all and it actually looked relatively accidental. You see players get away with much worse all the time, like Mangala did in the same game.

2188~~~
I believe it's to instructions. Other teams have noticed it and have been exploiting it, doubt the coaches haven't. I cautiously celebrated when he took the early yellow because it meant he'd have to restrain himself.

2189~~~

2190~~~
Better in the second half but a bit careless on occasions in the first.

2191~~~
Terrific performance today! Had Lukaku in his pocket once more and made some vital interceptions. Lukaku simply gave up in the end. He has to be aggressive because Blind can't (Blind had a good game, so nothing bad about that performance), and therefore he may look a little careless as he is pretty much all over the pitch defending, but he shut down their play so often. Great performance - highlighted by the Norwegian commentator actually - not often a defender gets that much credit. 

Looks like Smalling is finding some form again.

2192~~~
Both he and Blind had a good game. The latter did even better when you consider how frequently Lukaku tried to isolate him.

2193~~~
Yeah back to more or less his best today. Good time to find form!

2194~~~
My MOTM, he was fantastic.

2195~~~
We talk about De Gea, could you imagine what this season would've looked like if he was injured for any lengthy period of time?

2196~~~
About time him and Blind are both performing at the same time.

It's usually been one or the other.

2197~~~
It's patently untrue to suggest Smalling aggressively man-marked Lukaku while Blind just sweeped up behind in this game. Michael Cox's take on it was almost the complete reverse:

<i>"Lukaku spent much of the first half positioning himself up against Daley Blind, who has become a regular at the heart of United’s defence but lacks the traditional physical qualities required for a battle against the striker. Nevertheless, Blind was superb until he departed through injury with 10 minutes remaining, and unquestionably came out on top against Lukaku."</i>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/03/manchester-united-daley-blind-romelu-lukaku" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/03/manchester-united-daley-blind-romelu-lukaku</a>

2198~~~
He and Blind have nailed their spots, for me.

2199~~~
Not like they have any competition anyway!

2200~~~
I mean for next season and maybe future

2201~~~
Anyone else notice how his passes are always to the feet or behind the player? It's a really annoying trait, especially when he finds himself free to run into the opposition's half.

2202~~~
Look at how often Smalling defends both the right channels and the left channels, and the guardian may or may not agree, but Smalling was definitely the one who went to battle Lukaku the most. Blind came up on top against Lukaku, which I didn't expect, but was a pleasant surprise. How often do you find Blind battling defenders down on the right corner flag? Smalling does the opposite quite often, and that is mostly down to Blind's lacking physical qualities - in Michael Cox' words.

All that being said, Blind did great, but he plays on such small margins at times, and he is not close to having the recovery pace to make up for mistakes. In the last couple of games he hasn't made many mistakes, but he has been prone to a few, and Smalling has then had to run around saving his arse. There is a reason why Smalling frequently is top five player who covers the most distance in our team - not very common for a centre back.

2203~~~
You're right. At times it looked like Smalling was a fullback. I noticed him running the channels. Blind dealt with the direct balls to Lukaku in and around the box, and he did well, but Smalling did more running by far.

2204~~~
He is shittiest passer in the team right now. I hate it. Every time he gets the ball its like he doesn't know what to do with it or who to pass it too. He overruns it or passes it wide of the man and it goes out of play or gives it away.

2205~~~
It's painful to watch. You might say that it isn't his natural game, but for a modern centre back to be so short of confidence in his passing ability is a bad sign.

2206~~~
I think that Smalling need a senior defender or at least someone whose good in defending at his side. He's a good defender but he's not Rio or Stam (who were basically 1 man defense)

2207~~~
Smalling has been a '1 man defense' for the vast majority of this season, especially in the first half. He's more than just a good out and out defender, he's been immense. I think you're trying to say he needs a more complete partner, someone good or better with the ball at his feet.

2208~~~
There's no doubt that he's a good defender. However you also have to take in account LVG's patient ball possession game which basically put most of the team behind the ball. That does choke any ounce of creativity in the team but it also help the defense alot.

2209~~~
On the contrary we are actually highly susceptible to the counter attack when we push for a goal, especially when we push the fullbacks on, and because we tend to dilly dally on the ball in the middle of the pitch. Also many of the times one of the CBs is forced to bring the ball out and move out high the pitch due to our lack of movement and passing options.

We do protect the defense well in normal play, but also leave the defense open quick a bit when we are pushing in the "attacking"/or are pathetic excuse of an phase.

2210~~~
That's because eventually the players will start getting frustrated for not creating chances and they will break formation. I am not saying that Smalling is shit. Im only saying that he's not at Stam/Rio's level yet. Very few defenders reach that level.

2211~~~
I agree, I was just making the point that at times our defense has been very exposed because of how they play and Smalling and Blind have done well in those situations at times.

2212~~~
All I am saying is that Smalling needs that quality CB partner. Stam/Rio may have been a 1 man defence but they fared much better with Johnsen and Vidic around. Its time we find Smalling's 'Vidic/Johnsen'.

2213~~~
Thought it'd be worth mentioning that Terry has voted for him in team of the year at RB <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2214~~~
Terry should have dropped one of the Leicester CB's but good to see Smalling being recognised.

2215~~~
Yeah, glad to see people appreciate how good he's been for us this year, we certainly do.

2216~~~
He did pretty well against Kane, then everything went tits up.

2217~~~
I think the problem was he was entirely focused on Kane. Whether that was our game plan or not, it worked in nullifying him but players like Lamela and Eriksen (particularly when Fosu-Mensah went off) came to life in the final third mishaps. Blind and the two defensive midfielders having relatively poor games didn't help either.

2218~~~
Still think that he was the biggest culprit on the first goal.  It wasn't a risky ball and he decided to do it all by himself when everything was covered from Blind and Morgan, in the process disorganising the defense.

His tendency of Phil Jonesing every ball is annoying.

2219~~~
It's not his fault Blind is incapable of winning headers. It's clearly down to the instructions, Smalling is always battling the aerials duels even on Blind's side which always leaves lot of space behind him.

Also, even if he messed it up, if Blind simply tracked Alli earlier he could have prevented the goal.

2220~~~
I wouldn't blame Smalling and Blind today. I thought Rojo and Darmian were the main culprit we conceded 3 goals. Rojo was awful today, got beaten easily in defense, can't win header and not good enough going forward. And Darmian is just too slow typical of serie A player.

2221~~~
If it is instructed then yep, sure, but otherwise it is sheer incompetence.

2222~~~
Yeah, I agree with that, but I seriously think it's down to the instruction. Van Gaal said we conceeded first goal because Smalling <i>lost</i> a header, which probably means he is fine with him being there in the first place.

2223~~~
think he was pretty good, having liabilities like Darmian and Blind and a rookie player around is not helping him, need to find that partner for him

2224~~~
True, there a lot down to Blinds aerial incompetence basically Smalling has to do that side of his job. There was an aerial shot of that error and to me blind should not have gone for that, there were 3 defenders back at the time and he should have positioned himself to cover the left side and left Smalling to go into getting the header. Smalling needed a better partner at the back to take the load off him, he'll be a better player.
Rojo is a CB, a better defender and CB than Blind but he's playing at LB because he's got more pace than Blind, Rojo passing is not much worse than Blinds so there no loss there if he was to play at CB. He'd look a lot better at CB alongside Smalling. As for Darmian, we coincided 3 in the first 10 minutes of him coming on i believe. At a game like this it's not easy coming on as a subbed defender and getting a grip on the game straight away, the tempo, speed and instant pressure is extremely difficult to instantly adapt to, if he had started the game his performance would have been alot better. Poor management again from 1 Bollocks.

2225~~~
Just no.

2226~~~
Based on opinions of him playing at LB?

2227~~~
Based on the 19 appearances he has made at CB for us. It doesn't matter what position he is playing, his passing is no where near Blind's. He is also barely faster than Blind, he got outran by Carrick just a couple games ago. Blind is a better CB, a better LB, and just an overall better footballer than Rojo. It really isn't even close and is frankly laughable how someone could suggest Rojo's passing is anywhere near as good as Blind's.

2228~~~
To be honest, I'm not a big fans of Rojo as a CB either. He hasn't convinced me to be able to do a good job as a CB last season. Blind this season is much better than Rojo last season.

2229~~~
What's Blinds passing forward been like lately, pass it short or hoof it up, I'm sure Rojo more than capable of doing that, earlier in the season he was playing better passes but now he's no different to any of the defenders. Blind a better left back you must be joking, the last time I seen him at left back he barely got forward players were running past him at will and he was nowhere in sight once they got past him, at least Rojo can keep up to them and apply a bit of pressure. Blind is not good enough as a left back, only plays a CB due to his passing and he's not exactly great at his preferred position DM. He'll be one of the players that will be dropped if we bring in a new manager. Not good enough to be a UTD DM, CB or LB.
The point I made about Rojo is that having him at CB Smalling wouldn't have to do his heading side of the game and would be able to stick to his position thus making our defensive line more stable and not leaving holes in it. That's were our problem is defensive structure is lost every time a long ball is played.

2230~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The funniest thing I have heard in this forum. Blind wasn't good going forward at LB? If you want to know how he is at LB, watch the games from last season where he played at LB. we beat spurs Liverpool city and all. He was involved in most of our attacks with young and Fellaini. So either you don't watch our games or you make stuff up to win arguments.

2231~~~
His first pass of the game was absolutely atrocious. A mixed bag after that.

2232~~~
Needs someone more physical next to him, blind is an intelligent defender but doesn't have the physical attributes, put Mensah next to him, what have we got to lose now?

2233~~~
Yep, it was atrocious under no pressure at all. What's new though. His form has become really patchy after an excellent start to the season.

2234~~~
Yep, if is is instructed, then that makes Van Gaal a bigger idiot than he is now. You hardly see Pique going all over the place and winning headers in Mascherano position, despite that Mascherano is worse than Blind at headers (actually, Blind isn't that bad at them, he has around 50% success rate and he won headers against Lukaku who might be the most physical player in the league). In that particular instance, it was kind of crazy because there was absolutely no risk and there was a good chance than Morgan or Blind would win it. The Smalling went there, pushed Blind on his arse, lost the header and the only defender remaining was Darmian who has been a bit useless since the first few games.

It is very ironic that this miscommunication (or Smalling not trusting Blind) comes only a few days after Smalling said that him and Blind trust each other, have a great partnership etc etc.

2235~~~
If he's that good as a LB why isn't he playing there, he's shite all round.

2236~~~
Wow

2237~~~
Please explain what's he's good at. Please explain why we have his CB partner covering for him and leaving gaping holes in the defence which the RB has to cover leaving a gaping hole on the right side. It's a joke people back this kind of player. He's not good enough to be a starting CB, LB or DM but it's okay he can pass the ball or more accurately hoof it to Fellaini (he's another problem).

2238~~~
Pretty sure what was down to TFM following Ericksen inside, and nothing to do with covering for Blind. We haven't really seen that all season expect when Varela had a similar man marking job to do.

I think right now he should be starting CB with the current squad, but I would hope we upgraded on him in the summer.
I think he is a good player in a number of positions, fair enough probably shouldn't be starting but to say he is shite all round I don't agree.

2239~~~
he played well as a CB so why would we play him as a LB?

2240~~~
Rio was never a one man defence.

2241~~~
He was. During the pre Vidic times he single-handedly lead the defense. The defense leaked goals for fun prior to his arrival and once again leaked goals when he got suspended.

2242~~~
We were at times good defensively pre-Vidic, but Rio had plenty of sloppy moments as did our defence. It was only when Rio had Vidic next to him when our defence was really excellent. Before that Rio and whoever his partner were prone to getting bullied by physically strong strikers.

2243~~~
But if Smalling isn't the physical CB then what does he bring? He's certainly not a ball player. It's an awkward one.

2244~~~
He is the physical CB. He just needs a partner who can win his headers, have some pace, as well as play competently with the ball at his feet. That's why I'd love Marquinhos - he is very good on the ball, lightening quick and has a very impressive leap.

2245~~~
I would agree in saying that he should be the physical CB. The team is so ***-jointed that I don't think it's fair to judge any player this season.

2246~~~
In 2001-2002 United (ie the season between Stam departure and Rio's signing) ended up 3rd, 10 points away from Arsenal. Our GA was 45, which placed us 6th behind Chelsea. The season after (we bought Rio), we won the EPL title with a GA of 34 IE 11 less Goals against then the season before. The season after, Rio got suspended (it kickstarted in January 2004) and we ended up 3rd again. That kick started a spending spree which saw us signing Heinze (2004), Vidic and Evra (2006). That's how important our Rio was in his first years with us. 

The defense pre Rio and post Stam was shit. Irwin and Blanc were ancient (ancient museum level), Wes and Johnsen were constantly riddled with injuries, Silvestre was hilarious, May was amazingly still a United player and we had the Nevilles. No wonder why SAF decided to invest heavily in the defense in the next years.

2247~~~
However this is not a Rio thread so lets stop to that (or else we discuss the matter in a separate thread)

2248~~~
If you purely want to look at defensive record, we've conceded 30 goals this season and have the second best defensive record in the league. 

Our goals (A) from 02/03 and 05/06 (Pre-Vidic), was 34, 35, 26, and 34. Those aren't particularly special numbers barring one season and not actually very different to this season's tally.

The same for the years when we won the league thrice on the trot (with Vidic joining Rio) was 27, 22 and 24.  

Now, I do think looking at simple statistics like this can often result in missing the true picture as there are so many other factors involved, but to me it was clear from watching us from 02/03 to 05/06 that we lacked a defender who could physically dominate. And that's where your Rio "one man defence" theory fails. If he was a one man defence, he wasn't a complete one. Otherwise fans wouldn't have been begging for a no nonsense CB which there was a clamour for. So it's a bit unfair to claim that Smalling isn't a one man defence when even Rio really wasn't.

2249~~~
He's good because he can pass, he's good because he needs Smalling to cover him for headers? I don't get it. Did you see at any point vertonghen cover for alderweireld or vise versa? No both held their own, something blind can't do and that affects our defensive stability. We can look at stats and say it's all good whilst Smalling is covering for him but when there an error like yesterday it clear as day it's a weakness of ours and an issue that needs addressing

2250~~~
It's not tfm fault, he has to tuck inside, every time Smalling has to cover for Blind the right back has to tuck inside to cover smalling (its something darmian has struggled with) and if our wide man is not there to cover the RB it's a huge problem, its not an issue we should be having, having spent 300m. This is also evident in attack, having this issue does not allow to field attack minded player on the right wing because we become exposed in this area, its okay to play defensive Winger like young or Lingard because they'll track back and cover but we then lack in numbers when transition into attack. All this because 1 is not fit enough to do his job and I'm not talking about jones

2251~~~
I was't saying it was his fault, it seemed like an odd tactical decision to me rather than Blinds fault. TFM looked to be man marking Ericksen is all I was saying

2252~~~
I agree he had to do that everytime Smalling had moved out of position to cover blind but when the defensive line was intact alli was his man. If you watch the game again there were time tfm didn't know where to position himself, does he stick with his man or cover Smalling every time he went to cover for Blind. This is an issue that need dealing but so many overlook it because he can play a pass.

2253~~~
There were plenty of times where Vertonghen and alderweireld had to cover for each other this season. And they would have done that if we attacked more (actually when martial went on his run Vertonghen and dier had to cover him for alderweireld). Blind has shown time and again that he is an able CB. Your whole 'he is playing there only because he can pass' is something I would expect a Liverpool fan to say to irritate a united fan. Not to mention the 'he's shite all around' and 'Smalling has been making him look good all season' comments which is absolute nonsense once again. Many football writers have praised Blind playing as a CB this season so either you are wrong or they are. And it's not very difficult to decide who is.

2254~~~
Replace Smalling and buying a right footed blind is the solution?

2255~~~
TBF Rio's biggest weakness was his concentration. He had great potential as a young defender but he was really daft at times. We collapsed in the second half of the 03-04 season when he got banned.

2256~~~
Like I said in Blind's thread, it was a very good CB partnership outing for the two of them. I think he needs to watch how handsy he gets though, refs are going to start looking to pull him up on it.

2257~~~
Looked after Carroll well for most of the game, which I can imagine, is not easy.

2258~~~
Carroll, Kane, Lukaku and Aguero in the last 4 games have got very little out of him (and Blind). Comfortably one of our better performers this season if not the best.

2259~~~
Smalling will start to look even better if he has a strong partner next to him.

2260~~~
Agreed, in one on one duals hes been really good. Its nice to have a defender who can defend. Just wish his distribution was better than it is or he wasnt scared to come out with the ball and make a decisive forward pass like Rio used to.

2261~~~
Definitely.

2262~~~
Lost Carroll again on the corner, wasn't able to get a good hold of his shirt this time.

2263~~~
As long as Blind won his share of headers <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2264~~~
His lack of composure when dealing with loose balls is really starting to piss me off.

Time and time again he's clearing balls straight back to the opposition, slicing through clearances or just getting a crap contact on the ball. For our first choice centerback, he rarely looks like he has things under control and that nervousness must filter through to the rest of the team.

That cross at the end where West Ham put the ball in the net but it was offside, kind of sums its up. Jumping to clear a waist high cross, swinging a leg at it and missing then heading the clearance straight to a West Ham player.

2265~~~
Solid performance today, been getting back to his best I feel.

2266~~~
Opposition should press other players and leave him open for a pass. Then once he receives it, dont press him, just mark other players.
He will either run forward and then pass it back or boot it to the opposition player 90% of the time. :P

2267~~~
Gosh darn it, he was bleedin brilliant today, me thought. That one time where he toyed with Adebayor in a race was brilliant. Just before that, Adebayor had shrugged off and out paced Blind like Blind wasn't there. Smalling's physique is immense. Better on the ball today, but acres of space.

2268~~~
Long live Mike Smelling.

2269~~~
Not sure what game you were watching? Blind bossed adebayor sako and at times even Zaha today. Both CBs were faultless

2270~~~
My MOTM, tucked Adebayor in time and again and strode around like the cock of the walk back there.

2271~~~
Calm down - I wasn't criticising Blind - I thought he was good, but he was still out paced and out muscled by Adebayor earlier in the game. He got away with it because Adebayor clumsily lost the ball over the line for a goal kick. It was a one time incident, jeez

2272~~~
Absolutely brilliant, and this thread is almost like a tomb. He makes defending look so easy, but I love the way he wrestles with the attacker in aerial duels from goal kicks - he pressures them only to fall back and then pressure them again - great play time and time again.

2273~~~
Sorry man I didn't mean to sound rude. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

And ya I think we both are in agreement there. Both were good today.

2274~~~
Beast mode today, like at the beginning of the season. Very happy to see it!

2275~~~
Thought it was an easy game tbf. We probably should have rested one of him and Blind.

2276~~~
His standards are so high after early season we barely get excited when he goes into beast mode, he spoils us.

2277~~~
Best CB in the league this season, had a blip not too long ago but didn't last long. Bossing it.

2278~~~
Hes the best one on one defender in the world, doesnt mean hes the best CB but his height, strength and lighting pace make him a nightmare for even the best players. Very easy game from him today but was nonetheless flawless.

2279~~~
Think it was good to have a game like that just before the match on Saturday.

I was worried that he may have been injured, but thankfully he ran it off. Another game like this against Lukaku on Saturday will be great.

2280~~~
He's back in form after a patchy period. He and Blind have been sublime is the last few weeks.

2281~~~
They really have. I have been very skeptical of Blind, but they compliment each other well, even if there are things I would like to see improved.

2282~~~
Isn't Lukaku already too far inside Smalling's pocket to show up for the match on Saturday?

2283~~~
Lukaku climbed out of Smalling's pocket for our match against them a couple of weeks back. Of course, on that occasion he climbed straight into Blind's.

Hopefully both of them can do the job against him again on the weekend.

2284~~~
He's currently in Sakho's pocket

2285~~~
A little too fond of pockets perhaps?

2286~~~
Glad the own goal didn't end up costing us, he went with the wrong leg but why was he over Blind and Rojo';s side to begin with?

2287~~~
Because he was marking lukaku and lukaku came in.

2288~~~
Yeah, I think the fault is mainly on Rojo for gifting a player so good at crossing such space to put it into that area. Smalling should really be doing better though.

2289~~~
That is just an idiotic mistake to go with your right foot in that situation. Give him a bollocking for that and he won't do it again.

2290~~~
Not his best performance. On another day Lukaku would of had a hattrick.

2291~~~
Very poor mistake.

2292~~~
Poor decision from Smalling to lead with his stronger foot rather than the foot that would have put it out for a corner. His instep has just curled it in. 

He had a decent game bar that mistake though. Not his very best, but he handled everything else pretty well. Lukaku was doing everything right apart from the finish, and was tough to handle.

2293~~~
Unfortunate to see, thought he was coming back into form recently.

2294~~~
He had a good game, error aside, did another good job on Lukaku.

2295~~~
Good performance but its always true that one mistake can ruin your day as a CB and that wasnt a great moment. That being said all players make mistakes and his overall performance was class.

2296~~~
Awful defending for the goal.

2297~~~
Doesn't deserve the own goal because I thought he played well. But one single error can change everything. I have seen smalling used his left foot to clear the ball so to me he loses his concentration for a moment and made that silly error.

2298~~~
Normally good against the big powerful forwards but Lukaku was all over him today. Don't think he will go for a silly clearance like that again.

2299~~~
Probably the worst mistake ive seen him make since his sending off against City. But glad it didnt cost us.

Overall I thought he had a good performance (bar that) and his handling of Lukaku was well done. Hes handled Caroll, Kane, Lukaku (twice) really well.

2300~~~
I thought his game was riddled with mistakes today.. 
The early Lukaku chances were all avoidable and a series of episodes in the second half were he kept losing his position and not recovering well enough to stabilise the backline. Thought he is the reason it was chaotic on our right side of defence.
That said he made it very uncomfortable for Lukaku and won the psychological battle.

2301~~~
Blind handled Lukaku on the first match, not him. Even yesterday, for a large part of the match, Blind was on Lukaku.

He missed Caroll for his goal.

He definitely handled Kane well in both matches. though.

I think that he has been very average (to not say poor) for the large majority of matches since end of November. Don't have any idea what people are watching.

2302~~~
When did Carroll score past us?

2303~~~
Another good performance from Smalling, apart from the own goal, of course. This is something he'll have to try and get out of his game, though. It's not the first time he's gone with his furthest foot when clearly. Unfortunately, it resulted in an own goal yesterday. Other than that, he did a good job.

2304~~~
Sorry, it was his assist(essentially Smalling completely lost Carroll and then Carroll returned the header for a tap in to some other player).

Around 3 min in the video: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxMPhPmlPE0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2305~~~
He was blocked off, that happens in set pieces. For those occasions however second ball is always important.

Also Smalling was on Lukaku as much as blind if not more during open play. eg the deflected OG he moved across with him a few times. Still Lukaku should have scored a few, but the only one that could be resultant of Smalling is the one where his bad touch meant he had to kick it straight at DDG from out wide.

2306~~~
Emenike hardly got in his way and he was completely lost by that point anyway. Carroll lost him on the turn and Smalling was a good yard behind from then on. It does happen on set pieces, quite often too, because for how good Smalling has been and how good he is in the air, he can't mark a man on a corner for shit.

2307~~~
Shouldn't he have handed him off to Blind when he went into his zone though?

He went with the wrong foot on his wrong side, slow thinking on his part but unlucky as well. Rojo is our b biggest liability in the back 4 right now I'd say.

2308~~~
Eh on the own goal. Had he gone with his weaker foot and that had gone in, people would be saying he had time to make a simple clear with his stronger foot. It actually did look like a simple clearance but, obviously with the speed of the cross, was slightly mistimed and came off the shin. Pretty much happens all game to every player, not making the right contact. Played quite well overall - so onwards and upwards.

2309~~~
People would be idiots then. You clear that ball with your left foot every single time.

2310~~~
He's good at what he does generally, but you get the sense that he doesn't trust his technical ability in certain situations. This is most obvious on the numerous occasions that he tries to bring the ball out to start attacks, but then opts for the safest pass from promising positions. Prior to the own goal, there was an instance where Smalling was on the ball, and the best option available to him was a long pass to a stationary Valencia out on the wing, but he just seemed reluctant to attempt it. He did play the pass in the end, but it was overhit and went out of play.

It seemed to me like the own goal was an extension of that same reluctance and lack of trust.

2311~~~
Don't understand how people can say he had a good game.

Lukaku should of had at least a hattrick. In a game where so many clear cut chances are made, often by the striker himself, how can either of the CB's have a good game?

2312~~~
Yeah he didn't have a good game really. Lukaku not scoring was through a combination of poor finishing, great goalkeeping and luck rather than us marking him out of the game or anything. I suppose we did well in last ditch blocks and clearances off the line but you won't get away with that every week. And the own goal was just poor, tried to clear it with the wrong foot because he was panicking.

Smalling hasn't been as good as he was pre Xmas and he's had a few dodgy moments in the last few months but he's still been one of our better performers this season.

2313~~~
Strange game from him, seemed less involved than usual and didn't tuck up Ulloa the way I expected.

2314~~~

2315~~~
Madness. He was a rock before christmas for certain, but De Gea once again, and even arguably martial has had a larger impact.

EDIT: Perhaps not madness, thats too strong.

2316~~~
Called it.

2317~~~
Fully deserved.

2318~~~
Well deserved. Players weren't going to vote De Gea again and he'd been the next best. Bit unfortunate for Martial but what can you do.

2319~~~
It's the players award. Most self respecting players wouldn't have been happy about De Gea pratting about at the start of the season wanting to leave.

2320~~~
Well done Chris.

2321~~~
He's been superb this season. Great to see it being recognised by the players. Well deserved

2322~~~
Smalling, our players player of the year.

Without 2 DMs and negative tactics our defence including Smalling have been poor.  Everytime we've gone with attacking intent we have looked awful at the back, with Smalling generally just pulling at shirts.

Players player of the season, says it all really.

2323~~~
Nah

2324~~~
Excellent, very pleased for him.

2325~~~
I'm pleased in the sense that I hope it gives him the belief to take it to another level now.

2326~~~
Well, he's been our second or third best of course. It makes more sense to give him the title than DDG. De Gea already knows how amazing he is. So... Great choice. We'd be incredibly daft to mind the choice.

2327~~~
Nice that he gets some recognition but, honestly, the players must be on crack. DDG all the way.

2328~~~
Should have gone to a Martial. Smalling had a great start to the season ,but I don't even think he has been out best c.b since the turn of the year.

2329~~~
Well liked in the dressing room then.. Great sign considering he is likely to be our captain going forward.

2330~~~
I think DDG should have got both awards. Smalling was good for some months, but then has been average.
Anyways a defender and keeper take away the key awards. Not a good sign for Utd.

2331~~~
Not sure how he won that. He was superb in the first half of the season but Blind has out performed him over the last 3 or so months.

De Gea has comfortably been our best player. Maybe the players saw it as a way to encourage him and acknowledge his importance in the team.

2332~~~
Dominated Jerome today.

2333~~~
motm for me

2334~~~
Very comfortable for him today. Can't be many strikers in the Premier league as poor as Jerome.

2335~~~
My MOTM. Brilliant throughout and that header near the end he won out of pure hunger was unbelievable.

2336~~~
Close to his early season form today. Probably should have got himself a goal too.

2337~~~
How does he have an average rating of 6.4 for this season ? Cafe drunk.

2338~~~
Monstrous header at the end.

2339~~~
He was brilliant. 

Him and Mata only ones coming away with credit.

2340~~~
Beast, he loves them physical battles.

2341~~~
He was like Vidic in that second half.

2342~~~
Valencia too.

2343~~~
He needs to work on a few things to be top bracket player:

-Passing and coming out with the ball
-Attacking / directing the ball when hes in the oppositions box 

But a lovely performance at CB today esp second half.

2344~~~
Good game, my MOTM, he won everything in the air and pretty much manned it on his own back there while Rojo wandered about.

2345~~~
Had a fairly comfortable game, but that 1 header to clear the ball from mbokani was absolutely majestic! 

Came out of nowhere, mbokani couldn't believe it he thought he was gonna score <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2346~~~
Would have lost this without him.

2347~~~
He was a monster today.

2348~~~
Excellent game. He's really stepped up this season. His passing isn't tremendous, but the rest of his game is really good. He's probably the second name on the game sheet (after De Gea), and has turned into a leader. If only Jones had developed in a similar fashion!  He can hold his head high, despite our poor form this campaign.

2349~~~
Anyone who holds a clean sheet while is partnered with Rojo, deserves the ultimate respect.

2350~~~
May have saved him from a red as well.

2351~~~
Yep did well against Jerome thought i'd almost fancy myself against him he's that bad. The hoofing the ball straight of play under limited pressure was annoying though but think we pretty much have to accept that he's always going to be an oaf on the ball. So important that we have a proper ball playing defender alongside him to make up for this.

2352~~~
If Carroll had scored there it would of summed up how headless he can be at times.

2353~~~
Needs to stop manhandling strikers .he's   been penalized for that before. Dont give Dean ammunition.

2354~~~
he's not strong like vidic , and not great on the ball like rio. but has been the best cb we've had. need a new one to pair with mike.

2355~~~
He actually won a shit load of headers tonight, but we're playing against a team who repeatedly put balls into the box and we've got one player on the pitch brave enough to head the ball, only going to end one way, especially with us making sure we gave Payet as many free kicks as possible.

2356~~~
Horror show, has been since the Wolfsburg injury.

2357~~~
He did well against the Geordie Ibra I thought, especially with Blind having a mare next to him.

2358~~~
He's surrounded by shit. Don't want to blame him too much but I guess everyone bar martial is fair game right now.

2359~~~
Worst game since City, but he actually won the most headers <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>.

2360~~~
He was Carroll's personalized backpack

2361~~~
Good CB, will never be top class. Again an overhyped player on here. He is the only one who is anywhere close to a CB in our squad though.

2362~~~
I thought blind handled caroll better on a few occasions when he had to. Smalling improved a lot no doubt but he gave me a new scare that every time he has to defend in the box, i feel like we will give a penalty, set pieces or not. Gotta learn when to mark tightly and when to ease off. Rio was excellent at that.

2363~~~
He was supposed to clean every ball from our box, and people criticise him. Great stuff.

2364~~~
Was he supposed to go wandering into the oppo half trying to play a ball he had no chance of getting leaving his man in 30 yards of space ?

Is he supposed to be completely unable to give passes IN FRONT of his man instead of directly to where they are standing ?

2365~~~
No, but then Blind wasn't supposed to be 30 yards behind his defence either. 

As for the passing, our midfielders were probably even worse than him.

2366~~~
Chris Smalling at times has to defend for the entire team, yet he still gets criticized? Rojo and Valencia can't position themselves and Blind wanders on the ball constantly. During freekicks and corners, he is the only one heading the ball away and for some reason the 1 mistake he makes that didn't even cost us is entirely his fault. Besides, when he went up Blind should have gone up too and Carroll would have been offside.

2367~~~
That people portray him as some sort of Forrest Gump type character, exempt from blame due to his obliviousness to the world around him and unable to participate in any sense really doesn't speak much about him. 

He made 0 tackles tonight and conceded 3 fouls.

2368~~~
Only criticism I have for him is that set-piece wrestling he always gets involved in. He's constantly doing his best Martin Skrtel impersonation. Track the man, attack the ball. Don't attack the man and ignore the ball.

2369~~~
Awful

2370~~~
He couldn't organise a Filofax

2371~~~
He's had a pretty average second half of the season, which I'd say still makes him our third best player. He hasn't been perfect but he's so far away from being a problem.

2372~~~
Good defender but I think he needs a proper leader next to him Somebody like Rio/Vidic. I dont see him as a leader which is a bit sad.

2373~~~
He is our most over rated player by absolute miles.

People treat him as if he's world class on here.

He's nowhere near that, he's not in top 5 cbs in the league, let alone top 10.

2374~~~
Was shocking tonight. Got pulled all over the shop.

2375~~~
Been average since Christmas and how he got club player of the year I don't know.

However he is probably the least of our problems, atleast he can stay fit.

Phil Jones on the other hand is stealing a wage, all he has done all season is pull a couple of faces, get injured and piss around with his mobile phone on the bus floor tonight.

2376~~~
Bloody hell, I don't know what's more shocking, the result or this thread. He's the only defender that can come out of that game with his head held high. Blind was at fault for all 3 goals and could have been at fault for more.

2377~~~
Showed no leadership yesterday and was part of a horrible back 4

2378~~~
I don't expect him from the level of leadership like gray or keane or vidic or rio.

But, at least fecking communicate a bit better. He is at this club forever and know the league well. At least talk to your defenders around.

2379~~~
Did not have a bad game but these unnecessary physical combats he gets involved in does not help the team. Blind did not have a good game either but I believe Smalling made it all chaotic for everyone and allow West Ham to keep getting back into the game through Carroll win fouls.

2380~~~
I actually like to see smalling vs carroll duels.

Carroll had so much time to build up their play. He is known to be good at heading the ball so it is ok to say smalling didn't get the better of it. But, he didn't do well enough to shut Carroll out on the ground.

2381~~~
Somehow wasn't our worst defender today, despite that it was a genuinely 1/10 display.

Made Carroll look like Adriano.

2382~~~
So, I am too lazy to check that kind of stats atm.

But overall whoscored gave both of blind and smalling 6.25 despite blind's 'faults' with 3 goals. While carroll got 2nd highest rating in their team whose main marker was smalling.

So....

2383~~~
He isn't overrated. Few people have been praising him recently. He was genuinely world class in the autumn. I don't know what happened. He was first to every ball, stood his ground, made great tackles. He just doesn't now.

2384~~~
His form has dropped off something fierce since the start of the season.

2385~~~
He really is. People were calling him the best defender in the league after he performed well for two matches. Even a month ago, there were people who were calling him great, best CB in the league, etc etc.

I said quite early on the season, that I don't see him as a starter on a top team that regularly competes for trophies. Obviously, we have more concerns at the moment (upgrades on striker, right winger, central midfield, and arguably right back position and left center back), but eventually his position needs to be upgraded too if we ever hope of reaching top level.

He's good enough to be our third center back though, but that's it. Too limited technique, bad positioning, and acts like a headless chicken at least twice per match.

2386~~~
But half the time he was behind Carroll yet trying to wrestling him off a ball he was never getting to. It's not only Carroll this, he does it with all big striker. 
You'll notice in the second half they stopped feeding Carroll on goal and started using him as link to win fouls or drag Smalling out of position.

2387~~~
He absolutely did have a bad game. 
Shocking display at the most crucial of times. He's had a good season but has gone awol in our two biggest games this season. Wolfsburg and last night.

2388~~~
Well, it is why smalling has a way to go to be 'top class' defenders. He needs to be able to handle big strikers a bit better especially EPL has plenty.

He has almost all attributes but I think he has to be a tad clever with how he does things like Rio did when he couldn't use brute force only to do the job.

Blind in fact handled Carroll well at one moment and Carroll fouled him from behind and got a card. Blind is good at handling against brute force strikers usually. Just not against fast ones who smalling does against better.

2389~~~
The balance isn't right and he ends up trying to overcompensate for Blind's physical shortcomings, particularly on the aerial ball.

Blind is ace but he cannot continue long-term as a CB and almost certainly won't under a manager like Mourinho. I actually want to see him in midfield again, am sure he would do at least ten times better then the performance Schneiderlin produced yesterday.

2390~~~
He was the best defender in the league in the first half of the season and that's when people were calling him that. Just because he has been shit since then doesn't mean he wasn't great at the time. It wasn't two matches he performed in. I haven't had the impression that people were heaping praise on him a month ago. I'm sure there was some but far from a significant number.

2391~~~
Blind should not be long term cb true.

But, smalling's hype. I think he is a good defender. But what does blind's weakness have anything to do with smalling's sometimes being shit at passing the ball 10 yards or not being able to get the ball on the ground from his main man, trying to take off their shirts, using wrong foot to block off shots only to score own goals, leaving his man to press someone else into the other team's half and wrestling them to the ground etc?

It is all about one vs one defending, He usually does well against pacey strikers which he has to cover for blind but what about the other areas?

2392~~~
He's surrounded by mediocrity. Get a proper full on CB next to him and he can spend a bit more time working on his ball playing skills and less on how to cover the failings of the man next to him.

2393~~~
Just like Skrtel he can't help himself but to use arms and pull people shirts all the time, he could be gulity of giving away penalty every match if refs weren't so incompetent.

2394~~~
His ball playing is the last he should worry atm.

His defending not even as a pair but individual level has been a bit meh lately. So he should improve on that first.

2395~~~
I think it has something to do with lack of awareness with the whole thing. He has to touch/pull someone to feel where his marker is to defend instead of using positioning, calculating and pure instinct to be at places and sniff out the ball/danger before it puts you in bad positions. IF you have to pull someone that much, your balance will always be off for the ball because your body is adjusting the other player, not for the ball.

2396~~~
He was being called the best defender in the league in August, after literally two great games.

He wasn't the best defender in the league in the first half of the season considering that he was crap in December which counts as first half of the season. However, he was very good (probably even the best in the league) from August to November.

2397~~~
He was rubbish yesterday, he was amongst many in fairness to him. The whole defence was pretty much poor bar Valencia who I thought was reasonable. I still don't get this complete lack of any blame he gets for anything though, when he makes a mistake it's brushed off as it being because Blind is next to him which is ridiculous. He's a good defender, he's not a great one unfortunately. In these kinds of matches he should be stepping up and being an absolute force, instead he went missing and nearly set up a couple of goals himself. Ive been an advocate of Blind saying he's a good centre back (I still think he is) but after watching Smalling for the last few months it's clear he needs someone much better than him next to him. Someone who can actually get a defence organised and can stand up and be counted for when we're having a hard time of it. 
It's a shame because at the start of the season he was really good, but he's been just good for a while now, you can't just be good at Manchester United.

2398~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ffs, he's highlighted too much by commentators, the thing is everybody, EVERYBODY does it, pushes, pulls in the box is just part of the game. he was punished for that once and since that he hasnt commited other penalty, Evans has been getting away with it his whole career..

starts to get annoying like everyone is getting on the back of our best players just out of frustration, smalling is least of our problems..
the only problem I have with him that he can climb really high to get to the header but he cant finish, and he's the only header of the ball when comes to defensive headers so give him a break..

2399~~~
I stand by it <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2400~~~
Couldn't have said it better myself. Have him stop babysitting somebody who can't defend inside the box and is prone to going running off into no mans land to do god knows what and get someone who can defend and he can share his role and develop a partnership with. This whole Smalling-Blind partnership has been pretty excruciating to watch, that sequence today where Blind was on the touch line was just awe inspiring. Smalling has a bit of a scan around and doesn't even know where Daley is and just charges after the ball. Ugly.

2401~~~
Don't remember Rio or Vida constantly pulling other players shirt, and didn't notice that because of commentators but because it's so obvious. And so what he's our better player, that makes him immune for criticism?

I really like him, think he's by far our best defender, that's why I would like him to cut with that shirt pulling since he has enough ability to mark players without it.

2402~~~
Vidic did it all the time, he was often refered to as the master of that sort of stuff

2403~~~
I like the driving runs but he needs to work on his distribution at the end of them, he seems to get excited and fluff the pass.

2404~~~
De Gea looked like he wanted to knock him out after the OG!

2405~~~
No he didn't.

2406~~~
The own goal was unfortunate, happens to all defenders at some point in their career.

2407~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2408~~~
How many own goals has he scored this season? I can only think of the one v Everton in the FA Cup semi and today.

Couldn't really help it in fairness.

2409~~~

2410~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2411~~~
Was good near the end of the match when he was our only player in the box for the corner, shame we played it short

2412~~~
Can someone teach this man how to pass ?

2413~~~
He's been really poor for most of 2016. At the Euro's everyone outside England's going to be asking what all the fuss was about because no doubt he'll be exposed at that level in this form. Might even get himself sent off with the amount of stupid fouls he's making.

2414~~~
At least at euros he won't be the only one who will defend in his own box. I literally can't remember Bljnd or Valencia winning header in our box all game.

2415~~~
He's regressed badly.

He was so good earlier this season.

2416~~~
We're gonna concede so many fouls and goals at the Euros if he starts. He's a fecking clumsy idiot.

2417~~~
He's just not a top level footballer. 

Wildly over rated on here.

2418~~~
I was shocked by how slow he looked in that sprint with Wickham.

2419~~~
Really hope if/when we get Mourinho he has a word with the player and stops all the over-exerted shirt pulling and trying to win every ball instantly, instead reading and intercepting the play with his physically as back-up.

2420~~~
Overrated

2421~~~
Oh Chris, so stupid.

2422~~~
Sent off. 

It was coming.

2423~~~
fecking brainless

2424~~~
Thicket player ive ever seen play.

2425~~~
Shat it today

2426~~~
This. Massively. Hasn't been particularly good for the second half of the season.

2427~~~
Jones is thicker

2428~~~
Idiot

2429~~~
He's a twat. Clueless player.

2430~~~
Fecking idiot.

2431~~~
Mongy twat. Get fecked you cnut.

2432~~~
Been saying all season he's not that good and he's just a physically good athlete.

Not even that today!

2433~~~
Dumb cnut of the highest order

2434~~~
5 seconds til half time, 20 yards in the opposition half. Absolutely stupid!

2435~~~
This has been going on for so long. He's such an idiot. What on earth is he doing?

2436~~~
Pathetic display.

Hopefully Mourinho brings in a defender with some brains.

2437~~~
fecking stupid! Mental. You're a professional footballer.

2438~~~
He shouldn't have been beaten to the ball in the first place, he got in too close and allowed himself to be turned.

2439~~~
Idiot

2440~~~
He's had a nightmare today.

2441~~~
Pot meet kettle.

Shocking defending mind.

2442~~~
Nope, this is his level. Those two-three months have been an outlier, what are we showing since then is what we have seen from Smalling in the previous four seasons.

2443~~~
Christ. He's been great all season. Everyone makes a mistake.

2444~~~
That was up there with the red card versus City. Absolutely moronic.

2445~~~
No where near the defender people think he is for me. 

He's good but he's just that - hopefully he continues to get better because right now it's still not good enough.

2446~~~
He's good but not as good as some think.  A lot to learn.

2447~~~
Stupid mistake.

2448~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Some kneejerk shit here. Comfortably our best defender all season.

2449~~~
We need two centre backs.

2450~~~
Our defenders are getting stupider over time.

2451~~~
Absolutely brainless there.

2452~~~
Been poor tonight

2453~~~
constantly has to grapple with people, why mate why

2454~~~
He's just not a top class defender. Tries to do too much in those kinds situation. Just hold the attacker up, ffs.

2455~~~
I've always said he's fecking shit

2456~~~
He's shite every time he's put under. Massively overrated player.

2457~~~
No hes just shit.

2458~~~
Course he's been great all season. But poor today and a ridiculous red.

2459~~~
Yeah, he's not that great a player. Clumsy and unintelligent. Hardly the traits you look for in a defender.

2460~~~
Bad mong. Hope he gets battered.

2461~~~
Been saying it on here for years, he'll never be a top class player because he's thick as pigshit and braindead. A mistake waiting to happen every game...he gets away with major clangers in most games.

2462~~~
That's Blind actually - who has made plenty of mistakes himself.

We don't have any top centre backs. Big hole in the team.

2463~~~
You lot are an embarrassment. One bad moment and it turns to vitriol.

2464~~~
85 yards from goal. Absolutely mind boggling decision to do that

2465~~~
No he hasn't he has been shocking since the middle of December.

2466~~~
Wally.

2467~~~
Incredible overreacting here. A stupid red and he should get the blame for that, but he's a solid defender. Ramos has had red cards more stupid than that.

2468~~~
Please can people stop using the word embarrassing. It's a fecking forum for people's opinions - how can they be embarrassing?

2469~~~
Blind has been better for large parts of the season. Imagine saying that at the start of the season!

2470~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What's wrong with you?

2471~~~
He's a solid defender. Not world class as many on this forum suggest. Also I wouldn't want Ramos near the club, one of the thickest players I've ever seen.

2472~~~
Classic knee-jerk reactions

2473~~~
If I was to say we should bomb all Muslims, do you think it'd be fair to say that's an embarrassing comment?

2474~~~
If you told us all your real name and location then yeah it would be but you're using a username. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2475~~~
Pretty bizarre logic there.

2476~~~
Shocking, really?

2477~~~
Is he banned for next Prem, Charity shield or FA Cup game?

Silly stuff all the same.

2478~~~
After having been outpaced in two similar situations he decides to be that tight on his man and guess what happened.

2479~~~
Come off it. Where does all the anger come from? The match day thread was full of it before his sending off. He's been very good this season. Remarkable improvement. And at the very very very least, much better than what some are saying. 

Ridiculous.

2480~~~
I hate this place sometimes. 

Brainless from him, but it happens, it's not like he wanted them to win. Poor second half of the seasson for him, but still our best defender by a mile.

2481~~~
Hyperbole possibly, but not far off. As has been said, Blind has been better for more of the season. Says everything about the quality of our centre backs that someone who seemingly has no natural position has out shone him.

2482~~~
I thought he's been pretty solid all season but each to his own.

2483~~~
You could argue he won us the game!

2484~~~
Behave, you're getting pelters for that in the pod.

2485~~~
I'm a big fan of Smalling but I'd say hes let himself down for the last period of the season. However its not like the defence around him are any better. Having to play with Rojo and Valencia (or worse) as your fullbacks will be a challenge for any CB

2486~~~
Palace were playing for pens until he got sent off... game opened up when he got sent off as they pushed on.

2487~~~
They were two one one against Blind if he didn't grab, total bollocks for the commentators to say it wasn't necessary! Can't believe, totally the right call and we got away with it. 7/10 despite Red Card which is crazy.

2488~~~
Necessary and professional

I don't know why he is being criticized

2489~~~
They were 70 yards from our goal even if they got past him, he wasn't the last man and they'd still need to beat DDG. It was a stupid tackle to make, this wasn't a Solskjaer v Newcastle scenario.

2490~~~
Come off it, if we hadn't won we'd be slating him! Poor decision making from him thankfully it didn't matter!

2491~~~
He should never have been in a position where he had to make that foul though. That was entirely his own doing.

2492~~~
Wrong. That was my opinion during the match as well

2493~~~
Idiotic decision, thought he'd truly turned a corner after the City game last year but still has much to work on to reach the top. Still think he's a quality defender though and is one player LVG can point to as a success under him

2494~~~
He's grabbed and pulled too much all season.  This time it happened to be at a bad time and at a bad position.  The toll was due sooner or later, and we almost paid for it.

I can't look at it as one off.  He damn near made it a habit.

2495~~~
I agree. He's surrounded by makeshift full backs and an inconsistent midfield. 

Regardless, it was yet another instance of how stupid he can be - against City last year, Newcastle earlier in the season and today. He's extremely lucky as he'd have been blamed had we lost.

2496~~~
This. For all the good he's done this season, there's still the annoying habit of getting stuck in way too high up the pitch, and then pulling and grabbing. 

Did the right thing to stop the break and take the red, but it wouldn't have been necessary had he not charged up against the bloke 35 yards from goal in the first place. 

Needs to watch more tape of Rio and learn how to be patient.

2497~~~
I thought me made the right decision when he got into that position.

His mistake was getting too tight in the first place, but not sure he had much other choice when he got beaten.

2498~~~
Foolish and lucky.

2499~~~
The mistake was getting tight when there was so much room for them to run in to. But once he got tight, he really had to haul him down. Not excusing it though. He had to stand off him in the first instance, especially knowing the two men who would end up chasing that counter attack would be Blind and/or Carrick. Tired legs, tired minds, we won the fecking cup so there's no point in picking it apart, especially as he's been one of our most dependable players in a pretty horrid season.

Thought he was decent up until that point anyway. It was a game of so many errors from all over the pitch, very scrappy, lots of grappling at every set piece, every cross. He made a lot of his usual monstrous headers deep in the box. His passing was very good too.

The absolute least of our worries right now.

2500~~~
He had no other choice. He could have done nothing and Palace would have scored. Nothing to say about this red card really - especially after the win.

2501~~~
Not for me, both bookings were weak and he should have performed better for both in my view.

2502~~~
Overall he has had a good season but he has struggled at times. His decision making isn't great and he cannot pass. Hopefully Mourinho can help him to build on a promising season.

2503~~~
How did he not get the better of Connor Wickham for pace? Isn't Wickham a lump?

2504~~~
Yeah, I was shocked by that. Haven't seen him outpaced all season and then Wickham does that to him. Probably just a momentary lapse.

2505~~~
I've thought it for sometime but he looks like hes been carrying a knock for the past few months now. 

Started the season so well but since March hes not been the same

2506~~~
Still his best season at the club, but did dip the 2nd half of the season. Tbh, he did play a lot of games.

2507~~~
He is being criticized because he didnt use a bit of common sense. Of course it might have been necessary but why on earth you put yourself in that situation. That's the question considering he had been having a hard time against that dude the whole match. Yet, tried to defend/approach the same and got fecked (again).

2508~~~
Regarding that Wickham footrace, in Smalling's defence maybe he misjudged his timing and because of that was always on the back foot. 

However, Wickham is a pretty good athlete (he had a decent game) and because of his stride, over that long distance was able to match and even beat Smalling. 

Acceleration means the most in those 1-5 yards to beat a player and get the ball past but long strides and powerful running can beat that over a longer distance (which we know doesn't actually happen that often in a game). 

That's the remarkable thing about Smalling, you can't beat him in tight spaces (1-5 yards) because you'll have to physically get past AND around him, then you got to beat him in a flat footed race. In the longer
distances, his size and stride usually means he gets into a good position to stop/tackle/intercept whoever he is against.

2509~~~
TBH, he does it a lot where he charges to the half way line to get so tight and then gets turned or beaten. I was shocked Wickham had him for pace though, wasnt exactly Vardy or something.

I do think hes thick though. As much as I like Smalling, I think hes a few elements away from being a top class player:
-Some of his decision making
-On the ball hes shocking in terms of United defenders.
-Hes a "nearly man" when attacking set pieces in the oppositions box.

When he leaves the comfort of the edge of his box or inside his own box, hes not great at all. Hes a good-beastly box defender imo.

2510~~~
Would benefit from having a much more experienced CB alongside him at the back to keep his concentration levels up at times.

Similar to the effect Puyol had on Pique, then again who wouldn't benefit from a Puyol like figure alongside them!

He was fantastic at the beginning of the season, but I think having Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger sitting deep alongside him helped a lot.

I really enjoyed watching Blind this season at CB more than Smalling, he really surprised me at times!

2511~~~
He's braindead.

2512~~~
I would agree with this. 

Still our best defender though, can't see why would we replace him before anyone else in our defence.

2513~~~
Good time to have his worst performance since the City game in 2014.... Didn't cost us thankfully. Had a great season though.

2514~~~
Wow. What a thread. Ridiculously harsh comments.

Bad mistake and 2 stupid yellow cards but he has been fantastic this season. A real breakthrough year for him. I shudder to think how bad the defence would have been without him.

2515~~~
hopefully our 2nd best cb next season with blind moving back to midf.

2516~~~
His form dropped severely in the second-half of the season unfortunately. I'll back him to find his best next season though. He just seems to have lost some of the confidence he had earlier and looks slow and clumsy, maybe a bit jaded after a long season.

2517~~~
Yeah his form dipped in the second half of the season, but in general I've felt like we're in safe hands with him. He can be clumsy/brain dead but he's a solid centre back, and a fair few strikers like Vardy have said he's the hardest centre back they've come up against

2518~~~
I'm standing by it still <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2519~~~
I don't know if he is the most overrated in the history of the caf but he sure is. He has had as much many good months as bad/average this season.

2520~~~
Duh. Because Wickham had a running start.

2521~~~
Exactly. You see him look back to Blind and see he would be 2 v 1 if he let his man go, and that was when he grabbed his leg and brought him down. Smart play with 10 minutes to go in a cup final.

Of course he shouldn't have been so tight to him in the first place.

2522~~~
Yeah, no. Getting sent off in extra time of a cup final is always brainless. He could have easily cost us the trophy.

2523~~~
Needs to stop grabbing at players. He's given away a penalty this season doing it and now he's got sent off. You'd think he'd have learnt his lesson. 


He will do the same for England and get sent off,and the press will vilify him. They love a phantomine villain afterall. 

Overall decent season. But a very disappointing end.
He almost cost us the cup,twice. In  the  semi and final.

2524~~~
Had he not given the foul away & hooked the foot, we'd most likely have lost the FA cup. Stupid decision at the time, but it did actually work for the team. Had a very mixed game, could possibly be carrying an injury, not seen him turned & out paced so often in a game for a long time.

2525~~~
Watching the highlights just now he absolutely did not need to make that challenge, anyone who thinks Palace were probably scoring if he didn't bring him down needs to watch it again.

It doesn't matter now of course, he's had an excellent season but he needs to cut out moments like that.

2526~~~
Harsh comments.

Had a ropey close to the season but then he's not had a rest. Must have played every minute of every game.

And bailed out arses out on many an occasion.

New CB signing is imperative even if we did decide to stick with Smalling-Blind partnership.

2527~~~
Stupid sending off, but a 4.7 rating overall is just ridiculous. He won every header before that and every physical battle. I was surprised that he didn't win the foot race against Wickham even though he started a little behind him. He has looked a bit leggy at times lately, as if he is a little tired.

2528~~~
Had a good season overall. He's improved from 2 years ago and that's all we can ask for I suppose. Our best defender. 

We still need better though if our expectations are to be a force in Europe. He still has quite a few flaws in game.

2529~~~
Agree with that. It's actually pretty easy to see if Smalling is tired, his running style becomes a bit desperate.

Whilst he'll never be a world class defender he's still good enough to win titles with. Just needs a quality partner who can share the physical burden.

2530~~~
One of our best players over the course of the whole season. Has made huge improvements the last two years and was our best defender this year hands down. Has a tendancy for silly sending offs though, that second yellow yesterday was infuriating. He cuts that stupid stuff out and he'll be fine.

2531~~~
Knackered. That's all. The same with Blind. They played too many games and weren't rotated. Daft from LVG.

2532~~~
Brainless but some of the reactions on here are way over board. I hated him as much as the next United fan for those few minutes but people seem to have forgotten how much he bossed this season for us based on one red card.

He's a mistake or two always in him, he's no Rio but he's a damn good defender.

2533~~~
Not sure you can put it down to fatigue.... he made the exact same mistake when he was booked in the first half 

Just needs to defend smarter

2534~~~
Could / should have been sent of against City too (again). It's hard seeing him survive for 90 minutes against top teams in Europe. Thankfully for him we won't face such opposition next season.
Ppl like Keane or Ramos get / got many cards but they also successfully finished many top European / international games. Can't say the same about Smalling. He is not of the same quality, still needs to work and improve a lot.

2535~~~
Took one for the team. It worked out in the end.

2536~~~
Bit of a liability isn't he?

2537~~~
Indeed. Only Welbeck comes close.

Rafael, Kagawa and Herrera were overrated too (one of the culprits being myself), but the Caf was always divided there. On Smalling case, an entire forum went into an unprecedented delusion which would have made RAWK proud.

2538~~~
Maybe you are right. I expressed some doubts about his decision making at the start of the season and was heavily criticized for it. Thought he did pretty well in the first half of the season. Then tiredness kicked in. It may be a mental thing too and interfere with decision making. His mind wasn't fresh enough from too much football, IMO. Or maybe his decison making just isn't great, dunno about that.

2539~~~
This might explain the sending off...

2540~~~
Geez some of these comments are pathetic. He's been fantastic for most of the season. You lot can't be pleased

2541~~~
Too right. Especially as we've just won the FA Cup. Who gives a shit about the finer details of individual performances right now? Joyless whingers.


And as soon as any player is recognised as being a good player, they seem to be immediately swept into the "overrated" category. Because god forbid United could actually have a good player besides De Gea in the squad. One of few players who stepped up this season. He makes errors. Name a defender who doesn't? There isn't one. "Unprecedented delusion"? What a lot of shite.

2542~~~
He has really had a mixed season 

Really impressive until round about December then went through a long period where he didnt look calm or assured in his defending 

Think Mourinho has always had strong defensive units so maybe a strong dominant partner is what Smalling needs

2543~~~
One of the most laziest overused word in this place, regardless of context.

2544~~~
He has been average since December, and actually shit for the last two months. It isn't that after this mistake, I went from he's amazing, to he's good but not great.

He good do no wrong on eyes of many. He leaves his position and we concede a goal in the progress, 'it is not his fault cause he is surrounded by shit'. He leaves his position to go at the middle of the pitch to win a header which was completely un-risky and in the process drops both himself and Blind on their arses, conceding a goal 'it is not problem cause Blind cannot win a header'. He can't make a pass to save his life 'meh, defenders are there just to defend'. He has to cover a single player (Carroll) from the corner when he loses the header and we concede 'again it is someone's else fault'. He makes a complete stupid penalty 'every player does the same', etc etc. There were actually comments in this thread that he had Lukaku on his pocket, when Blind was dealing for the entire match with Lukaku.

The list of the excuses for him now is longer than that of Welbeck who apparently played somewhere between a defensive right back and a keeper.

For what is worth, I think that Smalling is a good player. I wasn't deluded enough to proclaim him as the best in the league after 2 good matches, and neither can say that he had a fantastic season when he was average for more than half of it. He had a decent season, the best he has ever had, when on 3-4 months he might have been the best performing CB in the league, and on the other months he was hit and miss, with the majority of time during those months outshined by Blind who is nothing special. He has been a top 3 - top 5 player for us this season (below De Gea and Martial, around the same level as Blind and probably Rashford). I think that both our CBs are good but not great, and ideally they should have been bench warmers, or at least partnered by someone who is much better than them. Signing a CB should be a priority this summer, and then depending on his strengths and weaknesses, one of Smalling/Blind can hopefully complement it (i.e if he is small like Marquinhos, then Smalling would be better, if he is shit at passing but he's strong and tall, then probably Blind would be better).

2545~~~
Spot on mate. I reckon some of these people just need a boxing bag instead of a laptop when they are all emotional about something. If anything he is underrated and I say that because I thought he should be in the pfa team of the year

2546~~~
Good player, has had some excellent moments.  Stupid player, needs to be smarter.

2547~~~
How can you say he was average for more than half of it? It's just not true. Could have used a rest in a couple matches but he's form has remained good. We got the second tightest defence and he's a big reason for it

2548~~~
I give Smalling an 8 for the season.  There are points to nitpick but on the whole he developed into an outstanding CB this season.

2549~~~
Because he has been from wank to average (with some exceptions) since December, and has actually been very poor on some of the most important matches (Wolfsburg, Newcastle, West Ham, Everton, yesterday, should have been send off a couple of times against City etc). We have the second tightest defense because we are one of the most defensive teams in the league (highest possession, highest backward passes but only 17th highest number of passes on the final third) in addition to having the best GK in the world, not because of Smalling's or Blind's heroics.

2550~~~
If it is so that he runs around the pitch taking headers without instructions to do so, LVG should take the blame for not telling him otherwise during the course of a season. If he does it because of management it says something about the other players surrounding him. Smalling is, besides Fellaini, our only dominant player in the air. Blind is hopeless most of the time; therefore, Smalling has to run around A LOT covering for Blind, both in terms of pace and heading ability. Smalling, on the other hand, tries to give the ball to Blind so that he can play it forward. To me, that looks like a game plan. Also, with about a 90% completed pass in most matches, he's not quite as shit at passing as you would make out.

I also think a minority, you included, would argue that Blind has performed better than Smalling in more than a couple of matches. There is so much lacking in Blind's game as a centre back. Smalling has had his ups and downs, but he has had a very good season.

As for those saying he didn't look fatigued; he looked fatigued from the get go yesterday. His run against Wickham showed that his legs were tired - compare that run to the one where he looked at least as fast as Vardy, both in the 87th minute or so. Smalling isn't used to playing as many games per season. Next season, I'm convinced he will have an even better second half as his body will be more used to it. Also, he should be allowed more rest from time to time.

Concerning being a liability, Smalling has had two red cards in his United career (14 yellow not counting yesterday). Him perhaps should have had a red card against City is really a silly argument as that can be labelled at any player at any team in any league - many players should have been sent off that never happened, and many have been sent off that never should have been. The fact that Rio only ever received one red card and 20 yellow cards in his career with 312 league appearanced should not be a yardstick to beat Smalling with - it is unreal. Nemanja Vidic had 6 red cards and 43 yellows in 211 appearances.

2551~~~
You clearly have an agenda, so maybe it's not worth debating with you at all. Voted as the players' player of the season, but he was "actually... very poor on some of the most important matches". Your arguments are so flawed; what does him having anything to do with only 17th highest number of passes on the final third have anything to do with him? He certainly runs around enough as it is covering for fullbacks and Blind.

2552~~~
<b>Vardy</b>: 
‘On a personal level, Chris Smalling [has been my toughest test],’ said Vardy.

‘He’s always tight and always around you to stop you from doing your bit on the ball or getting turned.

‘It makes it very difficult for you to bring your team-mates into the game as well.’

That's exactly how I see him as well - his defending is so tenacious, and even if you manage to steal a yard, he has so much pace and power that very few are able to get away from him, including a player like Vardy.

2553~~~
Very foolish of him to get sent off at that point of the game. He could've cost us the match.

2554~~~
He got beaten for pace and strength by Wickham. Zaha also showed him a clean pair of heels in the first few mins of E.T.

LVG's negative tactics really helped him this season. Yes he had a good season but he wasn't great. Technically he isn't good enough for a team that has aspirations to win the biggest honours. We need a CB of the ilk of Godin to marshall our defence and I think Mourinho will bring someone in.

2555~~~
Hope he gets demoted to bench duty by Mourinho. Would be delighted with that. He has nothing on our past great defenders, yet he seems to be seen on here as a mainstay cb who will form one part of our new twin tower defence for the foreseeable future. 

The regression is real.

2556~~~
Godins don't grow on tree. He's the best in the world IMO.

However, getting his partner would be awesome. He is essentially the new Vidic, and he would be able to play with both Smalling and Blind, and showing them how the game is played.

2557~~~
You have to go and put the money down for players of that ilk, instead of saying there's not another Rio or Vidic out there.

2558~~~
What's your point on getting beaten for speed? Most strikers/wingers should be faster than a centre back. He got players player of the year meaning he not only had a great season but he was a real leader out there too. Happy to have him as a future captain

2559~~~
My point is that if you're positionally and technically as suspect as Smalling then you've got to have recovery pace to compensate.

2560~~~
He is normally very fast though. At least matched Vardy for pace and beaten Welbeck. His legs just looked heavy yesterday. Shaw said he was the fastest player in the team, nothing wrong with his pace or strength.

2561~~~
Outstanding CB ? What were the likes of Vida and Rio for you then ?

2562~~~
Why does not being as good as Rio or Vidic make you not good enough? They're quite possibly the two best defenders United has ever had...Smalling is easily better and more consistent than the likes of Brown and Silvestre who both had spells as first choice centre backs for us not so many years ago. I'd be surprised if many were arguing he's the best centre half in the world or anything but he's clearly very good. Would love one of Villarreal's CBs to come in and partner him.

2563~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2564~~~
Blind looks slightly terrified <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2565~~~
Thats one big ass forehead Blind has.

2566~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2567~~~
Yeah, needs to stop wearing his hair like that, he emphasises it like that

2568~~~
They were world class, and then some. Rio at his best is the best centre back I've ever seen. The partnership with Vidic is the best partnership I've ever seen. We've been spoilt. If not for DDG's insane level, we would be thinking the same about the goalkeeper position as well considering we've had Schmeichel and VDS. There are so many big shoes to fill. Smalling is not at Rio's level. Rio can comfortably say that anything he can do, I could do better (maybe bar aerial duels).

2569~~~
I hope he's not as concerned with it as you are<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2570~~~
I wasnt the one commenting on it first, but i cant look past it now.

2571~~~
He jarred his knee in one the CL games (Wolfsburg away?) and he never looked the same after that.

He was playing at a good level at the start of the season, but since then no one has really paid much attention to him individually and just assumed he's been putting in good performances.

His end to the season has been really bad. In the last few weeks he's got sent off and scored two own goals, and has just generally been all over the place.

2572~~~
He's the best of a bad bunch. For me it's imperative to bring in a top level CB

2573~~~
This is the point though - after being beaten by Wickham of all people there was noway he should have tried to get in front of Bolasie to nick the ball - he was never making it there first and should have stayed goalside and kept it a 2 v 2 situation with Blind and allow the others time to get back. I mean yes once he made that first error it was always downhill from there and better he take the red but he was stupid to get into the same situation again after his previous error in the same game. Still much improved from his previous seasons but still not quite where he needs to be and has tailed of since returning from injury.

2574~~~
Sums the caf up at the moment. So reactionary, and emotionally bi-polar when ti comes to United.

Great season for him, clearly our best defender and with a proper defender beside him he can level-up next season. I hope he has a great Euro's.

2575~~~
He needs a defensive partner who is actually a defender.  I don't get the notion of us needing a left footer centreback and has the ability to bring the ball up the field. We need a proper hard guy to partner him at the back.  He is by far one of the best talents we have in the team.

2576~~~
That notion has left the club.

2577~~~
thank goodness

2578~~~
He needs to improve his thinking abilities

2579~~~
Yeah just like when you are in Blind's thread eh? Funny.

2580~~~
I agree, needs to do some Math quiz during the Euros and get him fit

2581~~~
Pardon me? Are you insinuating that my stance on Daley Blind has been "reactionary and emotionally bi-polar" when I've held a constant opinion that I think he has been poor for certain and calculated reasons through the entire season? In your attempt at some petty and sad one-upmanship in a thread completely off-topic, you've had a complete mare here, pal.

If I was on the caf at the start of the season I'd have happily told you that he shouldn't be playing 40+ games starting at CB for us this season and here I sit, right now, with the same un-reactionary and unwavering opinion.

2582~~~
LOL stop going too emotional over it.

Constant shit opinion is still constant shit opinion though. And not being able to change one's mind despite seeing different is eh special I guess?

2583~~~
He needs to do some doodles first

2584~~~
His defending at times is simply awful, Final being a good example.
Why all the grappling with players?
Hugely overated by some.

2585~~~
Yes, but we are playing a high-line defence a set-up that is terrible for Smalling, the one he does not have qualities to play really. And the fact that he has been our better performer this year, easily a top-3 one, only shows how much progress he 's made. No doubt he will be much-much better once we start to defend deeper.
He can't really match the speed of many strikers and his ability to defend running towards the goal is not great either. He clearly prefers to face his opponents, when he defends "from the back" with striker coming at him he is much much better, hardly lets them through.

2586~~~
He's not a tough tackling CB or a Ball playing CB. What is he then?

2587~~~
Thought people said his asset is his pace and one on one defending?

You have to be good at intercepting at United. We are not going to defend from deep often and we should not be. It will be boring as feck.

I don't think he is a bad defender. Just have some odd habits in certain situations.

2588~~~
He is a stripping defender, alright.

2589~~~
Their is a difference between "deep" and "normal" line defending. In that match he had almost an insane high line sometimes. I don't suggest we go "deep", but surely a bit deeper won't hurt.
1-on-1 defending sure, it kind of means that you defend against player running at you, what i have described. Pace? Not sure, he is surely not the fastest CB esp in terms of acceleratio and pace, rather than speed (long range running).

2590~~~
United players have said in interviews multiple times that Smalling is one of the fastest players in the side.

2591~~~
Yet he loses almost every second speed chasing i see him in, if not more. I hardly believe he can be faster than Young, Shaw, Valencia, Martial, so even if we don't go to Ander, Lingard and the rest, being 5-th hardly qualifies "one of the fastest" and this four players are much much faster.

2592~~~
So in short, you are saying he needs to work on positioning? I think that's what it is.

There is not much point playing a defender who can't intercept/stop the ball often from the others receiving it and turning around and leaving him dead regardless of where they defend. Not for United anyway.

2593~~~
Have we signed Bruce back?

2594~~~

In short the tactics need to be adjusted. Line need to me moved closer to our goal, not as close as in "deep line defending", but closer. Than in that match. I mean LVG played quite a lot of matches with much deeper line than we had in the final, actually i think Palace duped us into playing with such a high line knowing they can exploit it.
I don't get why you keep mentioning interceptions? How does it have to do with anything? Smalling just so you know is actually first in the team in interceptions per game at 2.8. Well Varela is the first at 3.0, but he hardly palyed. So obviously he is quite good in interception the ball. It's just when you play a high line, leave a lot of space behind and the other team just throws the ball long on the wing, how the hell do you supposed to intercept that? There is no way to do it, the only thin to do is to run for it sparring with a forward. And if forward comes deep gets the ball and then again has acres of space just kicks the ball 5-10 meters ahead and runs for it. Again there is nothing you can do in terms of positioning and intercepting it. If you don't have a cover from full back, the only thing you can do is beat the man with your acceleration and pace.

2596~~~
A club like United will be playing high line defense often because we will be attacking more and the other team will always have space to run around. One on one defending is just that one on one. If you are good at it, you are good at it. Nothing to do with if you are at 50 yards or 10 yards from the goal. He needs to get better IF he is shit at it. simple.

Why do I keep mentioning about intercepting? Because it is a huge part of defending no? Ever heard of Fergie talking about Maldini not tackling or almost at all in a game? What do you think how he did it? By mind control? Rio was master at it too. Of course smalling might be the first in the team for it but is it enough?

If you position and intercept well, you are going to get the ball often before the attackers do and you don't have to worry about physical battle or pace battle or pulling shirts and shit much. Simple no?

2597~~~
Mourinho doesn't play a high line, he normally plays his quite deep.

2598~~~
Of course he does not because he likes to sit deep a lot lately and it is why people think his style is boring. You hope we don't get that kind of crap often.

But, I think he played his line high enough for Real. At chelsea, he couldn't because of terry. If we had vidic in our line now, we couldn't have played either.

Also Jose's intention of buying stones might means he might want to play it high.

2599~~~
And once again, do you understand the difference between a tall person who is 1.9 m and the one that 2.1 m? giant. Both are very tall. The question is how tall. Same thing with line. Of course United will play high line, it will be much higher than WBA one, even with Mourinho, but it does need to be insanely high. Fergie never played with high line, our line of defence under him was more or less the middle one.
And Smalling is quite good at it.
Well Rio "the master" hardly ever top 3.0 interception per game, his rate in 2009-10 was just 1.9. So you make your own conclusions from that. But obviously if Smalling is United's leader in interception it shows that he is okay in that respect at least and that his partner should do more before we asked more of him. Common sense really.
No, that's stupid. Because in real football game you need to cover for your partners, full back and other center-half, they are balls that you just can't intercept etc. Team must defend as a unit, and it's tactic has to be right.

2600~~~
You don't need stat to see if rio was a far better defender than smalling, do you?  And, how did Maldini do it again?

And positioning well is stupid? Of course there are balls you can't intercept. But you can when the ball is coming to your area or the guy you are marking. If you think you can't match the pace of attacker, you get there and the ball before he gets it and starts running at you. Or simply position yourself away from him so that you don't get turned around and fecked right away?

You do know that we are talking about generally how smalling got fecked twice or so in similar manner in the last game by almost no named attacker he was supposed to take care of/mark? And i don't even think he is a bad defender. Just need to make sure he does not get exposed like that often.

2601~~~
No, but to say it was because of interceptions is wrong. As so is saying that Smalling is bad at intercepting the ball (which is what you have implied), that's just stupid, cause there is clear evidence he is not.
What exactly do you think Maldini did? By the sound of it i am not sure you have seen him play. He was a great defender, but him almost not making a tackle is a poppycock. Fergie just said it (if he really did) just to be nice, it's an oblivious exaggeration. It's kinda strange that you don't get it. I've seen Maldini a lot of times, and he did made a lot tackles.
The second thing of course is that Maldini hardly ever played with high line of defence, Milan team and especially Italy were always defending even a bit deeper than your "normal" middle line.
Exactly what i was saying. Some balls you just can't intercept no matter who you are. Even Maldini or Cannavaro would not be able to do that.
That all bad suggestions. If you keep running to the attacker, then you keep space open behind you. And if you step back, you just being stupid because with high line you will just create more option for opposition to attack without getting in the offside position. What you fail to understand is that no matter how skilled you are, Maldini or not, you can't defend alone or if it's two of you. It has to be a team effort. And team's efforts should be based on tactics that are right. And that are suited the team. For example Terry was awful under AVB that decided to play with insanely high line, but last season the 14-15 one when the line was much deeper Terry was integral part of championship winning side. So here you go, a tactics change come a long way. Same for Maldini. It was back in 90s, somewhere in the middle, Milan just won Serie A title with Capello while they had great attacking talent (Weah, Baggio) their win was based on overwhelming defence. Then Capello was "seduced" by Real Madrid. And off he went. Milan tried to replace him with some strange stuff, they had this coach committee or something i don't really remember, anyway the case in point is that Milan started to play differently and their great defence with Maldini was never to be found. The team was leaking goals. Because of fragility at the back the attacking play suffered as well. Of course the fact that some of the players were old did not help. They tried to come back first to Sacchi then Capello, did not work for them. From 1st place Milan went to 7-8 or something like that. And the great Maldini could do nothing about it. So system is way more important than the player.

LVG this season did not always played such as high line like we did against Palace in the Cup, and in games where our line was medium Slamming has done from "good" to "very good", even great. And his interception stats only prove that is very confident in intercepting the ball, when the tactics are right.
With the right tactics he won't. He would still make a mistake, but that stuff in FA Cup final was much more down to the wrong approach rather than his personal misses. Which is what i am trying to tell you.

2602~~~
Agree with that, I think he must have suffered with Nerves badly that game, he didn't look right from the first minute. Hoofed 1 ball straight out for a throw in, then was running like bambie on Ice against Wickham. Sometimes your body just doesn't work like it normally does, but he's definitely quicker than Wickham usually. Don't know if he had an injury or something but that was the reason he kept getting so close to people, ended up screwing himself over against Bolasie in the end.

2603~~~
Lol at the above digging up stats on Rio's interceptions. Rio was a comfortably better defender than Smalling.

Credit where credit is due - Smalling has been our best defender and deserves to be praised. Would like to see a top CB alongside him and some continuity at full backs. Couple that with Mou tactics and DDG should be gunning for VDS's clean sheet record.

2604~~~
Two moments of deft brilliance from Smalling last night. He actually played a cracking 30 yard lofted ball down the line to Alli's feet and scored with a text book glancing header into the bottom corner that any striker would have been proud of!

2605~~~
That's was a cracking header to be fair

2606~~~
Can't wait to see him under Mourinho.

2607~~~
The trouble with Rio is that stats hardly showed the truth. I recall a pundit saying that Rio, at his prime, knew just how to cope with pretty much any attacker, and how he often knew when to let the attacker get in front of him and when to intercept. Sometimes it is better to let the opponent think he has the upper hand. Smalling is very good, but Rio was world class.

Hopefully, the Euro's won't tire Smalling as he looked a little leggy in the last couple of matches.

2608~~~
I liked in the 1st half too when Rafa Silva had the ball and tried to drive at him 1v1. Smalling just turned on the boosters, and took the ball cleanly off him. It's in situations like that he is just so difficult to beat.

2609~~~
Smalling's acceleration isn't particularly good if he has to turn and start running from a standing start. It's not bad, but it's the closest thing to a physical weakness that he has. It just takes him a couple of steps to really get going (probably because of his size), and small nippy players can get a step or two ahead of him at times. Of course, after those first couple of steps he then reaches top speed and he normally makes up that ground as he is very fast once he gets going.

In saying that, I have no idea what happened against Wickham, that was just strange.

2610~~~
His "long-range" speed is not great either, it's fairly average and if it's a dash from the halfway line to the goal, he will lose to many attackers, especially in PL. Although Wickham just overplayed him basically, Smalling tried to muscle him down but fell himself.

2611~~~
I always thought he was the 'fast' one in each of the pairings, but as noted, he's actually not that rapid. He is good in the air though, and has gotten better. 

Will be interesting to see what type of partner Mourinho picks for him. The chat about the Villareal CB suggests that Smalling will actually be the organiser, with his partner as the more physical one. Which is odd, given I don't feel like communication and defensive intelligence are Chris/Mike's strong point.

2612~~~
He outpaced pretty much any striker he faced in the first part of the season, everyone can see he badly needs a rest, he looks dead in every game after 45 minutes, no way fecking Wickham is quicker than him.

He played <b>4974</b> minutes just for United this season(that's around 55 full games) plus couple of for England, just a random comparision Real Madrid's most featured player is Ronaldo with 4293, Kroos is second with 3741. This is the stat they quoted on United's site:

It is pretty much incredible stat, especially for a player who barely played complete season before in his career and always had injury problems.

2613~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8rL1Ig5Sfs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

This video will satisfy the doubters. Smalling has outpaced many pacey strikers so many times. His reactions are always quick too. Though he looked very tired both mentally and physically towards at the end of season.

2614~~~
Began the season excellently, form of his life. Then that Wolfsburg game happened and didn't look the same since. Didn't help that he had to play so many games. He is improving with every season now and it is great that he is probably the first name on the team sheet for both United and England.

2615~~~
He played around 50 games for us, i'm quite sure he's never done that and i'm happy he didn't get any injuries.
Maybe lack of rest caused his dip in form, he really is a beast when fully fit. 

I have been harsh on Smalling lately stating that we need 2 defenders because he lacks the technical ability, but if we find the right partner for him like Blind, there is no reason he shouldn't be first choice. 

Hopefully he continues to develop even though he isn't young anymore. I've always said since Moyes that he was our best defender, when he turns on beast mode you just can't get past him.

2616~~~
Nice thing is that Mourinho knows how to play defenders. While I think that Blind outperformed Smalling this season, I think that under Mourinho, Smalling will develop into a top top defender, something that I cannot see Blind doing (under any manager).

2617~~~
Bullshit. How many times does he have to prove people wrong in this respect? His run against Willian last season saving a 1v1 when Rojo fecked up and him catching up with Welbeck and getting the ball off him from a scoring position wasn't enough?

2618~~~
he will only get better under Mou and become United legend eventually, with Baileys pace and aggression it will be a bit overkill but at least it wont be  an one-man defence

2619~~~
Watching that video makes me astonished at how much we take him for granted here. England's and United's no.1 centre back in his first injury free season and being asked to play every single game. 

If he stays fit next season and is playing in a decent team under Mourinho then I can see him creeping back towards that elite list of top defenders in the world, where he was rightly halfway through the season

2620~~~
Oh man, his (admittedly cute) dog is called Miley.

2621~~~
Did really well tonight against a big and strong opponent. And for those who still think he is slow - isn't that just the most stupid comment ever? It's like saying Rio at his prime was slow because his last two or three years were a bit sluggish. Smalling is one of the fastest players at United, as quoted by many players including Smalling himself. 

I don't like the way he is tugging at people's shirts much too obviously though. It's almost as bad as Skrtel.

2622~~~
A very good defensive performance from Chris today and almost scored as well from a corner.

Needs to play at RCB imo, he struggles with distribution anyway nevermind on his left foot.

I think Cahill has a better left foot so I dont understand Hodgsons thinking putting Chris at LCB.

2623~~~

2624~~~
24 in two matches? That's insane.

2625~~~
and they played against Russia and Wales! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2626~~~
He's been solid for England so far and seems to be forming a good partnership with Cahill.

2627~~~
Hasn't he been playing LCB as well? He is mostly used to RCB.

Good to know that he can handle LCB as well since Bailly is most comfortable as RCB, and will probably need to play in his favourite position while bedding in.

2628~~~
Apparently he was soft yesterday.

2629~~~
Good to hear, I'd be worried if he was hard while surrounded by men in shorts.

2630~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> Not the best stat, that.

2631~~~
He is England's most important player. No other player in the team offers what he does.

2632~~~
I reckon he will be at least shortlisted for FPL player of the season next season, what Sir Alex started, Mou finishes, hopefully we will make him our captain and drop rooney for good, will be interesting if we pair him with Bailly straight away or buy another defender to complement Smalling better, there will definitely be a lack of vision and passing ability from the back but we could fix it with some DLP ala Pjanic or other and having two super aggressive center backs could bring us some nice moments as well.. intercepting a lot and bombing forward

2633~~~
He's been fantastic aerially in the Euros, if only we could get Bonucci to partner him! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2634~~~
Smalling is slow? Tell that to Aguero.

2635~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> At first glance I totally read that wrong.

2636~~~
I don't know if he is good enough for us moving forward. He can't pass so and he wouldn't be considered a destroyer either. He's quick but as a whole not that solid and gets bullied by some strikers.. He done well last season but that was in a complete possession based style which meant he wasn't tested as much as other CB's. I wonder would Bailly be seen as his replacement and Mourinho may look to bring in a ball playing CB as well.

2637~~~
Lol, some opinions just crack me up, Bailly a Smalling replacement <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he's not even good enough to tie Smalling shoe laces

2638~~~
Because further progression under a new manager is out of the question, right?

2639~~~
It is a good thing he is an excellent defender then.

2640~~~
Such as?

2641~~~
Some fans will just find anything to argue about. Smalling last season was one of the best defenders in the PL baring his inability to make long passes. I don't think Huth or Morgan were that good at long passes but Leicester still won the league. Let the defenders do their job and defend, just because some managers prefer defenders who can make long passes doesn't mean all top defender need to do so. What top defender wouldn't get bullied by giants such as Lukaku, Rondon, Benteke, Carroll. It's part of their game play to be slow but strong. Smalling on the other hand has to shape his physical attributes to defend against the strong, technical, or quick forwards. And he holds his own pretty well against all types so i'd be very happy with that. 

Smalling is quick, strong, good at tackling, and good in the air. For being the only CB on the field for the majority of the games he did a great job. Hopefully we have more competent manager now who will actually pair him with a proper CB.

2642~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2643~~~
Smalling is the real deal for me and I think as he's entering the best years of his career he will be regarded indubitably as world class in a years' time playing hopefully for a more settled team and with an actual CB partner. But having seen him in that 1 season for Fulham and when he just arrived here he was a much more composed ball-player while that part of his game has completely regressed IMO. Wonder what the reason for that is because I felt even when Rio became a better defender after 2006 he wasn't as good at playing the ball out as he used to be when he was at Leeds.

2644~~~
Had swear we plucked a 40 year old from a pub team. Cop on.

That could be a point. But it cuda been made without the sarcastic element to it. 

That was relating to him not being a ball playing CB

Ighalo and Deeney could have scored a buket load at OT. He struggled against Lukaku as well imo. Also Robson Kanu just shoved him out I'd the way to win a ball against Wales which caught me eye.

Great contribution that.

2645~~~
I thought he handled Lukaku quite well. Maybe in the FA cup he struggled more but his form had dropped then. Earlier encounters he won easily IMO. Don't remember the Watford game so I will take your word for it. The other is just a one off. Anyway, I can pick countless examples where he physically bullied a striker. And I think there would be more instances of that than the reverse.

2646~~~
So all of a sudden Smalling isn't a good defender anymore? The cafe is weird.

2647~~~
Smalling did not even play that game it was Blind and TFM as he was injured. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2648~~~
Great stuff this. 

He gives an example of one game three months ago and that was the game that Smalling didn't even play. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2649~~~
As usual the truth is somewhere in the middle. He's a good defender but he's not the best in the PL, nor elite level. He has plenty of flaws which still need ironed out.

Hopefully Mourinho can push him on.

Some are clearly responding the Caf' over-hyping another one of our own.

2650~~~
Probably better to wait until we've seen Bailly play in the PL before we start suggesting he should replace comfortably the best CB at the club. This time last year similar type posts suggested Depay was a sure thing on our left wing for years to come.

2651~~~
Though Smalling was CB and TFM was RB. My mistake but I named more than one match if ye read my post properly. He was very poor against Newcastle as well, Lukaku has bullied him. And he has been shoved about the place as well. Now I hope he improves and becomes our main CB but if he continues the way he did at the end of the season then we're in trouble. Also very immature posts on ur behalf, try acting like grown men in the future.

2652~~~
Lukaku doesn't play for Newcastle either.

2653~~~
Nor has he bullied him. At least make half truths in your agenda.

2654~~~
If you have a good story, why should you let truth come and disturb it? We need a new toy at OT, period.

2655~~~
Lukaku had one match where they were equals more or less. In the league games before that, Lukaku was so far down Smalling's pocket that he could just as well have played blindfolded. Smalling has also dominated Carroll, Benteke, Kane (every single time), and Vardy said Smalling is the most difficult defender to play against. Smalling even matched, or bettered, Vardy for top speed. He struggles a bit more with the likes of Aguero, which he has admitted himself as he says he is the worst attacker to play against, but he deals very well with the physically strong attackers like Lukaku and the fast ones like Vardy. Smalling had some average matched in the spring, but he has shown that he can deal with pretty much any type of attacker, so your argument is very, very flawed. Rio was a superior defender, but he often struggled a bit with the physical attackers, and Vidic, also a superior defender, struggled a lot with the fast attackers. The problem for the attackers was that there were two of them, so Vidic took out the physically imposing ones and Rio dealt with the quick ones, and very well at that. Smalling has to deal with all of them because Blind can't (he did well for the majority, but he was always going to struggle in a foot race or a physical battle with a strong player).

2656~~~
He has played some very good matches and I hope he improves further but I just worry that if he is paired with the wrong partner, we could be in trouble. I would disagree with you as regards his handling with some of the forwards mentioned.

2657~~~
I worry that he'll be paired with a slow, 5.11, midfielder who isn't very strong...

2658~~~
Daley Blind? 

Our best centre back last season. Lord knows what might happen.

2659~~~
I largely agree. But thing is, I get where the overhypers are coming from. It's natural to back your own. But it's utterly laughable that some people would fabricate examples for the specific purpose of arguing against one of our own. There is a balance between not doing that shit, and not overhyping RAWK style.

2660~~~
Wayne Rooney is being labelled a potential 'midfield general'; the Caf can be just as bad as RAWK make no mistake.

2661~~~
Good point.

2662~~~
Which do you disagree with? In two out of three matched he had Lukaku deep in his pocket. Carroll gave him a hard fight one match, but was destroyed another match, as emphasised by the commentators. Benteke would be dominated by a telephone pole these days, but he has still been found wanting against Smalling, as has Kane who has disappeared completely because Smalling has simply dominated him. I'm not saying that he doesn't have poor matches or that attackers don't get the best of him, because they do, but generally speaking, he doesn't have weaknesses against any type of attacker. Normally, when defenders are great against the Lukaku type player they struggle with the Vardy, Walcott type players, but Smalling has so much pace as well as being big and strong that he doesn't really struggle there - he's even had Ribery in his pocket playing RB of all things. I think the commentators said something like "And Ribery puts on the afterburners, oh, Smalling is pretty rapid too!" - he's excellent one on ones. Sometimes I think he pushes a little too far up the pitch though leaving too much space behind him. Maybe that won't be a problem with Bailly who can cover, but Blind doesn't have the pace for that.

2663~~~
I don't like how he can be pushed aside moreso than past CB destroyers (Vidic). His pace is fine but if we are going to sign a Ball playing CB then I wouldn't be completely convinced about our CB's. Its worth noting that he was not overly tested this season due to our possession based slow football which deprived some teams of the ball meaning less chances conceded.

2664~~~
Think he's looking quite sharp for England myself. Looked tired or maybe like he was carrying a knock towards the end of the season for us. Good to see because without him England's defence is weak.

2665~~~
Smalling still has a fair way to go before anyone should be considering him one of the best centre backs in Europe. He's certainly up there in the league though, which conveniently enough is where he'll be playing most of his matches. He's not brilliant on the ball but bar the top level centre backs not many really are. I'm not sure he could ever be the leader in a defence and I still feel he can be an accident waiting to happen but all in all he's a good player. Hopefully one day he can be a great one but I can't see it, but he's more than good enough for what we're currently trying to do which is regain domestic dominance. 
If and when the time comes that we will hopefully be looking to regularly win the league and go far in the champions league I think he will need to improve massively to be a mainstay in our defence.

2666~~~
Redcafe's most underrated player. Bar none.

2667~~~
How is he pushed aside? You had one example where he didn't even play. He has more than held his own against the likes of Lukaku, Carroll etc. Even if he lost one duel that tells nothing. If he lost those on a regular basis then that is fine, you would have a point, but it's a one off. Even Vidic would lose physical duels and Rio would lose foot races - one foot wrong in either and the best attackers take advantage - it doesn't mean your ability isn't there, just that you lost that time. Criticize him for his passing and sometimes wayward positioning, but the arguments you make are not valid.

2668~~~
He was definitely tired towards the end. That run he lost against the average attacker who is really quite slow told everything you needed to know. In addition, he seemed more out of breath. As a centre back, he regularly featured on the top five list of United players who covered the greatest distance.

2669~~~
From when I've seen him, I've seen him pushed aside a lot more than a Vidic. I'm entitled to my opinion so how's about ya calm down and stop getting worked up.

2670~~~
I think most people would agree that he handles the big and strong attackers very well most of the time. Vidic was amazing at handling the big and strong players, but often failed at the nimble and quick players. Smalling handles both well, but not the strong as well as Vidic nor is he as good one on one as Rio. You are comparing against two of the best in the PL era though.

Also, what is getting worked up? I'm discussing, you are throwing a tantrum.

2671~~~
I already said I disagree. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> tantrum? I'm not even going to respond to that.

2672~~~
Rubbish. How about you try posting facts and not BS just to prove an invalid point? Clearly you just dislike Smalling

2673~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I have no problem with Smalling so wind ur neck in.

2674~~~
I think he's very good with one on one's, he normally uses his strength and pace to take the ball.

IMO his weakness is passing and positioning, maybe that's why blind was in there as well because his positional awareness is his best asset - passing tough is rubbish, hoof ball. Shame really because when he (Blind) started with Utd in midfield his passing was very impressive.

I still standby the fact that Smalling is England's best CB

2675~~~
He's England's best CB - although thats not much of a compliment. However you can really see the difference in him at LCB compared to RCB. So much more comfortable on the right. Felt like he didn't get enough support from Cahill who was mostly anonymous. He was really good in the air and I saw a stat that said he has won the most headers so far in the tournament which bodes well for the future.

2676~~~
I thought both centre backs were fine without being exceptionally good. Smalling definitely had more help from Danny Rose than Cahill got from Walker, who ran around the pitch like a headless chicken misplacing 5 yard passes.

Smalling is solid as a rock though and is growing in to a leader, can't understand people calling for him to be replaced at United.

Once he gets his deserved rest he'll be fine again. Incredible how much football he's played, I reckon he is one of the leaders in Europe by number of minutes played this season in all competitions. I hope Mourinho gives him extra week.

Agree been a big plus for us last season along with Martial and Rashford.

Don't know if it's true but smalling apparently injured himself while surfing in Bali.

He doesn't need to be replaced, but he needs to be partnered with a better center back than he is.

Smalling is pretty good at what he does.   The Reds need someone to beside him that is AT LEAST as good as Smalling.

Own goals and that stupid tackle in the FA cup game really diminished his year imo.   Good year...but not great.

He needs a good partner or the Reds will be screwed.
