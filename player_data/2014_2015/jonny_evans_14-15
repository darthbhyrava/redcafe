It's hard to gauge just by the pre-season matches how good he'll be on the left side of a back 3, but early signs show nothing to worry about right. With Smalling and Jones back there to hold the fort, he might venture out and start attacks more; definitely out of the current back 3 he's the best passer, and it'll be good for him to develop that part of his game.

Also interesting is that with Vidic, Rio, and Pat all gone, he's now the senior defender of the squad. Being the most experienced of our lot, it's time to step up and not just play well, but also be a leader for the other guys around him. There's no excuse for not being strong and vocal with the others, bringing composure and focus to the line in front of De Gea.

My big concern this season, as it always is with Jonny, is injuries. Even if we sign another center half, losing Jonny for any extended period of time would be a blow. Fingers crossed he plays over 30 league games this time.

2~~~
With the exception of the LA Galaxy game, where he didn't look comfortable in a three-man defence, he has been good in pre-season. I think Evans would make a terrific captain, based on his organisation skills. He has become more vocal and looks more and more like a leader .

3~~~
He doesn't strike me as much of a leader to be captain of this club though, my only main concern If he does get the captain's armband next season

4~~~
He embraces the philosophy and is probably the most intelligent defensive player we have altogether, it's clear to see why he is a candidate. He will obviously need to step up his vocal and general presence, but I'm all for him taking the armband.

5~~~
He'll do, although he wouldn't compare to many of our captains of the past. But I'm not sure anyone in the squad would.

6~~~
By the end of this season he'll be regarded as one of the better CBs in the league, barring a major injury. A starting spot and a manager who likes passers is all he's ever really needed.

And I like him for captain. Ok, he's no Keane, but he's the best way to bypass the ridiculous 'Rooney or RVP' farce when neither of them are exactly perfect candidates themselves. And he's a defender, which is always best.

The importance of captaincy is overrated anyway. Particularly given how famous Van Gaal is for drilling every player until they know their role down to the finest details; there shouldn't need to be too much tactical leadership on the pitch.

7~~~
I hope he gets the captaincy

8~~~
Few years ago I said he would one day be a United captain, it would be nice to see. He is our number one CB, has experience, loves the club, I think he deserves a shot.

Big season for him regardless though, hoping he can kick on and nail down a spot without Rio and Vidic there.

9~~~
I think he would do better in the central or right sided role if we bring someone in for LCB.

10~~~
He does have leadership qualities. He's soft spoken but he still seems like a natural leader, kind of like Byran Robson. My only problem with him is his fitness record. If Evans can remain fit for a full season he'll absolutely become one of the integral players on the team.

11~~~
Average performance tonight. Left centre-back is a position I expect us to strengthen on, though I have faith in Evans.

12~~~
His passing was absolute shocking. Quite uncharacteristic, but that pass to Smalling especially was dreadful.

13~~~
It was a shocking performance for him more like... Don't think I've ever seen his passing as bad as it was today. Probably just a one off thing.

14~~~
No idea what he was up to tonight.

15~~~
Haven't got a clue what happened to him tonight. It was almost like he couldn't be arsed.

16~~~
Terrible performance by him, no idea what he was doing but hopefully it's just another one of Evans' random poor games.

17~~~
I think Evan is quality but, my goodness I was yelling at him today for not making the simple passes. Thank goodness he got subbed at the half.

18~~~
Liverpool's pressing unsettled him. It was a good test for all of the back 3.

19~~~
Yeah, average is an understatement. I'm surprised at how poor his distribution was - he's usually good under pressure.

For me, Smalling is first choice. Evans hasn't convinced me as a LCB and his mobility could be an issue for us. That's why it's best to play him in the middle.

20~~~
Had a mare tonight, in a back 3 I think he needs to be central.

21~~~
Rather have Smalling as the centre CB.

22~~~
Playing from the left just limits his distribution abilities and he doesn't look comfortable there.

He can do a job there when required, but i think the central role would suit him more.

23~~~
He still has this unbelievably annoying habit of just randomly hoofing it to no one. For no apparent reason.

24~~~
Spent too long playing with Rio.

25~~~
Rare off game for Evans, it happens. Still our best CB.

26~~~
It would be useful to have a ball playing defender like Evans although his performance was dreadful today. All Smalling did when he got the ball today was give it back to De Gea.

27~~~
An off day for Evans. It's amazing how many on here change their opinions on our CB from game to game. He will be crucial to van Gaal, it was just a poor game.

28~~~
How come you missed some of his accurate long balls today. He is a good passer for centre back.

29~~~
A really poor performance today, but I still think he's been one of our most consistent cbs on tour. He played well in every game up to today.

30~~~
Happens a lot on here, and it's an annoying trend. Watch him have a stormer against Valencia and all of the haters will flock back to his support. He's arguably been the club's most consistent CB in the past 3 years in my honest opinion, and you're right, he will be a crucial player for van Gaal.

31~~~
May be because they were too few in number? The idea of having three defenders is that one of them can carry out the ball to the of the pitch time to time when teams are pressing and not just play accurate long balls but also find players wide and centre time and again.

32~~~
Had a shocker lol it happens no big deal <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

33~~~
He doesn't have to find the target while waiting Liverpool players closing him down first, if he can do it earlier then it's better. Accurate means he finds the target both wide and centre. And he did it not just few today. And you said "<b>All Smalling did when he got the ball today was give it back to De Gea"</b>

34~~~
Yeah, not really a good game by him but still.

35~~~
Had a shit game last night, but played really good in the rest of the tour.

36~~~
Evans went weak at the knees last night in a way that was totally unexpected. It was almost as if he was having flashbacks of the 0-3 back in spring. Watching Evans confidently walk the ball out of defence, and step into midfield to give us an extra body, in the previous games nobody could have expected he'd crumble like that. His game was typified by that hospital pass he gave to Smalling: Simply didn't want the responsibility of playing out from the back. Looked up, no option, so just laid it off to the nearest player. Shocking performance from our most experienced centre-half. He played the whole half like he was worried about what Liverpool could do. Contrast this with Blackett who played determined to make Liverpool worry about what we could do to them. Really, really surprised. Up until last night Evans had looked our most composed defender. Crumbled mentally last night.

37~~~
Would like to see him as the middle of the three as it suits him best.

38~~~
Would've expected more from him under Van Gaal.

39~~~
You do realise it's preseason?

Judge his time under van Gaal in a year or two.

40~~~
Erm, sorry for my offending comment.

In his first appearances in the new system he didn't really show his praised ball-playing abilities as expected. Solid, but not more.

41~~~
New system, new position, season proper hasn't even started; it's early days yet.

Judging Evans now is definitely too early, but I think we could make a fair assessment come January/February.

42~~~
Sure, but overall I think Jones and Smalling looked more comfortable than Evans in the new system, surprisingly.

43~~~
Any news on where he was today?

44~~~
Injured, surprisingly.

45~~~
Looks like he's picked up Wes Brown's mantle of talented yet perma crocked defender.

46~~~
He's back and in contention for tonight. We really need him fit.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Aug/jonny-evans-available-for-milton-keynes-dons-clash.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...s-available-for-milton-keynes-dons-clash.aspx</a>

47~~~
Vital to have him back. Not so much for this match (well probably even for MK Dons the way we are going) but for the league match on the weekend, he will be an important return.

48~~~
Wouldn't mind him getting some minutes, just to prepare for the weekend. We really need our best players playing now we have dropped points early.

49~~~
Another Evans brainfart, 'our best defender'.

50~~~
I've never rated Evans and that is exactly why. He is an accident waiting to happen. Such a liability. He is average at best and always will be.

51~~~
I
It doesn't matter what he does some on here just don't see it. Complete liability.

52~~~
Ya it's one of the mysteries of the Caf. He is nowhere near as good as Jones yet there are people on here that think he is our best CB! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

53~~~
Poor whenever he's played without Vidic or Rio next to him. 

Hope this isn't a return to that season where he was a liability in every single game.

54~~~
Just don't understand. Didn't he see the MK Dons player RIGHT THERE!!??

55~~~
swap jonny with Helen

56~~~
Maybe he thought he could bend it around him... Quite a shame as he hasnt looked that bad bar that little mistake.

57~~~
Strange how he doesn't get nearly enough criticism as Jones and Smalling despite being more of a liability and sicknote than the other two despite being the eldest and most senior member of our defence.

58~~~
I think that was the problem. He wouldn't have tried that pass against a Premier League team.

Idiot was cockily trying to play it out from the back.

59~~~
He picked up where he left off against Liverpool in pre-season.

60~~~
Solid defender overall, but not top class and hugely injury prone. Can't rely on him.

61~~~
Carrying on from last season as our least impressive CB

62~~~
He's not a world class defender, nor is he second tier, he is just okay and we have enough of okay defenders. He's going to turn 27 in a few months yet he's still playing like a youngster, making mistakes in literally every game he plays. Signing just Rojo isn't enough to solve our defensive problems. Evans isn't good enough to start for United at the moment. Benatia would have been ideal to come in but he's gone to Bayern; feck knows why we weren't in for him.

63~~~
Shocking pass I have no idea what was going through his head.

64~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Never world class, not even top class and he's shit for a player of his age at this club

65~~~
You would have been shocked had an MK dons player done this, let alone an Mufc player.

Defenders need to be good 100% of the time, in the vast majority of games. Evans has never offered this.

66~~~
Evans, he is sooo poor.

67~~~
Don't worry he's playing in goal now! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

68~~~
Benatia wanted CL football so even if were in for him we probably woudnt have got him.

69~~~
We have too many mediocre/average players in the team, one or two good performances make them look better than the rest. It doesn't mean they're world class.
 Never rate Evans. Completely liability,doesn't show enough quality to be leader of our backline.

70~~~
Man, I remember in 08/09 him slotting next to Vidic and looking class. Vidic really carried that defense that year it seems.

71~~~
This game today once more underlines the problem with Evans. He is a good defenders, probably our best but he is so prone to silly errors.

72~~~
goodbye.

73~~~
Shit unless Vidic or Rio are next to him. He's proven it time and time again.

74~~~
Yet again proving my point that he looks fancy on the ball but when it comes to actual defending he's a bit poo.

75~~~
I honestly don't think I've ever seen such a poor defensive performance at United than from him tonight. Am I just being knee jerk?

76~~~
Many of those games, Evans also played them next to Rio.

77~~~
I believed that he's currently our best defender, not anymore. What a fecking joke he has been tonight.

78~~~
During the record breaking clean sheet run Vidic was the only constant.

79~~~
I don't know, I remember Carlton Cole completely took him apart a few years ago in the league cup.

80~~~
I was laughed at on this forum for not rating this guy.

81~~~
I don't care if you're coming back from injury, that is a shameful performance.

82~~~
And VDS obviously

83~~~
Carlton Cole is shit but even so.. this is MK Dons. I wasn't on about Evans specifically either.

84~~~
Do we have any defenders left who don't have a mistake in them?

85~~~
Hey at least he's great on the ball right? Most important ability for a CB.

86~~~
Awful. Nothing else to say.

87~~~
Clearly a mile away from competing for a starting place

88~~~
And some people wanted this error prone CB to become our captain, the mind boggles really.

89~~~
His 'challenge' for the 4th goal was pathetic.

90~~~
Coming off injury, with no preseason, he'll grow into it.

91~~~
Veteran leadership.. feck sakes that was a shameful performance.

92~~~
What? He only missed 1 pre-season game, and he got hooked at half time in the last one he played.

93~~~
PIG played a cup game and cost us that record. Roque Santa Cruz I seem to remember <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

94~~~
It seems that our need for a centre back is even more urgent than most of us realised. Evans was as miserable tonight as he was against West Ham in that infamous Carling Cup tie of 2010/11. Shameful for a defender of his experience.

95~~~
Worst defensive performance I have seen in my life, worse than Senderos at his worst.

96~~~
He needs more games I mean. He featured in the first games but again he's off the pace. Not close to his form.

97~~~
Absolutely no bottle whatsoever. look, good players make the odd mistake, but he was shit all night long against mickey mouse opposition, and frankly he's well known for dropping clangers and this has just solidified that view in a lot of fans.

98~~~
spent the whole game adjusting the arm band so everyone could read it, continued to shout orders out, whilst being completely shit.

99~~~
Overpaid, lazy and complacent player.

100~~~
The exaggeration in your post to make Evans seem like he was awful last season is ridiculous. Even worse than Ferdinand and Vidic? Evans and Smalling were, by far, our two best CBs last season. Some argue Evans was our best CB; others argue Smalling, but both were more solid than Ferdinand, Vidic, and Jones.
I don't believe this to be true. Evans was absolutely poor today, but he's had many games alongside Smalling/Jones where he's looked very good. The problem for him right now is that he doesn't look like a genuine leader despite improving on this aspect, and that's what Manchester United <i>need</i> at the back.

101~~~
He's a good player who had a shit game. It happens.

102~~~
Just one of the many who deserve to be shown the exit door this summer, disgusting performance tonight.

103~~~
I can forgive the poor pass for the first goal, sometimes that happens.

The last goal though, my god was he an absolute bottler/pussy. Why he jumped out of that tackle instead of smashing Afobe I will never know.

104~~~
Embarrassing display. Based on today's performance he deserves to be have his contract terminated, but let's see if he improves and understands Van Gaal's system as the season goes.

105~~~
Evans being Evans.

You can't have a defender who has it in him to be as completely shit as is when he is having a bad game.

His best is nowhere near good enough to justify his place in the squad.

106~~~
He was absolutely shocking tonight. He was massively at fault for the first goal with a disgraceful and lazy pass to the opposition in his own area and for the fourth goal he put in a shamefully feeble challenge. Got away with a blatant handball too, could have easily been a penalty.

In general I think he's a good defender but he is always capable of these nightmare performances, and they stop him from being a truly top class defender. He shouldn't be anywhere near the first team on Saturday.

107~~~
Really bad from the bits I've seen of the game.

Generally he's alright but no more than that. The fact that he's underrated by non-United fans doesn't actually mean he's good enough to be a first choice player for us.

108~~~
Never will be good enough. Give Smalling and Jones playing time when not injured. We just can hope that Rojo is good enough. Sell him and Keane next year, buy Hummels and hope the others step up.

109~~~
Finally some sense. Some short memories on here. No doubt he was utter shite tonight though

Think a few of us need to go and sleep this off.

110~~~
I don't get him. He'd get dominated by any old lump, yet perform well against Drogba.

But that performance was simply bad. So bad that he should be 6th choice at the moment.

111~~~
Horrendous performance but gets the "just back from an injury" excuse that also applies to powell. Obviously a game too soon for both of them. Be retarded to draw long term conclusions from tonight. Although, no doubt, that's already happening. S'all in the caf, yo.

112~~~
Soft arse

113~~~
After the season he just had, which is average compared to his 11/12 season, why would Manchester United sell their most experienced centre-back? With LvG coming in, there was no way we were going to sell him. He's not even the problem. As most have mentioned, Evans was terrible tonight. But it's his first game back from injury so I don't quite understand all the negativity.

114~~~
And a lot of very romantic (and presumably very Irish) posters were calling for him to be captain. Not anywhere near.

115~~~
Him and Cheech are worst performers today along with Anderson.

3 most senior players out there today.

Anyway. i think he had injury and the defenders are being ripped into too much for what they had in front.

116~~~
Was glad to see him back when I saw the starting 11, after all he should be our most experienced and best centre back.  90 minutes later I'm feeling a little less confident about the positive impact his return will have at the back!  Seriously though, lets hope he's got all that shit out of his system tonight and he can produce the goods when he returns to the league 11.

117~~~
It was a shocking list of candidates in fairness.

118~~~
He is poor, said it always, still dont understand the guy who told me that Cahill isnt better than Evans lol.

119~~~
I've never been his biggest fan, and now I'm of the opinion that - if anyone needs to make way for a commanding, experienced centre-back, it should be him.

120~~~
It was, but Evans should still have been nowhere near it.

I'm still a bit baffled by Fletcher as vice tbf

121~~~
Abysmal performance really. It didn't help he had Keane next to him though (people think he should be pushing for a first team spot?). He has always looked solid with Vidic or Rio next to him but I'm not sure if he handles responsibility well. He looked as clueless as the two either side of him tonight it was embarrassing to watch.

122~~~
I think it was more to do with him being an academy product, being at the club a number of years, a likely starter and his position more than where he's from. Same goes for Fletcher really. Outside of them who were the options? Rooney, who isn't captain material and Van Persie who's an injury concern and only at the club two years.

123~~~
He's coming back from injury to be fair but it was a terrible performance, he and Smalling are a million miles away from being Rio or Vidic. Yet most fans in the transfer forum stick their nose up at most of the defenders we're linked with despite how average our CBs are.

124~~~
His first performance of the season - pretty poor. But he'll be all the better physically for 90 minutes under his belt at least I guess and willing to cut him a bit of slack because of the recent injury.

And to be fair, he's come out on MUTV and held his hands up re: the first goal.

125~~~
Why does our multi million pound academy that scours the globe for talent not produce top CB's for the first team?

126~~~
He always has a couple of clangers every season.

127~~~
Mid table defender really, don't know why we seem intent on having his as the leader of our defence going forward. He isn't and will never be on the same level as the likes of Vidic and Rio and quite frankly, that's the level of player we ought to have.

128~~~
Captain's performance.

129~~~
One of the worst performances I've seen from a CB, it was absolutely shambolic, in truth I think he looked the least comfortable of our 3 senior CB's on tour when it came to this new back 3 system, I don't think it suits him as the spaces are bigger and he's more about reading the play than hunting the forward runners.

130~~~
Is this serious?

We sold Pique (granted he wasnt from our academy) as we could not afford him gametime - we have had Rio and Vidic for almost the last decade, making it impossible for any other CB to break through. We signed Smalling and Jones, as well as having Evans - all young and very promising CBs.

We now have Blackett coming through and looking excellent as well as the above,  and you are suggesting that somehow the academy/scouting has failed? What exactly did you expect, that a pair of 18 year old phenomenons would displace two of the greatest CBs of the premiership era?

The very criticism that was being made of Moyes last season, and even of SAF, was not giving the younger CBs enough playtime - Jones and Smalling were both played out of position regularly and have only now been getting consistent starts at CB, and you expect them to instantly and seamlessly replace Rio and Vidic?


edit: This isnt defending Evans' performance tonight so much as just pointing out that we are now paying for mistakes made over the last 2-3 seasons in not giving Evans/Jones/Smalling enough gametime at CB.

131~~~
He's supposed to be our most senior defender. Worrying signs indeed, he was terrible tonight I don't care if he's been out since April or not that was unacceptable.

132~~~
Indeed. Didn't look remotely match ready. Frankly he was lucky not to concede a penalty for handball on top of costing us their first goal. No sign of his usual quality on the ball.

Still think he's a decent player. So much uncertainty regarding our defence at the moment, it is hard to tell who will be in the starting 11 and who will be shown the door at the end of the season.

133~~~
Why are you talking about Rio and Vidic and everyone else? I'm just saying in general our academy just doesn't seem to produce top ones, maybe it's the state of the English game in general I don't know. For example I'd be amazed if M. Keane became anything other than another James Chester, that's if he's lucky as Chester is still a PL defender after all.

134~~~
When exactly was our academy meant to produce these world class CBs, for them to actually gain first team experience to progress to the required level?

Again, we have had Smalling and Jones on our books for a few years and they both struggled to get gametime at CB, how are you expecting the youngsters from the academy to be getting it?

Blackett has shown promise and so far this season has in fact been one of our best players - but you are casually ignoring his contribution as it pretty much voids your argument.

135~~~
Good days, he was excellent alongside Rio aswel. It really looks like he can't do it alongside younger CBs alongside him.

136~~~
Wow. He was so bad that I don't know if you simply erase this as an off night or bin him for a few weeks.

I mean he was about 5 levels below bad.

137~~~
Throw yourself into a fecking challenge you twat, just stood off whilst they crossed for the second and a pathetic 'tackle' for their 4th

138~~~
How are these guys going to get a chance if we have one of the best two defenders in our history playing in the first team for a long period? That is why they have been mentioned. World class players don't grow on trees, if you don't give them a chance and be patient they may become good/great. You just have to wait and see - a couple of bad nights and calling them shite and rubbish and never going to make it is just not the way that this happens. Good players learn from their mistakes, great players don't make them again.

139~~~
He was completely below par. Smalling was good, Vidic was good but with a couple of mad performances. Jones was good.

Evans didnt play well. At all.

140~~~
I'd probably class Smalling as was our best centre-back; Vidic was average; and Jones was decent but made more errors than Evans when he played as a centre-back. The level of consistency Evans had when he returned to our side is far greater than what Jones produced for us as a centre-back. When Evans came back into the side, we looked more solid defensively though it obviously doesn't reflect well that he was considered our best CB by some (myself included), which isn't a criticism of him. Hull (A) game onwards, he started making key errors, but his main problem was that he wasn't fit enough for the second half of the season.

IMO it's disingenuous to say what you said. He was awful tonight and I've already questioned his mobility in this system. But some of the posts in this thread are a continuation of knee-jerk reactions and exaggeration that's been present on here since the Swansea game. Take a look at the Rooney/Mata thread...

141~~~
He's always coming back from an injury that's half the problem, that and lack of defending ability over a 90mins period.

142~~~
Those forgiving this performance are being far too sentimental and thats been this club's problem for a while now. If he's capable of being that bad, theres no point in keeping him in the picture. He's not a consistent enough player and his highest level of play comes about as often as a solar eclipse. Although it sucks, he's just not going to cut it as a starting xi, quality option for our defence.

143~~~
To put it bluntly, he's shit and has been shit for some time now.

144~~~
Unbelieveable reaction. Yes, he was poor, extremely poor by his standards but the same people saying that he is our best CB (Rojo not included) just last week are now saying how woeful he has always been and that he should be sold this week.

We are in complete meltdown.

145~~~
It's reactions like this that have kept at the club for as long as he has been. He should have been sold after the city 'sick swan' game. If I was LVG, I'd make an example of him and ship him out before the end of this window.

146~~~
Good thing is you aren't.

147~~~
Sort of sums up a lot of United fans at the moment, lets sell our most experienced CB, the position where we need numbers and experience. Bloody hell.

148~~~
Had a 'mare yesterday, probably wasn't fully fit and was rushed back due to the embarrassingly low number of senior defenders we possess.

149~~~
He's never been good without a decent CB next to him, especially when we've been under pressure. Experienced at what making mistakes!?

150~~~
I'm not seeing what others see in him.......... looks to be an average player at best. His performances have been very average for a while now too.

151~~~
I probably see him as our best defender, but I don't see much between him and our other centre-halves. He'll never be top quality unfortunately, but as we know there aren't many top quality centre-halves currently available to us.

152~~~
Ah, so bring in an experienced CB to play along side, oh wait, we just sold him, damn.

I know you're upset at the moment, we all are but try your best to stay calm, selling Evans makes no sense. Once you have a nap, you will realise that.

153~~~
Dropping him makes sense.

154~~~
We are talking about selling. Also, it's his first game of the season, he was brought in for a League Cup game, can we give van Gaal time to get back to Manchester before he drops him.

155~~~
A performance to forget for Jonny. Not going to jump on the bandwagon like others though and say he's a poor defender in general. Just had a bad day at the office.

156~~~
Not when the alternative is probably Keane and we're absolutely desperate to both get a win and implement our senior players into a new system.

157~~~
Genuinely, based on what though? What defensive attributes/qualities is he better than Smalling at? I can kinda see why people would think he's a better CB due to his distribution but as a pure defender Smalling just looks on a different level.

158~~~
Sorry, I should've worded it centre-back. Yeah, I agree with you in term of pure defensive ability, Smalling is currently the best in the squad. I still feel Evans is the better all round centre-back though and should be first on the team sheet in defence.

159~~~
We need desperately to revert to a four man defence and I would like to see Jones paired with Rojo. Evans was shocking last night and incapable of organising his defence. LvG may have been impressed with him on tour but he doesn't strike fear into strikers like Vidic and he lacks Rio's game reading. Poor.

160~~~
hopefully we can get smalling rojo and jones together

161~~~
if we talk about deadwood and average players, who are not United standard, put him on that list if he wasnt already. Injury prone, cant defend, looks scared when someone runs at him, all over the place and makes costly mistakes. Reminds me of Vermaelen. Just a standard midtable premier league defender. The guy is 26, should massively step up after the patience we had with him, played yesterday like a U19 academy player. Jones and Smalling would now been further in their career if they got the playing time Evans got. If Jones had a game like yesterday, people would even slaughter him  in 2 years for that. He is in the Cleverley, Fletcher and Hernandez category now. Just waiting for another game to prove that he is useless when Rio or Vidic arent around him, probably will be injured in 2 weeks. Maybe Barcelona will be interested after we bench him. Just the thought of Diego Costa running at him and bullying him will be hopefully enough for everybody to realise that our Jonny never was good enough and probably never will be. Fergie got decent performances out of him, now he really is a complete liability.

162~~~
Disappointing to watch him nowadays. A couple of years ago, in top form, you'd have thought he's going to be an absolute brilliant CB but seems like he has regressed. Too many half arsed performances lately

163~~~
By far the worst game I've ever seen him play, but I still think he's our best centre half.

164~~~
he was appaling last night, but still feel he is our best center back, his performances over the period of vidic long injury showed a level of consistency and quality yet to be anyway near matched by smalling or jones

165~~~
I agree. His ability seems a bit inflated on here. When he first broke into the team in 08/09, and then in spells since then, he's looked colossal. Future captain material. He just hasn't kicked on though. His positioning hasn't improved, and he still gets caught playing everyone onside, or nowhere near his man. He's so easily overpowered as well. In terms of physical prowess, Smalling and Jones look so much more domineering in the challenge and in the air, than Evans does.

I think Smalling is currently better, if played in a back four (it seems impossible to judge anyone in the back 3, because they all look pretty awful).

166~~~
He has yet to show the ability to be the leader of the defence. In that respect, it is hard to justify that he is the best centre back. For me, when Shaw is fit, I would like to see Jones partner Rojo. And, of course, ditching the back three formation.

167~~~
You'd think he was as bad as Djemba-Djemba judging by the comments here. Evans has been good the vast majority of his games for us playing alongside both Vidic,Rio,Smalling,Jones and whoever else he was beside.Bit of rubbish here. Last season he was up/down but the season before that he was brilliant and people thought he had a shot at being in the team of the season. Cut him some slack.

168~~~
Currently 26 years old, not had a good season other than one a few years back, you'd hope he would come into his prime about now

169~~~
^ This.

170~~~
This could be a sentence about any one of Jones Evans or Smalling couldn't it? Shame really

171~~~
i dont think jones has shown that either.... and ive never seen jones perform to the level evans did when he was playing regualry a few seasons back, so would still pick evans. and i honestly dont no how good rojo is at left back as ive only seen him play left back. 

it also very worring if where already talking about dropping a back three.... kind of says van gaal dosnt no what he's doing which i dont want to even consider yet.

172~~~
i think has a lot to do with the fact he was playing reguarly, vidic came back and he was dropped and i just dont think his confidence has recovered

173~~~
To be honest, I never found Smalling bad. I like him a lot actually but then I might just be biased

174~~~
Might be true but I just find it hard to believe that a professional football player cant regain his confidence within 3 or more years

175~~~
its not 3 years its about 18 months, and last season with all the chopping and changing was hard for any player to get any level of consistancy

still think out of all the defenders we have evans should be first on team sheet,  niether smalling or jones have come close to a level evans has demonstrated at his best, and ive never seen rojo play center back

176~~~
By far our best CB on the ball. His return at least gives us the ability to play the ball out from the back consistantly.

177~~~
He's only had one good season? Okay then.

178~~~
Yup, Agree with all of this and, whilst Jones has time on his side, this commentary applies almost equally to Smalling.

If people think that's unfair on these two, ask yourselves this. If Smalling/Jones/Evans were not at United already, would you be thrilled if we were to sign any of them? Would you think wow, that's a statement of intent as he will definitely improve us?. Or would you be thinking injury prone squad player?

179~~~
The back 3 is being used out of necessity, to accomodate other players, because we don't have the squad to play 433, and in a certain way to send a message to the board, imo. It's not his preferred formation (and wasn't for Holland until Strootman got injured), and it'll probably be ditched as soon as he has the resources to play something else. Van Gaal knows exactly what he's doing.

180~~~
He hasn't had one good season, his best spell was on loan at Sunderland. Why so many seem to have always rated him is beyond me, was he a great youth player or something? I could count on one hand the number of performances for us he has impressed me. Gets turned easily, isn't great in the box, is over rated on the ball. Im not saying he is a bad defender, he is an average one, a decent squad player and for me has never been anything more than a fourth choice centre back. Wes Brown for example was a promising young defender for us, had a couple of injuries and seemed to lose a bit of confidence and form and has been average ever since. Evans has never looked to me like a player that would be a first choice centre back, and the fact so many seem to be saying he is our best defender either means a) Im totally wrong b) Our defence is an utter shambles c) People are deludedly loyal to our own players. If Evans is our best centre back and a starter for us consistently throughout the season we will be ripped apart by the likes of Costa for example in bigger games.

181~~~
He's had one season where has looked good enough for United in some respect, every other season is debatable due to his form, injuries or lower leagues

182~~~
still one more then smalling or jones

183~~~
i dont think he would have spent all summer working on onw formation if he planned to abondon it as soon as he boight some diffrent players, seems bizzare to work for a month on a forthanion for just 3 perimer league games before the window shuts then change it as he changed personel.

184~~~
When you consider Smalling didn't play professional football until 3/4 years ago, and Jones season before last was his 2nd full season, and still only getting sub appearances. Jonny's been here nearly 9 years and is 27 in Jan, whereas
Smalling is 23 and jones turned 22 this year... completely different kettle of fish

185~~~
Aye, I'd be the same. Although Jones has started the season in great form and always looked to have more potential than Evans.

The criticism in this thread after one bad game is insanely over the top. People saying hes only had a handful of good games in his entire United career. FFS...

My god he was bad last night, though...

You have to wonder how many games he's played in a back five, even in training? If he's only just back from injury and missed most of pre-season he's probably had less opportunity than any other defender to get his head round the new formation. Certainly looks that way.

186~~~
smalling is acually 25 in november... so no kid by any imagination....but i do get your point that these players are younger and have has less chance to turn in a decent season.
 but the point remanins they havn't, say they have potential to is completely different to actually doing it.

and as for lack at opportunity look at evans he has consonantly played second fiddle to vidic and ferdinand, and only really had one season where he was first choice and that season was in the top 3 or 4 center backs in the country, and then they got fit again and he went back to been heavily rotated and lost all form. so if where talking about lack of opportunities id say evans has a fairly strong case in that department

the bottom line is still in his career evans has showed a level of performance neither smaling or jones has, and for me that puts him ahead of them

187~~~
<a class="username" data-user="84846, @Nytram Shakes" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84846/">@Nytram Shakes</a> 

Good post, I'd suggest he is our best overall defender, my problem is the level he's at and the fact he's regarded as the best, if he was a squad player, lovely. Smalling & Jones breaking through, and Jones has about 4 seasons less experience than Evans, so he is a kid in comparison and Smalling, while being 24 wasn't playing proper footbll 5 years ago, so time at the top has been 2-3 years for them and 6-7 years for Jonny, ignoring the first 2/3 years of Jonny here.

I don't think we should sell him, but typically we have 2x top class CB's, 2x young emerging centre back and 1x squad player/utlity cover and currently, I'd use him as the 1 extra, Smalling Jones as upcoming and say we need 2 to CB's, but I feel with Evans here, that won't happen.

188~~~
A horrible day in an awful office for him last night, total collapse. Hopefully, after a win or two, he will get his confidence back. Will highly ever reach the levels of Rio, Vida or Stam it seems.

189~~~
i still think he is regarded as the best becuase he is the only defender we have who has shown that he can perform consistently at the top level, now i agree with you we probably shouldnt be in a position that evans is the best center back we have when he has only really had one top quality season, we should have bought an established quality center back, but we didnt and it dosnt look like we will.

i also think the issue of having to up and coming center backs is at some point they have got to come throu, if jones and smalling don't come through this season will they ever? probably not. so if we did buy two new cb's following your model, you couldnt really count them as up and coming,  they would be simply squad players.

if you tak the argument that we have a lot of center backs already and thats why we didnt buy, and we need to sell, i certainly don't think Evans should be the firs for the chop, hands down should be smalling, i no he hasnt had a long professional career, but at nearly 25, he simply hasn't shown enough to justify any long term faith in him.

i think the answer really is very basic, we needed to buy a top 1 top quality center back for, and let the rest of them scrap for a place alongside him, if thats evans because he regains his form of 18months ago then great, and if that jones or smalling finally for filling thier promise then equally great.

of course the forgotton man in all this is Rojo, is he the reliable quality CB where crying out for? i personally have no idea, he looked a decent enough left back at the world cup does that mean he will can add some steal to the middle of our defense... absolutely no idea. But whether he is or isnt i still think our best hope for sorting out our defensive issues is evans regaining his form of 18 months ago, if that dosn't happen and we dont buy further i think our chances of top four are pretty slim.

190~~~
I disagree. The revisionism in this thread is a little bit ridiculous. Evans had two good seasons (08/09 and 12/13) and one world class season (11/12). You can even throw in last season (first half when he was fit) because there's definitely a case to be made for that, as we looked much better with him in the team. That doesn't excuse his awful performance. Someone with his experience should produce much better.

I do wonder where he'll play though. Jones' aggressiveness is perfect for pressing in midfield areas; Smalling is our best defender, but evidently needs more practice on his distribution; Evans had a good pre-season, but LCB requires more mobility than he has and Blackett has surprisingly done very well. He's best suited to the middle to sweep and to start off our attacks. Either way, he doesn't scare me. He's a good defender and has the potential to become better.

191~~~
I don't rate Evans anywhere near as highly as others it would appear.

Good on the ball, but for someone who's 26 and he looks like he needs a more experienced partner all the time. Isn't vocal enough, injury prone and to be honest, if he was at another club say Everton, I doubt we'd be happy if we were rumoured to be after him. He gets over-rated because people want him to succeed as he came through the academy.

192~~~
He's already a better defender than Evans can ever hope to be. Why don't we just play Carrick at CB if ball playing ability is all that matters?

What pure defensive characteristics/attributes is Evans better at than Smalling? Genuinely, I'm baffled. He's on a completely different planet aerially, he's much quicker and much cleaner tackler. He's never been sent off for us and doesn't get stupid yellows as well. His on ball ability is a problem, but your CBs need to be good defenders first and it should be something that can be fixed. Is is Evans' mystical ability to lead and organize the defence which is somehow only present when Rio Ferdinand or Nemanja Vidic happen to be his partners?

193~~~
I see the future of our defence as a signing plus Jones. That signing might be Rojo but I have not seen enough of him to comment. Evans is a fine player but has a poor injury record and, being brutally honest, is not quite good enough to be United's senior defender if they want to climb back to the top. The standard should be Pallister, Stam, Rio or Vidic. Evans would be ok playing alongside someone of that ilk but, given his frequent absences, I am not sure he is reliable enough. I appreciate Jones is also a frequent sick note but I think that is more a result of immaturity and can hopefully be removed as he learns to judge challenges better.

194~~~
id say evans is positionaly better and more reliable and while he dosnt have great orgaistional abilities the light years ahead of smalling.  smalling maybe a cleaner tackler and quicker, but hes hardly played a more then one good game at a time for us since he has been here.

all our defenders have been poor for the last 18 months, but at least evans has shown he can step up and deliver at the highest regualry in the past, smalling never has.

195~~~
He was terrible, sure. He's still our best CB, though. Jones and Smalling haven't proven themselves any better, far from it. Rojo? No idea, really. I've seen him at CB a total of...one and a half times, I think. Hopefully he can go in and add something right away. We need that.

196~~~
I've never rated Evans. Never understood why Fergie had so much faith in him, he pretty much guaranteed his future and said he'd be captain one day. I couldn't see it and I still don't. The guy is now 26 and while that's still young for a defender, I think he's hit his ceiling at OT. He's not even half the player Vidic and Rio were to United. Im not saying he's terrible, the man has had some great games in a United shirt, but he's no more to us than say Varmaelen was to Arsenal, or Skyrtel to Liverpool. That's his level.

197~~~
Arguably our best CB. Look who he has for competition though, Smalling and Jones, two players who haven't been developed the right way in their natural positions and still lack experience. He should be our best CB without a shadow of doubt but that's not the case.

198~~~
Regardless of the merits of Jones, Smalling, Evans, Rojo, I think the 3-5-2 is causing unnecessary problems when we have enough trying to construct a decent midfield. So first thing is to get rid...Mr. van Gaal?

199~~~
I think Evans and Keane were guilty of giving it away in dangerous positions. It's crazy football. Just smack it down field and get back in formation. We almost gave it away 2-3 times against Mk Dons. Not good enough. Needs to make sure of his pass. I don't understand why these lads don't just smack it up field. It's not pretty but it's effective and not half as problematic as if you give it away needlessly. If the midfield switch off and our dopey lot do, suddenly we find ourselves in 1 vs 1 situations and it's just a race then.

200~~~
Yes. And I agree. I just think the whole thing (both your assessment and mine) could be paraphrased as: We should have better central defenders. But we don't.

201~~~
SO BAD.

202~~~
If he never played for United again, I wouldn't give a toss. Been shit for two and a bit seasons now.

203~~~
Sad to say but absolutely without confidence. A shadow of himself.

204~~~
Not good enough. If we had brought in a few defenders this season, I'd want him booted out as part of the deadwood.

Two brainfarts from him today.

205~~~
For someone who's meant to be good with the ball, he's been dreadful the last 2 games. Should not play when Rojo is sorted out.

206~~~
Our worst defender, he is just average. He wouldnt be misplaced at Hull.

207~~~
Terrible today. I'm usually a fan of his, but he was absolutely awful today, and has been all season.

208~~~
I actually dislike him at this stage. It makes me angry to see his name in the team sheet. Such a waste of space.

209~~~
Was he drinking last night, that was terrible

210~~~
Can we sell him? He finds it incredibly difficult to pass to his own teammates.  At least if we were a man down there'd be no one to give the ball away outside our own box.

211~~~
Our best defender eh? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

212~~~
Good on the ball? Not right now he isn't. He pisses his pants in possession with any pressure on him.

Right now Jones is the only CB I trust.

213~~~
Can't help but laugh at those who say he's our best defender. Can't make simple passes, takes an hour to decide who he wants to pass to, average defending and so fecking slow.

214~~~
All of those two games he's featured in. I don't what makes today's performance terrible? I thought he was good defensively and that it was his distribution (especially under pressure) which was his weak point today. He really needs to just hoof the ball up the field next time, rather than risk exposing us further by dwelling on the ball.

215~~~
The Cleverley of CB

Doesn't look good enough to be a backup CB for us.

216~~~
Ball playing CB people call him. Yeah right.

217~~~
Terrible again today.

218~~~
He just plays the ball to the pressing attacker, normally in a brilliant position.

219~~~
Crap.

220~~~
He's supposed to be our most experienced defender and a leader at the back. He's showing none of those characteristics so far. Just looks nervous all the time and dallies on the ball.

221~~~
Another poor performance. Probably our worst CB atm.

222~~~
There's no probably about it.  Jones and Blackett are miles better and there's no way Smalling can be worse.

223~~~
He looks a leader when Vidic and Rio were there holding his hand.

224~~~
Every time he is under pressure, he can't pass. Either he plays a stupid back pass and adds pressure on the keeper or he tries something stupid and gets caught out. Why are so scared when you have the ball and someone runs at you? This was how he was three years ago as well. Every time he got the ball, he played it back to the keeper. Thought he grew out of it. Pathetic first two performances of the year.

225~~~
Genuinely diabolical defending from him. It's not even a question of ability anymore, he needs to get out of his slump and needs to stop making suicidal mistakes at the back. Growing a pair to lead the back four would be lovely, but at times it almost like he has bet against the team and is throwing the match.  

Rojo should be replacing him instead of Blackett

226~~~
What has happened to him? He was so assured and confident in possession before this season and he's suddenly turned into a nervous wreck.

227~~~
Confidence has clearly been smashed to pieces. He needs to sort it out though because we need our CBs to be on their game.

228~~~
He has always looked suspect when Rio or Vidic haven't been next to him.

229~~~
He's the last guy I expected to struggle in a back 3 given his footballing abilities. I feel those are wasted too with him not playing in the middle of the back 3. I can though understand the reasoning behind playing Jones through the middle as he is more solid defensively.

230~~~
If we are going to persist with this back 3 then he has to play in the center of the 3, he's lost as wider CB that requires more one on one duels and more speed and mobility than he has.

231~~~
At least if he's out wide, he doesn't give the ball away directly in front of goal so they have some work left to do.

232~~~
Spinless fecking performance. Absolutely pathetic by one of our most senior players.

233~~~
It's worth pointing out that he's just back from injury but Evans has always had a mistake in him. I still think he's probably one of our best 2 centre halves although that shows just how far we've dropped off from when Rio and Vidic were in their pop. He's not a leader either albeit no one in the current squad is, it's depressing how little character we seem to have.

234~~~
He is beneficial for the opposing team to have on the pitch.

235~~~
Slightly better performance than against MK Dons. Still intent on gifting opponents the ball near our goal. Amazed we managed to keep a clean sheet. Hopefully he will find his form very soon as otherwise he'll find himself sat on the subs bench most of the season.

236~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Silver linings I guess then.

237~~~
He's the most experienced defender at the club. Just let that sink in.

238~~~
The mistakes are one obvious thing that is alarming about him. But even when he isn't making them, he's so slow to actually decide what to do with and play the ball.

239~~~
Center back struggling to regain form in recovery from lengthy injuries shocker.

240~~~
I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's ring rusty and when you take into account he's coming back when there's a new system or style of play being thought I think it's understandable enough that he's and others too (he's not the only one at it) is making such silly errors. As a unit our defence has looked all over the place since the start of the season. I'd be confident enough that time will iron out all the problems at the back.

241~~~
He looks better when he has a commanding player next to him. A bit of responsibility and he shits himself.

242~~~
Even when fully fit and on form, he's not exactly a feared and coveted world beater. He's endemic of the level the club have been accepting for the last couple of years.

243~~~
You mean when he had either Rio or Vidic to hold his hand? You'd think he'd have learned a thing or two from them.

244~~~
I still hope/ believe he can become a key player for us.

Not with passing like that though.

245~~~
Did he break up with his girlfriend or something?  Need to have Wayne hook him up with some working girls...

246~~~
Still shaky, but got better as the game went. Jones was clearly the better of the two and looks to be the one wanting to partner with Rojo.

247~~~
Improved somewhat during the game. Three word phrase that's scary though: Evans in space.

248~~~
It's a symptom of a lot of our younger players who aren't so young anymore imo. They should now be experienced enough to not need people holding their hands every game and take a bit more responsibility.

249~~~
Patently not true.

250~~~
He needs a good toe up the whole every now and then.

251~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://twii.edgeboss.net/download/twii/manutd/video_mufc_20140905_IceChallenge.mp4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://twii.edgeboss.net/download/twii/manutd/video_mufc_20140905_IceChallenge.mp4</a>

252~~~
Since he's basically guaranteed a start on Sunday, how many times will he needlessly and dangerously give the ball away?  Over/Under: 3.

253~~~
Jonny "Drogba Killer" Evans has had his highs and quite a few lows. I was really disappointed in how he played last season.

I wish I knew the issue, honestly I feel like he was better when he first came through.

Remember that record shutout streak for VdS? That was Vidic and Evans, ans Evans looked great.

Around that time northern Ireland had a great defensive run and he was integral to that.

I suspect it's mental. Perhaps he's gotten away from what made him more successful. He seems less passionate as well.

254~~~
When he first came through, the spotlight was on the other areas of our play, the excitment of Rooney and Ronaldo etc, we had Scholes and Carrick dictating games. It was a really good introduction for him, having Rio and Vidic there at the same time. Over the last two seasons, the spotlight has been on the CB's because of the pressure they have been under (brought on themselves but also our midfield problems which leave them exposed). I wouldn't say it's a team in transition in the way that it's usually used but it's not the most stable environment that he was introduced into.

I'm positive that the good side of his game is still there, whether LVG is able to get it out of him, time will tell but I think he has a better chance than most. And whilst he isn't new onto the scene, he is still only 26, he could have another 8-10 years playing in the EPL. He is going through a tough stage in his career that I'm sure will help him develop.

255~~~
Evans will always be a good backup player. A lifer at OT, but we need better leading the backline

256~~~
Evans had his day, but my God he's looked shite for the last 2+ seasons.  I'm on the edge of giving up all hope on him, but maybe if he can get some mental help -- and his problems are entirely mental -- he might return to that form from 3 seasons ago.

257~~~
If Jones and Smalling can both maintain long injury free spells they'll easily displace Evans.

258~~~
It's debatable in that we've never seen Jones or Smalling play for an extended period of time with the responsibility and at the center - both seem to have some very good performances but, with their injury record and being played in other positions - it's difficult to say they'd easily displace him.

Evans at his best has shown he can belong in the starting lineup but, because of his drop in confidence/form and Jones/Smalling could easily displace him. All things equal - all playing to their ability, confident and injury free, I think all 3 would give the manager one hell of a headache.

Edit: For a long time I thought Evans could really be the next big thing but, much like Valencia I've got serious doubts if he'll ever get his confidence back to drive him to the next level which he showed a lot of potential for a couple years back.

259~~~
Indeed. We still need to buy a top level CB. Our most experienced and CB shouldn't be a confidence player, he should be a leader but sadly thats not the case.

260~~~
Don't see much recent improvement in him and think he has probably peaked.  He's not looking like a clear long term first choice.

261~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> all this peak talk. Kagawa peaked at 23 apparently, Evans peaked too already. Who peaked too? Maybe Shaw peaked with 18, you never know.

262~~~
He's reached his limit in my opinion. Whereas Rojo, Jones and Smalling all have room for improvement, I don't envisage Evans eclipsing some of his finest seasons in a United shirt. His game has greatly enhanced when playing either in decent winning sides, sturdy defences and alongside an instrumental player like Rio and Vidic, but I don't think we have those elements to our game besides the former. He isn't someone who is capable of assuming defensive responsibilities and becoming the defensive leader and he shouldn't be anymore than a squad player IMO.

I'm not completely sold by any of our defenders in general, but at least all have some positives and are capable of more. Jones is in really good form and in theory, should eradicate his defensive weaknesses. Smalling is generally a very good defender, but his ability on the ball is in question and Rojo is a van Gaal approved signing.

He'll probably become demoted to a squad player, but if he continues in his current form, I could see LVG sanctioning his sale next season.

263~~~
Agreed.

For me, he's a 'secondary defender', the Robin to someone else's batman. The kind of defender that will do well if he has a leader next to him, a Vidic or a Terry. They can take control and lead the defense, while Jonny can go about his job quietly and effectively. But he just isn't a main man, he doesn't have that ability to be the leader, and doubt he ever will have.

264~~~
Watched the Burnley game again and the defenders were fine apart from a couple times when they had to distribute the ball. That also had to do with Fletcher hiding at CM and them not walking out with it when they had space in front of them. Blackett was also poor with the ball. Burnley didn't create anything. Even in the Swansea game, we basically got caught with two attacks. For one of the goals our CM's disappeared after pressing higher up the pitch.

265~~~
I reckon he's got Everton written all over him

266~~~
Been poor again thus far, I thought he was are "ball playing" defender?

267~~~
Why has his passing become so shit? If he's not playing it to the opposition he's under hitting them badly. He used to be very good at this

268~~~
The master of the hospital under hit pass to Rafael.

269~~~
Evans really hasn't been poor. Assessing his overall performance in a fixture based on his skills on the ball and ignoring his good defending, which includes a clearance that could have resulted in a goal, is harsh and unfair. He really does need to stop under-hitting passes which has been a common feature in every game he's played for us this season, that's something we can all agree on - even his successful passes are lacking sharpness, but that's just me being cynical.

270~~~
He has been poor. It's a miracle we didn't concede at Burnley with his passing and he's again put pressure on us due to his passing.

He's ll get over it though as we know he's very good at this aspect.

271~~~
I don't believe so. What's poor for you <i>may</i> not be poor for me. If we're talking about his overall performance - passing and defending combined - then he's been far from poor. If you specifically judge him on his passing, then he's definitely been poor by his standards. Defensively, he's dealt with everything well and done what you expect. He's not looking great under pressure on the ball at the moment, but with more games (as you said) he'll find more confidence.

272~~~
You have to be blind to say Evans has been poor.

273~~~
Eh? Passing is huge aspect of football so I'm not sure why you would ignore that in analyzing the player.

274~~~
Definitely have a soft spot for our Johnny. On his day he is an immense defender. Sad to say the other days he is a complete and utter liability. Jones should be taking his spot when fit.

275~~~
Four defender system player. Change something in that regard and he'll forget how to play football.

Anyway, he's back and looks miles faster than few weeks ago. Perfect chance for him while Jones & Smalling are combo injured.

276~~~
Re-read my post. I never said that.

277~~~
Evans and Blackett, cool and smooth today.

278~~~
Much, much sharper off the ball and very solid defensively. A good performance overall. Some of his passes, however, were under-hit and terrible which he needs to quickly sort out.

279~~~
Saved a certain goal but nearly gifted another to QPR. Brainfarts are still very much an issue.

280~~~
Improved in the 2nd half.

281~~~
was ok today, but there is really no weight in his passing, very disappointing in that aspect today, otherwise solid in defence and saved a goal.

282~~~
His passes back to the keeper are extremely dodgy for some reason.

283~~~
Dodgy again today but worth being patient and getting him back to his best, top defender when he's on a run of form

284~~~
Far from being out best defender. Always good for a blunder our Johnny

285~~~
Still doesn't look good enough to step up in the way we really need him to. Unfortunately we have yet to see if any of Jones, Smalling or Rojo can make that step up either so we're probably going to be relying on him quite a lot this season.

Evans should ideally be no more than a squad player.

286~~~
More dodgy back passes to De Gea but did well in preventing Qpr's sole chance on goal.

287~~~
He has mistakes in him which is very worrying given our lack of options at CB.

288~~~
Don't get the criticism? Thought he had a good game? Brilliant anticipation to bail Rojo/De Gea out after a woeful brain fart.

289~~~
He had a good game but sometimes he is a bit worrying in possession and distribution.

290~~~
He's more comfortable when he's not expected to be the main man, which doesn't help much right now with the personnel we have.

291~~~
Apart from the dodgy backpass. Then him running up front and giving the ball away, which forced RVP to get a booking.

292~~~
He started the season poorly but hasn't played much - thought he did well today

293~~~
I'd say so far this season, Jones has certainly proved he can make that step up. I think he and Rojo could strike up a decent partnership in my opinion

294~~~
Yeah, if Rojo kicks on from today's performance they could be a really exciting partnership.

295~~~
I agree with this. I didn't notice him do anything wrong (my stream went a bit wonky at the end, so perhaps I missed something.) I think people have selective memory regarding Evans. Yes he had a dreadful game recently, one which brought back uncomfortable memories of that dodgy patch he went through 4-5 years ago. But really, his biggest issue in recent seasons has been his health, not his performance.

296~~~
I can't get why so many posters on the post match thread are panning him. He had a couple of iffy back passes, but seemed very good otherwise!

297~~~
Which, ironically is the main thing that he was praised for so much before this season. Strange.

298~~~
He's had a couple of iffy back passes in practically every game he's played this season.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's the problem, although I feel he generally did a  good job defensively today.

299~~~
Exactly, he looks like the young Evans who was afraid of his own shadow, i don't understand.

300~~~
He used to look excellent on the ball, but recently, his passing in dangerous areas has been awful. He should just hoof it, to be safe. Looked okay otherwise, but hard to judge either of the two centre backs, as QPR didn't really have a sniff. It was great defending as a unit, especially now we have good protection from midfield in Herrera and Blind.

301~~~
He is still my first choice CB. Dont like those underhit back passes seeping into his game. Only a minor issue. Dont expect to see it happen again.

302~~~
Haha maybe he's overrating his ability on the ball.

303~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

304~~~
It's Evans. He can do no good.

305~~~
I just never feel confident when he's supposed to be the leader of the back 4. I don't know, maybe it will get rubbed in my face come the end of the season but I still think we'll need to buy a truly top CB before the start of next season.

306~~~
Pretty baffled reading some of the posts in here, regarding Jonny's performance today. Granted he didn't get much of a test defensively, he made some crucial blocks and interceptions, and apart from his under hit pass to De Gea, his ball distribution was really good, in my opinion. I thought he had a really good game.

307~~~
Good peformance. He's not looking as good on the ball as he used to. I wonder if that's down to Blackett and rojo being very comfortable on him and Evans looking relatively worse now.

308~~~
He was okay. Even against Burnley he didn't do much wrong apart from perhaps one or two iffy passes. Defensively, we have been good in both the QPR and Burnley games.

309~~~
Thought he was good.  Looks more comfortable in a 2 than a 3. Opposite of Blackett.

310~~~
Thought he was good, shaky at times but the intent was there from him, just poor execution, that save from De Gea and Rojo's mix up was crucuial.

311~~~
He underhit a couple passes to Raf in the first half, but other than that he had a good game. Better passing as the game went on, solid defending, even brought up the ball and won a foul in QPR's half.

312~~~
Well, it was a lot better than the League Cup game

313~~~
For being our best defender on the ball (which I believe he is), he has looked really nervy and uncomfortable since he got back. Thought he was better though, still not great. Seems to be an improving with every game he has played since returning so hopefully that rend continues.

314~~~
Unfortunately, he's shaping up to the next scapegoat (or spacegoat) for the caf. He's a genuinely good defender, he's playing his first match and for whole 90 minutes. Jones has time on his side, he's 22 and he's learning the game. Defenders are good when they reach 26 or 27 and with some more match time, I hope he strikes up a good partnership with Rojo and he's given the chance. He hardly had a bad game, especially considering he was thrust into the match due to Jones injury without having minutes on the pitch. 

Criticism in the match day thread is always over the top as it's minute by minute, but can't understand the criticism here. Or I'm extremely biased towards Johnny Evans.

315~~~
It's not his first match. It's his 3rd of the season I think.

316~~~
His first match after injury, correct? I don't think he played for Northern Ireland either.

317~~~
I know he wasn't tested much, and he did make a key 'goal-line' clearance - but I also felt he looked 'poor' yesterday. He seems to have lost something.

318~~~
His fitness, he was out for ages.

319~~~
He played against MK Dons and Burnley.

320~~~
I would give him one more game and if looks as shake and Shaw is fit - go for Blackett-Rojo-Shaw

321~~~
How long is Smalling out for? He has missed a few weeks now. If Evans still struggles then I can see Rojo moving across or Smalling coming back in.

322~~~
Yeah, I think so. With Smalling, Jones, and a past-it Rio/Vidic partner, Evans was always going to look a lot more comfortable on the ball. I guess it has given us the impression that he really is a ball playing defender, but now he is with these types of players, he seems fairly above average in his distribution. He has the vision and the ability to play on both feet, but his execution and power is really lacking.

323~~~
Evans will have to play while there are injuries but I would like to see the back four of Rafael-Jones-Rojo-Shaw.

324~~~
Surprised to see him being criticised for yesterday. Thought he was very good minus the under hit passes to Rafael.

325~~~
Thought he looked much better from when he made his block, seemed to give him a bit of confidence.

326~~~
with Evans its all about confidence, which is low at the moment. He won't be world class but if we can get his confidence back up he might be good partner to Jones or Rojo because them both are impetuous at times. Pairing them both seems not the best partnership on paper. He is the most experienced at the back.

No doubt we still have to be in the transfer market next time for a world-class defender but for the time being an Evans on form would be important to us.

327~~~
Blackett? He wasn't exactly convincing yesterday was he?

328~~~
One slightly shaky moment if I remember rightly?

Evans seems to have a period in most games where his movements have apparently been taken over by the opposition and he's doing his best to feck us over. I think it's a concentration thing with him. Big lapses and his game goes out the window for a while. Nervy looking as well. Blackett actually appears more composed than him but short on experience. A tough call but we know it's a weakness in our team.

I'd probably favour Blackett at this stage. This could be the right time to give him a run of games in a team that looks like it could score for fun and potentially make amends for any defensive inexperience.

329~~~
And if it was Evans that made that mistake, or the De Gea one, or any of the many defensive mistakes we made yesterday this place would be up in arms about it.
Evans mistakes are highlighted on here more than any other defensive player, on many occasions he has been blamed for mistakes that clearly weren't his fault.
He played well yesterday, the best game he's had since he came back from injury. Yet he's been heavily criticised by some, it's getting a bit tiresome now.

330~~~
Why do people think Rojo is an automatic choice now? He hasn't even played at CB for us and now he is the number one pick there. 

Evans - besides two underhit passes - was good yesterday.

331~~~
Because a player in his position should not make such mistakes. He has to compete with Blackett? If he was as good as he should and could have been, nobody would even question his spot. By now, if you are not good enough, you are simply not good enough. My problem is mostly his character. Seems scared at times and generally feeling like a mistake about to happen. Blackett, as young and foolish ( yesterday) as he is  seems much more composed on the ball.

332~~~
Whats getting tiresome is excuses being made for sloppy and mediocre play as though we've somehow come to expect it. He plays well in periods but consistent, reliable, dependable he is not. Evans is a byword for sloppy. The underhit backpass is his speciality. Did you watch the MK Dons game? The Burnley game? 

I made it three? Whatever, it's two/three too many. He consistently sells the keeper and others short. We have a problem when a senior CB is regarded as having had a good game despite underhitting his passing and gifting attacking chances to the likes of QPR.

333~~~
If by people, you mean me - i said IF Evans has another shaky game and IF Shaw is fit we should at least try and  see if it works better. Its not automatically 1st choice for any of them. If one is under performing, why not try the rest?

334~~~
Every single player makes mistakes, it just some choose to remember Evans over anybody else’s, why? He’s an easy target it seems, even when he does play well people moan about two misplaced passes yet forget to mention that he actually played well or all the other errors the defence made.

There are very few seasoned players in this squad who’s position hasn’t been questioned, in fact I can’t think of one, Rooney, RVP, Mata, De Gea, Rafael all players who’s ability has been questioned, yet they get away with murder on occasion because they are crowd favourites.


What excuses? He has been one of our best CBs for the last two seasons, if you choose not to think that then fine. Some people just don’t like a player for whatever reason, again that’s fine, but let’s not start making up bullshit reasons by saying that under hit back passes is his speciality or that he constantly sells the keeper short.

If you’re going to criticise a player at least come up with valid reasons.

335~~~
Wtf is wrong with his back passing ?

336~~~
He was our best defender, which doesn't mean he is good enough right now. I dont say we should sell him. The thing is, in a top club like ours players that dont perform should lose their spot. I dont care if its RvP or Rooney or Evans. If you have a series of not up to par games, you should sit a few. This creates competition and players perform better knowing they are not instant 1st choice. He makes me nervous more often than Blackett. I don't care what he has done in the past. We live now and right now he is not very reassuring.

337~~~
Of course, but how does that player regain fitness having been out for sometime injured?

338~~~
I must say it is too early to say Evans won't be as our main CB. We haven't seen Rojo plays as a centre back with us yet. Smalling and Jones are inconsistent but giving them enough time to play in there, they can somehow settle in because they have the quality. The same thing can be said on Evans. Blackett seems doing fine as well.
Most likely we haven't find our best paired centre back yet. Probably the only position we haven't settle in. We will give them chances, and hopefully in January we can find our best paired.

339~~~
I think eventually it will be Jones and Rojo, with, Evans, Blackett as back up. I can see Smalling leaving as he passing will not be good enough for LvG. Thorpe is a a beeter footballer

340~~~
Evans under pressure is like Wayne's first touch -quite sloppy. I, like others above, believe that Jones and Rojo will be our main CBs this season. I would hesitate to play Evans against a top side like Chavs or Shitty.

341~~~
Based on current form or you think he's never been good against a top side?

342~~~
Injured.

So is it a case of keeping him for backup or eventually getting rid? He's shocking at the moment.

343~~~
If he can't either improve his game or improve his injury record, he's probably a goner in the long-term. A shame since he's a very solid defender at his best.

344~~~
I don't trust him at the back. Even though injuries are the last thing we need, I think we could do with a few games without him on the pitch.

345~~~
Where´s the Johny Evans i saw in the Portugal vs Northern Ireland match? Injuries have played a big part in his stagnation. It´s a pity cause i rate Evans.

346~~~
I can see him being sold. Not because his performance but because of his injury prone. Blackett is looking very good so far.

347~~~
He's become so terrible. Blackett looked like the experienced 27 year old, and Johnny the youngster playing his 5th United match.

348~~~
He's bang average.

349~~~
Can't stay fit, so regardless of what you think of him we're better served looking towards others, or new players.

350~~~
Evans absolutely shocking. He's suppose to be the experienced player but offers the defence nothing in organisation or dominance. It's a massive problem.

351~~~
I think he is going to fall down the pecking order and be the last one there. Blackett has done admirably well since start of season, Jones has done well and one will expect Smalling and Rojo to take their chances now. Unfortunate because I rate Evans and this season is his big chance to cement his place as first choice.

352~~~
I am fine if he is our 3rd string back on either side.

Jones, Smalling, Evans
Rojo/Blackett, Evans

353~~~
and again injured. No matter how talented he is or not, we cant rely on him.

354~~~
I love Johnny but I think that his time here is coming to an end. If he's not injured he's out of form. If we get another CB in january or in the summer he should be moved on.

355~~~
Jones out evans in. Evans out smalling in. Wait for smalling to get injured and let jones in again. And the cycle begins again and again and again.

By this rate blackett is going to play every game for us. And the way he has been performing, deservely so.

356~~~
At fault for the goal for me. Marking no one.

No idea what Souness is talking about blaming Rafael.

357~~~
I no longer see potential in him, and he's certainly hiding any sort of talent there is in there.

358~~~
Same here. I'm a big fan of the guy but he's on the chopping block.

359~~~
Some strange reactions in the match day thread today. He's "pathetic" and "a joke" for...getting injured?

360~~~
His distribution is poor. I think he's always had either Rio or Vidic next to him. It's clear now he hasn't how limited he is as a footballer....

361~~~
He is just such a disappointment for us right now. The guy has played in our first team for over half a decade and he should technically be one of our leaders at the back, yet you would think Blackett was the more experienced one. Evans just has mistake written all over him these days.

362~~~
Given up on him becoming a mainstay in our defence. Not helping our defensive frailties with his injuries and lapses in concentration.

363~~~
Jonny Injured has been Evans again.

364~~~
Evans with a boot on. We need to splash some cash and get a top defender who isn't made of wet toilet paper.

365~~~
I'm tired of this shit, fecking another injury, another substition we have to waste on one of our glass defenders because they get injured 24/7, move him on, we can't afford to have three injury-error prone CBs who can't get a fecking run of games together because they get injured 24/7.

Also, him and Rafael can't mark fecking central striker who's only Leicester's attacking player in the box for the first goal, laughable.

366~~~
Another damn injury. I'm pretty close to officially giving up on him.

367~~~
He was at his best whenever he played alongside Rio, it was a class partnership.

368~~~
What even happened to him? I glanced down, look back and he is limping off and then returns in a fecking moonboot? Did he get a tackle? Or twist it? Or what?

369~~~
He is ment to be our senior defender. The one to help the others out but another injury is another blow for him. He always seems to get long term injuries as well. Never just a couple of weeks, always months. Had his leg in a boot, could be just precautionary as they said but hope it isn't serious for his sake.

370~~~
Sick of this. Made of glass

371~~~
Bye Evans.

372~~~
His positioning was awful today. The gap between him and Blackett was massive at times, and as senior defender it should be he that organises the defence.

373~~~
I'm just not even going to class him in our defenders to select anymore, it's pointless when he is made of glass.

374~~~
He got kicked

375~~~
So do 1000's of players every weekend. 
Falcao and Di Maria got sad abuse today but, I don't see them on crutches right now.
Vidic was in the wars non stop when he was here but, he wasn't injured every few weeks. 

Seems like it's a regular occurrence

376~~~
Was never convinced by him.  Made of glass.  We need a proper, experienced central defender.

377~~~
It's a game of football, that's going to happen. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

378~~~
We're not going to win anything this season, so this is the time to look for the future. Not only Evans is always injured, he's not really up to the required quality. The defending for the first "goal" was criminal. I'd rather see Blackett getting valuable experience whenever Jones/Smalling are not available. They deserve a chance to form a partnership....that in case they can stay fecking fit. Perhaps play Rojo in the middle and Shaw at LB.

379~~~
FFS, give the man a break we have no idea how bad the kick was, his he landed on his foot, his bad the injury even us.
Evans us the blame even when he's not playing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

380~~~
And it's going to cause injuries <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

381~~~
I'm not blaming him for anything today....But, it's a very valid point, as it seems to be with a lot of our defenders
Why are they so injury prone?

382~~~
No idea, it's something we've had for years with no end in sight.
About Evans, I would understand the annoyance if Evans got a muscle injury again but he got a kick, that's why I find the posts frustrating.

383~~~
Been far too injury prone lately. Seems to have lost a yard of pace, too.

384~~~
Times up for Jonny now IMO, How long can we persevere with his stop start career at the club, I think he is a good player when he is on form but his form has been awful this season and now yet another injury, I have always defended him but I would be starting Blackett, Jones, probably Rojo and a new cb we NEED in January over Evans, it's a shame but like with the others that have departed, there is no room for sentiment anymore

385~~~
So wrong on so many points!
But to blame a player for getting injured if laughable, terrible post, go sit in the corner...

386~~~
I have always supported Evans but the man is made of paper.  Add to the fact that he is struggling with the current setup and he really is begging to be sold.

Clearly not cut out for any kind of leadership in the back, physically as well as mentally.  Looked to be cementing his position as a regular two seasons ago and has gone downhill.

387~~~
It's annoying, but you can't have a pop at the lad for being injury prone. However, the club has a decision to make on his future, because we can't plan ahead and build a solid defensive foundation with Evans as a first choice - it constantly leaves us in the lurch.

388~~~
Ha! 
So it's not a valid question to ask why our defenders are injured so often? This, despite our manager, even evaluating his own methods because of these injuries.

389~~~
Perhaps he should join QPR then.

390~~~
It's a shame really because early on the guy had so much potential to develope into a really good defender. However, I reckon his continous injuries have probably dented his confidence and stiffled his development. He can't be relied on now and we shouldn't be thinking of him as a mainstay. Wouldn't get rid of him though, since he would make good cover.

391~~~
Sorry but missed the point where you questioned why our defenders get injured?
You were simply having a go at Evans for allowing himself to be injured.
And he was kicked as per Van Gaal's comment, so why as why he was injured as you know the answer.

And as for Vidic not being injured lol, where were you during his last 3 season? It was a regular occurrence, stop changing history to prove your point.

392~~~
I had big expectations for him this season. His footballing abilities were suppose to come to the fore with the 352. He'd establish himself as the leader of the backline as a result but alas. More injuries and a clear lack of nous when on the pitch. Oh well.

393~~~
Fair enough, he got kicked today

I'm not having a go at him for being injured....If I was, I'd come out and say "he's a tit, whose always injured. Ship him out"
And it's a very fair question! It seems you only have to look at one of our defenders and they are injured these days.
Evans is constantly in and out with injuries and has been for years now. It's a regular occurrence.

Whats the betting Smalling gets injured next week

394~~~
He really needs to improve his performances. His injuries are frustrating but they are harder to stop. Don't know what he was doing for the first goal.

395~~~
He always looks to blame other people. Moments after the first goal he was laying into De Gea for what he thought was the wrong pass.

396~~~
It doesn't really matter if it's his fault - the guy is consistently injured. This puts him in the Hargreaves and Saha category of players on whom you cannot rely to be healthy for an extended run.

397~~~
Noticed that. Someone said last week that Evans always appears to have a problem with DDG, and thinking about it now he does seem to always have this annoyed look on his face when he communicates with de Gea.

398~~~
Lets not create this myth. Defenders and goalies are always blaming each other regardless.

399~~~
Soon he's going to have to move on, he's not capable of playing even half a season consistently. In his few appearances under Van Gaal so far I think he's been pretty poor, and I'd rather almost any of our options start over him.

400~~~
I'd be shocked if him, Smalling and Jones were all still here next season, they are made of Digestive biscuits.

401~~~
Either he accepts to play a Wes Brown-like role or he just leaves. There's no room for sentimentality now because, let's be blunt, Jonny just sucks at being the main man in the back 4.

402~~~
I bet even Helen Evans can do a better job

403~~~
No he needs to leave. We are well stocked of hyped injury prone defenders. If we had to keep one of these gentlemen than it should Rafael.

404~~~
And to think many laughed at me before start of season because I said he isn't good enough to be our main central defender.

Yes I accept he has had good games but that was when he was partnered by one of the best central defenders this country has produced. 

When was the last game you can say he was a rock at the back? When was the last time this "ball playing defender" actually looked composed on the ball?

Very poor start to the season and now injured, could be a chance for someone else (if there is anyone else, that's the bigger problem we have) to stake a claim.

405~~~
Completely agree. Erratic and injury prone. Should now be in his peak years but is nowhere near sufficiently consistent or robust.

Not United quality in my view and never will be. It was negligent of van Gaal to go into the season with Evans and Smalling as his two senior CB's and if at all possible this must be addressed in January.

406~~~
Spot on. Exposed now Rio or Vidic arent next to him. Smalling is better but a player that always looks like he's going to make a mistake.

407~~~
You can say that about all our CBs but you don't. Why?

408~~~
Because unlike Jonny, the others aren't branded as our "best" defender. They aren't as experienced as Jonny.

This is also a Jonny Evans thread, if I wanted to moan about the others I'd post it in there threads.

409~~~
So because some branded him as our best defender he should be ridiculed and blamed for everything that's wrong with our defence. You also mention that he was only good when playing beside Rio or Vidic, how dare he right? He hasn't had a permanent partner for some time now, yet you fail to mention that. Oh and he also had a good partnership with Jones until the usual injuries ended that.

I noticed yesterday that many posters blamed him for their first goal, no explanation as to why just the usual shit that's talked in the match day thread. It's pathetic. Our defensive players aren't bad players, they are injury prone, big differance.

410~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

As annoying as it is, I won't join in and lynch him for being injured.

What I will say is that he hasn't impressed for a single minute this season anyway, which is more of a concern to me. Well, maybe a single minute, when he made that clearance a week ago, but other than that he's been terrible.

I just want Jones and Smalling to get a run of games, with Shaw and Rafael either side.

411~~~
Any update on his injury?

412~~~
Getting a scan at some point today. Got a heavy kick on his foot and ended up with a cast/crutches. With our luck it'll be his metatarsal.

413~~~
That was my first thought when he had the cast on his foot.

414~~~
Why is Evans getting stick for yesterday's performance, whilst he was on the pitch I thought we were doing fine?

People blaming the first goal on him and Rafael. I just think its a cracking goal, great ball in and top header - not much you can do about it. Only one who could have done better was Rojo.

Starting to think I am bias towards Evans because apart from his MK Dons "performance" he hasn't been too bad IMO.

415~~~
I agree it was a good goal. But I don't know why Rafael was on the striker (a big striker) while Evans was just in front of them guarding no one. He should have been closer to his opponent I think. It probably would have still been scored, but Evans could have at least got involved somehow and tried to stop it from happening.

Cracking header but you can't be in the box as a CB, be standing in no mans land and look around to see your RB who is a midget challenging their big striker expecting him to deal with it. That is called 'you have just made an error'.

<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> was there any further news on his foot scan after Z asked? Saw him in a moonboot on the night and that pretty much said to me minimum one month but could be a while. I don't really rate him but having any defenders fit is better than having none.

417~~~
I'd need to see it again but Evans' position was correct IIRC. 1 striker in the box and 2 defenders. Rafael should be picking up the striker and Evans covering the area in line with the front post.

418~~~
He should have been manned up on the striker. Blackett was covering the space. It was an inch perfect cross but as a CB you can't be standing around marking nobody in acres of space when your partner is also covering near post and low.

419~~~
This is my thinking. Although I don't remember it that clearly so I am just going off my memory. Would need to see it again.

420~~~
9 goals conceded against Leicester and MK Dons is simply disgraceful.

Yeah, I'm a bit selective here for not including games against the likes of QPR, but still, when he really needed to step up in the games the rest of the defense was struggling he simply went hiding. I don't see why we should persist with him, especially since he's injury prone as well. We shall see what happens as the season progresses but so far he's not convincing me he'll make it here past this season.

421~~~
As I said, I'd need to see it again. Remember thinking at the time though that Rafael seemed to have switched off.

422~~~
I watched it again, to be fair the cross and the header were executed perfectly. Just seems to me that a lot of the time when we concede, if one central player is marking a zone like a near post cross or a cut back or something the other CB is also marking space as well and there is a free man with nobody on him. If your partner leaves the line to mark space then you probably should be going to the nearest man ASAP.
I thought it was Evans getting dragged out by Blackett and instead of staying with the man he kind of went to the ball as if anticipating an underhit ball or an anticipated intercept of some sort. Obviously that is just my opinion though. Personally, to me, it's poor if you're leaving your fullback to mark the striker and there is one of your own men in between the delivery and yourself. You as a CB should be trying to stay manned up as much as possible?

I am also sitting in a computer chair talking billy big on the Caf and not getting paid to play football professionally.

423~~~
He has been fecking horrendous

424~~~
Too many excuses. He's been here since a long time ago, he doesn't cut the job to be the main defender for a League challengers.

Sell / demote him to rotation I say, enough of this young and learning bullshit

425~~~
Indeed. He's 26 now FFS. Vidic and Evra were both 24 when we bought them, Ferdidand was 24 as well. If Welbeck was sold on grounds that his record was deemed not United quality then the same can be said for Evans. He's not even a reliable back up player like Silvestre, Fortune, Ronny Johnsen and Wes Brown were because he's more injury prone than they ever were.

426~~~
I don't understand why he is getting abuse for the clubs inability to address the CB issue. Can any of his haters please let me know how that is his fault?

He is being blamed for not being a leader, was he being blamed for that when Rio and Vidic were here? No, those players were signed for that reason, to be big commanding figures at the back, the club has failed to replace them, that is in no way a reason to abuse Evans.

427~~~
The criticism from me and most is more about his poor performances, not solely about his lack of leadership. If he was performing like he did in 2011/12 he wouldn't be getting abuse. We just have to accept that Evans is the new Wes Brown.

428~~~
To be fair I've never really rated him. He was very promising as a youngster and his career to date is definitely nothing to be sneezed at for sure. But there has always been something I can't put my finger on about him that I could never explain. Something where I have always said 'There's just something about Evans and I don't know what it is'. I support him though, he's a quality footballer who needs to rediscover his best and fast. I feel that there is just not enough room at the moment to really wait on him.

429~~~
If that were the case and people saw it like that, that's fine but I can't remember Wes ever getting the treatment Evans does. Maybe on the caf it was but I wasn't on here at the time.

430~~~
Blackett was in no mans land FFS. Are we now making stuff up to blame Evans?

431~~~
No? Blackett is covering the near post. He's out of position and he's had to drop to deal with the threat. I'd certainly want my other CB to be manning up in that case. Settle.

432~~~
We are watching a completely different game.

433~~~
I think it is safe to say that overall Evans has been pretty shite this season. On top of being very injury prone, he's become a liability. He's not a boy anymore and should be grabbing this opportunity to be the main man like nothing else. I suppose some people's bodies are just more tough than others...and at the end of the day there is nothing that can be really done about it. Genetics I suppose

434~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_crQVuNQlo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

It's here, he's come across with Rojo and is out on the flank while there is a threat that a player could cut inside. Evans is kind of stuck in no mans land not really marking anyone, he has a look around when the player beats Rojo and waves his hand. Right there and the he's made the error he should have probably slotted back onto Ulloa but he just stands there as if he's waiting to intercept an underhit or low cross.

Of course, as I mentioned the cross itself is absolutely perfect and the header is as well.

edit: If I could be even more nit-picky, even as the ball comes in he kind of ball watches and doesn't make an effort to get over to it. But that is being incredibly harsh.

435~~~
The only thing that’s safe to say is that Evans is the new scapegoat, this is very evident in the blaming him for Leicesters first goal when it clearly wasn’t his fault. I noticed you and others have said that he’s been a liability this season when in fact he actually played quite well against QPR and Leicester until he got injured. MK Dons aside he’s done very little wrong. However no matter what good he does people will only focus on the negative, even blaming him for things he has no control over. It’s really becoming a bore now.

His recent injury has nothing to do with his bodies’ toughness but more to do with him getting a kick from a very aggressive Leicester team. We were a worse team when Evans went off, we conceded 4 goals after he went off FFS. No doubt had he been on the pitch all goals would have been his fault, actually, I’m sure there are some who do blame him for it.

436~~~
How was he not at fault for Leicester's first goal? He pawns off marking Ulloa, a 6ft 3 aerial beast, to the 5 ft 8 Rafael when there's no-one else to mark. It was clearly his fault.

437~~~
You are seeing what you want to see, in that clip the one person you can’t blame is Evans, Rojo, should do better, he is to easily bullied off the ball, Blackett gets sucked into the ball and our shape suffers because of it, Rafael loses his man, he doesn’t even challenge him FFS.

Evans is covering the space of two CB’s, you mentioned that the cross was perfect and it was but Evans has to be in a position to stop the cross getting to the player, that’s his job in that situation. However you’re trying to blame him for not knowing exactly where the ball was going to go, it could end up in 3 or 4 dangerous areas, it’s getting beyond silly now. Sometimes you have to applaud a good goal for being exactly that.

438~~~
How? Tell me how it was his fault.

439~~~
Because he is doing nothing. Who else is in the box on the end of that cross that scores?.

If Evans marks Ulloa properly, or atleast challenges him then no goal happens.

Instead he makes the wrong decision and tries to cut out the cross at the front post. 

At the end of the day marking space is fine when you have cover, but he should have challenged the striker instead.

Of course though Rojo should have dealt with it first, and Blackett was out of position aswell.

440~~~
Ok,

Stealing this from reddit user larry_b

<b>Evans at fault for the first goal?</b>:<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.gfycat.com/ShockingDecimalHerculesbeetle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> In the first goal</a>, we see how Ulloa comfortably heads the ball between Rafael and Evans. Now, I tend to blame the latter for this goal. As Vardy carries the ball in the right flank, Evans signals Rafael to mark Ulloa. But why? <a class="externalLink" href="http://i.imgur.com/NBzh9Kn.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Who is he expecting?</a> Is he worried that <a class="externalLink" href="http://i.imgur.com/LjzUwEK.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Drinkwater is going to somehow sprint towards the first post?</a> I don't understand why Rafael (a 1.73m/5' 8" <i>right back</i>) would be a better choice than Evans (a 1.89m/6' 2" <i>center back</i>) to challenge Ulloa (a 1.90m/6' 3" <i>center forward</i>) in the middle of the box, when <a class="externalLink" href="http://i.imgur.com/b72bhXW.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">there were literally no other Leicester players in it</a>.

441~~~
Should have, would have, and could have. It’s all well and good saying that but every defender in the league would have took up Evans position, the threat should have been stopped before it even got to the cross, Rojo was bullied out of it, Blackett should not have been pulled out of position so easily and Rafael failed to challenge for the ball, Ulloa was his man by the way. But no, let’s blame Evans, much much easier.

442~~~
He won't be here next season or at the very least in the starting eleven if LVG is still here. He wouldn't get in any other top six team's back four. He's just not good enough for us, sadly.

443~~~
I love how people are over analysing this. Is Evans at fault? A case can be made either way but at the end of the day, it's a game of football and it's not black and white, he has a different view at ground level to what we have on TV. He may or may not have got things wrong, we don't know what information he got from Rafael and De Gea, we won't accept that it was a pinpoint cross and a great header, it has to be someone's fault.

444~~~
Well yes, one of the magical parts of forming an opinion is seeing what you want to see. Rafael should never be man marking the central striker in the middle of the pitch. Even more especially that his center half is standing about a yard and a half away beside him.

445~~~
Come up with your own reason, or do you now have to go looking for reasons to blame him?

446~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Leave Jonny alone!"</a>

447~~~
He made an individual error. But also the team defended the whole thing poorly, Rojo, Blackett and Rafa as well. Team blame, I say.

448~~~
I'm not blaming or defending him, Blackett, Rojo and Evans all made errors.

At the end of the day though, if Evans marks the man rather than the space then Ulloa's chance of scoring is significantly reduced. Sure it happens very quick and making that decision is hard, but that's what is the difference between world class and good defenders.

449~~~
Actually you’re not, People display bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. Therefore you are only seeing what you want to see and coming to a misguided opinion.
Lets be honest here, if Evans had been marking Ulloa and Ulloa scored we would be blaming Evans for not winning the header, not stopping the cross, not being strong enough, being out of position, not taking control of the box or any other reason that comes to the top of our heads, while the other three defenders and midfielders who didn’t track back off scot free.

450~~~
MK Dons agreed. That was his worst performance since that 4-0 loss at West Ham a few years back.

Apart from his distribution not being up to his usual (high) standard I think he has been okay. It hasn't been his defending that has been much of an issue more lack of concentration in possession.

Most frustrating thing is these injuries. Would like to see him partnered with Rojo/Smalling/Jones for a few games when fit.

451~~~
If Rojo is stronger there is no goal, if Blackett stays in shape the chances of a goal are massively reduced, if Evans stops the cross the chances of a goal are massively reduced and if Rafael or Evans challenges his man the chances of a goal are reduced.

Evans took the right option to try and stop the cross getting into the box, the cross was perfect. As I said sometimes you have to applaud the goal.

Laugh all you want but I’ve yet to hear one sound reason as to why he is to blame, but yeah if it makes you feel better, laugh away. Take it you can't up with your own reason then?

452~~~
I care nought for Evans, have also defended him saying it took a near perfect cross and header to breach our defense. You've obviously developed a sentimental attachment to Johnny Evans so I find it ironic you could be calling someone else biased when you are unwilling as it seems to even apportion any blame to him for the goal. Consider this washing my hands of the incident, he deserves blame for waving in his midget fullback instead of realizing the danger and manning up on the giant striker that happened to be in the center of the park in the box.

You could probably argue that but I would retort a little pearl of wisdom from yourself a few posts back. 'Could have, should have, would have'. If he was better positioned goal side while tightly marking at that particular angle positionally he would have certainly won the header, I have no doubts of that.

453~~~
My reasons are the ones provided on my post. With pictorial evidence. If Jonny marks the man rather than fobbing off a 6ft 3 aerial beast on to Rafael then we don't concede, therefore he fecked up.

454~~~
I'm not sure what you mean "your own reason", that is my own reason. If YOU cannot accept he made the wrong decision then that's fine. You say Evans tried to stop the cross, how can he stop the cross from 10 metres away? He need's to worry about the man in the box not the ball coming in!.

455~~~
He is at fault, as is every player on the pitch. However he is far from bring the main culprit that many have suggested. As I said, he is the new scapegoat and I feel that I have to defend him in circumstances that clearly aren’t his fault. I have blasted him when he deserved it, and at times he has been awful, but Leicester first goal was not one of them.

If he was better positioned he would have stopped the cross therefore completely eliminating the threat on goal, he was dragged out of position due to Blackett getting sucked into the ball, he assumed Ulloa was marked and got in position to clear the ball from the cross.

456~~~
Pretty much what I've said myself when they scored this goal. Evans goes full pedestrian, he doesn't really position himself to either head the ball away at near post nor does he mark a striker that's physically superior to Rafael. He's doing nothing there. For me, when there's a CB and a RB in the box and a lone striker to mark, it's quite obvious who should take him, especially that Evans wasn't like 10 yards away from him but whole fecking two.

457~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
How do you know we dont concede? The only way we dont concede is if Rojo wasnt so easily bullied off the ball.

458~~~
We don't concede because I generously assume that a competent centre back can head clear a cross. With Evans nowadays that might not be the case.....

459~~~
Evans was certainly at fault. He should be the one marking Ulloa and put some pressure on him. Ulloa might have still scored but to allow him an unopposed header in the box is criminal. Rojo still takes the major share of the blame for being bullied off the ball.

460~~~
Exactly it's an individual error, things like that happens, there is no need to blame him 2 days after the game.

461~~~
That’s what I mean by your own reason, he obviously made the wrong decision because we conceded, however his reasons for doing so were made harder due to Blackett getting sucked into the ball which made his decision all that more difficult to decide.

Stop the cross from 10 metres? No idea what you’re talking about.

462~~~
Oh FFS, so attackers dont score headers now?

463~~~
Vardy crossed the ball from the touchline, how was Evans supposed to stop him crossing it?. Unless you mean he was trying to cut out a low cross at the front post, but that was taking a big risk IMO.

464~~~
Actually his decision was made easier, if you are alone you mark your man, you don't try to anticipate or intercept.

465~~~
To stop the cross getting to the attacking player. If the cross hadn't have been as good Ive no doubt that Evans would have cleared it, therefore eliminating the danger 100%

466~~~
Competent centre backs should be able to win those aerial duels 10/10, see: Vidic, Ferdinand before they got decrepit. Especially when they had plenty of time to identify the threat and mark their man. Evans had literally 5 seconds to realise that Ulloa was the only threat in the box, he failed to do so, fobbed him off on Rafael and we conceded due to his poor decision.

467~~~
He wasn't alone?

468~~~
They didnt win their arial battles all of time, no defender has. In situations like that the attacker has the benefit as he can attacked the cross.

469~~~
Yeah Rafael was there but he can't compete with Ulloa, that's what i meant by alone. It was Evans or Blackett duty to take care of Ulloa, not Rafael.

470~~~
Evans job was to eliminate the danger, he was pulled out of position due to Blacketts lack of experiance. He had to try and stop the cross getting to the attacking player, its that simple, 9 times out of 10 he would have cleared that. As I've said a few times now, sometimes you have to applaud the attacking play.

471~~~
It's not that simple, he made a mistake by choosing the wrong option and Blackett position was irrevelant since there was only one opponent in the box. You can try to cut if you are outnumbered but it wasn't the case.

472~~~
Oh FFS, how does Blackett being out of position not have nothing to do with it? How did he make the wrong decision? If you eliminate the danger you eliminate the chances of conceding a goal. Id imagine most CB’s would have taken that option, it wasn’t his decision making that cost us, it was the cross, as close to perfect as you are going to get.

Your post is exactly what I’m talking about when I mention about Evans being the scapegoat, it’s laughable.

473~~~
I'm not making a scapegoat, i don't blame him i don't resent him, mistake like that happens all the time, it's not a big deal. But saying that he isn't at fault is stupid.

Blackett position is irrelevant, Evans has no reason to be where he is.

474~~~
I give up <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

475~~~
Only played 2 and half games this season after having come back from injury and now he is deemed shit and not United quality. 2 1/2 games. One poor game, one good game and another where he was subbed off.

Definitely the new scapegoat <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

476~~~
Exactly. We could blame every player if we wanted, but sometimes you just have to sit back and admire the attack.

477~~~
my only concern with Evans is that he is picking up injury after injury.

Form comes and goes but becoming injury prone is a real concern for his longevity and building a consistent defence. Same applies to Rafa

478~~~
From Belfast, so naturally I'll support Evans here...

Nah, let's call a spade, a spade. He's been shite all season. Terrible defender and will be sold unless he dramatically turns it around.

Evans was definitely at fault for their first goal. Not even in question. Standing their marking no one, ball-watching.

Rafael getting blamed for it was ridiculous. At least the wee man actually tried to get a challenge in.

479~~~
You are guilty of dounle standards here, and that is why you are finding it increasingly difficult to defend your position.
You say Jonny's decision to pass the responsibility of marking Ulloa onto Rafael, in case he may be able to cut out a cross. He doesn't know how that cross will be delivered. A looping cross or, as happened, one pulled back a little more, and he is stranded. 
Yet you are willing to criticise Blackett's position.  Look at the first frame in that sequence.
If Blackett looks around there, he sees two on one in the box, and no other Leicester players in advance of our midfield.
The danger therefore is Vardy. If he cuts in past Rojo, he has a free run on goal, or pull back, or to delay for reenforcements.
For me Blackett makes the right call on this goal.

The bulk of the blame should be Rojo's (after the lino), but Jonny effectively surrendered responsibility for what happened after.

480~~~
Become the new Cleverley scapegoat

481~~~
Hardly.

He's been terrible so far this season. Shit against MK Dons, dodgy against Burnley and QPR (first half anyway) and mistake against Leicester.

482~~~
Was going to dispute this, as the discussion with Getsme might give a false impression.
So I read back to check, and some of the shit being flung is ridiculous.

So, yeah you're right.

483~~~
He's so lucky to be playing so many games for United. He's just not that good.

484~~~
Finding it difficult to defend my position? Where? Any chance you could point it out for me?

I didn’t say he passed the responsibility to Rafael, I said he took a position that he thought was the best area to clear the cross, and of course he doesn’t know what ball is going to come but he has to try and read the game. The cross was fantastic, the movement from Ulloa was good, so much so that Rafael didn’t even challenge him.

Jonny is not innocent here but he is far from being at fault for the goal. As for Blackett, he was in no mans land when the cross came in, the midfield aren’t even in the frame, Evans was in an area of the pitch where he could try and clear the cross and Rafael had lost his man.

You are correct in saying the Bulk of the Blame should land with Rojo being bullied of the ball, Evans and Rafael were beaten by the quality of the cross, as vie said what feels like a 1000 times now, Leicesters attacking play should be applauded.

485~~~
MK Dons, he was rubbish, as was everyone.
Burnley 0-0
QPR 4-0
Leicester 1-2 before he went off.

486~~~
Blackett is covering Rojo is positioning is good, Evans makes a mistake but he is not particularly responsible for the goal.

487~~~
And?

He was dodgy against both Burney and QPR, mainly his passing.

488~~~
Those who defend him are morons. He didn't even know where the attacker was in the build up to the goal. He was carried by Rio and Vidic at times. He needs to be replaced as soon as because he is not united quality, every time he is in the team we look vulnerable and shaky.

489~~~
Blacketts position is not good, but he can be forgiven for that as he is young and inexperienced, however by the time the cross comes in he is nowhere near where he needs to be. He became redundant.

You could blame the midfield for not supporting the defence, you could blame Rojo for not being strong enough, Evans for not heading it away, Rafael for losing his man, you could blame a 1000 things but you can’t solely blame one player. It’s a good goal, a fantastic cross and a bullet of a header.

490~~~
I don't think you understood my comment, as you aren't going against it, you just gave your opinion.

By classifying him as the Tom Cleverley scapegoat, it does not mean he is innocent, it does not mean he performs well, but merely that people that didn't watch the game will bandy his name about as he's had a few poor performances, it seems a poor performance will stick in the head longer than a positive one, and this isn't a defense of his performances, but most comments are said stupidly.

491~~~
Against Burnley it was his first game back in a new formation, yet they still managed to keep a clean sheet. Against QPR, he cleared one off the line and had a very comfortable game. Before he went off injured against Leicester he was having a good game, how we could have done with him in defence in the second half. But no, hes been shit from the first minute to the last <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

492~~~
What a waste of time this fella is. He had a shocking few games up to Sunday then gets another fecking injury. He's 27 in January, he should be coming into his peak years yet he looks no better than he did when he was at Sunderland.

493~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

494~~~
I agree with you, on that.

495~~~
As someone just reading through, you are arguing against valid points, and not convincingly.

in response to: You say Jonny's decision to pass the responsibility of marking Ulloa onto Rafael, <b>in case he may be able to cut out a cross</b>

Which is where he failed. Rojo and Blackett "covering the man with the ball, Jonny not recognising that he should be marking the centre forward (CB lesson 101)

Wrong

As I said, if Tyler has taken a look, he sees no immediate danger coming from midfield. His choice is to make up 3 men marking one in the box, or cover his fullback. He makes the right choice. Even then, by your standards for Jonny, he is in a position to cut out a cross, if he is fortunate enough for Vardy to hit it straight to him.

Rafael has the least blame in all of this, and this illustrates the first part of my post. You are willing to stretch opportioning the blame ridiculously, in an effort to exhonorate Evans. 

You have an agenda, just as much as those who are slaughtering Evans, when it is a case of form being a good player's problem, and not "Evans is shit!"
You would be better arguing that, than trying to make excuses for an isolated incident, for which he is receiving warranted flack.

496~~~
How can you blame the midfield? It was straight from kick off and the long pass and Rojo error took them out of the game. Blackett was covering for Rojo because he was 1v1 against Vardy and struggling t odefend. There are only two players to blame for that goal - Evans and Rojo.

497~~~
Exactly what i think.

498~~~
Do we know the extent of his injury yet?

499~~~
And Rafael when the cross is made he has to jump infront of Ulloa, but he isn't defensively savvy so it's understandable.

500~~~
Does the truth hurt? 

The whole Johnny Evans debate gets boring, its clear as day that Manchester united and johhny evans are a million miles apart in the standards they deliver. Manchester united are expected to be at the pinnacle of world football, whilst johhny evans is just a weak and inconsistent mediocre footballer that came through the ranks and has been given privileges other players havent. 

We need to get realistic and invest heavily in defence, sentiment has caused too many problems of late.

501~~~
You must be watching different games. First half against QPR there were several times when he either misplaced his pass or underhit them severely and putting everyone else under pressure. Looked very dodgy against Burnley as well.

He's usually a lot better than he's shown so far but there's no hiding from the fact that he's been poor so far this season. All things considered, our worst defender this season.

502~~~
Absolute rubbish, the midfield is nowhere to be seen, yes it was along ball and it was from the kick off, so where was our midfield? There was no tracking back at all. Vardy managed to get the cross in and still there was no sign of our midfield.

503~~~
Rafael has no chance against Ulloa, I don't blame him in the slightest. Evans should be dealing with that or at least putting some sort of challenge in. He ends up doing nothing.

504~~~
I agree that he is far from his best form, however, our worst defender? Thats disputable to say the least, none of them have any reason to hold their head up high.

505~~~
The scores don't mean much when it comes to analyzing individual performances. He has been poor this season to date. And injured twice on top of that.

506~~~
The midfield could have done literally (lol) nothing. The long ball towards Rojo took out Di Maria and the CM's. From that point on either Rojo has to deal with the situation by putting the ball out or the CB's have to deal with the cross. Blackett does the right thing by trying to cover for Rojo who was beaten by Vardy. It's then up to Evans to put a challenge on Vardy, which he doesn't.

Funny how you accuse others of having an agenda while at the same time blaming everyone else.

507~~~
The only one who's been as bad is Rojo and he has the excuse of playing in an unfamiliar position and being new to the club. All the others have been better not that it says much about them.

508~~~
I know, i already said it in an earlier post, but in the spirit he should have anticipated, he could have failed but he should have made the movement.
It's just in order to upset Ulloa.

509~~~
Yeah I agree. There's a chance it might still have been a goal (was an excellent cross and Ulloa looks like he's great in the air) but Evans made it too easy for him.

510~~~
What truth? Im defending him from those that say that goal was clearly Evans fault, yet you come in and call anyone who disagrees a moron. Thats what im laughing at, not your post. You.

511~~~
Evans is a very good defender, who always seems to take a few games to discover form. In fact it was very good defending that saw him get injured.
I don't want to get into the buying and selling side of things, because 1) we are so far from the transfer window, and 2) I'm that fed up of our injuries that I'd be tempted to get rid of them all, for more robust ones (which I know is folly).
Evans is a different player after a run of games, but the problem is, should we expect a run of games from him?

I'm going to back out, because the frailty of our defenders brings on a headache.

512~~~
I’m not blaming everyone else, but you keep thinking that eh? I’ve said there are many players who are at fault for the goal, but as usual many on here take the lazy but expected approach to blame Evans. As for the midfield, Ulloa was able to run half the length of the pitch with none of our midfield in sight, if you don’t think that’s an issue then fair enough, but I do.

There are many factors here that lead to the goal, but the biggest was the cross and the way the goal was executed.

513~~~
Lets be honest here, Jones, Smalling and Blackett have been far from convincing this season. The only one whos played well is Rafael and Rojo against QPR.

514~~~
I'm sorry mate, and I know you mean something else but
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

515~~~
Agree  about Smalling and Blackett, but I think Jones has been the best.

516~~~
He's been utter garbage this season. Doesn't have Vidic or Rio to molly coddle him anymore and he's been found out.

517~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

518~~~
Just, but hes as injury prone as Evans, thats the problem for me with Evans. When he gets a run of games hes a very good player, but he cant get them because of injuries. I know this recent injury isnt muscular but its getting very frustrating.

519~~~
That's why it gives me a headache. If we could field the same defence for more than a couple of games we would see improvements, then judge the players on their best standards and team effectiveness and cohesion.
Right now it is like a revolving door to a clinic's waiting room.

520~~~
Evans was dodgy against Burnley. He even gave Burnley a 1on1 with his crap pass to de Gea. He has had a really bad start to the season, but I won't write him off after just 4 games. I always felt he couldn't be the #1 guy in defense though. He needs an imposing figure next to him.

521~~~
I’m giving my opinion, if you don’t agree with them then that’s fine. Yes he failed to read the game but that was mainly down to the quality of the cross, a cross that should never have been for more reasons than one.

You have yet to give me a valid reason as to why Evans was solely at fault for the goal, yet tell me I am wrong when I suggest that there are many reasons as to why Leicester scored that goal, yet I have an agenda?
You and others keep on going on that I’m trying to exonerate Evans from any blame, no idea why you’re saying that but I’m not surprised that you are.

For the last time, try reading this carefully. There are many errors that lead to that goal, one player wasn’t solely to blame, it was a fantastic cross and even better finish. IT’S THAT SIMPLE.

522~~~
Yep, it’s more than frustrating, it’s hampered us for 3 seasons now. I’m hoping Rojo can become a constant alongside Shaw and not fall into the 'permanently injured' category. A solid back four would do wonders for us <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

523~~~
I agree, he’s been far from his best. Injuries, new formation, added pressure have all added to that. I believe our defence don’t have belief in each other now Rio, Vidic and Evra have gone. That’s something for LVG to sort out, and I’m sure he will.

524~~~
Evans was one of the very few United players who looked good last season. In the early parts of it anyway. Then he got injured and never really found any form again. I've always thought he was at his best alongside Vidic. They work really well as a partnership. He's obviously not as adaptable as some CBs and can look really atrocious if he's not alongside the right player.

525~~~
He looks genuinely terrified every time he's under the slightest bit of pressure, you can see it in his face.

526~~~
Indeed, he started to form a good partnership with Jones last season if I remember correctly, before the inevitable happened and one of them got injured. I would like to see a CB pairing of Jones and Evans, unfortunately I’ve lost all hope of that happening.

527~~~
Yeah, Jones is the only "alpha male" CB of the three of them. Hence, he could form a good partnership with either Evans or Smalling. Especially now he's going to get a run of games in his preferred position and started the season playing so well. He's been prone to brainfarts of his own but at his best he's a really dominant presence and is at an age where he might step up this year and become a really top CB. 

The other two don't have the leadership skills to play alongside young, inexperienced players like Blacket and Keane (or each other) and we're invariably shite when that happens.

Unfortunately, we're at the mercy of Jones fragile body and reckless bravery if we want to build a defence around him. Which is not ideal. Unless Rojo is a like for like replacement?

528~~~
I’m going to reserve judgement on Rojo until he gets a good run of games in CB. He didn’t have a great game on Sunday and was easily bullied of the ball at times, but it’s not fair to judge when he hasn’t played a minute in his preferred position (in which I’ve never seen him play)

I said in a previous post that if he stays injury free and is half decent he will be first choice by default unless the other three can sort their injury issues out.

529~~~
So frustrating when the likes of Chelsea seem to be able to play the same back 4 (Ivanovic-Cahill-Terry-Azpilicueta) almost every single league game. Everton also the last few years have always seemed to be able to field Coleman-Jagielka-Distin-Baines.

All the best defensive sides have the most settled personnel. Rafael, Smalling, Jones or Evans never seem to be able to play more than 4 in a row.

530~~~
At the very least, you'd expect 2 out of 4 to be more or less permanently available if you're going to have a crack at the title. City almost never play second choice fullbacks.

Evra's invulnerability to injury is a huge loss. We've fitness question marks over every single defender in our squad, bar Rojo and Blackett.

531~~~
Shaw?
I know hes just come back from injury, but wasnt his record at Southampton quite good?

532~~~
Yeah, I think so. Was going to leave him out but included him on the basis of "fitness" meaning stamina, after Van Gaal's comments.

533~~~
True, but I suppose thats something that can be worked on. I've no idea how we can go about making the ususal 3 injury free. Saying that we managed to do it with RVP so you never know.

534~~~
Evans can he a top defender but is prone to injury and glaring lapses in concentration. He needs to smarten up and toughen up or ship out IMO.

535~~~
He'll never be a top defender, but he is at the level below, he's just out of form.

536~~~
Evans is never going to be the leader in the defence we need. I wouldn't mind him being sold in the summer. He's 26 now, and he looks out of sorts a lot. Compare him to a 26 y/o Ferdinand or Vidic, that is the standard of defender that should be starting for Manchester United.

537~~~
I'd go along with that.

538~~~
What the hell has Shaw done between the World Cup and his first inclusion into training camp to be such in bad shape? Unless you stuff yourself with burgers and beer, I don't see how a player can be deemed that much out of shape between a World Cup and the next club season.

End off-topic.

Evans will be nothing more than a Wes Brown at the most, and even then Wes knew how to make himself useful at some point.

539~~~
Personally I think we should sell while he's still young. We can squeeze about 8M for him

540~~~
I'd accept that. He's not as bad as he has been showing.

541~~~
Out for 4 weeks according to the Mail.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2767104/Jonny-Evans-deals-Manchester-United-boss-Louis-van-Gaal-blow-defensive-injury-woes-mount-up.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...Gaal-blow-defensive-injury-woes-mount-up.html</a>

542~~~
Mr Glass

543~~~
He's stagnated imo - still looks good as the junior in a pairing with a more senior CB eg Vidic, Rio - hasn't shown enough to prove he can be that senior CB to lead younger lads... the rooney of the CBs!

544~~~
If Smalling and Jones can stay fit, and Rojo plays well as a CB then I see Evans struggling to get back into the side to be honest.

545~~~
Which part of the Evans "Out of form, actually just a bit shit, catastrophic performance, Injured, we Evans to come back, he is our best defender, potentially worlds class, still young (26 going on 27) and can be potentially world class if given a run of games" cycle are we at now?

546~~~
He isn't and won't ever be good enough to be the main man in our defence. 

We wouldn't be having this argument if he'd been bought. But since he came through our academy people like to give him leeway. Fed up of him not showing any authority.

547~~~
I'd be quite happy if he performed to the levels he's shown before but he hasn't even come close to that level.

548~~~
Not so sure. I don't think Jones or Smalling have a thought in their head between them. Yet to be seen if Rojo has a brain. Not one of them is world class, but what I wouldn't give to see any one of them become at least a reliable Steady Eddie.

549~~~
Agreed. Funny how we all laughed when 'mediocre' Cahill signed for Chelsea.

550~~~
Indeed, how we could do with him now <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

551~~~
He hasn't had a chance to, none of our current CBs have.

552~~~
Bang on.

It's time for us to acknowledge that a lot of the academy players we have/had aren't/weren't good enough or simply weren't performing.

553~~~
Evans has had way more of a chance than the other two. We just need to sell this guy and accept that he's not good enough for United. We let Welbeck, O'Shea and Brown go, Evans wouldn't be a loss at all.

554~~~
Ok, when has he had his chance to get back to his best?

555~~~
Come on he's had his chances to cement his place with both Ferdinand's and Vidic's poor fitness in their last seasons at United. He's not even at the level both of those players were and he'll never be, isn't that the United standard? Thats why Welbeck was let go. Evans will not be missed. Only United fans rate him very highly anyway, a team like Everton at best is probably his level and thats not an insult. He's been playing in the first team since his teens FFS

556~~~
I have always been a big fan of Evans' style in the past; an assured, classy-almost luxurious way of football. But recently he looks a complete shadow of his former self. He's too nervous, too weak, too easy to beat. He's always lacked physicality at the best of his game, but now it shows even more. I do agree with the sentiments that - at his best - he is a 'tier below' top, which is enough for a side aiming for top four or even a title challenge if the rest of the team is on song. But, with that said, he hasn't shown that side anywhere near enough recently, and I do feel he's too prone to injury to truly manage it. And it is for these reasons I think we may have to <i>consider</i> his depature - we cannot afford to have three injury prone CB's of whom we are sat twiddling our thumbs waiting to tap their potential. He is the oldest, and whilst most experienced, I feel weakest, and should be aptly replaced for this reason.

557~~~
This.

He's 26.  He'll be 27 come January.  Rio joined us at 23? Vidic joined us at 24? They probably started getting the best years out of themselves around the age he is now.  If he doesn't pull his finger out his ass soon, he's not going to have many 'good' years left.

558~~~
I personally think he's done. If he wasn't a home grown player he'd be out the door by now in all honesty. Eyebrows were raised when we sold O'shea but in reality he was past his best. I don't see Evans having a miraculous turnaround, we're just delaying the obvious.

559~~~
I’m not being funny here but like many others, your mind is playing tricks on you. He has cemented his place over the last two seasons, I think Fergie even said that Vidic and Rio could no longer be considered first choice due to Evans. He was a regular last season ahead of players like Rio and Vidic and he has arguably been our best defender for the last two years.

On form, Evans is a great defender, yes he plays better beside Vidic or Rio but who wouldn’t, and it’s not talent that’s hindering Evans its injuries. He hasn’t had a good run of games this season thanks to injuries, so how on Earth is he going to rediscover his form?

Another thing that annoys me is people are saying he’s not Rio or Vidic, not many players are.

560~~~
Van Gaal basically said Welbeck is not Rooney or RVP and thats the United standard. Whats the difference in saying Evans is not Rio and Vidic? The United standard? The man only played in two games out of 8 against the top four contenders last season. He played Arsenal once and Chelsea once...Ferdinand/Jones/Vidic played all the other big games. Hope we sell him next season.

561~~~
I actually thought he was having a good game sunday..... until he had to go off,and there in lies the true problem with him, ( and smalling... and jones.... and rafael), if you can't rely on these players for regular games then they unltimately need to be replaced (or at least relegated down to backups once more), we can't just keep waiting forever for them to finally stay fit for longer than 5 matches in a row.

When LvG mentions "We have 7 injuries this week!, we have 9 injuries this week" etc, it's always the usual suspects making up the bulk, not just for this season but honestly the last 3-4 years.

Rafael
Evans
Jones
Smalling
Young
Fletcher

You get the feeling if replaced this lot, our average weekly injury report would drop from 7-9 out to averaging 2-3.

562~~~
Sorry mate, but our last two seasons were shocking.  Even Ferguson's last season, our team was shocking...on the brink of falling apart.  Ferguson did extremely well to win the BPL with that team.  And the injury proneness is a really bad sign for someone you want to be in control of your back line.

To say he's good enough because he was 'arguably' one of our best defenders in the last two seasons...it's not a positive considering how weak our squad was.  And to keep him on because 'his injuries don't allow him to rediscover his form' is wishful thinking.  As I said he's 27 in January coming back from injuries.  And we need solid defenders, with big egos, urgently in the center.  

He's not worth the effort or the risk imo.

563~~~
It's true that not many players can reach the level of Rio or Vidic but atm Evans can't reach the level of someone like Gary Cahill.

Plus injuries can only be an excuse for so long before they become just another flaw.

564~~~

565~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>
Maybe I think hes not as bad as some on here are making out, the rubbish that has been talked on here is very odd indeed, it doesnt surprise me though.

566~~~
What rubbish, are you just making things up now? He was very good in our last title winning season, a team that walks the league is not shit. He was one of the best defenders last season and as a back four we look more solid when he's in the team, Sundays result is an example of that. Yes the injuries are annoying, but if the club can get them under control much like they did for RVP then we will have a very good player.



This makes no sense what so ever and just adds to the bizarre posts that have been made about Evans.

567~~~
I agree about the injuries, I've never disputed that. However some of the shite that’s been talked in this thread is beyond laughable. I’m surprised people haven’t blamed him for the other 4 goals Leicester scored on Sunday let alone the one he is being solely blamed for by some.

568~~~
Evans is not a Vidic, Rio, Jaap Stam, Bruce, or Pallister...and that is what we need right now. Not saying he isn't an ok player...but just not in that league.

569~~~
And where are we going to find a Vidic, Rio, Stam, Bruce or Pallister, in fact where are we going to find four?

570~~~
Michael Cox (Zonal Marking) wrote a great article, it's predominantly Liverpool focused but it raises a good point about Evans.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/blog/tactics-and-analysis/67/post/2050805/whos-to-blame-for-liverpools-defensive-woes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/blog/tactics-...5/whos-to-blame-for-liverpools-defensive-woes</a>

Essentially when played alongside a senior defender who is vocal (Rio* and latterly Nemanja) then Evans excels - or certainly has done for spells in the past 3 years - however, when a vocal player is not alongside him, his displays appear to fall apart.

None of the players we have currently are capable of that. Jones has the potential to develop that skill but he is yet to establish himself in the team with authority, too often he is caught in a bad position or a run of form is cut short by injury. Smalling appears just appears short of all confidence on that front. Rojo no habla Inglés. Blackett is always talking to his credit but lacks influence and experience so far. Evans needs to pick up on this over the next 9 months or he will be the defender at most risk of being sold.

* Arguably Rio's finest quality. He was always orchestrating defences, positioning and generally vocally throughout games.

571~~~
You're argument is laughable.  Take a good look at yourself and see how ridiculous you sound.

Let's break down your comments shall we.  Unlike you, I like a nice debate with good understanding and actual facts.  Opinions which have facts weighted towards them are nice as well.

<b>What rubbish, are you just making things up now?</b>
First of all, I assume you're responding to this.
-----------
<i>Sorry mate, but our last two seasons were shocking. Even Ferguson's last season, our team was shocking...on the brink of falling apart. Ferguson did extremely well to win the BPL with that team.
----------</i>
How am I making things up?  Are you going to argue that our season under Moyes was not abysmal?  Are you going to argue that the 2012/2013 winning squad was not one of the weakest squads we've had win the title?  Are you going to argue that us falling apart the next season, was not somewhat based on that squad we had?  The squad with minimal changes in the transfer window?  Moyes played his part, but you're actually suggesting none of it was down to how weak our squad was?  If so...no comment.

<b>He was very good in our last title winning season, a team that walks the league is not shit.</b>
I'd personally say he was good.  Very good, I think is an overstatement.  But we're all entitled to our opinions.  Before you try and put words in my mouth that I never stated, not anywhere did I say that the team was 'shit'.  My comment towards how shocking that season was for us, was directed at the weakness of our squad compared to squads of old.  As demonstrated in the season afterwards.

<b>He was one of the best defenders last season and as a back four we look more solid when he's in the team, Sundays result is an example of that.</b>
Last season we were awful.  Last season, do you remember us finishing 7th?  Yeh that's right.  The worst we've finished since 1989/90?(<i>edited</i>)  Please don't state who was our best striker/midfielder/defender/goalkeeper was last season, because it's about as relevant as my FIFA Career mode.

As for us looking more solid when he's in the team, personally I'm on edge whenever he's in possession.  Sunday's result is a great example of his awful positioning and management of our defence more like.  Are you joking me?  It showed he always has a mistake up his sleeve in every match, no matter how 'solid' he looks for the majority of it.
<b>
Yes the injuries are annoying, but if the club can get them under control much like they did for RVP then we will have a very good player.</b>
Yes, good luck with that one.

<b>This makes no sense what so ever and just adds to the bizarre posts that have been made about Evans.</b>
You need to take your tongue out of somewhere mate.

572~~~
Someone in the smalling thread says smalling is like an 'arsenal' defender. Which most probably defines as a good defender but will get bullied when things get physical. I just think i kind of agree with that and i'll add evans onto this list as well.

Shame because we used to have guys like bruce, stam, rio, vidic who you would worry over the prospect of them getting bullied by strikers in the pitch. Even the likes of wes brown and o'shea can take care of themselves againts the most physical of forwards but you just got the feeling that is not the same case with smalling or evans.

To make things worse they are very injury prone as well.

573~~~
He's just not good enough. Squad player at absolute best for a team like United.

574~~~
So many contradictions.

575~~~
So he's going to be out a month and Jones is out for another 3 weeks, so when is the next International break?

576~~~
I am sorry at the age of 26 he should have developed into a defender with the commanding influence to take over from Rio/Vida, however he himself lacks confidence, you always feel he has a mistake in him, he is sloppy on occasions in possession and yet in my opinion after Jones he remains our 2nd best defender, which says it all about the state of our defence at present. Rojo centrally is not the answer at the moment.

577~~~
Getsme is more than likely a young 21 year old who has never played the game, with a blinded love for a certain Johnny Evans. 

Not really sure how long he can go on arguing that Johnny Evans is good without any actual basis for an arguement. 

Your starting to appear less than great

578~~~
Most likely a 21 year old who has never played the game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> FFS, will you have a word with yourself. Saying that, I don’t play Football manager so you are most likely an expert on all things football <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I'll tell you someone who’s played the game and rated him highly, Sir Alex Ferguson, or do you and other members of RedCafe know more than him? David Moyes also rated him as does LVG it seems.

Not one person has been able to argue that Evans is as shit as they are making out, yet I’m the one not showing any basis for an argument. What I’ve read in the last few pages.
He was clearly at fault for Leicesters first goal – Wrong, it’s been discussed to death.
He’s been shit so far this season – Wrong, with the exception of the MK Dons game he has played well, we've looked more solid at the back before he went off injured against Leicester.
Blackett looks more experienced – Wrong. He has made massive mistakes this season, that’s to be expected as he is young and learning.
Hes not Rio or Vidic – Correct, not many are, also we have to remember those two built up a fantastic relationship, none of our CBs have had a chance to do that.
He's injury prone - Correct.


I could go on but I can’t be arsed.

579~~~
The hype surrounding some of our players is what got us in this sad situation in the first place. I honestly don't give a feck if a player is 'our lad', has 'potential', is 'a good player' etc. What I want is that such talent is shown on the pitch NOW and on a regular basis. If they can't produce the goods on a regular basis then they are not good enough

580~~~
If Evans, Jones and Smalling can't get his injuries sorted out (<i>not talking about Evans latest one</i>) then they should all be sold. 
We crave a back four who can play constantly together, it's the platform on which all our best teams have been built. I honestly believe that the three mentioned players have the talent to succeed here, Jones and Evans started to build a solid partnership last season until the inevitable happened.

581~~~
More IFs and BUTs. These defenders has been at OT for quite some time. They have failed to remain fit and produce the goods for a consistent period of time. If they can't do that then we should sell them to make space for defenders who are dependable. Its that simple.

582~~~
Points have to be awarded for his persistence. He's like a dog with an old jersey. Maybe an Evans jersey.

583~~~
I agree, however there isnt much we can do about it at the moment, all we can hope for is the ifs and buts <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

584~~~
Lets hope we won't end up with another 'next year will be their year' situation similar to what we've had with Ando and Cleverley

585~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ando....you just have to laugh don't you really....

586~~~
Its not funny. This mentality is what brought us to this sad situation and even now you still find people who defend the likes of Evans and Smalling because they are 'young' and 'they do play well once in a while'

Id say we give a player 2 seasons. After the first season he loses his first team role. After the second season he should be out. We're a top club not a nursery, a hospital or a retirement house.

587~~~
I keep hearing this garbage about him being 'very' good in the 20th title winning season. What games were you watching? I watched a season of us having to fight back and perform some amazing comeback victories because we were shipping goals constantly.

He was OK. that's it.

He's not some world class talent that we have to keep around. He's replaceable. He can't stay fit. Get rid.

588~~~
But no, cos jonny evans is great.  Nothing else matters.

Actually, I reckon he won us that 20th title.  He was our best defender last season too, amazing player.  Hes in his prime now, when he gets a chance to stay fit, hes gonna be the best defender in the world.

589~~~
We aren't in a situation right now where we can afford to give chances (unless your name is either Ashley Young or Antonio Valencia). We did a good job of shipping out some deadwood but by next summer, maybe even January, if we are not saying "look how good these guys have been" in regards to all three of Smalling, Evans and even Jones, then we should definitely be looking to show at least two of them the door.

590~~~
What are you talking about?

591~~~
If all 3 remain injured the only one I'd keep is Jones. For one more season at least.

592~~~
Just stating a point mate, calm down.

593~~~
Jones is the one I would hate to see go. His potential is a lot more evident, and he's a very likeable player.

Smalling I would be fine with leaving, but it would be just our luck for him to step it up at another top club, injury free to boot.

I don't have much time for Evans anymore.

594~~~
That's why I'm asking, what point are you trying to make?

Add to that, Jones is only 22(?) he's very versatile and if he can stay injury free then he could have a massive future. 
I hope that all 3 can stay injury free, however the news today that Smalling is injured again has made me lose all hope. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

596~~~
If you'd paid enough fecking attention to Evans' career at United so far you'd be well aware of his basis for an 'arguement'

597~~~
Just seen a picture of him posing in his golfing outfit with lush green scenery on the background. His posture: staring
wi<span style="font-size: 16px">stfully to the side, showing off an unsurprisingly weak chin and insecure jawline. 

Really makes my blood boil.</span>

Manchester united are a club that reward loyalty and promote youth, Johnny Evans is the epitome of this philosophy, however there is always a time when this ideology is met with the reality of the clubs present needs.

Johnny Evans is not young anymore, he is still inconsistent and injury prone and has never managed to get rid of the inability's which another defender may have overcome. He is still very weak, unassured, prone to a lapse in concentration and quite clearly a soft touch defender. Time has come to replace him with a world class centre back as we can't carry him anymore, he has had his chance.

Look at the current chelsea and city defence, look at our defence from our successful years - this is the manchester united standard, players in the top echelon, not Johnny Evans. We need to act now (january) and acknowledge our weakness. A lack of a mature leader in defence.

599~~~
Ferguson retired 2 years ago and still didn't have Johnny Evans as his number one centre back. He was giving him the chance to develop and move on towards becoming the player we needed, he has never taken that chance and made the spot his own. The fact he is of an age now where he should be dominating games and still isn't is the problem. We can't keep waiting. IMO I never believed he could be that player anyway.

What makes you think Van Gaal rates him? We have been stricken with injuries and necessity has played its part here with Evans being the senior defender. I am sure Van Gaal knows that Evans is a liability.

You are too stubborn to change your opinion now, but when you see him sold within the next 2 windows you will understand then why your wrong.

600~~~
The United I learnt to love was a team who promoted creativity and quality football. A club which didn't cared about hype and was willing to give a go to anyone whose good enough even though that would mean letting big names go. SAF built a team of world class talent only to dismantle it when he felt that their heart was not set to our goal anymore and went on relying on a couple of youths who made the club history.These days we have become a bunch of cowards who hype our players to a ridiculous extent, cling to them even if they are not good enough and keep on making excuses for them even though they repeatedly fail to produce the goods.

The United of old allowed one of the best defensive midfielder of his generation to leave for 4.5m to give space to a small red haired striker who was moved in CM despite not having an idea of how to tackle which constrasts greatly to what happened with Pogba were the most promising midfielder in the world was left to rot on the bench while 36-40 year olds and average midfielders were given ample space to do their job in CM.

601~~~
SAF believed that Cleverley was as good as Thiago Alcantara which speaks volumes on how biased he had become at late. Moyes and VG weren't given enough time to assess the defense. However the latter has already added 2 defenders to the team (Rojo and Shaw), he had promoted Blackett and he also bought Blind who can play in defense. Considering that we would probably add more defenders in the next few months I seriously doubt that he rates Evans very much.

602~~~
I've been watching a few Vidic videos, and it's just striking how much of a wimp Evans is in comparison to Vida.

What I wouldn't do for a prime Vidic back in this side <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

603~~~
Useless as English lazy brigade that still sucking up wages and life from this club like cancer.

604~~~
"Lazy brigade"?  How does being injured translate to being lazy?  If you want to make a reasoned argument that the English players aren't talented, then fair enough, I'm sure many would agree, but why use the term "lazy" to describe the English contingent at the club?

605~~~
I think we should cut our losses with him at the end of the season, or January even. Smalling too, and then bring in a couple of defenders who will actually be fit most of the time or just generally not make mistakes every game. Right now, having them in the team is holding us back and keeping us from bringing in other defenders pretty much.

606~~~
who?

607~~~
you mean <i>any </i>defender compared to Vidic

608~~~
True, but even the likes of Wes Brown were a lot harder than Jonny Evans.

609~~~
whilst i like the hard nut defenders myself, you dont particularly have to be, for example Rio. His game was based on positioning and timing. Like Evans. Problem with Evans is he needs a run of games to play into proper form but injuries keep holding him back, he's now 26 so he should be looking how to minimize the constant stop-start due to injuries.

610~~~
It's more than just injuries with Jonny.  He lacks the tools required to be a great defender.  He could be a solid defendrr for Newcastle or even Everton, but never a great defender for United.

611~~~
They are not only talentless but also lazy and can't even learn how to avoid serious responsibility about their own health. Few years ago Sir Alex gave Phil Jones and other players like even Rafael advices to watch with their reckless tackling and getting too easy into dangerous challenges. Didn't help too much. Smalling looks like a monster but can't even protect himself from inevitable 'death' on the pitch. It's really laughable when you'll see that they spend more time on focusing about their own asses than this club.

I hope we won't tolerate this like Arsenal did for so long because this is a bunch of infantile bullshit. You take responsibilities or you pack your toys and move on.

612~~~
Apart from Carrick and sometimes Rooney...
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBKXu3Kg4yg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Thankfully two of the main lazy fecks are gone.

613~~~
I dont think thats fair to say that <i>yet.</i> He did show what a good defender he was alongside Vidic in the record breaking run. Problem is that he needs a leader beside him. He isnt a natural leader himself.

614~~~
Sorry but thats complete rubbish. You might be able to criticise them for not having the desired quality but you cant criticise them for being lazy. Im sure some whizzkid will supplement this with stats to show how far they run etc.

Also I'd add that its a bit racist to say that its the lazy <i>English</i>

615~~~
This. 

I mentioned this in a post yesterday, Everton is his level, and only if he can stay fit. People are very sentimental when it comes to Evans, but in reality what are we getting from him? I hope this is his last season at OT. We've lost good servants at the club before like Wes Brown and John O'Shea and the time was right, its certainly the right time to cut our losses on Evans.

616~~~
That's your opinion. Mine is that he's our best defender, an opinion I share with many. 
Again, that's opinion, not fact. I'm really struggling with your logic - you want rid of our only defender over the age of 25 when we're struggling in that position. 

He's struggled with injuries, to the extent it's becoming a real problem, but I think he's shown on countless occasions that he's United quality.

617~~~
So that's what this about ? How do you expect them to improve without some work on their own detriments. We can't expect from younger players harder work in the biggest club in the world ? Are feckin kidding me ? That's totally gonna lower the football standards.

I'm gonna say it again - English footballers are lazy. There are exceptions but this club has been flooded with overrated wave. Call it a racism. I don't give a feck if that's the only line of defense you have for them.

618~~~
Laughable? Have a little read of your own posts mate. Utter drivel.

619~~~
He's only had one exceptional season here, 2010/11. He's not good enough for United. Not reliable enough either, he only played 2 out of 8 games against the top four teams last season. He can't play 4-5 games straight without breaking down, and when he plays you don't know when the next stupid brain fart will prove costly. Even if he was just a backup player you can't count on him to be always fit when called upon/needed. Only sentimental United fans rate Evans very highly, he's not even as good as Gary Cahill. Time to cut our losses.

620~~~
At least I don't hide in the majority and I can actually express the current state of things but thank your for Your arguments. Such a great posts from your side on the matter.

621~~~
Hide in the majority?

622~~~
Do I look like an English teacher ?

623~~~
I don't know, I can't see you?

624~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Finally some good answer with a question.

625~~~
What? What are you even trying to say?
Well if you're going to make sweeping generalisations about the English, you should try speaking the language properly first.

626~~~
Keep raging and attacking. I'm sure that's what will make United play better.

627~~~
He was looking like a proper top defender on the making at one point some years back.

628~~~
As long as Vidic and Ferdinand were capable of sustaining defense in a good shape he looked tidy and cool. I can give him that.

Being oldest defender in the club now is probably too much pressure and responsibility. Sad outcome not because of the player but the amount of trust he received.

629~~~
He's never been any good when we've been under sustained pressure. Not a good defender and he's contantly injured in anycase. I believe Sunderland offered circa £12m a few seasons ago, I thought at the time we should have snapped their hand off.   Hopefully we will cut our losses sooner rather than later.

630~~~
I remember that. TBH we'd be lucky to even get 8M for him now. 7 consecutive games in the last two seasons is just not good enough!

631~~~
FFS.

632~~~
Not sure if some of you are being sarcastic or if its that time of the month again.  Evans had been rated as our best defender on here numerous times, some of you have really short memories.  A homegrown player who came through the system and whose family are United fans, we need more players like this, instead of flogging them out for peanuts.  As been said before, he needs a Vidic or another commanding partner to play his best football.  That partner should have been Phil Jones if injuries hadn't hampered his development so badly.  So unless we are suddenly overflowing with quality centerbacks in our academy, he isn't going anywhere.

Both Vida and Brown were some of the hardest defenders in Fergie's era.  When was the last time we've seen someone get brnwed?  Besides Rafael and then getting sent off for it.

633~~~
If this shit keeps up he'll be gone next summer like Welbeck this one. Who gives a feck if he came from the ranks when he's never around to contribute? I'll repeat, he's only played 7 consecutive games in two seasons! Thats simply not good enough and is around Anderson level of unreliability!

634~~~
The games he's been voted MOTM are where we've been put under little pressure and he's been good at taking the ball out of defence. However, when a team have constantly been pressing and putting the defence under pressure I am struggling to think of a game where he's excelled. 

To be honest it's pointless debating about how good or bad he is/was as a defender because he's just too injury prone, certainly for a centre back (a postion that IMO should not be rotated).   Time to move him on.

635~~~
I fail to see any valid parallel to Anderson. He's injured a lot, which is a real shame for the guy. When fit, he's the best we have and with the right partner, he'll still be a huge contributer. Some terrible shit being talked in here.

636~~~
He's been voted MOTM when we haven't been under pressure, ok then.

637~~~
unfortunately this is becoming the norm over here...

638~~~
When he's fit he's either very good or very erratic. You know this. He's 27 soon. You wouldn't keep someone at your company with the same level of output. Sentimentality getting in the way of reality. People are not rational when it comes to home grown players. 7 consecutive games in 2 years is Anderson territory of productivity. Be honest to yourself and tell me its not. Last season he only played 2 out of 8 games against the top four..so what exactly does he contribute?

639~~~
Thank you! Defence is the one area of the field that needs to be the most settled. Its not good for a GK playing with different defenders every 5 games. Evans needs to fecking go once we get proper dependable players.

640~~~
Roy Keane on Jonny Evans:

641~~~
He's never looked like that to be fair.

642~~~
Which is mostly what you get on a forum.

My opinion happens also to be that he is a very average defender.

643~~~
Agreed. It's crazy how many seem to think he's our best defender though.

644~~~
When Vidic got sat on by that Basel player, Evans came in and was top class.

645~~~
Not saying he doesn't have his moments.

646~~~
Evans, Smalling, Jones - they've all had periods that make you say they are excellent centerhalves or will be. It's all about taking the next step and doing that permanently, which none of them has so far. Injuries haven't helped, of course...

647~~~
Yawn

648~~~
Cups hand behind ear.

649~~~
You should get that checked out.

650~~~
Hope we can sell this guy as early as January if we get in some reinforcements.

651~~~
It was basically a whole season.

652~~~
He's been a big dissapointment tbh. Not entirely his fault with all his injuries but really should have stepped it up as of yet. Early signs were there.
Don't think he will ever be top class now.

653~~~
He sure did.

654~~~
I agree. He'll be 27 in a few and will soon be entering that phase of a career where players naturally get more injuries and take longer to recover from them. Let's sell now and get what we can. Probably less than 10M

655~~~
You are a moron if you believe that. Look at him play when he was younger, he was good and looked like he could push on and become a very good (not world class) player. If you can't see that you are delusional. 

There are lots of games for United, Sunderland and Northern Ireland that he showed his true class in. Unfortunately he has scummed to too many injuries and lacks the ability to get back inform quickly.

656~~~
Criticise the post not the poster?

He's an average defender, always has been, always will be. If you weren't from Ulster, you might see it too.

657~~~
So you never believe that he once showed potential to be a very good top 4 side Centre Back?

658~~~
Not since his very early days have I thought he would be good enough to be a starter week in week out for us. 

Too injured too often though and when that's the case it doesn't matter how good you may or may not be anyway.

659~~~
Got it in one.

660~~~
So that run of games he had beside Rio the season before last wasn't convincing?

661~~~
Has he reproduced it since?

And there lies the problem.

Patches of good form mean nothing if its between long periods of absense or poor form. He's not a young player anymore.

662~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

663~~~
Yes he has, the problem isn't his talent it's his injuries. Some seem to be incapable of separating the two.

664~~~
I don't think anyone is incapable of separating the 2. What use is all of this talent if he's never able to show it?

Fact is he's nearly 27 and still hasn't nailed down a place in the side.

And honestly, the talent he has, some make out he's an a fecking world beater. He isn't. He's a good defender and nothing more. Certainly not good enough to justify the risk involved in continuing to rely on him.

665~~~
Some fail to recognise that he has talent, when challenged, they type the same old tired shite about his injuries, or he is always at fault for us conceding goals, sometimes when he's not even playing, so yes, there are some who can't separate the two.
His injuries have let him down, it's not exactly a secret that he hasn't managed to play a consistent run of games for some time now. It's hardly his fault that he's injured is it, his recent one was after a bad challenge during the Leicester game, a game when our defence crumbled after he went off.
Of course he hasn't nailed down a place, name me a CB in the Club that has over the last few seasons? All our defenders seem to suffer from injuries, how can any player build a relationship in that scenario? Again, the problem isn't his talent it's his injury record, however some just refuse to accept that.

666~~~
I'm not really interested what the cause is of his latest injury. Fact is he's injured though. Again. He has proven over time that he isn't capable of being relied upon.

So let me ask you, do you think it's wise to keep 3 CBs at the club who are so regularly injured? Presuming this answer is no (which it really should be, we can't go on like this) the do you think Evans is worth saving over Smalling and/or Jones?

For me Jones is the one with the greatest potential from those 3. I'd move on the other 2. They're both good players who may get better but we simply can't have so many injury prone players that play in the same position. It's madness.

667~~~
I haven't mentioned his injuries once.

668~~~
Mate last year he is the only our player who selected in UEFA starting 11 for Group stage. So it not some recognize it.
Its his injuries that let him down, if he sort out his injuries problem (which I doubt he could be) he can become great defender.
It is not like he don't have talent, problem is his injuries which let him down.

669~~~
Of course the type of injury comes into it, it's not the usual type he suffers from, this time he got a kick after a decent challenge which resulted in his injury. That could happen any player.
I agree that overtime it has been proven beyond doubt that he is injury prone, unfortunately for us and him this has had a negative influence on his career, what's makes it worse is his fellow CBs suffer from the same curse. However, I'm not debating that, what I am debating is people using his injury record as a reason for labelling him a shit player.
As for keeping 3 injury prone CBs, no it's not the best idea, however at the moment we have no other option but to keep them. As good as McNair has been, any one or even two of Evans, Jones or Smalling will walk into the starting 11. If I had to get rid of one my personal choice would be Smalling, but in all honesty I wouldn't get rid of any until we have an established back four.

I would have no ill feelings if we sold Evans, however I feel he gets a very raw deal on here which he doesn't deserve. If we somehow managed to keep him injury free then we would have a fantastic player on our hands.

670~~~
Promised to be more and has had very good spells but he has now become the New Wes Brown in more than one ways.

671~~~
"great defender"? That's the sort of over rating of our own players we suffer from. Are you telling me he could be in the class of the likes of Stam, Vidic and Ferdinand? No chance. He's a good defender and no more than that.

672~~~
No it doesn't come into it. This one was unfortunate, so what? It's just 1 of many. 

Oh and it goes without saying that I would bring replacements in before I binned them off. I would have thought something so obvious didn't need pointing out. Crickey.

673~~~
If we can get money for him in January or the summer, get rid and buy some actual quality. We could keep him but he's nearly 27, and having been shite for a while, I'd rather give that spot to a young player that's not injured 24/7. God knows we're stacked in that department.

674~~~
You'd be surprised <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

675~~~
Evans will never be world class, even without the injuries. He's a solid player at best, in the class of Gary Cahill.

676~~~
Ofcouse not. He will never became like vidic, Stam or Ferdinand. But that doesn't means he is waste of time.
There are not much defenders same class as vidic, stam or rio.

677~~~
However one would describe Cahill for Chelsea - that's how I'd describe Evans. Similar level of player.
Do people believe Cahill's a 'great' defender? If not, then it's stretching it to say Evans is one/capable of being one.

678~~~
Smalling and Jones have the excuse of being played out of position a lot since they arrived at the club.

Evans doesn't have that excuse and sadly I believe he is running out of time at the club.

I can't see LVG being impressed with Evans so far, and once another CB is bought into the team, along with Rojo and the reserve lads doing well, I can see Evan being shown the exit door.

679~~~
If he was the only injury prone defender in a group of 4 then I'd agree he would be worth persevering with but fact is we have 3 (<b>three!</b>) pernanently injured CBs and we can't go on like that. As such I believe 1 or 2 need moving on. Out of the 3 I believe Jones has the most potential so the 2 for the chop would be Evans and Smalling.

680~~~
The big difference is Cahill spends more time on the pitch than in the treatment room. The same can't be said for Evans.

EDIT: According to transfermarkt Cahill has had just 1 injury in the last 4 years.

681~~~
We could sign any two defenders in the world right now and we would be extremely lucky to get them up to the level of Rio/Vidic from 2006-2011. Very few world class defenders about these days.

682~~~
Indeed, very hard to get a combination like that.

683~~~
Only people with red tinted glasses. Some United fans think Evans is one of the best CBs in the premier league. I'm talking up there with Kompany.

684~~~
Show me one post on here where people put Evans up alongside Kompany. You have a habit of making stuff up, I'm betting this is another one.

685~~~
When I talk about United fans im not fvcking restricted to posters on this forum

686~~~
It just a disgrace, it's Rawk'ish, Evans is a mediocre defender, in form he is a decent top10 defender, not more and not less.

687~~~
Ah ok, it's 'those' fans that are saying it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

688~~~
I've come across them, how the fvck would you know?

689~~~
Fergie started this shit with all the unrealistic praise he was heaping on Evans since he was 19...including saying Evans was arguably the 'best defender in the country' back in 2012. He also said Evans would be a dead cert to be a United captain and key player for years to come when he was 21 and awarded with a 30k salary

690~~~
I'm not saying you haven't, it's just you have a history of making shit up.

691~~~
<a class="username" data-user="65160, @iBoss" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65160/">@iBoss</a> is right about how good Evans was in the season where Vidic did his ligaments, I recall Fergie calling him the best CB in the league that season, now that might be typical hyperbole from a manager but I think Evans was in the conversation without a doubt. 

It's been a long time since he showed that type of form though and I'd certainly sell him to make room for a top CB in January.

692~~~
A history of making shit up? Like what exactly? You must be stuck on that Vidic/McNair comparison shit. Assuming

693~~~
That was the one that sticks out, I remember there being another couple but I can't remember them.

694~~~
I don't recall getting into any other direct debates with you besides that one on the McNair thread and on this one, you'd certainly remember and so would I.

695~~~
Nothing personal, but come on...

696~~~
Maybe.

697~~~
True, And that's the problem lots of people here,
They just want to compare even its realistically not possible.
Evens never going to be next Rio, or Vidic but that's doesn't means he is useless.
In past when he was given chance he done good job and that we need to realize.

698~~~
Well if you are talking about injuries then I agree with you, it look like he is not going to overcome his injury problem.
But if you think he is useless and don't have talent than I disagree with you.
As its goes he is most reliable defender on those 3, also less injuries prone.

699~~~
At no point have I ever said he's useless and doesn't have talent. In fact I've repeatedly gone out of my way to state I think he's a good player.

700~~~
I picked those names to use as a comparison. Maybe it's something lost in translation but you said Evans could be a "great" player. When I hear the word "great" I'm thinking of names like Vidic, Rio and Stam.

701~~~
Also, can I just add, "great" is the level we should be aiming for. We won't win anything with just decent/good defenders.

702~~~
If Evans wasn't a perma-crock then you'd think he could be a regular starter for an elite club - either as a 3rd choice CB or potentially even as first choice alongside a world class CB who complimented Evans perfectly.

As it is I'm starting to have doubts if he will even be at United for much longer. He's two years older than Smalling and four years older than Jones, so you'd expect him to be the first of our current crop to be cut loose if he doesn't stay fit and produce consistently soon.

703~~~
City won the league with Demichellis and Kolarov/Clichy in their defence last season. Madrid won the CL with Carvajal at RB. None of them are great defenders.

704~~~
All of them are more consistent than Evans

705~~~
Kolarov or Clichy aren't IMO and Demichellis was poor for the first half of last season.

706~~~
We don't have any great defenders at CB, that's my point. CIty have Kompany. Madrid have, erm, yeh, take your point.

707~~~
All of them can get on the pitch more often than Evans...

708~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I quite rate Ramos TBH.
True and I agree with your earlier point that we need to get rid of at least one of the three injury prone CB's for one that can be relied upon, and Evans would probably be my pick of the three, but I do think he could be good enough to be a starter for a team challenging for major trophies if he could get over his injury problems once and for all.

709~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

710~~~
Still, Evans is both inconsistent with his performances (which could sometimes be due to him struggling with form getting back from injury, but still) and off course he's unreliable. All of those other players have managed more than 7 consecutive games in the last two years, which is where Evans is.

711~~~
We'll sell him to Sunderland next season. If he's lucky maybe Everton will pick him up. I don't see him playing for a top four team after United.

712~~~
For real?

713~~~
Did he not get a good run in 2009 as well during our long clean sheet run?

714~~~
He's had loads of good to great spells in the team. Some so good people wanted one of Vidic/Rio benched and sometimes that did happen.

715~~~
I remember him being quite good during that period to be honest.

Interestingly enough, Keano calls him "a born leader" in his latest book. 

It's interesting how so few people can meet in the middle when discussing our players. Rooney, Mata, Kagawa, Jones, Evans, etc seem to create such polarising opinions when in reality the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle.

Evans isn't a world beating CB, however, he isn't the dog shite he's often made out to be. He can be a fairly high quality CB when he is healthy and playing a few consecutive games. Perhaps he needs to be paired with a better partner. I don't think the Evans of the last 18 months is the true Jonny Evans. A lot of our players need a big shot of confidence (and a run of games) following the Moyes fiasco and he is one of them. 

However, how we can give him this with him out injured half the time is another story.

716~~~
Yes I do believe he could be great player and when he had run of game he prove that.
I also said if he can resolve his injuries problem.
Also vidic, Rio are not great players but they are one of best in world.

717~~~
This doesn't make sense...how can you say they are/were not great players but among the best in the world?

718~~~
He probably means not the best players individually but as a partnership where one of the best in the world.

719~~~
Alright. Probably so. I believe they were both great individually.

720~~~
I think he means that they were more than great. Because if he means they weren't the best individually then he is completely wrong.

721~~~
I agree.

722~~~
I think I haven't make my-self clear,
Discussion was about Evens could be great player (if he solve his injuries problem).
Now person reply with me, asking about do I compare him with Rio, Vidic a great player.

What I am trying to say is Vidic and Rio is level above great players hence one of best in world.
And I can't compare Evans with both of them.

723~~~
Rio and Vidic were world class at their peak.

Evans had the potential, imo, to get to the level below them, very good player but not world class.

724~~~
Reading Keane's book, it is very painful to watch Jonny Evans these days. He was destined to reach the very top (probably a bit better than Brown and Silvestre at their very best), but just stagnated for one reason or another, probably injuries. Won't mind at all if he's sold this summer if he doesn't improve quickly in the coming months.

725~~~
For those who haven't read the book, what does it say about Evans exactly?

726~~~
No. Hell be entering the age where players reach their physical and mental peak.

727~~~
Fair enough. Even so, he's 3 years shy of 30, reaching his peak before that won't help him much if his fitness record doesn't improve. Do you honestly think it will?

728~~~
He seems to have an recurring ankle problem.

He's an excellent defender who has demonstrated his ability in various times. He needs to play over 30 league games for at least one season(not likely to happen this season either).

I reckon he'll face the same fate as Welbeck.

729~~~
I agree, and the sooner it happens the better. Im hoping we sign  a solid CB in January. If that happens we can offload Evans. Lets not delay the inevitable.

730~~~
I would wait until the for both summer for following reasons: We gave an chance to evaluate all our current center backs in a season with lower expectations; It'll be easier to identify the type of top CB we need after LvG has a clear idea of the level and potential of our current CBs; and, finally, better CBs won't be available until the  summer.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Why not get rid of Jones and Smalling in the January as well then. In fact, let's buy 3 new CBs and give them no time what so ever to gel or become accustomed to a new Country/league/team. feck it if they don't settle or benefit the team in anyway, it doesn't matter, just get rid of that cnut Evans.
I mean we just bought Rojo and he has been outplayed by a 19 year old who's only played two professional games in his life, but that doesn't matter. I really hope you don't make decisions in real life.
Sometimes you just have to sit back and laugh at posts, and you do supply plenty of them.

733~~~
Interesting. Wouldn't have imagined Evans being described as tough by Roy Keane considering how he (Evans) is on the pitch.

734~~~
What the feck are you on? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> All this shit you're talking about has nothing to do with with anything. You must be Northern Irish or from the republic, at least it will explain this blind devotion to your fellow Irishman Evans, I get it. Evans has been a first team player since the age of 19, is now almost 27 and has only had one <i>truly superb</i> season here (2011-12). Since then he hasn't produced the same consistency in quality over a sustained period of time. Your man simply hasn't made the grade here and unfortunately its mostly down to his absence through injury and the stop-starts that play havoc with him getting a rhythm going and hitting top form. So yes, why delay the inevitable and hold on to him?  You seriously think he's going to turn a corner...you seriously think a player who has only managed 7 consecutive games for two whole fecking years is suddenly going to be more reliable as he gets older? Evans will probably stay on, and I bet we'll still be having this conversation next season.

If I recall correctly from the Welbeck thread, you had no problem with us selling him because he was a squad player at best. At this rate Evans can't even be a reliable squad player. It buffles me that you think a player who spends a lot of time on the sidelines is more useful to United. All of a sudden it becomes crazy for someone like me to suggest Evans should meet the same fate. Evans has stagnated and deep inside you know this. Blind devotion.

735~~~
Reductio ad Ferguson. You can't use Fergie as the ultimate trump card when people don't agree with you.

736~~~
Getsme must be Johnny Evans himself. I like Evans and before the season started he would have been my first choice CB but the fact is he's been mostly shite this season. He was terrible against all of MK Dons, Burnley and the first half against QPR. Yes, we kept  a clean sheet in the latter two but it wasn't because of Evans played well. He also did not do his job for the 1st Leicester goal despite getsme's best attempts to pretend otherwise.

If he can't proove that he can stay for an extended period of time this season then he should be sold. Same with Smalling.

737~~~
It seems to be the thing to do these days.  If Ferguson does/says something, it's 100% lawful truth.

"He’s been shit so far this season – Wrong, <b>with the exception of the MK Dons game</b> he has played well, we've looked more solid at the back before he went off injured against Leicester.
Blackett looks more experienced – Wrong. He has made <b>massive mistakes</b> this season, that’s to be expected as he is young and learning."

Both these points are utter bollocks :].  I'd give up talking to him as people have stated...it's most likely Johnny Evans himself.

738~~~
What am I on? No idea, however maybe I have a bit of common sense and that's what's confusing you.
You want to get rid of Evans no matter what. I think your words were 'the sooner we get rid of him the better' Why? What benefit is it to the team getting rid of him in January? You have yet to give one valid reason yet go on and on about it. Do you not think it would be more beneficial to keep him around, then if we do buy another CB It will give him time to establish himself in the team? What's so hard to understand about that? Do you think a Rojo has settled into the team well? I sure as hell don't, will he? Most likely but it will take time. Vidic and Evra are a good example of January signings needing time.

Yes Evans has been a first team member for 7 or 8 years but he was up against two of the best defenders the Club has had in recent times, yet he still managed to play a bigger part than both of them over the last couple of seasons.
Injuries have been his biggest nemesis, not talent. When he has had a run of games he has played very very well, in fact I think he was in the team of the group stages in last years Champions league, but let's ignore that as it doesn't suit your agenda. It's obvious that no matter what Evans does he will simply be deemed not good enough by some, which is complete bollocks.
As for using my nationality as a reason for defending Evans, all that shows is your immaturity and lack of ability to come up with any sound reasons as to why we should get rid of Evans, apart from the usual 'he's always injured line' which you bring up time and time again, its getting boring now, it's not as if that's breaking news.
I've also defended Valencia, Rooney, Young, Jones, Fellaini, Lingard plus many other players when they have had unjust criticism thrown there way, make of that what you will?
I had no problem getting rid of Welbeck because he had Rooney, RVP, Falcao, Wilson and Januzaj in front of him, that's the big difference and the thing you clearly don't understand. We have had to play two youth players this season as our three main CBs are injured, yet you want to get rid of one without giving any new  players coming in time to settle or to see if they are good actually good enough.
If we buy new CBs and they give us the much needed consistency we need, who knows maybe McNair (<i>oops better not say him as he's Northern Irish</i>)  will become a regular, then we can sell Evans, Jones or Smalling, maybe all three, until then they will stay.
It's not blind devotion as you said it's common fecking sense.

739~~~
Oooh FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Giving away a penalty and getting sent off is a massive mistake, TBF. Don't agree with the first point though.

You seem to be missing the 's' on the end of mistake. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> I'd totally agree with 'mistake' :P

That's one fecked up post.

I think 19 year old Jonny Evans would beat up 26 year old Jonny Evans.

Johnny, you should be taking criticism on board and improving your game mate.

745~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Go away and start posting more weird posts.

746~~~
Getme are you still defending Johnny Evans?

I admire your persistence but saying he is great over and over again doesn't make it true.

I am not surprised that the majority of united fans realise the obvious that he isn't good enough, I am surprised though that it took this long!

747~~~
I may be counting pre-season in my mind, he had an absolute mare on the right side of a back three at some point, made Blackett on the left look like Beckenbauer.

748~~~
Agreed, he's only gotten worse, seemingly.

I still hold out hope he'll pull it together, he's worth keeping as a back-up at least, he's had his days with Drogba in his pocket.

749~~~
Are the buffles contagious?

750~~~
I think he should move for his career. Everton would be an excellent place for him. Distin very much aging, Jagielka past 30. He could be an excellent addition there.

751~~~
How about you tag me so I know when your talking about me.
I don't have to say it over and over again, he is a very good player, that isn't the issue. It's his injuries that have stopped him, not his talent. 
Some seem to be incapable of separating the two.

752~~~
I don't know how to tag! Excuse me for my lack of e-competance.

This is where you are inexcusably wrong, he is not a very good player, the fact you seem to have convinced yourself this is true is odd and this is the issue.

He wouldn't get into the starting 11 for any of the top 4 (Man city, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool). In truth only the first 3 teams listed there posses 'very good' central defenders.

He showed some promise and that is it.

His injuries have given you an excuse as to why he hasn't been great, but the truth is he has had enough time injuries aside to prove himself but he is 27 and remains a mediocre player.

753~~~
You're excused.
Evans got into a Championship winning team, something which one of those teams haven't won, another hasn't won for 10 years and one hasn't won it for 5 years. He is also played every game in 08/09 when the defence set the world league clean sheet record by not conceding a single goal for 1,311 minutes.
More recently, during Sir Alex Fergusons last title winning season, when Evans was in the team we averaged 2.7 points per game, he was in the team of the group stages for last seasons Champions League and was being touted as a potential captain for the club this season.

2008–09    17 appearances in PL - Champions
2009–10    18 appearances IN PL - Second
2010–11    13 appearances in PL - Champions
2011–12    29 appearances in PL - Second
2012–13    23 appearances in PL - Champions
2013–14    17 appearances in PL - Seventh
2014–15    03 appearances in PL - Unknown.
Not bad for a shit player. As I've said 1000 times now, it's his injuries that's the problem, not his talent.

754~~~
That is not a reflection of him as a player though is it, because there are so many players who feature in successful teams that aren't great players, its a stupid debate. 

Just because the team as a whole achieved past success does not mean he is currently a good player. In Ferguson's last season he only made 23 appearances (just over half the total premier league games) and we scrapped the title. Ferdinand and Vidic were struggling with injuries and would have been in there if fit. Which clearly displays the level of his ability.

If you notice the ongoing trend is that he has progressively played less games over the course of the seasons and he has also got progressively worse since his so called amazing season.

You keep referring to a season which happened 6 years ago, one which he only player half the game! since then he has regressed and that is a fact. He is actually getting worse with age.

It doesn't matter about the positions of the teams I've listed over the past years its irrelevant, it matters about the quality that they hold now and the quality of the player we are comparing them with - NOW.

You sound like a deluded Liverpool fan who goes on and fixates on former glories!

I think you could do with just being a bit more realistic and admitting that he just had 1 good season and that you over rate his ability.

Thank you

755~~~
Sorry but <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

756~~~
It's no more laughable than the drivel you posted. That Evans was a good player in 08/09 is indisputable, whether he's a useful member of the squad going forward as a 26 year old, inconsistent, injury prone mess of an "experienced" central defender  is another matter altogether. We shouldn't settle for mediocrity, especially in central defence. Jonny Evans will never be world class, yet takes minutes off defenders who could reach that level in Jones and Rojo, that's reason enough for him to be out the door.

It's the Cleverley syndrome all over again. A good season or two a few years back, homegrown, inconsistent, injury prone - and the second he's out the door nobody will be mourning his absence.

757~~~
What drivel?

758~~~
Well, funnily enough we could even see a pattern in the data you posted on a season to season basis which contradicts your "Evans is great" thesis.


2008–09 17 appearances in PL - Champions.-----------Evans plays a decent/low amount of games, Champions.
2009–10 18 appearances IN PL - Second.---------------Evans plays slightly more games. Not Champions.
2010–11 13 appearances in PL - Champions------------Evans plays far less games. Champions.
2011–12 29 appearances in PL - Second----------------Evans plays far more games. Not Champions.
2012–13 23 appearances in PL - Champions-----------Evans plays less games. Champions.
2013–14 17 appearances in PL - Seventh---------------Moyes
2014–15 03 appearances in PL - Unknown.

So I don't know how that data suggests Evans was a major factor in us winning titles, but...whatever. 

He really is a rather pointless member of a title-contending squad at present. What's the point of a supposedly experienced squad-level defender if he's never available and isn't even very good when he's slotted back into the side.

759~~~

Classic sign of submitance in an argument, you had a sign an opportunity to counter but resorted to a smiley face.

I will even give you another opportunity to respond to my previous post with a constructive argument. But the reality is you can't argue with what I said.

You have no where to go.

761~~~
What utter tosh. How can a player who played that many games be considered a pointless member of the team, posts like this one is the main reason I come on here to defend Evans. It just goes to show how fickle some of our fans are,

762~~~
Sometimes a smiley face will do, especially when your post is 100% bollocks.

763~~~
Because football is a game in which you look to the future. I don't care that Evans has played "that many games". I care that he's A. Inconsistent. B. Injury prone and C. Going to take minutes away from potentially WC players. There is no room for sentimentality in the PL or CL. Unfortunately, that he's a lovely, homegrown lad doesn't magically grant us 3 extra points at the start of the season, so we should evaluate him on the basis of what he offers going forward. On current evidence that's less than what a younger, less injury prone replacement could offer.

764~~~
Guys the tone in here is getting a bit overly aggressive, please keep the debate civilized.

765~~~
When is he back?

766~~~
Again, I have no problem with moving him on, I've said it quite a few times now. I'm defending him against posters who claim he is shit when that's clearly not the case. Again at the risk of repeating myself, some cant seem to differentiate between his injury record and his talent.
His inconsistency comes from his injuries, the same can be said about many of our players, RVP, Jones, Rooney, Smalling to name but a few take quite a few games to regain any sort of form, however they seem to be given time to gain some form where Evans is slated for goals which aren't his fault. (Yes I'm going back to the Leicester goal)
I understand the frustration with Evans, I'm frustrated with him but the bashing of him is just ridicilious.

767~~~
He's training again from what I've read.

768~~~
Excellent.

769~~~
The irony in your post is beautiufl and there is an age old saying "you can't reason with stupidity" which means I'll have to leave it there.

He is nothing more than a squad player and his numbers prove that, we need more than that now.

He is not of the class that we require it's that simple and even you can't deny that. 

I've given you countless opportunities to provide me with a decent reasoning as to why is very good player but you have fallen short.

770~~~
OK then.

771~~~
Apparently!

772~~~
I don't get bold part of your post. Which CB you are refereeing?, as all of our back-line keep getting injured.

773~~~
Overrated, never fit, and really not good enough to be starting CB.

774~~~
Has he always had these fitness issues? I don't really remember him missing that many games through injuries early on in his career. I guess he was managed more with Vida and Rio in front of him though.

775~~~
Whether he's a good player, a bad player, a squad player, whatever. It's all secondary to his appalling injury record. 

So many articles about Evans in the press start with "if Jonny can stay fit, he's............". But he never stays fit. And the same applies to "stiff legs" Smalling and Jones. And Rafael, Young and Valencia for the matter of that. It's ridiculous.

We can't keep going into matches with our fingers crossed that one of our key centre backs is not going to pick up a seemingly innocuous injury that sidelines them for ages. Our defensive solidity is being continually compromised by the inability to consistently select a settled pairing. And this in a season when we have just league fixtures and the FA Cup left.   

It will be a gradual process, but Evans, Smalling and Jones all need moving on.

776~~~
Future United captain apparently.

Torquay United most likely, because he wont ever be Manchester United captain, mainly because he wont be here after this season.

777~~~
Totally agree.

778~~~
His injury record is being exaggerated in this thread, that's for damn sure. He's averaged 20 league games/season over the last 6 seasons. Considering he's never been first-choice (thanks to Rio and Vidic) had decent competition as a second choice CB (Smalling and Jones) and never gets games in any other position that's by no means a disastrous record. 

Last year was definitely a bad year for him which - combined with the standard redcafe goldfish memories - seems to have been enough to decide he's always been an utter crock. 23 and 29 league appearances in the two previous seasons.

779~~~
Indeed. Games missed because of injuries below...

07/08 0 games
08/09 3 PL games, 1 FA Cup game
09/10 0 games
10/11 3 CL games, 4 PL games, 2 FA Cup Games
11/12 0 games
12/13 1 CL game, 5 PL games, 2 FA Cup Games
13/14 4 CL games + 9 PL games (calf)

780~~~
Well there you have it. In the last seven seasons he's been available for selection in just under 8 out of every 10 league games.

What a crock...

781~~~
Source?

782~~~
Didn't realize that. His injury record isn't that bad. 

 In any case, I think one of Evans and Smalling will leave the club next season.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/jonny-evans/verletzungen/spieler/42412" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">On this page</a> transfermarket says he's missed 46 games as opposed to the 34 you say he missed.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/players/2504/jonny_evans_injury.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Here's a list</a> of his injuries from physioroom. In the last 2 calender years he's had 12 injuries. That seems quite injury prone to me.

786~~~
That has 14/15 season included. And yeah, they have some problems with counting. I used this page below...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/jonny-evans/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/42412/verein/985" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/jonny-evans/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/42412/verein/985</a>

787~~~
That page does not appear to be correct. For instance, in 08/09 season it says Evans missed 8 games between 20th January to 21st February. United did play eight games in that period, but Evans didn't miss all of them, just four. 

Those 4, plus 14/15 4 so far, and we're already on 38...and they just added four more in other seasons. No biggie.

788~~~
Without even looking at his injury record, Evans is simply not a reliable player to have when you're chasing titles. LVG will sell this guy next summer.

789~~~
I hope he makes a tit of the lot of you. The poor fecker needs 12 months injury free and in a settled defense and I'd back him over pretty much anyone you want to bring in. People talk about him like they did about Anderson except without the affection. It baffles me.

790~~~
For some reason he is the new scapegoat, no idea why. Some posters on here tend to jump on the bandwagon when a player is singled out and only have tunnel vision when it comes to talking about or discussing him.

791~~~
If I had a dollar for every time someone said this. 'All he needs is a good injury free run', this had been said to death about Evans. Seven years and counting and only one truly exceptional season from this guy.

792~~~
It's not that people think he's a poor player, but that he's not good enough to be leading a defence which wants to be winning trophies at the top level. I doubt that anyone sees him as a defensive Anderson - he's had some sustained periods of good form, but most of them came when he was next to a top class defender in Vidic/Ferdinand. I'd happily keep him around because I do rate him, but I definitely think we need to be looking for a top quality player as our number 1 defender. Evans could play next to him, but unless Smalling's development picks up again then it'll probably be Jones/Rojo who will be that players long-term partner.

793~~~
Even then, I'd say exceptional is a bit of an overstatement. I'd say his best season was probably in 2011/12, but even then, that was only for a period of the season (admittedly a sustained one), next to a top defender in Ferdinand, in a time where we were largely comfortable at the back and went on a winning run against a lot of smaller teams who we were dominant over.

I don't agree with the supposed Anderson comparisons a poster used above, but people saying that "he needs an injury free spell" is the sort of stuff that used to be said about him. And posts above have demonstrated that Evans' injury problems haven't even been that significant. Especially when we consider that Vidic/Ferdinand had their fair share of problems and still managed to be world class defenders.

794~~~
I'm sure the same people saying Evans is not good enough, said the same about Cahill a couple years back.

Evans has proven he can be a very good CB. Most notably when he replaced Vidic when he picked up that injury vs Basel for the rest of that season. Some of you want all of our CB's sold off! Unbelieveable. No doubt the same people were gushing over Blackett after a couple games because he 'looked composed on the ball'. Have you forgotten how good Evans can be on the ball?!? Because he has a couple dodgy back passes against MK Dons and Burnley means he's shit now?

795~~~
He's not a shit player, he's simply not dependable and his record shows that.

796~~~
This is the problem though. People will say, "Player X became top class when people didn't think he would, so Player Y will", even if there's not the evidence to suggest it will happen. People used to say Anderson was bound to become a top player for example, because Xavi had been a late bloomer. Of course, Evans has already done much better than Anderson ever did and he's a respected player here, but he's not top class. He's coming on 27 - there's not a lot to suggest he's going to be good enough to lead our defence as a world class player, and that's what we should be looking for.

Does that mean we need to sell Evans? No. In fact, I want us to keep him and I think he has an important place in this squad, but if you offered me a top class defender to start ahead of him? I'd take it, and we'd be a bit daft not to.

797~~~
Except Evans has shown he can reach the level Cahill is at now.

798~~~
He's had some good sustained run of form, but has never demonstrated that he's a truly world class defender. At his best, he's very good, but not at that very top level. I don't really seem him getting there, either.

799~~~
He doesn't have to be world class. Since when did you need 11 world class players to have a world class team? 
Is Cahill world class? Is Terry still the same player he was? Why is that they are the best CB partnership in the league then?

The fact remains that you can't just go out and sign Hummels. There aren't many top World Class CB's out there either.

800~~~
You don't, but we should be looking to have a world class centre back. Terry and Cahill are a very good partnership, but that doesn't mean that Chelsea shouldn't be constantly looking to improve if they get the opportunity. Terry/Cahill are also bolstered by the fact that they're managed by Mourinho - it's no coincidence that they've been excellent since his return.

Not to mention that Evans generally isn't as good as Cahill anyway - if we can, we should be looking to improve upon him. Yes, you can't just go out and land lots of world class centre backs, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. If we want to become one of the best teams around again, we shouldn't be relying on Evans as our main defender. We had two world class players in Ferdinand and Vidic before. Why are we now lowering standards to the point where that's not what we should be aiming for?

801~~~
If there is a WC CB out there available, we should buy him. I didn't say we shouldn't.

802~~~
Fair enough. Either way though, I think we need to be looking for an upgrade on Evans. I like him, and rate him as a good defender, but he's not good enough to be our main defender and I don't think he will be long-term. He should still play an important role in the squad though.

803~~~
He's not really shown a great deal of quality (like others) since 2013 before Sir Alex retired. It's worrying as far as I'm concerned because I thought the rough diamond had finally been shaped by then but he shows far less composure in possession nowadays, this season has made a few notable errors (one or two which have led to goals) and the injuries are creeping back too.

He's one of those who you'd have to say is quite dispensable but he has the quality somewhere in him, so hopefully he can nail it soon enough. Chris Smalling has been notably worse more recently though, and what worries me about that is so many people on here really rate Smalling, and for some reason I just never have. He epitomises gormless when it comes to having to play football from the back.

804~~~
We don't have any defenders that are World Class, not one. Should we get rid of them all? In fact through the whole team we only have two players who would be considered to be in the category. In midfield we only have Di Maria and up front only Falcao would be considered World Class.
Leaves us kinda short doesn't it.

805~~~
That really depends on how you interpret 'world class' doesn't it. Evans has been oyr worst defender this season by a considerable distance, is old and looks far less likely to ever reach his potential, which is lower than the likes of Jones, Smalling and probably even Blackett, that's why.

He's played 2.5 league games this season, while he has been on the pitch we have conceded one goal.
He hasn't been our worst defender, he has make some mistakes but which defender hasn't this season, he's 26, since when has that been old <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

807~~~
Typo there, was supposed to be oldER. No he hasnt played 2.5 games, don't just pick and chose which manner of football you judge him on, why ignore his shameful performance against MK Dons for example or anything in preseason? Over the last few years he actually gotten worse.

808~~~
His shameful performance, it was the entire team. It was a makeshift team in which it was his first game back in ages, most of that team aren't even at the  Club now.
Over the last few years he's getting worse, instead of saying it prove it.

809~~~
He's probably the only senior defender to exclusively play in that awful 352 which blatantly confused the shit out of everyone. Not to mention he was usually playing alongside rookie defenders who have made our defence look terrible even when they played in a familiar formation (e.g. Blackett vs Leicester) Bit stupid to make any conclusions based on that small sample of games. 

Last season he had a spell of playing really well. One of only two or three United players you could say that about. Obviously, injury derailed his season but its ridiculous the way this is getting ignore and people have decided he's our worst defender now after a tiny sample of games, in a crappy formation.

810~~~
Don't be ridiculous, why don't you 'prove' he isn't deteriorating, however you do that I don't know. Again you can't pick and choose which games, it was a totally inexperienced back line  and he shouldve lead by example, letting 4 in against a league 1 side isnt shameful?

811~~~
Of course it is, it was a shameful team performance as I have ever seen, but it was a team full of players who had never played together, a team that only had their first shot on target on 70 odd minutes, a team that looked disjointed and unorganised a team full of players who are no longer at the Club or have been loaned out. However, when playing with regular first team players we have only conceded 1 goal when he has played and 9 when he hasn't. (2.5 played, 4.5 missed)

You say it's ridiculous for me to ask you to prove or give legitimate reasons as to why he has 'gotten worse' over the last couple of years. Why? Surely it shouldn't be that hard to prove, right? 
I've gave reasons many times in this thread why I think he is a good player, I'm not going to repeat them over and over again.

812~~~
Yes, a game in which he was the leader, the experienced playing who's job it was to guide the fringe and younger plays through, a game against a league 1 side, LEAGUE ONE, a game in which he was disasterous, but yeah we shouldn't count that when looking at his performances so far...

Please, show me how I can prove that he is accident prone, has been positioning poor, has made several errors in the short time he's played for us. Its funny how your opinion is enough to prove that he's a good player but you won't accept mine without evidence, no? It already appears painfully obvious that the only thing that matters when judging a player to you is their stats.

You've already tried manipulating those stats too, telling me that he has only conceded one goal for us, despite being present when we shipped 4 against MK Dons. You discount that because the players around him were poor but you're happy for him to take credit for his defensive performances in those '2.5 games', funny how you fail to mention the players around him then, you can't have it both ways.

813~~~
Do you even read posts, or just post the same old stuff for the sake of it? Conceding goals in an unorganised team who have never played together, who had most likely had little to no training together always has the potential to go wrong. We didn't get a shot on target until the 70th odd minute, even though we had Welbeck, Hernandez and Januzaj in the team. Obviously Evans has to take some of the blame, if I remember correctly he was at fault for one of the goals but as a team the performance was truly awful.
When he's played with more senior players his performances has been better, he was playing well against Leicester until he got injured, an injury that came about due to a good tackle if I remember correctly. I'm not ignoring the MK Dons game, but when put into perspective you should be able to understand why. It's like saying he conceded 4 in a reserve game so that should count against him, that's the standard of player he had around him a team of players unfamiliar with each other, It's just another stick for those with blinkered vision to hit him with.

I haven't said my opinion is enough to prove he is a good player, again, by failing to properly read my post you missed the part where I said 'I've gave reasons many times in this thread why I think he is a good player, I'm not going to repeat them over and over again'

So a player won't play better with better players around him?

814~~~
Evans and Nani are always scapegoat for some people.
When they can't blame anyone they blame this players.

You will never going to win Evans argument.

815~~~
I know, but what can you do <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

816~~~
The good thing for Northern Irish fans is that once we sell Evans they have McNair to look forward to seeing in a red shirt.

817~~~
Or better yet, Evans AND McNair. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

818~~~
Evans has not been scapegoated. He's actually been shite this season and has looked all over the place.

That's not to say he's not a good player, just a player in bad form.

819~~~
I'm not saying he's been brilliant, but in the league he has played 2.5 games and conceded one goal, hardly shocking stuff.

820~~~
Is McNair World class now?

821~~~
Don't be so idiotic, its MK Dons for feck sake!!!! They play in league 1! We had established internationals playing for us, we shouldn't be losing that game let alone conceding 4! It doesn't take ANYTHING away from the fact he was as absolute horseshit in that game and was directly responsible for at least one of those goals, he should be a shining light playing with lesser players, not worse than them.

"I've gave reasons many times in this thread why I think he is a good player, I'm not going to repeat them over and over again", that's your opinion that youre not willing to share with me yet you want me to PROVE he's been poor, why don't you PROVE to me he hasn't been, understand the difference between proof and opinion yet or perhaps instead of insulating I havent read your post you should have taken a little more time reading mine? If you want me to prove he's been poor, you need to prove he hasnt.

You claim I have blinkered vision when it comes to Evans but I'm willing to judge him on all games played, not just the ones that I fancy. He's become so accident prone of late he's become a complete liability, for me he's now behind Jones, Smalling, McNair and Blackett.

822~~~
Calm down <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

823~~~
Er no....never said that. Maybe he'll at least be dependable.

824~~~
Oh the irony...

825~~~
Yeah, maybe, but I thought we were only after World Class defenders like Vidic, Rio, Southgate and Stam
<span style="color: #ffffff">Joke</span>

826~~~
Where?

827~~~
We should be. I didn't say anything about McNair being a first team regular or being the answer to our problems. With Evans out of the way maybe he or another youth player can go on to replace him as a reliable backup player.

828~~~
Why does a Evans have to be out of the way for that to happen?

829~~~
You need to watch the Burnley game again. Yes, we kept a clean sheet but it wasn't because we defended well. Evans was dreadful in that game and only De Gea's save prevented from repeating what he did against MK Dons. Wasn't much better in the first half against QPR either and put unnecessary pressure on some of our other players with his shoddy passing.

830~~~
Our entire team performance in the Burnley game wasn't great, yes Evans wasn't at his best but he was coming back from a long layoff. Against QPR he had a good game, he stopped a certain goal after a de Gea and a Rojo mix up and was starting to show good form in the Leicester game before that unfortunate injury.

831~~~
Rozay posted coherently about this in the Ron Vlaar thread......

<b>"I wouldn't mind Concrete myself. I don't think we necessarily need a 'World-Class defender'. That is just the result of the short-termists we have become of late and have lost sight of what it takes to build a top side I think. It is panic.

Our league has been full of teams with very good defences for years simply made up of good, organised defences. Tony Pulis doesn't require Mats Hummels to get a team to stop conceding every half an hour, for example. I also think that our defenders are actually good enough anyway, although I do hold question marks re: Evans.

The likes of Demichelis has come into an organised back-four at City and been excellent. Concrete could help us to improve. We are getting the basics wrong at the back at the minute. I reckon the line between a 'world-class centre half' and a 'good' one can be a bit blurry in my opinion anyway. It largeley depends on what team you play for, for starters. I think centre-half is the one position where it is not as simple as taking a world class player out of one team and putting him in another and expecting world class performances. The whole <i>team</i>defends.

I think Rio Ferdinand, for instance, was undoubted world-class. Vidic, however, I think, was certainly a world class player in the end, but not necessarily more talented than Vlaar and in the Villa side may have looked little better. The conditions at United were just right for Nemanja's strengths to blossom, but I do believe that another player in his mould could have probably replaced him competently who may well have spent most of the last decade at Europa League level.

Basically, some <i>teams</i> just know how to defend. We don't right now. I'm more inclined to believe that could be fixed on the training ground (and in the medical centre) as much as it could be in the transfer market. I think Senderos is the worst PL centre-half of recent times (although Mike Williamson is rapidly closing on him), but even he has had excellent international tournaments in the Swiss defence. Materazzi was a nobody struggling at Everton, but in the Inter team he became a CL winner and World Cup winning international regular. Right now, I don't think Hummels would change much. Bringing in Tony Pulis to fix our defence would be more effective, providing he has fit defenders to work with anyway."</b>

Centre-halves more than possibly any other position on the pitch need context when discussing their performances. The unit that they are part of is hugely important. My contention would be that when Jonny has been part of a settled unit, he's been good, outstanding at times. I would like to see him judged when we have settled in to a defensive system that we're happy with, in a partnership that doesn't change from one week to the next. If anyone thinks the solution to all our defensive woes is parachuting Mats Hummels in full-stop, they're kidding themselves.

832~~~
Good post

833~~~
What <a class="username" data-user="45824, @Loublaze" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/45824/">@Loublaze</a> said.

834~~~
Because i'd rather see a promising player get game time than one who has been here for years and who will never fulfill his promise. You gave the 'back from a long lay off' excuse for Evan's recent poor showings. Whether its a valid excuse or not, its still a big problem because Evans is usually coming back from a big layoff. Must we just accept it with this player?

835~~~
Again
Again you failed to answer my question, why do we have to get rid of Evans for this to happen.

836~~~
I asked him so I'll ask you as well, where is the irony?

837~~~
Because there's only a finite amount of minutes available every year.

838~~~
Are you seriously asking this? When Evans makes a full recovery he's probably going to start a few games, but seeing as he's failed to make more than 7 consecutive appearances in the last two years he's probably going to wind up injured again. He'll be back from another lay off, play like shit, you'll make excuses and the cycle will continue. Instead of affording him chance after chance only for him to be disrupted, i'd rather we gave the game time that Evans would other wise get to another player. Simple as that. We're going nowhere with Evans, no progress, zero, zilch! Why delay the inevitable?

839~~~
True, but why do we have to get rid of Evans for a youth player to get games? If he is good enough he will play no matter who is in front of him. You keep going on about Evans not being good enough yet want to replace him with a youth team player who has it all to prove. 
Youth team players break through because they are deemed good enough by the manager, no other reason.

840~~~
Yes I am asking it.
As I said above if the manager thinks a youth team player is good enough he will be promoted to the first team, it doesn't matter what players we move on.  You have still failed to answer the question, the truth is, you can't.

841~~~
<img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

842~~~
Ah ok.

843~~~
You're the one who can't accept the truth that Evans has failed to make the grade here. You simply won't admit to that. You were happy to let Welbeck go but your man Evans has contributed even less than Welbeck in the last couple of years. Hyped up to death by a large section of United fans for years and he's failed to live up to expectations. He'll be the first CB to be sold out of the glass three.

844~~~
He has made the grade here, how has he not? Yes, he may well be sold on but if you're trying to say he's been a flop then you are truly mistaken.
I've said this before and it seems like we are going in circles here, but I'll repeat what I said about Welbeck, he left because he had RVP, Rooney, Falcao, Wilson and Januzaj in front of him, if our CB positions had that sort of talent then of course Evans would be moved on.
Again, you've failed to answer a simple question.

845~~~
He was not this season, but i have seen posts in past where people blaming him for everything.
He only play 3 game (I guess) and its when we are experimenting 3 - 5 - 2 line up where every one look dreadful.

My Point is, he is not he is world class because he never will be, but he deferentially better than some people pointing out right now.

846~~~
Cool.

847~~~
People are frustrated and not just with him but with Smalling and Jones as well. He'll take most of the criticism because a)He's been the worst of the lot this season b)Unlike Smalling and Jones he doesn't have the excuse of being consistently played out of position. 

I don't blame people for being frustrated either. We've been saying for years now that all Evans, Smaling and Jones needed was a good run the in the team. With Rio and Vidic gone they had that chance this season and as expected all 3 get injured at the same bloody time. All 3 of them are useless for us if they can't stay fit.

I haven't followed all the arguments closely but I don't think <a class="username" data-user="45824, @Loublaze" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/45824/">@Loublaze</a> is saying Evans is a bad player. He's just saying that Evans is very much expendable as a player given his recent injury record and that he's not exactly a world class defender that would justify us keeping faith in him despite his injuries and lack of form.

848~~~
How can anyone frustrated of him for 3 games?
Yes he had injuries but I think its only last 2 season. He was well played in past seasons when Rio and Vidic unavailable for play and done good job.

I am not blaming any user not I have follow argument in this thread also, but he is player certainly deserve at-least one more change before we cut loose and sell him.

849~~~
Well at-least in one season he does.
2012-13 Evans total goal - 4
2012-13 Welbeck total goal - 2

<span style="color: #ffffff">Just kidding.</span>

850~~~
Don't think you have to worry about that.

851~~~
Because he's already managed to get injured twice in the opening 3 months..

He'll get a chance. He has this entire season to convince Van Gaal of his fitness and quality.

852~~~
So are you upset with his injuries? or his performance?
Because I was talking about he is been scapegoat for his performance in past season.

853~~~
If we are to buy another centre half, albeit I think there is a dearth of prime, available centre halfs kicking about these days, I think Jonny is the most expendable out of our current group. I still believe in Smalling and Jones very much, and Evans is the oldest, with an injury record that is marginally worse.

Four centre halfs is enough for any club, and that will always remain the case. If players can't stay fit then I think we'll have to look at offloading, or replacing, those who are struggling to be a viable option. With that said, I still strongly believe that our defenders need to build up a tolerance to playing regular football, which could take some time. We'll know more come next summer.

854~~~
Both. And I'm more annoyed that upset.

855~~~
Smalling is likely to be more expendable than Evans. He's still extremely uncomfortable in possession at times despite the fact that he can usually hold his own against big forwards. That is important in the way LvG's teams play. 

As an aside, I've said it before, I think people are basing their opinions on Evans this season entirely on the one MK Dons game, in which he was poor yes, but in his other games he's been nowhere near as bad as people are making out. 

A few weeks ago people were in the Rafael thread saying that we should sell him as he's too injury prone, and some of those people are now in there lauding his last few performances. There is no reason that Evans won't come back strong for the rest of the season. He started 2012/13 injured then was one of our better players in our last title winning season.

856~~~
I'm not suggesting we get rid of our entire defence. I'm suggesting that we should be continuing to try and improve it, to get it back to the level it was at previously. A hard task, but what we should be aiming for.

We may lack world class players in some positions, but players such as Herrera, Blind, Rafael, Shaw and others are undoubtedly very good players and I'd trust most of them to be the main player in their position. I wouldn't be so confident of Evans in that role for us.

857~~~
The players that have never really been good enough are now being exposed and certainly Jonny fits that bill. The defender that can't defend or head the ball when under pressure.  I won't be sorry to see him gone.

858~~~
Excellent post

859~~~
What does that mean, "...are now being exposed"? Now that we're shit? Now that they're injured? Now that we're playing a different system? Now that we're having to play untested youngsters in the backline? The notion that the likes of Evans has never been tested until now is moronic. You don't fancy him as a player, fair enough but the guy's been assuming responsibility since he was 19 and shoring things up for Sunderland. You act as if MK Dons was the first time he's been under a high ball.

860~~~
Shawcross would do a better job for United than Evans. We got rid of the wrong CB. This is not saying Shawcross is more talented than Evans.

861~~~
Shawcross's pass completion record this season is 77%. Last season it was 74%. When a United central defender has one single match with that type of percentage, he gets tons of abuse on here for giving the ball away. Smalling gets a lot of criticism for a lack of composure on the ball. Evans pass completion record is 87% (both this season and last).

Shawcross is not a viable option for a team that wants to play out from the back. It is debatable whether Smalling is and his stats are far superior.

Personally, I'd wait until near the end of the season before making any judgement on our right-footed central defenders; no new contracts, no decisions to sell.

862~~~
Pass percentage is a stat that can be skewed by game style though. If Shawcross is pumping a lot of long balls while Smalling is playing safe 5m passes then you would expect his (Smalling's) pass % to be higher.

863~~~
I would rather play Mcnair over Evans.

864~~~
We all know Stoke were a hoof the ball up team. That has changed under Hughes. Shawcross has played 90 full minutes of every league game Stoke have played this season so far, and he is adapting well to Hughes' open passing game. He was immense against City when Stoke won 1-0 at the Etihad and also against Hull when he scored a late equalizing goal to save a point. He played 37 league games last season and the least he's played in a single season since 2010/11 is 36 games! He'd be waaay more dependable than any of our glass three.

865~~~
Yeah, lets sign a player who isn't good enough because he will be able to play in every game. That isn't a good thing.

If he wasn't ex United we wouldn't even mention him.

866~~~
Yes, lets! Having a decent player who can play whenever he's needed is better than having a very good player who is always on the sidelines due to poor fitness. Al Shawcross would give us better service than our glass three.

If Smalling and Jones weren't United players many people on here wouldn't rate them. Those two have nothing on Shawcross to be honest because they haven't even been properly developed in their natural positions. What have they done to show they are good enough for United? This is their season to finally prove they can fit those shoes and so far they are falling short. Im not saying Shawcross is more talented, but he has vast experience and he is very dependable. All we'd need him to do is play to an acceptable level when we need him.

He could beef up our backline until the summer when we're in a position to actually buy an available top quality CB. Shawcross is a better option in January than Vlaar for me, he already knows what is expected at OT and knows the surroundings in and out. He'd settle in quickly. You don't rate him because of who he plays for, simple as that. He was great against City. Who would you sign in January? Because players like Hummels won't be available.

867~~~
Well that's one thing he has going that the other three don't, why isn't that a good thing again? Frankly speaking we need to have world class first choice defenders that are available to play more often than not and good back up players that are always AVAILABLE when needed. So far Jones, Smalling and Evans are in neither category but then only Jones is young enough to persist with. Always having three senior CBs missing is not healthy and needs to be dealt with swiftly and decisively.

868~~~
If Evans gets slated it's because of the standards he is being judged against. Stam, Bruce, Pallister, Ferdinand, Vidic. No one should make apologies for that. If he wants to be a Manchester United player than that is the calibre of player he must aspire to emulate. He will be 27 in January. He should be establishing himself as the natural leader of the defence. Yet when he plays he is erratic and he doesn't play enough because he picks up injuries like a kid picks up sweeties. 

If Evans were to be sold, would a major team - a team competing at the level this club needs to return to - be interested in him? A Chelsea, or City? Or Bayern Munich. I doubt it. 

Similarly, if they currently played for another side, ask yourself if you'd be putting bunting up and organising a street party because we'd signed Evans (or Smalling). Again, I doubt it.

869~~~
How long have you followed United?

870~~~
My earliest memories are from around 1970 so I would have been five or six. Why? Is that relevant?

871~~~
Then surely you should know that the standard of player you expect our players to become is going to be close to impossible. Players like Ronny Johnsen and Henning Berg were vital to the Clubs long term success, yet were nowhere near the standard you say is required. Does Rafael have to become as good as or better than Neville, or Luke Shaw as good as Dennis Irwin, what about Blind, Herrera, Mata or Rojo?
LVG has said that just because players have the best name, it doesn’t mean that they are the best for the team, and that’s very true. For years Fergie built team after team and always tried to buy the right type of player, it didn’t matter if he wasn’t World Class as long as he fitted into the team.

I’m not talking about Evans in particular, but I’ve read it many times on here about Evans not being as good as Vidic or Rio, who is? However if that stick is going to be thrown at Evans then surely it has to be thrown at the entire team, and let’s face it, we wouldn’t be left with too many players.

872~~~
Given that this thread was specifically about Evans, for what it's worth, of the players you cite, I would rate Ronny Johnsen or Henning Berg as better defenders than Evans. They were positive and aggressive where Evans is often seemingly diffident. 

Johnsen was far better and an ideal foil for Stam. He was moved on because of a chronic knee problem. Similar to Evans he was not fit and available for selection sufficiently often. Although in Johnsen's case the injury was a chronic one as opposed to a succession of knocks, strains and pulls. Johnsen was also versatile and could play in midfield to good effect if required. 

Will Rafael or Shaw be as good as Neville or Irwin? I don't know, however, those are the standards to which they must aspire. Shaw is just 19 so it is far to soon to judge. Rafael 24 and I would say he needs a good season this year.

Extending the argument to the quality of Blind, Herrera, or Rojo doesn't stand close scrutiny, I'm afraid. None of them have been here long enough to make an objective assessment. What I can say is that  Blind is, at 24 already a versatile, technically adept footballer able to cover a variety of roles. That very quality gives him a value beyond just being the best in a given position. He is an improvement on what we had.  Rojo, also 24 has played in a World Cup final. Once he settles properly and, ideally, has a settled partner in defence I believe he can be of the quality we need and, again, will prove to be in improvement on what we had. 

Herrera, in the short time he is been here has already demonstrated his undoubted quality and has surprised me with his physical commitment as well as his technical ability. He is an undoubted improvement on what we had.

So in my view, all of these three bring immediate improvement with the <i>potential </i>for significant further development.

Mata is a bit of an enigma but is, I believe, worth perseverance.

You're right, of course, in that for years SAF built many great teams, however, look at his finest teams. The double winners in 1994. The treble team. The League and European Cup winning side of 2008. All of them were based on a high quality, solid, settled central defensive axis. Our progress back to that standard is compromised by the current quality of, and continual changes in, defensive personnel. At nearly 27, Evans should, by now, have made a convincing case to be part of the next such defensive partnership. I don't believe he has.

873~~~
I'd say Evans is unfortunate in that circumstances have thrust upon him the responsibility to lead this defense. People are so harsh on him because they had higher expectations from him, he has been touted as a future United Captain by the likes of Bruce for crying out loud! He had to stand up this season and, even though injuries aren't his fault, he hasn't. Frankly I'm disappointed thus far and if he can't prove that he can not only play a significant role but also lead that defense then there isn't much point in keeping him. He is too talented and has been earmarked for far too long to descent into the squad role that the likes of JOS had. He really must kick on.

874~~~
Yes the thread is about Evans, however you stated that he must aspire to be as good as or better than Stam, Vidic, Rio, Pallister or Bruce, therefore the same level of expectancy must be applied of all our players, that’s my point, it impossible yet somehow Evans seems to be criticised for it.

According to you Johnsen and Berg should be slated for not being as good or better than Stam etc, in fact I think you said 'no apologies should be made’ for doing so. It doesn’t matter if you or anyone else thinks they contributed to United’s careers, they must be slated. It doesn’t make sense and people use that pathetic excuse as another reason to beat one of our players. A team doesn’t have to be full of superstars for it to work it has to be the right player in accordance to the mangers wishes.
Ok, it’s fair to say it too early to judge our new players but the same can be said for Carrick, Fletcher, Smalling, Jones, RVP, Nani, Rafael, Rooney, in fact nyou could argue that every player in our of our current squad isn’t as good as their predecessors. Nicky Butt, Evra, Berbatov, etc all good players for the Club but nowhere near the level of their predecessors, im surprised we ever won anything in truth.

If we as fans expect every player to emulate our Clubs greats and slate them when they don’t reach that level then we really do have a pathetic bunch of fans. If Evans or another other player gets moved on then yes we have to always try and improve the type of player we bring in, however just because that player doesn’t look as good on the pitch doesn’t mean he’s not better for the team.

875~~~
Yes, losing Vidic and Rio at the same time wasn’t good for the player or the Club, however he has stood up and in truth has been one of our main defenders for a couple of seasons now. Unfortunately Evans seems to be one of those players that some fans love to blame, a good example of this is when some on here blamed him solely for Leicester’s first goal, for me that was beyond laughable.

He hasn’t stood up this season due to injuries, he hasn’t had a run of games nor has he had the chance to regain a bit of match fitness but even then he hasn’t actually been as bad as many have made out. For me he is still our best defender and some tend to have a short or blinkered memory when it comes to him.

876~~~
You've interpreted my initial point absolutely literally  - but then you knew that. Fair enough.

Earlier in this thread, you state; "I'll repeat what I said about Welbeck, he left because he had RVP, Rooney, Falcao, Wilson and Januzaj in front of him, if our CB positions had that sort of talent then of course Evans would be moved on".

Suffice it to say that I support your conclusion regarding Evans. And it's my view that we should be seeking to replace him (and Smalling) with players of comparable defensive ability to the forwards you list.

877~~~
Anyone know if he is back yet?

878~~~
H's still out with foot injury. No mention of expected recovery time

879~~~
Whats actually happened to him? It feels like he's disappeared off the face of the earth this season.

880~~~
He's the player on the team who has spent the most time on the sidelines for the last two years.

881~~~
According to Michael O'Neil, Evans isnt even training yet.

882~~~
Hope its not too long, he's the CB I trust the most based on his previous form. Which reflects poorly on us as whilst he's shown top form he's inconsistent as hell.

883~~~
Source please

884~~~
At least he's alive

885~~~
I wouldn't be wasting my time with football when Helen is waiting at home. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

887~~~
A few days ago a guy on the Norwegian page for United fans referred to him as "the Nesta of Northern Ireland" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

888~~~
According to official site (daily live blog), he will possibly play tomorrow for reserves vs Blackburn.

889~~~
Will he come straight back into the first team once he plays a few reserve games? Assuming we go back to a back four then I am not sure he comes straight back in. He doesn't displace Smalling and McNair has been quite solid.

890~~~
He's two footed so maybe van Gaal will give him the LCB spot.

891~~~
great to have him back although we need an in form jonny evans. he has been very poor this season obviously.

unless he is back to his best i don't think he will replace any of smalling or mcnair anytime soon.

892~~~
Started for reserves no? How did he get on

893~~~
He had a good game but he (and the defenders) were not really tested. I wouldnt start him over Paddy

894~~~
I can see Evans getting the nod over McNair as soon as he's deemed fit enough.

McNair has been great but his wayward passing was a feature of Arsenal's domination in the first 30 minutes, then you had Welbeck leaving him for dead and his contribution to the Giroud goal. He's taken his chance better than any of us (and, presumably, Van Gaal?) dared hope but he's still a kid with a lot of developing to do. Evans is a class above and shouldn't have any bother getting his place back.

If him and Smalling can somehow stay fit long enough to play a run of games together then maybe, just maybe...

895~~~
As soon as Evans is physically fit enough to play in the Premier League then he should be in alongside Smalling. McNair has done well, but Evans alongside Smalling makes for a more experienced back line. They've had some very good games together, too.

896~~~
I'd play McNair. He's earned his chance. Evans has been shocking this season.

897~~~
That opinion will have been massively influenced by him playing in the CC fiasco and generally only getting games as part of the three man defence when absolutely everyone looked shocking at various times behind a porous and ineffective midfield. Stick him back in a familiar formation with Carrick screening the back four and he'll immediately look a far better player. You shouldn't read too much into a very small sample of games.

898~~~
I think he should be starting our games along with Smalling/Jones whoever is available. Rojo, currently, seems very error prone and Evans might bring that experience/calmness in our backline which we have sorely missed. I still think he is the best CB we have currently and a couple of poor games should not make people forget his wonderful performances just over a season ago.

899~~~
Should and will start when fit IMO

900~~~
Exactly.

You don't even need to back to the season before last. He was one of very few players that looked really good last season, until injuries derailed his campaign.

901~~~
Yep, this is first poor run of games in years. Deserves a chance to set it right. The only knock people can justifiably use is his tendency to get injured too often in recent seasons.

902~~~
I'm not even sure he has been THAT bad this season. Apart from that horror show at MK Dons which is probably the worst I've seen him play. Really hoping him and Smalling start this weekend with Blackett and Valencia as fullbacks. Hope it can be the start of an injury free run

903~~~
I agree, many have tried to blame him for mistakes or errors that weren’t even his fault this season. I’ve no idea why he’s hated as much as he is by some, maybe it’s because he’s not Vidic or Rio, saying that not many players are.

904~~~
He was absolutely horrendous, individually, in the CC game to be fair. Spectacularly crap. Will take a few decent performances (which I think he's capable of) to get rid of the stigma from that horror show.

905~~~
It was doubly unfortunate as he came in when we had been having injuries (shock) and he was hopefully going to come in and steady the ship and provide some consistency and reliability. Instead he looked even worse than any of the previous CBs had done.

906~~~
Didn't he then also make that horrendous back pass against Burnley in the game right after MK Dons? Got away with it that time unlike the CC game.

It was his third game in a row with exactly the same mistake including his last pre-season game against Liverpool.

907~~~
He also cleared a certain goal in the QPR game when we were 1-0 up

908~~~
Need him back alongside Smalling if he is fit. He makes a good pairing with Smalling when he is focused and not making stupid mistakes.

909~~~
Let's hope he's remembered how to pass the ball again once he comes back.

910~~~
Also he let Uchoa free for Leicester's first goall.. he was at fault for that goal too..

911~~~
If we're going to play 5 at the back, I'd keep Blackett in there and play Young as the wingback. If it's going to be 4 at the back, maybe play Smalling and Evans in the centre with Blackett at fullback. Bottom line is that, on this season's form, I'd favour Blackett over Evans given the chance (particularly with the 3/5 at the back where Evans looked totally lost and Blackett was quite at home).

912~~~
He was out for quite a while and LVG won't play him if he isn't one hundred percent fit. Maybe 50-60 minutes for a start would do good to avoid risk of another injury.

He needs solid run of games though but sometimes I just think that McNair is a bit better alternative at this point, at least to the time of Rojo's return.

Prove us wrong Jonny.

913~~~
I just hope he can stay fit.

914~~~
If we're doing that Caf thing where every oppo goal is attributed to the defensive mistake of one player, Rojo would have to take the blame for that one.

915~~~
I don't know whats wrong with him, he makes stupid mistakes like that too often. His concentration is shit

916~~~
I blasted him after his sending off against city a few years ago. I said he wasn't good enough. Then I started to watch him a little closer and he went on an amazing run of form  and I saw great he was with the ball and how much he improved defensively. He shut me up completely. He is very good. 

Is he the top ball playing central defender in the British Isles? He's got to be close. Most just hoof. He can really play.

917~~~
Anybody know how many games he started in our ridiculous clean sheet record a few seasons back?

918~~~
Five starts through a streak of 14 matches and 1311 minutes. Always thought the 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in January 2009 vs Drogba and co. was his breakout performance.

919~~~
From what I've seen, both him and Cahill have been a level above every other British & Irish defender in the Isles in terms of their ability on the ball. If have to say who the best is on the ball, I'd have to say Evans given how calm he is on the ball. However, others can argue that Cahill's better and allude to his great strikes and volleys for that.

Still, though, he's one of the top 2 in terms of on-the-ball ability for a defender from the British Isles, at least. Defensively, he's very good as well, though he not the best at players running at him or physically bullying him.

920~~~
Never really rated him, had a brief period a few years ago where he was good but for the most part he's been a liability, when he hasn't been injured,which is most of the time.

921~~~
He has had two excellent seasons since his promotion. That's 2 out of 6 or 7; which is a shame as he has done well whenever he got an uninterrupted injury free run. Always felt that Evans needed a strong leader alongside him to perform at his best.

922~~~
Absolute crap tonight so far, looks half asleep for most things, isn't United quality and needs to be sold this summer.

923~~~
He shouldn't be playing as the middle of the 3. Much better off on the left or the right then he has less defending to do.

924~~~
he is absolutely shocking this season so far.

925~~~
Regular Evans performance.

926~~~
Just got back from a long injury layoff, just cut him some slack.

927~~~
Jesus Christ. He has barely played

928~~~
Another reason to sell him then? He's always injured, when was the last time he actually had a good game though, you just knew that when smelling went down injured and Evans was stripping off we'd concede at least one.

929~~~
I can't wait for the day Jonny Evans isn't even a thing.

930~~~
His last game was against Leicester when he was fit and he was even worse back then, he still miss Rio.

931~~~
Honestly think I must have a blind faith in him because again I don't think he has been terrible at all. The only time we have looked solid this season is with 4 at the back, its obvious to see that the whole defence is exposed in this system

932~~~
Because he's a crock. It's not just bad luck anymore.
He's almost 27 now.I'll say we cut the crap, sell him and get someone who can play consistently for two straight months

933~~~
FFS

934~~~
Evans (is always this smilie for me) = <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Edit: Back from injury or not.....his level is Tottenham

935~~~
You rate him I guess? I'd rather classify him as Newcastle'esque, I doubt he is better than Collocini for example.

936~~~
I just think he's better than Kaboul, Fazio or Chiriches <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

937~~~
I'm sorry but he's not. The Evans we see nowadays wouldn't even make it at Spurs.

938~~~
He looks completely lost in three man defence, he has no idea what to do.

939~~~
He looked a complete retard the way he was spinning in circles with the ball. 

Really bad performance but his first back. Can only get better <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

940~~~
Something he has in common with every CB who's played that formation all season.

941~~~
I like Evans, but he definitely looks the worst, it's like we brought a clown to play(and I repeat, I rate Evans, if you told me one year ago I would compare him with clown, I would call you a clown).

942~~~
Looks unfit, brought the ball out of defence better than any of our other cb's though. I still have huge faith in him, a run of games and he is at least as good as someone like Vlaar.

943~~~
He was okay in the first half and very good defensively in the 2nd. Poor in possession though but that is the same with all of our defenders in this system. I don't think that system will ever work unless Carrick/Blind and Herrera are in midfield to provide options. 

Its painful watching the back 5 playing it round until they either give the ball away trying to pass along the floor or hoof it forward. LVG has to have noticed that this only happens when we havea  back 5. I can just about see why it was played today to protect Valencia/Young but not sure even that worked!

944~~~
I thought he was lucky not to get hooked instead of McNair. He looked completely off the pace from the moment he stepped on to the pitch.

He's barely played football this season, so I'm only expecting him to get better. But, given his inability to stay fit and the fact that he's approaching the end of his twenties, you have to wonder how long we can afford to rely on him in any way before we flog him.

945~~~
He is 26, 27 next month.

946~~~
Very sloppy but 3 at the back sucks anyways

947~~~
My bad, I thought he was an 87-er for some reason. Still, I don't think that does much to the crux of my argument.

948~~~
a nothing player.

949~~~
Christ.

950~~~
don't see what he's got to do with it. He died thousands of years ago.

951~~~
Here we go again <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Some of these posts.

952~~~
Did he?

953~~~
Evans played like he died 1000 years ago.

954~~~
He really was terrible tonight though. Rojo wasn't much better mind and McNair was worse. How we only conceded one I'll never know.

955~~~
He's a little lightweight compared to the best CBs. He's very good with the ball and carrying the ball out of defense, even whilst a little rusty today. He struggles with both fast and strong players though, which is a bit alarming. I'm not convinced he's the way forward, but he's more than a decent option to have.

956~~~
DDG!

957~~~
Pretty crucial attribute when you're a LVG team, something most of our other cb's lack.

958~~~
No doubt, but I do like our CBs to be excellent at the defending bit as well, and he does struggle against too many different types of players. He's very good with the ball though, no doubt. His long passing is excellent and he runs with the ball very well.

959~~~
Didn't understand why he didn't play Rojo left back and Evans centre half in a 4.

960~~~
Evans doing well in putting himself in the window for a move to Villa or Hull! feck me he was dreadful again.

961~~~
His usual shit start from injury.

962~~~
Calm down. Just got back from injury and got thrown in a game with a formation that the defense is uncomfortable with.

963~~~
He was sh*t again tonight. End of story. I hope to god that Smalling's injury isn't serious.

964~~~
He should be sold to a club like Hull, that's his level. Cant understand how some rate him, was good years ago but terrible since, 27 and extremely injury prone.

965~~~
I'm calm I'm just saying the guy has been shite all season but at least he has been consistent with it!

966~~~
Poor game but he will have to play sunday so hopefully he can improve, don't see him being here next season because of his injury record though.

967~~~
I will let him off because it was his first game back against a good Southampton side, <i>but </i>he would be the first one I cut loose. He hasn't been good enough all season. Worse than that actually, he has been very poor.

968~~~
He's lucky he's had Vidic and Ferdinand around for the majority of his career.

He's woeful. If he hadn't came through our academy most on here would of wanted rid a while back.

969~~~
Well, he has been injured for the most of it. He has always looked better when he has had a consisten run in the team. 

The million dollar question is can he stay fit to get a consistent run. I think we need to assess Smalling and Evans at the end of season, or may be January, and take a call on their long-term futures at the club. This defensive musical chairs cannot continue if we have ambitions to win titles and trophies.

970~~~
He was doing that really annoying thing he sometimes does where he dummys it about 5 times before deciding to kick it, and then it's too late and he's been closed down or the ball's rolled out of play. Why does he keep doing that?

971~~~
The big question is "is he good enough" under LVG out of Jones Rojo Smalling and Evans. Evans has easily been the worst performer and the one who looks most likely to be shipped out.

972~~~
My first reaction when I saw him being readied was is there no one else? I think I'd rather have Blackett play than him.

973~~~
Wonder how long we'll last with him not getting injured. Hopefully Jones comes back by the time he inevitably gets an injury, and the smalling is back by the time Jones gets injured. It's all a cycle really, and they'll all get their chances but ultimately not take them because they all get injured. 

On Evans' actual performance, he defended decently enough, was very nervy on the ball though. Visibly rusty out there but this result will do him a world of good IMO (so long as he stays fit).

974~~~
On the pre-season tour I thought he looked the most uncomfortable with the back 3 of all our CB's and that was clear again tonight, obviously he's not fully match fit but he looked so uneasy on the ball and having to run about laterally so much.

975~~~
Was he really that bad?  I thought he improved once he was properly warmed up.  Rojo was the one I thought looked out of it.

976~~~
I agree with this roughly.

I didn't think he was that bad tonight mind you, but as our most experienced defender he needs to be a leader. The fact that we had to push Carrick back to marshal the defence was not a good sign for Evans. I expect he will be the first to go of our current crop of defenders.

977~~~
Yeah at this point I think we need to just 'Wes Brown' him and cut our ties, same applies to one of the Jones / Smalling duo. Said it at the start of the season and nothing is convincing me otherwise.

978~~~
He is skating on very thin ice, really. It was another really poor performance, and it won't be long before he's out through another injury.

979~~~
I think the age is the key part. A few years back there was an argument that he was gradually coming into his own and would be a top player. But he's 27, and still fairly good at his best, but has been playing poorly this season.

Honestly, while he was excellent around 2012, I think he's always hugely benefited from having a player like Rio or Vidic beside him. Not that he is awful without them, but I think having a top defender alongside him arguably made him look a bit better than he really is.

980~~~
One of the biggest disappointments for me this year. I'd liked to see him shipped out at this point even if I was a huge fan of his coming through the ranks.

981~~~
Was dogshit.....again.

982~~~
Not a big fan, I'll be honest. Seems shakey and not up for the pressure of playing for United.

983~~~
Going by the reactions, you would think he gave away two penalties, scored an own goal and got sent off. Bloody hell <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

984~~~
No he wasn't, but if you wanna be in the cool gang you gave to slag him off.

985~~~
Er, you do realise he gave away a corner.

986~~~
Some of the reactions in here are OTT. It's his first game back after 2 months of injury, cut him some slack.

I think he will be back to his best if we get a leader like Godin or Hummels at the back. He did really well beside Rio/Vidic a few years ago, maybe that's just how he is. He is kind of like Piqué in that regard - needs a leader like Puyol to perform optimally.

987~~~
Returning from injury or not he absolutely cacks himself on the ball these days. Should be leading on the pitch but he simply doesn't have it.

Gone at the end of the season.

988~~~
I gave up on him a long time ago, he's not that good and he's very bad when the team is under sustained pressure.

989~~~
First off, people are not judging him only on this match, but on the season as a whole. Everytime he has played he has been terrible.

And if he needs a leader to play properly, then he doesn't need to start for Manchester United.

990~~~
First off, he hasnt had a chance to get going this season, how can people not see that? Nor has he been terrible.
He plays better beside a Vidic type player, shoot the cnut <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

991~~~
He had a chance. In the friendlies and then in the first matches here before he got injured and he did absolutely nothing. I don't know why you keep defending him. Even when he had Rio and Vidic behind him, he still made frequent errors.

Second, well, he shouldn't need a leader to perform, he should be able to perform at all times, if he wants to play at a club like United. Also, he isn't even that good when he has one. 

Smalling or Jones at least play relatively well when they are not injured, too bad they can't manage to stay fit, Evans on the other hand gets injured almost every match and plays shit every match.

992~~~
feck me, Getsme is still defending Evans. He's been beyond terible this season.

993~~~
Exactly this. That is the difference this season between Evans and the other two and why I would get rid of him first.

994~~~
I’m defending him because he doesn’t deserve all the abuse he gets on here, it’s pathetic. Even when he has a good game or makes a fantastic tackle or clearance he still gets criticised or his efforts are ignored as it doesn’t fit in with some posters agenda.

Everyone performs better with a leader beside them, Rio, wasn’t a leader but played so much better beside Vidic, Keane was a leader and all players played better when he was in the team, same for Robson, Cantona, Schmeichel, Stam in fact the one thing our present team is missing is a leader, should we sell everyone?

You have no foundation for your criticism of Evans, your last paragraph illustrates that clearly.



I’m not defending his performances this season, in fact my rating for him this season is 0.1 higher than the average. I’m defending him as a player as he gets unfair and quite frankly bizarre abuse on here. Those saying he was the worst player on the park last night backs up my belief that some poster don’t even watch the games and join the bandwagon to fit in with the crowd.

995~~~
On the season as a whole? He's barely played. I agree that he's been poor so far, but doesn't he deserve a chance to change that impression?

And it's not uncommon that a player needs a leader beside him to play well. Look at Cahill and Miranda for example. They look lost without their respective partners who happen to be leaders.

996~~~
Season as a whole? fecking hell thats hilarious. He played what 3-4 games at the start of the season in August-September. Last night was his first game back in nearly 3 months FFS.

Looks like Evans has became the Caf's new scapegoat now that Cleverley has left. Considering he was out for 3 months and had to come on earlier than planned and play in a back 3 which so far none of our defenders have looked comfortable playing in i thought he did alright.

Baffling OTT reactions to a half decent performance. Some seem to have developed an irrational hatred towards Evans for reasons unknown.

997~~~
Not a fan of him at all but he wasn't half as bad as some of you are making it out to be considering he was out a very long time and only played for the u21s. 
Puts an end to the theory that playing for our youth can get you back into form though.

998~~~
True. Helps with fitness but still a massive adjustment when you step up to the first team. The reserves league has got so young it's become almost useless as a way to get up to speed for senior football. 

Agree Evans wasn't terrible last night. Not good but not awful. A victim of our absurd formation, along with almost everyone else. 

Haters gonna hate though...

999~~~
He's only been terrible in one game this season and that was against MK Dons. Other than that, he's done a decent job but the problem this season hasn't even been his defending. It's been his passing. He has played a couple of suicidal passes in each game he's played in the league which is a major concern. He's developed this annoying habit of dwelling on the ball and under hitting passes, which is surprising considering he's usually one of our most composed players on the ball.

1000~~~
It's because he's only ever played in the 352. Where all our players blatantly have no idea where their team-mates will be at any given moment. Considering Van Gaal's reputation as a coach, we look worryingly unprepared for that formation. Each game we play 352 it looks as though everyone is making it up as they go along.

1001~~~
He wasn't dire today considering it was his first apperance in months, but I just can't see him moving up a level at his age and the fact he seems to get injured so frequently.

I never was a fan of him when he broke through the first team, and nothing has changed my mind since. He has put in good performances here and there around 2012 but he is not close to what you would call a top top defender, which is what we should be looking for. 

He also just tends to have a lot more brain farts than other CB's around him and I never feel comfortable for our defence when he is on the pitch.

1002~~~
I honestly think I have a blind spot with Evans because I didn't think he was bad last night. Can someone point out some ocassions of this terrible defending from last night? He defended well in the 2nd half and the only time I found myself shouting at him was when he was giving the ball away. But quite frankly, Evans' ability on the ball is the last thing that worries me, he is our best ball playing CB by a distance.

1003~~~
I would keep him at the club purely to keep seeing Helen on MUTV <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1004~~~
What agenda? I don't have any, I just see it as it is and the fact of the matter is that Jonny Evans is simply not good enough for this team. At least, if he managed to stay fit regularly, then maybe he could have become a decent bench player, but now? Just sell him and be done with it. He can't keep fit and his performances this year have been absolutely terrible and last year they were below average. Now you tell me what exactly does he do for us that we should keep him? Buy Godin and hope Jonny Evans suddenly becomes a good defender? Hope that he will play consistently? I don't know about you, but I don't see any of that happening.

And what exactly did he do in those games? Absolutely nothing. Not to mention his mistakes cost us number of times. He is not a scapegoat, he is just being judged as any other player who has not played well. Has Tom Cleverley ever played well? No, which is exactly why he was criticized constantly and it was fair, whether he likes it or not. No player should be immune to criticism.

And I repeat, I do not hate Evans, I just don't think he is good enough for a club of our stature and he is a crock.

1005~~~
As soon as we bring in any quality defender the bloke will be shipped out to Hull or somewhere.

1006~~~
He’s been in this team for several seasons now, you seem to be criticising him without any evidence to back it up, saying he’s shit 1000 times doesn’t make it true. His past mistakes are referenced as if they happened yesterday, if he makes a mistake in the game it’s the worst thing to ever happen to the Club, he is even blamed for mistakes that weren’t his fault, it’s a joke. The best I’ve heard this season is Evans was at fault for Leicester’s first goal. Despite the fact our defence has looked better with Evans in it some still refuse to give him any credit whatsoever.

Believe it or not he has performed to a high level consistently for the Club which I have proven many times in this thread. For example he was in the team of the knock out stages in last year’s Champions league, he was a front runner to be named Captain this season and LVG has praised his ability at bringing the ball out from the back. Then I could go on about his clean sheet record when him, VDS, and Vidic were the only three who played in all games, or the fact that he Ferdinand formed a partnership that helped United's title bid during Fergies last year.

During the 2012/13 season with Rio and Evans in central defence we won 13 of 17 games, only losing two, in which Fergie Said “he (Evans) is arguably the best defender in the country"


Simply put he’s not a shit player, are there better players out there? Of course but there are better players out there for all our positions.

1007~~~
He'll be 27 in a month and it doesn't look like he has matured into a defender we thought he could be. He's not some sort of a youngster who still has time on his hands, van Gaal will be ruthless at the end of season and if Evans cannot deliver (and so far he's been poor when he played) he is more likely to be shipped than McNair and Blackett who are considerably younger and still have time to develop, or Smalling who has been much better than him. I keep forgetting Jones exists.

1008~~~
I think you would be surprised at the calibre of clubs that would be interested in him if we ever decided to sell.

1009~~~
Would he get in any top four side? I doubt it. Maybe Everton but no higher.

1010~~~
26/27 is still young for a CB. Cahill was still at Bolton when he was this age. Look how much he's improved since then.

You said he has been terrible this season as a whole, 3-5 games hardly constitute a season do they? He did nothing did he, fair enough he wasn't great but i don't know if you noticed but all but one of his games this season he has played in a back 3. How many of our other defenders have excelled when asked to play in this formation? Answer none.


Makes mistakes how dare he, only perfect defenders are good enough for United then? Yeah the perfect defender doesn't exist. Lets face facts even Vidic, Ferdinand, Stam etc. in their pomp made mistakes every defender does. Evans makes more than those 3 its true but then hes not as good as them and never will be which is no shame given how good the others were. Evans biggest crime in some peoples eyes as far as i can tell is thats hes not Rio Ferdinand in his prime. He seems to come in for way more criticism than either Jones or Smalling despite those two having injury records as bad. And neither being brilliant either Jones especially who has been very poor in his time at United. 

People need to accept Evans for what he is a good defender nothing more. When fit and given a run to get his sharpness back hes a very good defender. People keep banging on about this mythical world class CB we need, but how many are around? Even if we get one are we going to play him on his own? Because as hard as it will be to find one i doubt we can find 3-4 which is how many Defenders we need for an average season. Evans is an Academy produced player capable of a fairly high level of play who will be happy not being a first team player. He will be great back up if we eventually sign a world class CB, he can be a solid squad member just like O'Shea, Neville, Butt and Fletcher have been in the past.

To listen to some of the hysterical ranting in this thread after last nights game you would think we were talking about a William Prunier horror show performance. He wasn't even that bad FFS.

1012~~~
He annoys me. A lot. The amount of time he takes to release the ball drives me mad.

1013~~~
He is just coming into a defender's prime age, he was a fantastic understudy to Rio and Vidic during our most recent glory years, deputising in important European matches and performing at the highest level. I wonder if some of you have forgotten that. If we can get him match-fit I think he can be a big part of LVG's tenure at Utd.

1014~~~
Pretty much, though he did play a couple of poor passes when we played 442 diamond earlier this season. I don't think he's as bad as some have made him out to be this season. His defending has generally been solid, though he hasn't been tested much. But it's awful passes like the Burnley and QPR ones - and his awful display against MK Dons - which have had too much of an impact on peoples' opinions. 

Ultimately that doesn't account for much because he's not been fit for most of this season, but I do think he can perform at a good level for us. And the hysteria in this thread has become tedious and predictable.

1015~~~
See I disagree completely, for me he looked the part because he was paired with them. Some on here portray him as a ball playing defender yet in recent years he's distributing has been terrible and often plays hospital balls to teammates. For me if we want to truly get to the level we want we have to replace the likes of Jonny for better quality.

1016~~~
Absolute reactionary bollox.

He's 100% is a ball playing centre half and his distribution has been nowhere near terrible. The stats back this up.

Has there been problems with other aspects of his game? Of course there has, but his ability to pass a football certainly wasn't/ isn't one of them.

1017~~~
Difference of opinions, I believe we have to upgrade on this, other's don't.

1018~~~
Its more than that though. Sums up a lot of the nonsense in this thread of late.

You said his distribution has been terrible in recent years. Its hardly a difference of opinion when the stats prove this simply isn't true.

I get people don't like him but making stuff up doesn't aid sensible debate

1019~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1020~~~
He's been an accident waiting to happen this season. He made a terrible pass yesterday which led to the Shane Long chance. He made another terrible pass which led to a goal in the Carling cup debacle and he also made another in the game right after that. That's 3 I can remember on the top of my head and he's barely played this season!

I definitely  wouldn't complain if he was sold at the end of the season.

1021~~~
When you look at his average rating on there it shows just how underrated Evans is on here.

1022~~~
Has he played in a back 4 yet this season? I think the 4-0 against QPR and started the Leicester City game before being brought off at 2-1? 

Clearly doesn't suit a back 5. Not sure any of them do but Evans particularly seems to struggle. Was generally a very good distributor of the ball in the past but it's been so casual and ridden with mistakes this season. Confidence likely to do with it too but he was very stop/start for us in the past too.

1023~~~
So he's made one bad pass in a cup game playing alongside unfamiliar players after a long injury layoff, he then made a bad pass against QPR which didn't result in a goal, let's not forget he stopped a certain goal after a De Gea and Rojo blunder when the we were winning 1-0 in that game. Then he made a bad pass last night, correct me if I'm wrong but I think we made several bad passes last night, including one from Fellaini which actually lead to a goal.

1024~~~
‘There’s a difference between being fit and being match fit’. LVG.

I think that he was sloppy at times yesterday because he wasn’t match fit. When you’re out such a long time (since September) you have to play 4-5 games to be better, and he’ll need time to be solid again. I think that yesterday, he tried too much to force his nature and stick with the ‘PHILOSOPHY’. He could have kick the ball a lot of time, but always tried to play a good pass. Yeah he missed few, but he wasn’t really helped by Fellaini or Valencia. So it wasn’t really his fault.

I always thought that from Smalling, Jones and him, he was the best defender. He has experience now and played some terrific games next to Vidic and Rio at times. He has been unnoticed because his partners were monsters, but during our last winning campaign, he was absolutely great.

I hope that we can build his fitness enough for Pool this Sunday

1025~~~
Whoscored isnt the greatest source in the world to get objective stats from.

It crucifies just as many top players as it elevates shit ones.

1026~~~
Sell him, dont care

1027~~~
Put him in a back 4. He isn't very adaptable and struggles in the 352, so can others but the likes of Smalling and Rojo have the pace to run themselves out of trouble when on the ball.

1028~~~
Yes Barca have room for another crock, him and Vermaelen will be the perfect CB pairing in the physioroom.

1029~~~
It's a reoccurring theme with Evans and its a major problem if you're the last man and giving the ball away. Coming back from injury is a poor excuse for making bad decisions. I thought he could go to become a top defender a few years back but he still has too many mistakes in him. 

Yes Fellani did make a bad pass and most of understand he's not good enough to be playing even though he has done well in the last few weeks.

1030~~~
Rojo gave the ball away in really dangerous positions. Young made a similar awful pass as Fellaini.

1031~~~
And still you wouldn't expect that from a CB that has played that many games for us already. He is the most experienced CB we have atm. He is still very prone to those mistakes sadly

1032~~~
Every player takes time to get back to their best after injuries, even Messi. With the exception of RVP everyone made terrible passes yesterday, what was there excuse? Rojo, Fellaini, McNair, Mata, Rooney, Young, Valencia, Herrera, Smalling, Carrick all made terrible passes in dangerous areas.
The unfair bashing Evans gets in here is why I feel I have to come in here and defend him all the time.

1033~~~
He made one bad pass. I am sure we can actually put that down to being a bit rusty. Let's see if he can recapture his form that made him our #1 CB last season and the one before that.

1034~~~
LvG didn't help him last night by putting him into the back 3 instead of leaving Carrick in midfield and reverting to a back 4. I am far from convinced Evans is going to be here come the start of next season but he has a few starts coming up with Smalling injured again and Jones still out, to make a case for himself with LvG.

1035~~~
He didn't show any of that in his games this season, it's more than just rusty, he looks completely empty and is showing no signs of any self-confidence . If he continues to find his form at this rate we might as well sell him.

1036~~~
It's not one bad pass. He's done it multiple times in really bad area's. Everyone 
It's not unfair bashing. He's done it so many times that it becomes a concern. Fair enough everyone loses the ball on occasions but you can't do it when you the last line of defence. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsIFGejLMWg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

That first goal is a perfect example of why he is getting criticism. He has done something similar to that atleast 3 times this season, which is totally unacceptable.

1037~~~
He wasn't as bad as most make him. Considering he just came back from a long layoff, he actually had a good game. Yes, he messed up a few passes, but everyone did that yesterday - the reason was the aggressive pressing.

1038~~~
Sorry, but that's bollocks. Evans has been blamed many many times for goals conceded that either wasn’t his fault or ones he could do nothing about, using a few bad passes as a bat to beat him with is a fine example of that.

I’ve heard people bring up the Dons game time and time again yet seem to conveniently forget all the good he has done this season, or choose to accept it in case they have to admit he’s not as shit as they want to believe. Even the great Vidic, Rio and Stam made plenty of mistakes and it was brushed off as they were fan favourites, when a scapegoat makes the tiniest mistake people want his balls on a plate.

1039~~~
At present we are using a rotation system, where defenders are played if they are fit. This is the only requirement. We can't choose who we play.
Its got so bad, that yesterday Carrick was being played in defence.
We cannot sell any of our defenders. In fact, we need to buy more (squad) defenders, to ensure that we have enough defenders to play a game.

Imagine what would've happened this year, if we were in the CL?
We would probably end up fielding 3 midfielders in defence, in some of games.

1040~~~
I think that the main problem is that while Evans looked very good when he played with a great defender (Rio or Vidic), he never convinced me when he was the most senior defender. Now that those two are gone, Evans looks not that good. I hope that he can improve this season, otherwise it might be the last season for him here.

1041~~~
I think I have forgot, I haven't seen him play consistently well in a long time! All I said was I wouldn't be sad If he was sold and I think that's a fair comment. He's not a top class defender.

1042~~~
He's done enough for us in the past to be allowed at least until the end of the season to show his form. Bar that season when Carlton Cole was dragging him around he's rarely had a bad patch of games. It'd be 1 bad game in 10 or similar. This season's been dissimilar to that aforementioned season because his passing was fine then but his defending was atrocious. Opposites this season and it's shown because those bad passes are in dangerous positions.

1043~~~
Not because they were fan favourites but probably something to do with the fact that they were world class and 4x better than Evans will ever be.... Honestly, if they had the level of defending that Evans has, no one would be brushing it off.

1044~~~
He has been the most injury prone last 2 seasons out of the 3 CB's. Plus when he gets injured usually it takes time for him to get going.

Also, he is the most senior defender in the squad now and been here for years. He should be showing leadership now and helping others but doesn't seem a leader even the U21s really.


If we have to chop one of the CB's becoming tough to argue why it shouldn't be him.

1045~~~
Thought he was our best defender at the start of the season, but he was shocking every single game he's played.

1046~~~
He played like 3 games and 30 minutes. Burnley game he made 2 poor errors and was lucky to get away, in Leicester 30 minutes he was Ordinary including his lack of aerial defending for their first goal. And as for MK dons well less said the better......

The only decent game he's had this season been vs QPR. 

Tbf he doesn't seem suited to a back 3 at all but still been poor.


Jones was by our best defender by a distance start of the season before he injured himself for England.

1047~~~
I think he was talking in general and his opinion has changed during this season, I'm the same. I thought Evans is still our best defender at the start of the season, but he isn't backing it up.

1048~~~
Ah my bad. Misunderstood that <a class="username" data-user="69865, @ottosec" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69865/">@ottosec</a> post.

1049~~~
I've spent my few years on the caf disagreeing with people who say this, but... he needs to bulk up. A lot.

He's lacking in confidence at the moment so he's not looking that great on the ball, but we know when he's in form that's a real strength for him, and not something to worry about.

But no matter how good his feet are he will never be good enough to regularly start for us if he can't start winning headers and holding off physical pressure from strikers. Pelle was winning every aerial ball that came near him on Monday, no matter how much they appeared to favour Evans or Rojo. The contrast with Smalling, who over the last few games has been really dominant in the air, comfortably winning almost everything, was shocking.

1050~~~
Some of the posts in here are shocking.

1051~~~
Upcoming game may be a massive test under pressure for him but we can't even be sure of that because Louie may play Carrick-Rojo combo, again. If he can put some refreshing performances like Smalling did not so long ago then there's a light in the tunnel for something close to stable season for him.

It's up to the player to take the chances created by a manager and Louie already proved he can seriously shake things up in one month so let's not be surprised of possible outcomes.

1052~~~
Jonny Evans struggled against Pelle's strength and frequently tried to back off of him. In the box, when trying to aerially challenge him, he struggled with it and lost many aerial challenges against him. It's quite obvious that he still struggles with physically strong forwards who bully him.

Other than that, though, once he moved to the right side and away from Pelle, he seemed more settled. He was more composed, and he dealt with Mane well. He took nice defensive positions, and helped Valencia massively on the right side. Still, though, the fact that he struggles against big, strong forwards like Pelle is quite worrying. I thought he'd have fixed this issue, but he still has problems against such players.

1053~~~
Said this myself. He is a good defender, but he undoubtedly benefited massively in having top quality players beside him.

1054~~~
What the hell is wrong with him? That's like the 3rd or 4th time he's done that this season.

1055~~~
Such a terrible defender and not a ball playing defender at any means, has made more ball playing mistakes this season than Smalling all his career.

1056~~~
Genuinely think it's been more than that. Did he not have four shocking passes combined against Burnley and QPR?

1057~~~
One against MK and one against Burnley and now this one. Couple of near misses against QPR I think .I would have had him down as our best ball playing CB before this season but he's been shocking.

1058~~~
Incredibly error-prone. He's an awful defender and needs to get kicked out of here.

1059~~~
He needs to stop passing back. Surprised we haven't conceded a goal yet from it.

1060~~~
Shocking performance..

1061~~~
Doesn't seem to do very well in a back three. He's been our worst player today.

1062~~~
Poor performance. Doesn't suit a back three at all. He seems to have lost his composure on the ball and his awareness off the ball today was horrible.

1063~~~
Gives away a golden chance every game. We need a top centre half to come in and with Smalling Rojo and Jones all appearing to be ahead of him. He's looking like the one who will get sold.

1064~~~
It was painful watching him today. Hope its the rustiness but jesus christ, all over the place with his passing. Something he was best at among our CBs

1065~~~
absolute shite all season, every week the same. Wouldnt look out of place in that Liverpool defence.

1066~~~
I was defending him then this. Idiot. Could have ruined the day. Him and Jones are a calamity waiting to happen. Smalling and Rojo please.

1067~~~
People here who were defending him. Jesus, he is absolutely terrible. It's not about the back 3 only, he is just terrible. Constant mistakes on the ball and off the ball. As I said last time, Jones and Smalling may get injured a lot, but at least they play decently well when they play. Evans not only does he get injured all the time, but when he plays he is horrendous. Doubt he will be good for Newcastle really.

1068~~~
He was shit today. Really shit. Misplaced passes, not getting into the challenges properly.

1069~~~
I wouldn't even be much more convinced by them at the moment, but yeah, he was certainly poor today.

1070~~~
Evans being Evans.

He isn't playing any better of worse than he has ever done.

1071~~~
Worth pointing out that he started the attack for the third. Still he's nowhere near his best or where he needs to be to have a future with us.

1072~~~
He looks absolutely awful. Nothing good about him this season.

1073~~~
Dire. Really gave me a heart attack every time he touched the ball

1074~~~
Really depressing how bad he's been lately. I remember he gave away the first goal in the 4-0 MK Dons defeat too. Is he just not accustomed to LVGs plans or has he really just turned crap?

Compare that to Jones' first game back and he was winning tackles and defending everything.

1075~~~
Annoying player. I hope our other defenders come back soon because I never want to see him starting again.

1076~~~
He's easily the least gifted defender of the senior defenders we have at the club, but with his age and experience you'd just hope at the very least he wouldn't make such stupid mistakes.

1077~~~
Sometimes he's like a classy passing defender. Days like this he's erratic with the ball. Defensively grew into the game. Handled the one on ones very well.

1078~~~
He was a lot better than this in 2011/2012, although I suspect having top defenders alongside him did enhance his game to a certain extent.

1079~~~
If he keeps this up I'd sell him at the end of the season. He's consistently causing us problems and has been all season.

Hopefully it's just a form issue mind.

1080~~~
Not great today but no one at the back was, we desperately need a settled back four.

1081~~~
Give him time, give him time he's still a little ring rusty and lacking in confidence... don't throw him to the hounds yet he'll turn things around.

1082~~~
A lot.

He has always been shaky.

1083~~~
He was quite clearly the worst. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1084~~~
<a class="username" data-user="71720, @Getsme" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/71720/">@Getsme</a> are you Northern Irish?

1085~~~
I think he was definitely a <i>good </i>defender at his best, although he did struggle in games when he was put under a lot of pressure admittedly. I hope he can find some better form again, but I have little confidence in him to lead the line for us.

1086~~~
Reaffirms what I was saying earlier in the week. He always have a mistake in him.

1087~~~
He's looked clueless on the ball in the last two games playing this system. I still can't figure it out if it's his lack of vision/composure or he just has no one to pass to.

1088~~~
Even then, it's not really a good excuse. Other defenders performing poorly or an unsettled defence doesn't really compensate for the basic errors Evans is making and how incredibly shaky he looks.

1089~~~
Evans was awful today. Needs more games in the reserves.

1090~~~
His passing has degraded, from being out best passer out 2 or so years ago, confidence low.

1091~~~
Probably the worst player on the pitch today. Our defence was a complete mess and that was largely down to him.

1092~~~
Jones was pretty poor today.

1093~~~
Evans had to correct Van Gaal when he said it was an English defence today. To be honest, Van Gaal wasn't wrong in the first place.

I'll admit Jones wasn't great but Evans was just awful. Get the impression Jones got rushed back after Rojo's injury.

1094~~~
He is the Wes Brown of defending when he comes back from injury. Needs around 5-6 games to pick up form. Always comes back like a pub player.

1095~~~
4th choice cb here.

1096~~~
Before the game I was happy he played instead of poor Rojo today. I take that back, he's just not good enough.

1097~~~
Jones was miles better than Evans.

1098~~~
Think we'll bring someone in at least in the summer and Evans will  be sold.

1099~~~
He'll come good, he just needs a run of games before he finds his feet. It's always been the same with him. 

He's got competition mind you

1100~~~
It was just always so painfully obvious he's the weakest defender. He's not quick, he's been dominated by physical strikers before and he's not as a cleaner tackler as a Jones or a Smalling. So people made up some bull shit about him being a much better leader (strangely enough a leadership quality which only shows up when he's partnered by veterans like Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic) and being Beckenbauer on the ball.

1101~~~
He really wasn't, unless you think the six or seven decent chances Liverpool had where all the fault of Evans. The fact De Gea won MOTM should tell you that we were terrible defensively. We gave away stupid balls in midfield which put added pressure on the back three, which never helps. So many on here underestimate the importance of having a consistent back line, we haven't had the same back four once this season, we have to give credit to the fact we have nearly as good a record as Chelsea in defence.

1102~~~
Isn't Wes Brown a defender?

1103~~~
That ball to Carrick which led to the one on one was shocking. I used to be in Evans camp but really think since 2012 his fall from grace has been unreal. There was a time when i wanted him to start a head of Rio but now id rather see Rojo there than him

1104~~~
There were three times I thought, Jonny, what are you doing? I never once thought the same about Jones. Every time Evans got the ball and passed, I was dreading the outcome. Never felt any dread with Jones.

1105~~~
Jonny looks like a different player from two years ago. I guess injuries haven't helped, but his distribution, which used to be his strong point has not been great.

He's just got back from an injury so I can't be too harsh, but if all defenders our fit, I can't see him starting, in my opinion. He lacks pace big time as well.

1106~~~
He's 27 in a couple of weeks. If he is not good enough to be first choice (and I don't think he is, either in absolute terms or in comparative terms relative to the best United defenders of the recent past), then it's time for him to move on.

1107~~~
He's Johny Evans.

1108~~~
He must have been studying Fonte last week, with that pass that put Sterling through. Remember when we thought that he was the footballing CB that LVG was going to like? Where did that guy go, and who is this guy who ends a game with 70% pass completion?

1109~~~
I said in the post game thread he is our only player that is still in Moyes mode. Looks like he is really lacking in confidence and can't pass a simple ball. Hopefully he gets it back soon and is a bit more composed with the ball at his feet because we could do with him playing like he did a couple of years ago. It's funny what confidence does with a player because I remember thinking I wouldn't swap him for anyone at one point in his career. This season he's probably looked our worst player.

1110~~~
Awful player

1111~~~
I still think THAT Jonny will make an appearance. These damn injuries though!

1112~~~
He's lost the fecking plot this season with the ball at his feet. What is he playing at?

1113~~~
The back 3 suits him less than any of our other CB's, but he just looks hopeless in general.

1114~~~
Shouldn't be starting ahead of McNair or Blackett. Awful again.

1115~~~
If we have to sell on of our CB's which we will have to in order to bring a new one then his head should be on chopping block first.

1116~~~
Said it a few days or a week ago on this thread and i'll say it again...never rated him. He's incredibly error prone and that is unforgivable considering he is the senior CB at the club. If he didn't come from the academy, then he wouldn't have a sniff of a chance for the first team squad.

1117~~~
At this point I'd be comfortable with Rojo or even McNair starting ahead of him.

1118~~~
Playing in a back 3 is no excuse for passing the ball to the opposition multiple times with only half a season gone.

1119~~~
Him and Jones need to stay healthy. They both looked out of it mostly because they have just started playing regularly again. They were both all over the place today.

1120~~~
I've always rated him lower than Smalling/Jones but I'd have him lower than Rojo as well now. If he plays like he did today then McNair and Blackett are better options as well.

Comfortably our worst player today.

1121~~~
That back pass for when sterling nearly scored was completely needless and nearly cost us massively. I don't unferstand why they keep going backwards?.

Is it really beyond any of our defenders to travel up the pitch with the ball if a pass isn't open?. They often just shrug off responsibility and would rather lose possession by a long kick.

1122~~~
The thing that annoys me about the backpass is they turn around to pass it to De Gea and then dont offer themselves for a pass thus its De Gea who ends up booting it up field. Instead of the defenders do it, if they screw up, at least they are still there to recover.

He needs a leader next to him, like Rio.

1123~~~
jonny jonny. comfortably our worst defender this season. 

like someone said we need a world class CB and smalling, rojo and jones are performing much better than evans. if someone is going to be show the door out of OT then evans is a big favourite now. 

you got a united career to save jonny.

1124~~~
His back passes could've cost us dearly. If we can keep all our defenders fit plus add one maybe two more then we can show him the door.

1125~~~
I actually liked Evans much more then Jones today and the back pas was more Carrick's fault (whom I love by the way). He did better then before this season and i don't really see why people blame him so much.

I have much bigger problems with Fellaini, then with him....

1126~~~
Apart from the back pass (which was truly terrible), he played well.

1127~~~
Agree with this.

I'm not sure what's happened to his ability on the ball this season. Gone from being our best ball playing CB to looking shaky with it.

1128~~~
About that back-pass, wasn't Carrick just as culpable?

I thought both of them did okay, Carrick more than okay, apart from that one.

1129~~~
Still decent on the ball, but he is just prone to one or two brainfarts per game that can lose us points. Having Smalling out makes us realize how good the big lad really is. I can't wait to have him back. If we are to play with three at the back, Jones, Smalling and Rojo are perfectly suited with Carrick in front of them.

1130~~~
Agreed.

This level of criticism is insane after a clean sheet. I think opinions are really clouded by the back-pass (which was pathetic).

Reckon he's next in line to prove a few doubters wrong.

1131~~~
I think part of it is the whole back '3' thing. Some of it is due to last season. Some of it is because of injuries. Some of it is form.

He's a good player who once he regains his composure and form. He'll be all right.

1132~~~
Is that was first game in this season when we played without left-footed central defender (and left-footed defender at all)?

1133~~~
Having watched that 'back pass' again it seems like Carrick let it go back to De Gea, however it's hard to tell how far he was from the ball when it passed him.

1134~~~
Needs to stay fit so as to regain his form and composure. Whether he stay fit is another matter altogether.

1135~~~

1136~~~
I was thinking about that. Not sure why he decided to let it go. 

Evans looks rusty as hell to me, as he hasn't been playing football for half a year. Generally speaking, this is our B Centre Back pairing I think.

1137~~~
Won't be fully up to speed until January. Considering how long he's been out i think he's been ok defensively, just his distribution thats notably letting him down, and slow decision making on the ball.

1138~~~
I can't believe people are blaming Carrick for Evan's casual stupidity. If that was a pass to Carrick it was a very, very poor one. Even worse if it was intended for De Gea

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/evansjjida.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/evansjjida.gif"/>

1139~~~
Agreed here.

1140~~~
I can't believe there are still people on here who think he is good on the ball.

1141~~~
He has proved himself as a fantastic ball player over the past few years. Even last season in a year or mediocrity he was still brilliant on the ball.

1142~~~
When given time on the ball

1143~~~
Even worse is how slow he was react <i>after </i>the error on that one. You'd expect as soon as he realised he wasn't getting the ball, he'd have sprinted towards the attacker and try to shut him down. De Gea bailed him out big time.

1144~~~
Whenever i have every watched him as a neutral he always looks poor on the ball to be honest.

1145~~~
Unfortunately that is Evans sprinting

1146~~~
The way Carrick reacts to that is very strange. Look at him, what's he doing?

1147~~~
He has been very solid in the past but I think of all our defenders he seems to be the most uncomfortable and unsure in a back line with 3 centre backs. As <a class="username" data-user="63211, @Locka" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/63211/">@Locka</a> said rightly on our show, he's only played in that system because of the timing of injuries whereas Rojo, McNair and Smalling have all had the opportunity to play in a 4 and have looked better for it.

1148~~~
Evans has had a season to forget. He cocked up against MK Dons to give them the lead. We have been guilty for years of passing it back to the goalkeeper an obscene number of times. There's no excuse for it. Stop it.

1149~~~
I mean when he kind of randomly backed away for a moment after the ball sailed past him, instead of chasing it immediately.

Edit: I've confused Evans and Carrick here. Ignore me.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1150~~~
Absolutely terrible on the ball, which is the same as all the CB at the club. None of them can pass the ball 5 yards. The difference is Carrick can and is prepared to pass the ball forward when the teams press as oppose to lumping it forward when under pressure. We need ball playing defenders.

1151~~~
He's confused because he knows theres no way someone trying to pass to him would play that ball. So he has to believe that De Gea is right behind him where Evans bent the ball.

Even if Carrick slides he probably can't get to it. Not that he should have to

1152~~~
He was awful. Little defensive contribution, looked totally lost and only 70% passing. He was lucky Johnson was playing - meant he wasn't the worst player on the field.

1153~~~
De Gea blasted Carrick as well, obviously Carricks error is no where near Evans' stupidity levels but he shouldn't have let it go or react so slowly.

1154~~~
Third or fourth suicide pass from him this season.
Last week i've said he's Tottenham level.......i change my mind to QPR level.

I really can't see him at Old Trafford next season.
Oh Louis...i love you <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1155~~~
Let's be honest here, anyone Blaming Carrick for that Evans fail needs a word with themselves. Maybe you can criticize his reaction to the stupid ball, but even if he sprinted towards Sterling he was never going to stop him from getting the ball. 100% Evans fault

1156~~~
If Rojo had been fit he'd not have got the game to begin with, he's never looked capable of adjusting to a 3 man defense either. At least even the youngsters like Blackett and McNair were making an effort to fit in.

1157~~~
Evans defended well but was a bit sloppy in possession today.

1158~~~
Except he would have.

1159~~~
When everyone is fit, he won't start. Just a shame that he has not become the top top defender we hoped he would get some years back when he really had  a great spell

1160~~~
Ok Louis.

1161~~~
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
From the man himself.

1162~~~
He was terrible today. That back pass could have cost us and then later he allowed Balotelli on a very good chance.

This season he has been very bad and as soon as Rojo is fit, he'll go to bench.

1163~~~
That Balotelli chance pissed me off. Because him and Fellaini seemed to be having an argument whilst Sterling ran past them.

1164~~~
Oh well, my bad. Rojo and Evans could have been a bigger calamity.

1165~~~
Actually I was talking for the other Balotelli chance. That one when Markovic run and made the pass while Evans was just looking and somehow lost Balotelli. Then De Gea had to make an another save and scream at him.

But yes, that one you mentioned was bad too.

1166~~~
Great pass to Mata in action for third goal.

1167~~~
I think he's been woeful. it was his job to step up as the most senior defender at the club and he's just not done it.

1168~~~
He really was, once. His confidence has inexplicably collapsed and he's nervous and error-prone with it now.

Poor from him today. His and Fellaini's were the only bad performances, for me, although Wilson struggled to get on the ball much (mainly because he spent all day waiting for balls to be played in behind and none were.)

1169~~~
I have only really took notice after reading on here so i don't doubt that he once was but as i said above whenever i watch him he doesn't look comfortable on the ball at all.

After a sloppy 1st half i though Fellaini was great in the 2nd, he broke up everything that came near him.

1170~~~
Yeah, whatever it was that he had, it's thoroughly gone. You see the odd glimpse with nice midfield-splitting passes into the forwards every now and then, but he looks terrified in possession whenever an opposition player gets anywhere near him. And <i>so</i> error-prone. Gutting, because he really did show Pique-esque potential for a while.

Fellaini started actually doing something in the second half, true, but he was still giving away the ball for fun, and has the agility of an eighteen-wheeler. I counted his successful tackles/interceptions and dispossessions/mispasses during the game. 4 or the former, 7 of the latter. Herrera struck a stark contrast in his 20-minute cameo - he was winning the ball too, but keeping it and then actually doing something with it.

1171~~~
Just watched the highlights again, I hadn't realised at the time just how badly he'd played.

1172~~~
Maybe now this myth about Evans being a leader will finally be dispelled for good. His best performances have come when being led by others like Vidic and Rio.

1173~~~
A couple of seasons ago i thought he would be leading the line after Rio and Vidic, but now he looks as if he is afraid of getting onto the pitch. A player with so much experience should not look as if he is playing in the first team for the first time in his life. Evans needs to grow some balls and lead the line, otherwise it's the end for him.

1174~~~
He wasn't great, but he's still returning from an injury. Evans is very much a confidence player too, you see his best form when he's consistently picked in the side. Having said that, Jones was also returning from an injury and he was good.

1175~~~
I think he thought De Gea was going to get there and was trying to offer a passing option. When he realised he wasn't he tried to get back.

1176~~~
He wasn't very good. Maybe it's just a match practice thing but I am not sure. Shouldn't be starting once Smalling is fit anyway. Think Smojo is the way to go. Evans is in trouble. Would be looking to offload him.

1177~~~
I'm not sure if he has regressed massively, just had an 18 month purple patch next to the more experienced Rio, or is rusty after coming back. Whichever, he was fairly awful. If he doesn't improve on what we've seen this season i don't think he can have any complaints if he's moved on.

1178~~~
Second match after the injury. Some of you lot are quick to write him off. To be fair, the criticisms are justified, but he'll still come good. Wasn't it rumoured that LvG liked Evans of all the defenders we have? Let's hope he's sorted out physically and also build up some confidence and games. With a busy period like Christmas, a fit again Evans could make a world of difference.

1179~~~
He's turning 27 in a month, is constantly out injured and hasn't put in a solid half of football this season really. I just don't think he's good enough. Makes way too many mistakes and has gone backwards (by a lot) if you compare him now to 3 years ago.

1180~~~
I disagree, the last season was a write off for everyone and he has shown enough talent for us to stick by the injury related issues this year. I'm not sure if he's gone back massively, he's still a great defender and he is comfortable on the ball. It's not easy to adjust to a new system and repeatedly play the ball in tight situations and we've seen even reliable defenders struggle with LvG's set up. I can understand why some of you want to move him on, but I'm still not giving up.

1181~~~
As a defender, I've always thought he was behind Smalling and Jones, at least in terms of potential. On the ball, he's definitely plummeted due to a lack of confidence.

1182~~~
The only positive contribution he made today was the pass to Mata for the third goal, after good work from Fellaini. He was rubbish otherwise, with his defending as well as passing.

Can't believe the rumours which say he's above Jones and Smalling in LVG's keep list; he's been quite shite since the start of the season.

1183~~~
Agreed.  The only two CBs we have that seem at home as the outside CB in this system are Jones and Rojo, the rest don't enough pace.

1184~~~
Smalling is as quick as Jones, if not quicker

1185~~~
Smalling has pace over a long distance, but Jones is quicker over a short area.

1186~~~
You might have a point but I don't quite see it. Maybe I need to be more observant. I know Jones is just getting back from injury, but Sterling had the beating of him for speed quite a few times in his own area.

1187~~~
I never heard that myth but he's anything but a leader. Ok he does a lot of shouting and pointing but doesn't lead by example. I like a leader to be battle hardened not someone that would get bullied of a school kid.

1188~~~
Both Small
Smalling and Jones have both pace to burn. You won't get many quicker centre backs that's for sure.

1189~~~
Came out of the mouths of SAF and Keane. Fergie once said the United team would be built around Evans, tipped him for captaincy and said his future place in the team was guaranteed. I was shocked because i've never rated Evans. That was after he was awarded a 30k contract after his return from Sunderland. Roy Keane said in his book that Evans is a 'natural born leader'. They were both wrong

<i>Jonny was a centre-half. He had the qualities of a Manchester United player, and he was bringing them to Sunderland. For such a young man – he was nineteen – <b>he was very mature, and a born leader</b>. Jonny was unbelievable for us. He lived with his mam and dad in Sale, near my home, so I picked him up there and brought him up to see the set-up at Sunderland.</i>

<i>I knew I was on a winner; I knew him, and I knew what he was about. I remembered an incident when I was still at United; there’d been a fight in the canteen and Jonny had looked after himself well – I think he knocked the other lad out. I knew Jonny was tough</i>

I think Keane was more impressed that Evans knocked someone out to be honest

1190~~~
Fergie also said Macheda was like Hughes! It's ok Both saying this but another thing watching them season in season out being anything but a leader. I would love to be proved wrong (like i was wanting to be with Clev and Anderson) but I suspect like those two he will always come up short. He looks excellent when we are flying but when he has to dig deep I'm not so sure.

1191~~~
Evans was absolutely terrible yesterday. It was one of the worst defensive performances I have seen from a United defender. It was absolutely incredible that he decided not to close Sterling down just before Balotelli hit the bar. He just stood there and watched as Sterling turned unopposed in the box to play a simple pass to Balotelli.

Playing 3-5-2 is no excuse for having no sense of where the danger is. Both he and Jones should be embarrassed that a makeshift centre back in Carrick completely outperformed them both. He's just back from injury so hopefully after some games he will improve but that was a shocking performance.

1192~~~
He's going through a poor run of form, that's for sure. In a game where Van Persie made a lot of people eat humble pie - and a season where Valencia and Young are doing the same - it would be silly to write him off completely. Although no doubt many will.

1193~~~
People love a moan. He and Jones have just returned from long injury lay offs, it should hardly be a surprise that they look so rusty.

1194~~~
He is not as bad as it would seem reading the caf imo, but then again, there is almost n oone who is as bad as they are on here. 

Still, for a CB in the modern game with years of experience, his passing is way below avarge. 
ITs strange, but up untill last year i always had a picture of him as a CB who was good on the ball. 
You can see he dont trust his own passing game anymore. Driving the ball upwards he either hoofs it or turn around and take an easy pass. The way the game develops a modern CB needs to be able to pass thru the midfield. You can see the difference when Carrick gets the ball deep in the field and look up to start the attacking play, while Evans looks scared to try anything.

1195~~~
Smalling's very quick over short distances as well. See the way he dealt with Sterling's pace in the pre-season friendly. I've rarely ever seen him beaten 1v1 whether that's in the box or over a long distance.

1196~~~
He looks woeful and has done for some time. I'm not buying this line that its just rustiness either he's not up to it. He was a journeyman at best and now he's a liability.

I cack myself every time he's on the ball and its clear that opponents are smelling blood when he has it - they know if they press him he'll panic.

1197~~~
Will judge him after a couple of months, but he's been awful. Looks worse than his debut season which is staggering.

1198~~~
The worst of our defenders this season IMO, hopefully he can get some form as we're going to need him with all these injuries. Have a feeling Rojo might be out for a while...

1199~~~
That's just wrong.

1200~~~
There is nothing that fills me with any confidence that he can deal with any striker with above average qualities comfortably. He has looked average at best for very long now and with defensive changes touted, his future here must be at risk.

He's up against Big Ben next weekend too, that should be fun.

1201~~~
Out of the CBs for me he needs to go in the summer tbh, maybe he can change that around in the second half of the season, but going on this season so far he is going to be shown the door.

1202~~~
Continues to pose an inabilty to play one match without kacking his knickers whenever opposition present him with the slightest of pressure. Surely first to go in the summer once an upgrade is available. The lad just reeks of self destruction. With his amount of experience you would think he has something to offer the young cbs coming through, but honestly i feel more confident with blackett or mcnair starting before him.

1203~~~
Sorry but he never convinced me and certainly not for any length of time. Spasmodically looked the part but he remains mediocre.

1204~~~
I agree. I've never seen Smalling get beaten for pace in any circumstance. He stopped Willian in a 1v1 against Chelsea and he caught up with Welbeck and tackled him before he could shoot at the Emirates. He's our best out-and-out CB.

Evans is handing out heart attacks like hotcakes these days whenever he gets on the ball.

1205~~~

1206~~~

1207~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1208~~~
I really thought we had a gem when he first broke into the side.

I've no confidence in him currently I am afraid to say.

1209~~~
At what point do individuals stop passing the ball back towards the keeper because they have gifted so many opportunities to opposing forwards ? Evans is doing it game after game this season. Other players have been guilty too, but not time after time.

At the moment, the case for playing Evans ahead of McNair or Blackett relies almost solely on his performances in previous seasons.

1210~~~
He certainly looked like a leader when he played for Northern Ireland against Portugal away in an excellent performance i remember very well. Guess he can't replicate that at United at the moment. Look i'm not going to argue with United fans who are much more knowledgeable than me about him but i don't think Evans is as bad as some people claim. Perhaps he's going through a bad phase and struggling to regain form (along with plenty of other players in the last two years) but i think he is a decent player. Clearly injuries are taking a toll on him and his evolution as a player but i've seen him having excellent performances and perhaps given game time, patience, with a steady defence and lineup, he can return to the form of the past.

1211~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1212~~~
I was very concerned to see him being paired with Jones yesterday as they are probably our slowest pairing in central-defence, so seeing them up against the speed of Lallana, Dipsy and Po had me worried, but they were generally decent all things considered. Maybe that's down to Carrick's role in the formation yesterday?

I have Smalling down as our best centre-back so I'd have him back in the team once he's available (for the two or three games until he's injured again) but I'm not sure which partner is best for him ideally. I doubt that would be Evans, but hopefully he can re-discover the form he showed a few seasons back.

1213~~~
Wasn't nearly as bad yesterday as some are trying to make out. Needs an injury free run in a back 4 to get his confidence back, if after that he still isn't playing well then it would definitely be time to move him on along with Jones also who to be honest i would ship out in January if we could get a half decent centre back to replace him.

1214~~~
Really worry when this guy is playing. He was always error prone when he was younger but I expected him to have ironed that out of his game at this stage. He seems to make a major error in nearly every game. He made ones against Burnley, MK Dons and Liverpool but thankfully De Gea bailed him out on two of those occasions. He makes Titus Bramble look reliable at this stage. We really should cut him loose in the summer.

1215~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Do you mean error prone?

1216~~~
Ya my bad. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1217~~~
What's up with Evans' flag?

1218~~~
His defending is fine, it's his distribution and ball work that he needs to work on.

1219~~~
Which will come back with more practice and confidence.

1220~~~
Yeah noticed that myself, seems English players have an English flag and Fletcher has a Scottish flag. But Evans and McNair have the Union flag instead of the NI flag.

1221~~~
Isn't the Union flag often used as well as the traditional one?

1222~~~
The status of the flags are different (the Ulster Banner isn't an official flag, unlike the others). But it's what the football team uses - and it's used by UEFA and FIFA. So, I reckon it could be changed. In terms of possible controversy and such it can't make a difference, you'd think. The Union Flag is hardly uncontroversial either.

1223~~~
Fleg.

1224~~~
And don't you dare remove it.

1225~~~
In all seriousness - and with no intention of insulting anyone - wouldn't those who have a problem with the Union Flag have a problem with the Ulster Banner too? 

Again, no need to get agitated - just asking. And for the record I don't consider the flag issue hugely important, nor do I have any preference. I just figure it would be more obvious to use the flag normally used in a football context (which this is, after all).

1226~~~
Not really no, the only flag used to represent the NI football team is the Ulster Banner even though its not an official flag.

1227~~~
He also struggles defensively against fast and physical players. Balotelli bullied him when he came on

1228~~~
I doubt anyone over here is offended by the Union flag in and of itself when its in a place its supposed to be like a government building etc. It doesn't offend me at all but to be honest i am sick of the sight of it. I have to drive through 2-3 areas in Belfast most days absolutely covered with the things its tacky as feck. 

I reckon i would feel the same if it was Tricolours or any other flag for that matter plastered all over the city making whole areas an eye sore. All flags should be banned in Northern Ireland unless on an official building. And don't even get me started on curb painting anyone caught doing that should get 50 lashes <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1229~~~
He's been out for a while. Let's give him some time before making judgements. Remember RVP was supposedly finished a couple of weeks ago.

1230~~~
I'm not sure if you understood what the word means...

1231~~~
He'll be given a chance, but in all honesty he hasn't been good in two seasons (and in this same time period he hasn't played more than 7 consecutive games. 

Evan's contribution is receding faster than his hairline.

1232~~~
Always thought he wasn't good enough, should be the first to be shipped out when a target becomes available, might get £6-7m for him too.

1233~~~
That's my current assessment of him too. The thing is though, Van Gaal wants us to keep possession and play out on the floor more, which is getting him into lots of trouble. Distribution and ball work is about half the job these days, and being bad at half of your job is pretty bad.

1234~~~
Oh I think I do..

noun, plural journeymen.
1.
a person who has served an apprenticeship at a trade or handicraft andis certified to work at it assisting or under another person.
2.
<b>any experienced, competent but routine worker or performer.</b>
3.
a person hired to do work for another, usually for a day at a time.

Sums it up that, for me, he was never better than just competent

1235~~~
It's what he should of been to be fair.

If he hadn't of been carried through the former parts of his career here by Vidic and Rio he would of been bombed out years ago and plying his trades with the likes of Burley and Wigan.

1236~~~
Fair enough, "journeyman" is usually used in the context of player who hops around clubs e.g. Anelka, but your command of English is obviously superior to mine. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

However, I do disagree as well - there were periods in the 2012/2013 season where Evans was a rock in the defence whenever Rio isn't available. Like most players he became shite under Moyes, and this season he's been out so long so I'm sure that plays a part in his dire performances.

1237~~~
Strange what's happened to him.

When he first arrived on the scene he was good on the ball, a little weak at times, but a decent defender.

Now he seems to still be weak, looks slower to me, and as mentioned earlier in the thread he has introduced dithering on the ball to his game. 

I don't know if this is down to a lack of confidence, or lack of games, either way I still have hope he can regain his best form.

1238~~~
I'd say it's a bit of both.

1239~~~
I don't know about slower, seems about the same pace he always had. Again, it's amazing how the defender who played the most minutes during VDS's record breaking clean sheet run is now this.

1240~~~
That's one meaning, indeed. The other meaning is a performer who is at a decent level but who can't or won't go beyond that level. I think it's an American term originally in the latter sense*, something they used to say about baseball players, etc.

FWIW

* The sports meaning, that is. An actual journeyman is something else.

1241~~~
Although he has been poor this season, he has been injured more than half of it and the few times he has played, he has been played in a back 3 where the whole team tends to defend poorly. Kinda hard to slag him now, if you ask me. 

Give him a few more games and see if he gets to grips with the system, etc. If at the end of the season, after he has played many games and still doesn't perform, then perhaps we can draw a conclusion he doesn't fit into LvG's system and might be shipped off. But I get the feeling, if he gets a run of games in a settled back 4, he'll shine. I still remember a time when he was part of an excellent back 4 for us 3 - 4 years ago. I do not believe that the wonderful centerback of that time has suddenly disappeared.

1242~~~
What troubles me more than anything is how he gets caught watching play develop around him without taking any kind of action.  On Sunday there was more than one instance where Liverpool had gotten into our box or on the edge of it and Evans is just standing there, not marking, just standing and trying to figure out how to get involved.  His main problem besides injuries is that he's too afraid to make a quick decision and carry it out.  Is fairly good when playing with strong defenders next to him, but we don't look as solid when he's leading the backline.  Smalling is 100x more of a leader than he is.

1243~~~
Its pretty clear he needs a leader to perform
This. We need to sell this imposter while we can still squeeze a decent amount for him. 5-7 M would be a decent return, we won't get more. Come on Hull City make a cheeky bid!

1244~~~
He's shit.

1245~~~
x1000. Get rid of him ASAP.

1246~~~
Very shit, about as much use as a chocolate teapot, get rid in January please

1247~~~
He's going to be 27 , supposedly into his peak age for a defender and he plays like he is still in the U18's... fecking embarrassing player, ship him out asap <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1248~~~
The worst thing about this was that it was so predictable. Inevitable really.

1249~~~
Knee jerking already. It was a sublime, unstoppable strike.

1250~~~
Did nothing wrong. Shielded the goal. Just an incredible finish. Scapegoating is over the top.

1251~~~
Can't believe Evans is getting blamed for that goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> and he's not a scapegoat.

1252~~~
Wouldnt say hes completely free from blame. He miss judged the flight of the ball and ending up trying to arc himself back to get something on it. I also felt he dived in a bit where he could have given away a pen. I just feel when Evans is on the ball hes going to do something stupid that could cost us.

He wasnt completely to blame for the goal but i think he should have done better

1253~~~
Are you Jonnys agent?

1254~~~
It was a good shot, but poor defending leading to it. He should be doing a LOT better.

1255~~~
It was going in irrespective of how much better he did.

1256~~~
The strike was good yes but any decent CB wouldn't have given benteke the space to get the shot off in the first place, benteke made Evans stumble 3 or 4 times just by doing fake shots. 

Not good enough.

1257~~~
No, I just have a memory that goes further back than 5 games.

1258~~~
Nonsense. Benetke deserves all the credit for that. The knee jerk scapegoating of players during matches is utterly embarrassing.

1259~~~
Cant watch the game so im making due with livescore from my phone. Can someone tell me if we`re playing good enough to nick a draw?

1260~~~
Which could have been prevented, if he hadn't misjudged the long ball and therefore was closer to Benteke. He drops off way too much and it is poor defending. Somebody could have helped him out though.

1261~~~
5 games, that's about as many good games he has had for us.

1262~~~
Ok then.

1263~~~
I never said he should have blocked the shot just he misjudged the first ball that went in from the FK

1264~~~
Sorry just don't rate him, never have.

1265~~~
Got a lot of the ball, doing absolutely feck all with it. Villa look more dangerous on the break.

1266~~~
Nobody is going to argue the quality of the finish, no chance of saving that one.

The issue is what happened before he took the shot, and it's typical Johnny Evans to give too much space away as he's worried about his pace. He needs to be much closer to Benteke to prevent him taking the shot in the first place.  As soon as Benteke gets the ball Evans is struggling to keep up, feints a move and Evans is long gone. John O'Shea used to do the same against wide players, he'd stand off and instead of them going past they'd have plenty of time to put in a cross.

You'll see it when players are running towards Evans with the ball, he's not very good at closing down gaps to force them away from goal.

1267~~~
Wait, of course Evans is at fault for that goal. Credit to Benteke for finishing that the way he did, but he shouldn't be given nearly enough space as Evans has afforded him let alone the fact that Evans should be clearing or at the very least defending the initial ball in. Not to mention the fact that he's constantly hesitant on the ball and shits himself if anyone pressure him.

It's the same old story with Jonny, same old excuses too. You can count how many good games he's had in the last two years on one hand.

1268~~~
Irrespective of the goal, I think he is the worst in a back 3.

1269~~~
I love his ten yard sprints with the ball nowhere near any pressure then as soon as an opponent comes to close down he either passes it backward or hoofs it to nowhere.

1270~~~
God he is awful.

1271~~~
needs to go in the summer

1272~~~
How was he at fault for the goal?

1273~~~
Johnny Evans can't deal with big, strong, athletic strikers. We've known that for years.

1274~~~
Whenever I see him in the lineups I feel uneasy and usually those feelings are confirmed during the match. If he was 18 years old I'd understand some of his decisions, but he's 27 and supposed to be reaching his peak ffs. On top of that he is injury prone like the rest of our defense which is already bad enough on its own.

If we had to get rid of one of Jones, Smalling, and Evans, it has to be Evans. Right now I don't see what's to gain from keeping him.

1275~~~
Other than missing the header and failing to stop benteke's shot?

Absolute shit really. Has mistakes in him every match. Needs to go. At the very most he is defensive cover. Although I guess with Smalling and Rojo out he is doing his part?

We really need to get rid because he just cant play in a back 3. Not much better in a back 4 either.

1276~~~
Probably because he didn't cover Benteke enough? But there was a huge gap in the middle too, though.

1277~~~
He was the one marking Benteke? Surely you can see him takes some fault no?

1278~~~
Said it in the matchday thread that it's been obvious for a while now that one of our senior centre-backs will make way for a new signing in the summer.

I'd be really amazed if it wasn't Evans that gets the boot.

1279~~~
Because he was nowhere near tight enough to Benteke?

1280~~~
Terrible defending from Evans for the goal. Misjudged the flight rather spectacularly given that it was played from about 30 yards away, and compounded that by not getting remotely close enough to Benteke and buying the dummy very easily. Beyond that, he looks very shakey all day in my opinion. Nothing to do with scapegoating, that simply wasn't good enough defending.

1281~~~
Weak. Piss poor. Schooled by Vlaar and Clark in how to be a CB. Look how sharp and strong Vllar has been. Nothing like this guy.

1282~~~
He misjudged the flight of the ball, and then maintained a position a yard away from Benteke for a few seconds allowing him to get his tremendous shot away It's a great goal, but it is poor from Evans.

1283~~~
He's just horribly mediocre. No better than Vlaar or Okore in this Villa team and they are a lower league side.

Him and Fletcher have been by far our worst performers this season.

1284~~~
Misjudged the cross, put himself in bad position, could not close down fast enough? 
Benetke did a good job there though.

1285~~~
United level maybe under Moyes but not Van Gaal.

His shit needs to stop.

1286~~~
Are you being serious? Please watch the goal again. In fact, I'll try to send you a video.

Here it is:
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OXAqbgLgtF6/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>
And this is discounting the worst mistake of it all, his horrendous defending and misjudgment when the ball's crossed in.

1287~~~
He's shit.

1288~~~
Did nothing, let the opponent control the situation and have all the time in the world to set himself

1289~~~
He's just not a good player. People said he was good on the ball, but passing wise he fecks up more then smalling or Jones. Defensively he's not very good either. He won't be here next season.

1290~~~
Forget his defending, his ball distribution(mainly down to his decision making) is dreadfull this season. He always has the simple pass, but no, he delays the passing and ruins the attack, only to run himself in blind street, and then panics it and puts someone else in danger.
He's very lucky that he is naturally left side CB otherwise I am not sure he would get much minutes this season on this form.

1291~~~
I'm always trying to defend him, but today he's just awful... Looks like an amateur.

1292~~~
For all that think hes blameless look at the goal. He isnt tight enough to Benteke for one and misjudging the flight of the ball which he should be cutting out. He does that and theres no goal. At this level mistakes like losing the flight of the ball cost you and it did

1293~~~
To be objective, Benteke got him dancing there pretty nice.

1294~~~
Actually this is a better one <a class="username" data-user="40797, @Ole's_toe_poke" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/40797/">@Ole's_toe_poke</a>.

1295~~~
It's just a great finish FFS.

The only thing he did wrong was perhaps not winning the header. From there on Benteke has a lot to do and he does it brilliantly including finishing with his wrong foot. Evans had his angle covered and he came up with a great finish.

His passing has been shit though. Unquestionably.

Certain players will be crucified even if they make the smallest of errors.

1296~~~
Expected better marking than that. Hope he gets better in the 2nd half

1297~~~
Evans didnt cover himself in glory there. Great finish asaide he gave away to much space there.

1298~~~
If Evans had the angle covered, how did the ball end up in the goal?

Evans lost his bearings after getting caught under the flight of the ball. He never got his head back and into a good position to restict Benteke

1299~~~
And again fgs

1300~~~
I'm tired of watching him, honestly.

1301~~~
Shit as usual. Can we just play mcnair or blackett instead?

1302~~~
He looks scared.

1303~~~
Who's bright idea was it to have Evans mark Benteke from set-pieces? Twice it happened and twice they nearly scored.

1304~~~
Thought the criticism was a bit over stated for Evans recently(after the MK game mostly) but he really seems to be playing at a level below what he was before the MK Dons match. Confidence seems to be completely shot.

1305~~~
Not good enough. Move him on, or use him as a squad player only. Should not be an automatic starter post January.

1306~~~
School boy. End of discussion. Move him on.

1307~~~
How long does he get until we can simply say he's shit?

1308~~~
He seems to have lost it.

1309~~~
Jones was taking Vlaar or Clark. Who else was left ?

1310~~~
Slowest of our senior defenders as well. So what can he actually deal with?

1311~~~
He's a walking horror movie.

1312~~~
We need a one in, one out for CBs right now. Unfortunately we are not in a position to offload Evans until we get a replacement for him. He puts us into so much danger with wayward passing and being out of position!

1313~~~
It's incredible how basically some lost cases upped their game with LVG in the driving seat yet a defender who I thought was our best defender before this season started managed to slide down so fecking much, painful to watch. He's been outplayed like three times in that one attack from which Villa scored and then he somehow managed to slow everything down, even when he was rushing at their goal he still slowed things down.

1314~~~
He truly is shite.

1315~~~
Terrible today. Made benteke look like a world beater.

Needs to be benched once Rojo or Smalling are back.

1316~~~
Not much.

1317~~~
One of the worst CBs in the PL right now.

1318~~~
No change in his recent form.

1319~~~
He's not good enough anymore. Plain and simple. Getsme needs to stop defending this clown and see what actually happens.

1320~~~
Supposed to be our ball playing defender. But he can't pass anymore.

1321~~~
It's been his problem for a long time to get bullied by physical striker. I don't know any good CB that look physically as weak as him. Why he's never thought of bulk up a bit more, thus a bit stronger as a CB, it's a mystery.

1322~~~
Towards the end of SAFs final season i started to question whether Evans was United quality for the first time. Under Moyes i gave him the benefit of the doubt because everyone was rubbish under him.

But now i think i've made up my mind, hes NOT United quality and i'd be tempted to even replace him from the squad because i dont know if he can be called up as adequate cover for Rojo/Jones/Smalling. I would rather play one of the kids

Completely agree mate, i mean i dont expect all CBs to be built like Ronaldo or anything, i mean Vidic was pretty lean but had good core strength which is a must for defenders. Evans gets out muscled far too easy for my liking

1323~~~
What an utter disappointment he is. At least Smalling and Jones managed to prove themselves, Evans just seems to be getting worse.

Will he ever stop passing the ball to the opposition in a dangerous area?

1324~~~
If we put Jones or Smalling up for sale Arsenal would gladly take the pair. Evans would be lucky to attract Newcastle. Says it all really.

1325~~~
Until he proves me wrong, I have no confidence in him whatsoever. He's been poor for a while now and his passing has become a weakness as opposed to strength. Countless times today he carried the ball forward and was reluctant to play a forward pass to Falcao or RVP and chose to go backwards

1326~~~
Ship him off. Enough with this shit.

1327~~~
His pass at the end summed it up. How many backpasses or shit passes do we need to contend with? Still surprised we ain't conceded.

1328~~~
Agreed. We have four senior centre-backs and it's still a problem area that needs to be improved so one of them needs to go. Evans is clearly the weakest so it's an easy decision.

1329~~~
I agree. One of the reasons why I feel so unnerved when Evans starts. Already cost us the first (?) goal against MK Dons if I remember correctly and could've cost us against Liverpool.

1330~~~
I think we have a coward on our backline.  His injuries might be influencing this but I don't know of a PL player at any top club who shies from challenging for headers, taking players 1 v 1, and making an aggressive pass forward.  Needs to go.

1331~~~
Burnley too.

1332~~~
It's taken me longer than a lot of posters but that's it for me too. He isn't good enough anymore, everything that was great about him before (skills on the ball and coolness), it's gone now.

1333~~~
Still think he'll end up at Stoke, what is he doing here at United. Totally out of place, just like Moyes or even Ando.

1334~~~
A lot of people thought he would do well for Van Gaal because he could play a good pass. But I remember this story about Van Gaal literally making Badstuber cry at Bayern. Same style of player as Evans I think, also strikes me a bit as a 'thinker' and not very 'tough'. So now I have this theory that Van Gaal demands more of Evans because he's got quality on the ball but isn't a good defender. Like Van Gaal smells the insecurity in Evans or something, pointed that out, and it's led to Jonny being more insecure and clueless than ever.

It already started in pre-season, I think vs. Liverpool, but it could've been another match. After 45 minutes LvG pointed to Evans and screamed 'YOU!', because Jonny made some terrible passes that match. In general, Evans should raise his game though, Jones has been a better defender and passer this season, Smalling a way better defender who at least doesn't have those brain fart passes, and Rojo who's new seemed better than Evans too.

1335~~~
Is there a more lightweight CB in the league?

1336~~~
He wasn't at fault for the goal but my fecking word he has been absolutely pointless this season. He is our worst centre half so far under Van Gaal, and I expected him to excel under him. A shame, but he is not United standard.

1337~~~
Lol to all those who was saying he's the best defender utd have at the start of the season, talking up his passing skills and leadership qualities <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> hes the worst out of the lot of them, Blackett and McNair are better than him, its actually laughable, he's the senior utd defender and will 27 in 2 weeks, he's a joke. Ship him out.

1338~~~
I think we need to show some patience, we know Johnny can do better, we've already seen that.

I don't think the formations are bringing out he best in him, neither is he fully match fit yet.

Also he's not the first or last to miss out physically to benteke, he's a beast

1339~~~
lucky to fit into QPR...

1340~~~
Have never felt overly confident with him there.

A premier league defender needs strength and height in my book. All our best combos have had it.

Evans looks the kind of guy I could outmuscle, and I'm a streak of piss long distance runner build!

1341~~~
Jonny going through some shi*y form. As long as he stays fit he has a chance to regain his best form. Benteke manhandled him for the goal but thats never been Jonny's strength anyway.

1342~~~
Oh here we go, just like fletcher before was only good enough for championship teams. Why do some of our so called fans make such idiotic statements

1343~~~
The problem with Jonny is that you just <i>know</i> he's going to struggle against any striker who is physically imposing, whether they're particularity talented on the ball or not. Its not like he might win the battle. You know he's lost it before the game has even begun. Its a major flaw in his game.

1344~~~
Pretty big failing right there for a CB no?

1345~~~
Here, in this thread, I agree with you.

1346~~~
He's a damn good footballer for a CB, something he has ironically failed to show in a system designed to showcase this. What annoys me is the lack of attention to detail by our coaching staff, Jones should have been marking Benteke.

1347~~~
Played his best games with Vidic and we don't have a defender like him anymore..

1348~~~
Surprisingly one of the best physical striker in premier league league history  Drogba and Evans has dealt with him well.

But then he has trouble dealing with Carlton Cole, Zamora, Elmander and more players of that nature. 

I was never keen on him when either Rio and Vidic weren't there. I just don't think he is as dominant or leader as them. And really he should be the one who should be leading the back four.

1349~~~
I'm assuming that fantastic block which stopped a certain goal in the second half isn't getting much of a mention?

Should have done better for the goal we did concede. That goes without saying. Although, no doubt, it won't.

1350~~~
Wise up Pogue, the blocked shot ended up going up to a Villa player, should have made sure the blocked shot went to a united player for a quick counter attack, sack him.

1351~~~
Let's face it...it's a great myth that Evans is the present and the future for us at center back. He's a Spurs/Southampton level defender. He should be nowhere near the first 11 and should only be a squad player here

1352~~~
Good at interceptions, and can work alongside an absolute physical monster like Vidic.

I thought he was quite good at passing, but this season there seems to be at least one horrible gaffe a game.
Am sure there was one today, the Liverpool one to Sterling, one in the MK game, and plenty more I'm sure.

He's always had an error in him. None as bad as that Man City 6-1 sending off though.

1353~~~
Yes, at (nearly) 27, it's all about the present and he simply isn't good enough to be a senior defender for a team aiming to compete for the Premier League and Champions League. He'll be moved on in the summer - we may as well use younger players with scope for development for squad places.

1354~~~
Evans makes mistakes from time to time... as well as Jones, as well as Smalling, as well as... but my personal impression is that Evans is that kind of player who is thinking "too much" about his errors. His mistakes make him panicky while other players just go on as nothing happened. That's why I don't see a leader in him. He is able to play some pretty good matches if there is a son of a gun like Vidic next to him, but to be the boss? To play it cool when others are nervous? No. I can't see that.

[/amateur psychology off]

1355~~~
Smalling hardly makes mistakes (apart from that City match).

1356~~~
Surely even you can see that at nearly 27 he should be far ahead of his development than he is at the moment. I'm no way suggesting he is sold, but I am thinking he shouldn't be considered in the future as first choice. He get's injured too often. More of a Wes Brown for me....and yeah...we could do with Wes right now to be honest!

1357~~~
He's nowhere near as bad as his form is suggesting. He's a good player. The problem he might face is that LVG has a limited timescale to make an impact. If his poor form means LVG can't can't be certain that Evans won't be able to perform at the highest level then he won't play. If he doesn't play (and the same goes for the likes of Smalling, Jones, Rafael, Herrera) then we'll likely cash in at some stage. I'd actually be pretty surprised if one of he Jones and Smalling doesn't pitch up at Arsenal in the next season or two.

1358~~~
The worst thing is that you've got people having to mention the good things he does now, as if that's not what he's paid to do, so he doesn't get criticised for all the wrong things he does in a match. He's not some kid that can be afforded that right, he's one of our most experienced players.

1359~~~
How long can we keep saying that? We're starting to sound like Chelsea fans about Torres. He was awful last season, but then again so was the rest of our defence, so I'll give him that but the season before he wasn't great either. His last good season, imo, was 11/12 and since then he's been largely 'meh' or awful. It's time to get rid as I don't think he's even good anymore.

1360~~~
Evans won't be pitching up with Arsenal next season that is for sure. He's a good player...but would you put him in the same catergory as Rio and Vidic when they were near 27?

1361~~~
Hell no!

1362~~~
He's physically not able to cope. Unreal how often he gets outmuscled.

1363~~~
An absolute coward of a player who instead of taking his opportunity as the most senior defender to step up has instead completely regressed. will be 27 in january, and i dont see a place for him once we bring in a proper established cb.

1364~~~
I reckon they'd have him if he was on the market. Similar to the Welbeck deal in that it'd make perfect sense for them.

Nah, nowhere close. Fwiw I said this last season and, I think, the one before that. We gambled it all on Smalling, Evans and Jones and none of them looks like they have a chance at being as good as what we want them to effectively replace (along with Rojo who is, IMO, a million miles away). I think LVG being here is good as he has no ties to any of them. If they don't raise their levels then he'll be brutal and they'll either be gone or they'll end up playing the O'Shea role which, without his versatility, might well end up being a bit sparse in terms of appearances.

1365~~~
He annoyed me today with his slowness on the ball. Took an age to make up his mind what to do with it and most of the time ended up instead going backwards. Struggling for form and confidence at the minute clearly while trying to build up his fitness. Needs to up his game very soon.

1366~~~
Not comparable, Welbeck is a good striker, young, and offers something. Evans is poor, near his prime (you can hardly call it one) and offers close to nothing to Arsenal, as even Monreal on the CB is better.

1367~~~
Our worst CB by far. I voiced my concerns about how he'd handle Benteke's threat. This guy needs to go sharpish

1368~~~
He should be thankfulthat he'd injured himself during pre-season tour or else he could've been in the same boat with Nani, Kagawa and Welbeck.  FFS our CB situation is a mess, even they do something wrong, they always can get away with it because LvG has no other choice.

1369~~~
The 352 has thrown him for a loop, it was evident dating back to pre-season against Liverpool where he had a mare. Evans is comfortably the least adaptable of our CB's and he needs to be in a back 4.

1370~~~
I don't know what's happening to him. It's like he gets scared of the amount of space around him. Another thing I don't get is why he has to constantly lash out on his mates. Phil Jones specifically seems to be at the receiving end.

Really bemusing.

1371~~~
Some thought Arsenal would take him? He wouldn't even start over Chambers. Its not like Welbeck, its like Cleverley

Would he get into that Villa team? On current form he wouldn't and they were without Baker who was one of the first choice CBs at the start of the season.

1372~~~
The new scapegoat. It used to be Smalling.

That said, he struggles against to many different types of strikers. Any striker whose main attribute as physical, either in terms of strength or speed, Evans struggles against. He isn't slow, nor is he weak, but he's not tough enough. He's been out for a while though, so let's go a little easier on him. He is, however, the defender I wouldn't shed a tear over if/when he leaves. He seems a very likable character though. Smalling and Jones are better and younger.

1373~~~
He's no scapegoat. He's just not good enough anymore. The deficiencies in his game are gaping. Smalling was a proper scapegoat for his stupidity against City but it had nothing to do with his actual performance as a CB playing for United.

1374~~~
Honestly in terms of Man Utd defenders in the last 10 years. I'd rank Brown and O'Shea ahead of him.

1375~~~
Brown and O'Shea are exactly what he isnt. Reliable and able to slot into multiple positions at a good level

1376~~~
It's not even that he got outmuscled by Benteke there, first he misses the header, then he gets dummied twice on two different sides, I mean come fecking on.

Add his new specialite de la maison a.k.a dodgy backpasses (like one against Liverpool), a drop in his passing ability (not the % but quality of those passes, he just doesn't do it anymore) and you've got very little of good points on him left.

1377~~~
I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Both were versatile, useful players for us fairly often. Certainly wouldn't have Evans above them.

1378~~~
Brown pisses all over him. At least Brown never got bullied even when he got sent off.

1379~~~
I think its a bad thing that our standards have dropped for squad players since then. Evans should need to be their equal or be moved on like they were

1380~~~
Thought he was average today. Will be disappointed for being bullied by Benteke quite so much for the goal. Was too weak in the challenge and gave him too much time and space when he brought it down.

That said, I don't think he was particularly poor for the rest of the game so some of the harsh criticism on here is a bit too much for my liking. Thought he was composed on the ball and was quite vocal with instructions and team play when trying to build from the back. The limitations of our formation is that it gives time on the ball to the rcb and lcb and its a process for them to be quicker and more effective with it. it's a new way of playing and he'll adapt well in time.

1381~~~
I thought that he was crap today, again.

Quite interestingly, Evans looked great (to not say world class) when he was partnered with a senior defender (Rio or Vidic) but looked bad when he is the senior defender. This season he has been very bad in every aspect of the game, with his passing being really bad and putting us on bad positions.

If he doesn't significantly improve, he'll be off soon enough. Would be really surprised if all three of Smalling, Jones and him will be here next season. And so far, he has looked worse than those two (with Smalling being the best by a distance).

1382~~~
Yeah, Brown was an absolutely excellent centre back, much better than Evans.

1383~~~
Agree hopefully at Sunderland or QPR cause he has a heart of a pea.

1384~~~
I'd rank O'Shea and Brown ahead of Smalling and Jones as well and I'm including these days there too. 
Both were absolutely top class against Chelsea a week or two ago.

I'm not to sure what's up with Evans but if I was to take a guess id say a lot of it is down to confidence other than anything else. Either way he'd want to sort things out fairly quick as time mightn't be on his side.

1385~~~
Watching MOTD. Christ he was shit.

1386~~~
The defending for the goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It was even worse then I thought at the time.

1387~~~
He didn't hold the line, he shit himself to head it and then he showed Benteke on his strong side and then nearly set them up for a winner. Get rid ASAP he's a calamity.

1388~~~
Disappointing Jonny, really disappointing. 

You're supposed to now be the leader of this defence, instead you're shying away and running your career at United.

1389~~~
Smalling is well ahead of either as CB

1390~~~
I seriously struggle to understand how people who have watched us over the last few years can continue to be so absolutely oblivious to Chris Smalling's talent.

1391~~~
Wonder what happened? Was it all the injuries because he looked promising and now he just looks scared and has no idea what to do with the ball. I actually feel uncomfortable watching whenever he's near the ball.

1392~~~
Evans is not and never will be United quality defender. He always seems weaker than any opposition attacker and I always get nervous when the ball is near him because he never looks composed on the ball or positionally. If we are to step up to the next level, players like Evans need to be shipped out. He's also always teh first player I sell in every football manager game!

1393~~~
he makes mistakes like every other player, but his mistakes end up costly nearly every time. I dont know why people say it has to do with the 3-5-2 system, his passing and mistake today had nothing to do with the system. Just a lack of confidence, bad form and missing leadership partner. While not in form and coming back from an injury, it doesnt look good for him. Jones and Smalling are returning from injury constantly too, but play far better. He gets totally exposed as an average player these days.

1394~~~
Scapegoat for what? I think some are confusing making someone an arguably undeserved figurehead summing up an entire organisation or length of time, and just being generally a bit shit.

1395~~~
Yep! Even up to this day, Wes Brown is 10 times what Jonny Evans will never be.

Back on Evans: if he can't or doesn't want to man up and stop needing a leadership figure alongside at age 26-27, that says it all for me. Sell Evans and activate Laporte's release clause; you would solve the LCB problem in one go.

1396~~~
He's our worst CB atm, by a fair distance. Needs to improve his form or he'll probably be on the way out.

1397~~~
I don't understand how a central defender can be that weak. This isn't a new problem, he's been like this since I can remember.

1398~~~
He'l be off soon I reckon when we get another CB in. Our worst player there atm. Seems to have totally lost his confidence and him being so weak physically is a big problem anyways.

1399~~~
Don't think we should ship him out, but is is frustrating that injuries mean we have to start him while he is playing so poorly.  The sooner Smalling or Rojo is back the better.

1400~~~
I've supported him for a while because of how much promise he showed between 19-24. I can't help but think now that a lot of that was from playing next to Rio or Vidic and having it dictated to him. 

He's looking like our worst CB and unfortunately for him he is also our oldest. Makes perfect sense to move him on and bring quality in.

1401~~~
Inept.

The day he's sold is a day closer to getting our shit together.

1402~~~
Nothing has happened, this is Johnny Evans.

He is making exactly the same mistakes he has always done, struggling against exactly the same types of players as he has always done and going completely to pieces in exactly the same situations as he has always done.

The difference being in the past he had Rio and Vidic and Evra to bail him out.

I find it incredible that a 27 year old professional centre back STILL doesn't know how to mark up, or to not pass it across the face of goal under pressure, or under hit as many passes, or to put it out when there is nothing on, he is terrible at reading the game, he consistently loses his man, doesn't track runners, gets done in air.....


If he played anywhere else he would be rated alongside Titus Bramble.

1403~~~
He's shown good form even without Rio or Vidic in the past... 2 or 3 years ago. If he doesn't dramatically improve by the summer he will be gone. At least one of our CBs has to go this summer, and the smart mine has to be on him.

1404~~~
If anyone is to blame for the goal it's him, he just stood off Benteke and wasn't prepared to make a challenge. I think van Gaal was referring to him partly in his post match press conference that we need to be more aggressive.

1405~~~
This is no 'scapegoat' hob, Evans has been poor for a very long time now, although now he's at his very worst I think. He is a nervous wreck, and our defence lost it's resurgence when he came on for Smalling at St. Mary's. 

He has no great qualities any more, and I called it here last week that I was afraid of him coming up against Big Ben this weekend. 

#SmallingPlusAnyoneOtherThanEvans

1406~~~
Wow, didn't realise he is 27. As you say it was obviously a big help to have Rio or Vidic next to him, but I thought at the time he looked like a good player. He hasn't progressed at all since and should be shipped out.

1407~~~
Seems weak and has lost some of his bite.  Needs to hit the gym hard and find a desire to make it at the very top or find his level down the league.

Real shame.

1408~~~
Wonder how much we will get for him if we put him up for sale

1409~~~
I know he was next to Rio/Vidic but on his own at the moment he does not look good(that does not mean he is bad,just i expect higher standard from him).I almost cant believe how he looks awkward with a ball.

1410~~~
Well Villa were gonna pay 8million for Cleverley. As shit as Evans is, he's not that bad, so I'd hope for at least that amount.

1411~~~
So the scrotes have got themselves a new scapegoat then. Yawn.

1412~~~
Its not him being a scapegoat. He's just been a bit shit for a while. Constantly getting bullied by forwards, often times misplacing simple passes and giving away chances, just not defending properly. Its not that it happens for 90 minutes, he can have a decent game but it happens once every single game at least and often times it results in a goal.

1413~~~
Exactly. I will also remind everyone that he made that silly pass that gave Raheem Sterling a glorious chance of cutting our 2-goal lead against Liverpool to just 1 goal... until DDG ended up saving Evans' ass on that one.

The moral of the story: Evans' mistakes very often come at a time when they could take the stuffing out of his teammates, and that's nowhere near what we want from a 27-year-old defender at Manchester United.

1414~~~
He's not even being scapegoated. Don't know why people are coming up with that. The cold hard fact is that he has been absolutely awful. It could be down to him not being able to string games together but still poor nonetheless.

1415~~~
In some respects I see why your annoyed but he is not getting scapegoated IMO he's get criticised for his poor performances and the mistakes he is constantly making. Right now he is at least one goal scoring mistake a game.

1416~~~
Oh should we say "Well done Jonny" if he plays awful in every match???

He has made at least one massive mistake in every match this season.

1417~~~
I didn't see the whole match, but if people are criticising him because he got outmuscled by Benteke, bear in mind what he did to Smalling a couple of years ago (see below). He's a tank. Evans has been poor this season, but then all of our defenders look crap in the 3-5-2 and he's also just coming back from injury. Hardly the time to be making judgements about his long term future, especially when he was probably our most consistent centre back over the prior two seasons.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRAKNsjAs9Y?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1418~~~
1) Oh come on he's fit enough since weeks.....he has played 2 1/2 games for the first team and i think 2 games for the U21's.

2) He comes back from injuries 4-5 times in a season....he can't always get that excuse if he comes back from a injury.

1419~~~
He missed about two months from injury, at a time when most footballers tend to be getting their fitness together after pre-season. Probably the bigger issue is the 3-5-2, pretty much everyone except the middle CB looks crap.

1420~~~
Thinking being contrarian makes you cool. Yawn.

1421~~~
Yeah maybe 3-5-2 is a problem for him.

But his 5-6 suicide passes this season can have nothing to do with the system.

1422~~~
LVG will be looking to add one top class CB soon, and one out of Smalling, Jones and Evans will probably be sold to make room for the new signing.

Currently, Evans seems to be the obvious choice to go.

He is the most senior of our CBs, and  he has been playing like a newly promoted youngster.

1423~~~
The two major issues with him yesterday:

1. He didn't get outmuscled by Benteke for the goal, he just utterly missed the flight of the ball. That's pretty sad for a 27 year old centre back. That was Villa's first time in our third of the pitch, if he just does the bare minimum of his job, we probably score first and comfortably win the match. His ineptitude completely changed the momentum of the match. (special kudos to Darren Fletcher for getting the wrong side of a midfielder in the centre circle and committing a stupid foul too)

2. His distribution is cowardly and useless. For whatever reason he was the CB who became free in our formation further up the pitch (not Carrick, odd) and got himself in great positions in their half. But his confidence is gone, and he did nothing with the ball. Never played forwards, never took a few more steps to force a defender to leave their man to come to him. He's terrified of making mistakes - yet continually makes them anyway.

Not good enough, and hasn't been for 2 years now. Not sure we can trust he'll make some return to form anymore. Sad as he's a proper United player and all that, but if we had to lose one of the CBs it has to be him.

1424~~~
Not excusing the carelessness in his passing, but the formation does invite an awful lot of backpasses. Mainly because in a back four the fullbacks normally are an easy outlet ball for the centre backs, but in the 3-5-2 the wing backs tend to be marked which means that the centre back either has to pass through midfield, hoof or pass it back a lot, either to the GK or other CBs.

1425~~~
Smallings back in game or two so hopefully it will be the end of Evans.

Its a shame to see what's happened with him tbh, just hasn't kicked on at all there was definitely enough about him when he was younger to think that he had something, he was comfortable on the ball and seemed to read the game well. He was always too timid, though, and he just hasn't grown out of it as you might expect. At 27 he's not a good enough player and doesn't have time on his side to persevere with him.

1426~~~
He plays in a position where it's far more unforgivable to show signs of having been out for a long time.

1427~~~
He's been pretty poor, in all fairness. So I agree with those who claim that this isn't a simple case of spacegoatin'. He's supposed to be our senior defender - and he certainly hasn't looked the part. The fact that others have looked shaky and poor too isn't much of an excuse, although it is hard to assess anyone properly at the moment, given that nobody has really gotten a proper run in the same set-up.

1428~~~
Should have done better for the goal and his passing has been shot since coming back. Same thing happened to Smalling last season. Hopefully Evans can improve with games because he used to be a very good passer.

We dropped points because we couldnt break down a 10 man poor villa side.

1429~~~
Err..? When did I say that?

Not remotely. I'm sick of our pathetically spoiled fanbase needing someone to blame for every disappointing result. As mentioned above, he's just come back from a long injury lay off so it's hardly a surprise he's rusty. He's been in poor form but some are suggesting he's always been this bad which is pure fiction.

Perhaps this sort of behaviour is more a symptom of the sort who populate this forum rather than our actual matchgoing fanbase, of which there don't seem to be many on here.

1430~~~
Matchgoing fans and TV/stream watchers watch exactly the same bloody match mate.Being a ST holder doesn't automatically qualify you as a "quality" football fans, and vice versa.

Agree that this scapegoating mentality need to be stopped.

1431~~~
Nobody here is spoiled, he is just not good enough. What part of that can't you understand? He gets constantly injured and when he does play, which is very rarely, he constantly makes stupid mistakes. He is also 27 so he should be entering his prime right now. This forum is for expressing our opinions and this is exactly what we have done. Check out the Van Persie, Falcao and other threads and you'll see a lot of people unhappy about them also. That's not scapegoating, that's just expressing our opinions.

IMO, Evans is not good enough and he will never be good enough. I remember 4-5 years ago when he first started entering the team, he was making the same mistakes as he is making now, but there was a large difference in who was partnering him. He should be moved out not only because of his performances, but also because his inability to stay fit. He won't just miraculously become the new Ferdinand and keep himself fit like Evra did. He will always be an average defender who is missing due injuries more times than he is playing. He hasn't progressed from his debut at United and you can even say he has regressed

That's the cold hard truth and you have to accept it.

1432~~~
It's been a horrendous season for defenders. New formation, constantly changing line-up, experimental midfields with varying amounts of cover from just about enough to none whatsoever and a manager who will probably tear strips off anyone who dares divert from his philosophy and hoof clearances into Row Z. This has been reflected by a whole bunch of horrendous midfield performances. Evans can count himself particularly unlucky in that - along with Jones - he's never once had an opportunity to start a game playing a formation he's familiar with. His season has basically involved the early season 352 games where nobody had the faintest clue what they were doing, followed by a young spell out injured, then straight back into the 352 madness as part of a team that <i>still</i> looks uncomfortable in that formation. No great surprise he's floundering.

But yeah, he's been crap. What's annoying is the short memories regarding last season. I know everyone is trying to forget it but Evans is one of very few United players to emerge with any credit. Comfortably our best central defender under Moyes, until injuries derailed his season. Which is why there's absolutely nothing wrong with suggesting people show a bit more patience regarding his poor performances so far.

1433~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that last line...

1434~~~
But Pogue, you can't blame it all on the new changes. It's not about the formation only, he makes stupid mistakes constantly. You would expect him to at least know how to defend well and pass the ball. He does none of that.

1435~~~
This season? He's been crap, I agree. He's previously shown himself quite capable of defending and passing the ball well ( has arguably been our best central defender on the ball, bar Rio) so it seems obvious to me that the formation (and rustiness post injury) is a huge factor in him looking so inept. If you're not sure where your team mates are going to be at any given moment (which has been a constant theme every time we play the fecking 352) it stands to reason you'll struggle with defending <i>and</i> passing the ball.

1436~~~
We'll see. We can't sell him now anyway so by the end of the season everything should be clear. I personally don't see Evans progressing at all, but I might be wrong.

1437~~~
I think the scapegoating remarks are coming from the biased view that some are taking on Evans, while I agree that his performances haven’t been great they haven’t exactly been as awful as many would have you believe. For some he can do no right, they ignore any positive aspect he brings to the game but highlight any mistake like it’s the worst in the World. It’s like they are waiting for an error so they can prove to the CAF that they were right. The Villa game is a prime example of that, yes he could have done better for the goal, but it was a fantastic goal, the uproar on the match day and JE performance threads was typical, however very little was made of a superb tackle in the first half and possibly match saving blocks in the second.

Further, he didn’t have much of a pre-season and when he did come back from injury he got another injury due to an unfortunate tackle in the Leicester game, he needs games and he will come good, I truly believe that. According to some he’s never been good enough which should be enough to tell you that they are looking at the situation from a certain view. Jones, Smalling, Rojo, McNair, Blackett have all made similar or worse mistakes this season. McNair and Blackett aren’t even close to being considered first team regulars, in fact I’d be surprised if either is the squad come the end of the season, getting rid of any defender at the moment would be beyond stupid given our circumstances.

Evans is not as bad as he is made out to be, either is Jones, Smalling, or Rojo, we as fans tend to write off players when they show a dip in form, this season alone it’s been done to RVP, Mata, Smalling, Jones, Rafael, Falcao and Rooney, last season it was Young, Valencia and Fellaini yet they are amongst the top performers this season.

Personally Id sell Evans  if he proves that he can’t stay fit, the same can be said of Jones, Smalling and Rafael.

1438~~~
We are half way through the season and he's been awful since LVG took over, its no longer about having patience with him or being young and talented and needs time to develop ala Cleverley, he's 27 and the most senior defender and the defender who had to step up the most but he hasn't done. Time for him to move on just like Cleverley and be replaced, Hopefully he doesn't get injured in the next or 2 as he usually does and we can see that happen sooner rather than later.

1439~~~
You seem to have missed my point. I'm talking about being patient regarding a dip in form, not waiting for a young player to develop. Two completely different scenarios.

1440~~~
He's still making the same juvenile mistakes that can be forgiven in a 20 year old, but for a defender who should be grasping a real opportunity to be our first choice central defender and leader it's disappointing. 

For what it's worth I think he's the defender that needs to make way if we are to sign a top class player. You see players like Cahill who were miles behind him say 4 years ago, who now is ten times the defender. 

Maybe it's just a case that the player he was at 22 is the player he'll always be. His concentration levels and positioning haven't improved, his distribution or passing hasn't improved and without a strong leader next to him his weaknesses are exaggerated.

1441~~~
Yeah, played a bit better on Saturday but still seemed very indecisive. Not one that I have a lot of confidence in. Hopefully in January we can get a few more defenders that can do the job.

1442~~~
He's been just plain awful.

1443~~~
Ok with the fact that Evans has to improve, but not totally ok with the fact that he has to move.

I think that in a club you must have 4 center back to compete. 

Having Smalling, Evans, Jones + one top defender, we don't need to sell one

You'll talk about Rojo, but to me he's not good enough to be considered as a CB. I think that he'll be our LB cover.

And with Evans, Jones and Smalling been injury maxi prone, then it make sense to keep them

1444~~~
I am a fan of Evans and coming into the season believed that he was our best defender (along with many others on here). He looked decent earlier in the season (around the time of the QPR/Leicester mathces) but since coming back from this latest injury he just seems weak, slow and unfit which has had a knock on effect on his confidence as can be seen in his poor distribution which has been brilliant over in the past. Bit worried about his future at the moment but still hopeful he can get back to his best.

1445~~~
You missed the matches vs MK Dons and Burnley I reckon? Vs Liverpool in pre season too, that was just embarassing stuff from him. He is an okay player, but nowhere near United quality. We want to become the best in the world again, just compare Evans to other defendees at topclubs..

1446~~~
My biggest worry with Evans is that as a young player he was bullied a lot. It was a clear flaw in his game and probably why he looked better playing next to Vidic (also because Vidic made all of his partners look good). He is now 27 and has done nothing to remedy that. Any physical striker he plays against just humiliates him.

In the Premier League as a centre half you need to stand up and be counted or you need to be an absolutely phenomenal defender. Evans is/does neither. He's on the verge of being the number one defender at Manchester United and you would think he would do everything in his power to secure that spot. He clearly hasn't.

1447~~~
He is stealing a living, embarrassment.

1448~~~
Thats what I find frankly amazing about the whole situation. He's been at this club for this long and is still displaying the exact same frailties he did at 21, how no one in the club moulded him into a better player is baffling. Its a shame, because I think the raw attributes he possessed when he broke through should have seen him become close to World Class but he's been stagnant for years.

1449~~~
What a fecking dreadful post. Embarrassing.

1450~~~
Fixed your post for you mate, you're welcome.

1451~~~
what about blackett and mcnair?

Blackett is going to be top drawer in my opinion and above all except Smalling already.

1452~~~
No, he's working for a living and failing miserably at it.

1453~~~
That Benteke free header in the second half (when Evans was standing next to him) was worrying. As was the goal, when Evans got under the ball in the first place. If you can't deal with physical strikers it limits your ability to play centre back effectively in the prem.

1454~~~
Evans always always gets bossed by the big players. I don't understand why Jones didn't mark benteke.

I wonder if fellaini played whether he would have defended him, as I would have felt much more comfortable with him doing it.

1455~~~
Really laughable the posts suggesting he's never been good enough. This is his first run of bad form since that season a few years back, can't remember which, where he was struggling against lower league players. Since then he's been solid to great with all of Jones, Smalling, Rio and Vidic beside him. Not just the latter two. Could count his bad games on one hand over those seasons. For some reason, he's lost all confidence and looks like a rookie. Areas of his game that were decent are now awful and parts that were great are now mediocre. 

Last season he was one of the few defenders who was anywhere near decent so he's not been crap for years now. This is an anomaly if you look at his career in total. To suggest otherwise is being a liar. Comes at a bad time for him though with a new manager. Wouldn't be surprised if he's gone in the summer. He has to pick it up.

1456~~~
He was under par last season for sure

1457~~~
Evans takes a long time to get back from injury to playing well.

I think he is a very good player. So unfortunate he gets injured so often.

1458~~~
The way he's looked this season I'd rather get someone else in.

If LVG wants his as backup then fine.

1459~~~
I cringe when I read posts like this, complete lack of any acknowledgement of good performances.

1460~~~
Woeful. Dire. Grim.

Jonny was a fantastic young defender three seasons ago, but that was three seasons ago.

1461~~~
Harsh words, but you're right. These days he's either injured or on the pitch playing like shit.

1462~~~
Is it feck, some people in here need to get a grip of themselves.

1463~~~
I agree with your post but he needs to take most of the responsibility for this. Nobody at the club can force him to grow a set.

1464~~~
Hyperbole. 

Evans is shit though. He's not proving his worth and he hasn't in over two seasons now

1465~~~
Watch out, Getsme is like TheMadWinger on Evans subject. He can do no wrong.

1466~~~
I think it's a myth that he needs either Rio or Vidic next to him to look any good, he has in the past shown signs of a promising partnership with Jones in a flat back 4. He's obviously struggling with both a new formation and coming back from injury. That's not to blame his fitness for exactly half his ineptitude however, he looked poor in the MK Dons game for example. 

The way i see it is he's basically got 5 months to save his United career. I think one of the glass trio will be sold, and Evans looks the slowest on the uptake.

1467~~~
hehe I know this. Some say he's Evans himself! I wish Evans would vindicate him

1468~~~
Thats not a good excuse. He played in preseason and got out shined by Blackett. Even McNair came in when least expected and did a job in a back three. Evans is our most experienced player yet least adaptable. All people have in his defense are weak excuses

1469~~~
I think Evans really struggles in back 3,
He needs to play in back 4 formation.

1470~~~
So LVG should change his planned formation for the sake of Evans? What if LVG wants 3-5-2?

1471~~~
It isn't an excuse, it's an explanation. I've been pretty outspoken about how poor he's been this season in various threads.

1472~~~
Any good is wiped out by the bad.

It's like staying with a girlfriend who keeps fecking around because some times she doesn't feck around.

Why don't you tell us what qualities he does have?

1473~~~
Nothing like a cheating partner, unless you think he makes errors that are intended?

 I don't need to identify his qualities, go watch some older games when he had established defensive colleagues & wasn't coming back from injury.

1474~~~
Point me to where I said he can do no wrong? Show me one post where I said that. 

You're hatred for Evans is so deep that you refuse to see or accept how good a player he has been for us in the past, the fact that you have to resort to childish remarks just adds to my thinking that you haven't got a fecking clue what you're talking about.

1475~~~
How does playing in a back 3 excuse or explain his shit back passes this season or the fact that he's physically not up to it?

Your opinion that Evans has always been shit is wrong though. Out of all our CB's he was best on the ball before this season. Not sure what's happened to him.

He's been utter shite this season mind and I'm not sure why some have problems in accepting that.

1476~~~
He was one of our better players last season, why can't you accept that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1477~~~
Was he? What games did he particularly impress in? Genuine question.

1478~~~
I wouldn't say utter shite, he hasn't been as bad as some are making out but he needs to improve his performances sharply. I don't think playing in a back three is the issue, for me it's purely down to confidence and not having much of a pre season.

1479~~~
Did you watch any games last season? Did you watch the champions League?

1480~~~
Yes. I watch pretty much every United game every season.

I am not saying he wasn't. I am asking you which games he particularly stood out in for you. I don't really remember any standout performances from him although there could be plenty I don't remember - so I am asking you to remind me. I remember he and Jones being utterly abysmal at home to Stoke. Maybe I only remember the bad ones.

1481~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1482~~~
He traveled to the states and that tour was the bulk of our preseason. Evans played in a few games including the final against Liverpool in Miami where he was subbed at halftime for Blackett. Am I forgetting something?

1483~~~
For starters he got into the team of the group stage in the Champions League, he was a candidate on here to be our new captain and before this season he was regarded by many as our best CB, now after 7 games his detractors are using his poor performances to rewrite history.

1484~~~
He then got injured, missed the rest of pre season, came back and got an unfortunate injury against Leicester, he's started 5 games in the league out of 17.

1485~~~
Really? His longest run of games was five last season, and we did badly in them. He only performed well against Arsenal (1-0 win) in that stretch of games

1486~~~
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1487~~~
How many friendlies did we play after the US tour (which essentially was our preseason)?

1488~~~
Cop out answer.

Tell us his good points.

You also don't seem to understand what an analogy is.

In this case, we keep sticking with Evans despite his track record of unforced errors, poor performances, and falling asleep at the wheel because sometimes he has a decent game.

Its the reasoning and the conclusion that are comparable in this case.

1489~~~
The only funny thing is your defense of his crap performances. We know he's your fellow countryman, its understandable. Tell me when he last had a notably good performance. It wasn't last season. He only featured in two games out of 8 against the top four. Furthermore, like I said he only managed 5 consecutive games and we only kept a clean sheet in one against Arsenal. The stats are there

1490~~~
He can't. The best he can do is tell us to watch games from 2012.

1491~~~
I wasn't the one with a cringe worthy post about all the negatives & zero positives. If you cannot acknowledge any of his good performances, what's the point in trying to change your opinion or debating.

Not a cop out, simply some cringe worthy posters are not worthy of having a reasonable debate!

1492~~~
To be fair, you need to tell us his qualities or just back out of the conversation because you are not bringing anything to it.

1493~~~
What's his and my nationality got to do with it, the fact you have had to resort to childish remarks indicates that you are so blinkered in your view that you can't think straight. 
Last season stats, considering the shit season we had.

1494~~~
Your right, he was the best on the ball but I can explain what's happened, he doesn't have a clue what he's meant to do with the ball anymore and he's always been shite at defending. Don't worry he'll be injured again before we know it (Jones is back <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>) and he'll miss most part of the season again.

1495~~~
These stats can make Demba Ba look like Messi, but it ain't so. It's proven countless times that they are misleading and inaccurate. You can judge him with your own eyes. The fact is, Evans has made minimum of 1 large mistake that can cost a goal per match this season. He wasn't great last season and he always had those mistakes in him the seasons before that, but was covered by Rio and Vidic. You can't deny that. We all just closed our eyes to this because back then he had a strong partner who can cover him (and a great goalkeeper who was commanding, De Gea is just starting to become one). Now it's quite different.

1496~~~
Ah ok, stats are only acceptable when they work in your favour, gotcha, I'll remember that for next time shall I <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I haven't posted any stats. I'm watching it with my own eyes and I can't remember a single match in which Evans hasn't made a major mistake.

1498~~~
You haven't watched to many matches then.

1499~~~
in fairness he has made some major errors......mainly due to his passing

is he struggling a little with LVGs system? who knows 

Evans was always a reliable defender and a decent passer - he wasn't known in past seasons for making such uncharacteristic mistakes.....

I'd put his mistakes so far down to rustiness......in time we will see a more improved Evans

1500~~~
If we bring in a top defender in the summer, which is expected, then someone has to go and most likely it'll be evans.

1501~~~
Why does someone have to go, serious question.

1502~~~
He has been in shocking form recently let's be fair. He can defend against the smaller quicker type attackers fairly well, but give him a target man and he craps himself. 

Alloa bossed him, Benteke Bossed him. The worrying thing though is even his composure has gone. That back pass against Liverpool when Sterling nearly scored was absolutely Schoolboy. He really is lucky that Rojo and Smalling are injured, and Mcnair isn't ready yet.

1503~~~
Because our defense will look really unbalanced with 5 CBs and 1 full back on each side, one would think 4 would be enough with the addition of at least another full back.

1504~~~
Rafael, Smalling, Jones and by the looks of it Shaw and Rojo are all injury prone, it would be a bad move to get rid of any defensive player IMO, not until we have a consistent back four anyway.
We desperately need that more than anything.

1505~~~
His form has been awfull

1506~~~
This.

Personally, I have been shocked by how bad Evans has been. I actually think he played better under Moyes! That back pass against Liverpool had shades of his assist for MK Dons in the League Cup. For some reason all of Evans' composure has vanished. He constantly looks out of his depth and blames others for not making the game easy for him. There is no hint that he is either willing or ready to take responsibility for our defence. When you compare how Smalling helped the kids along at Arsenal to the way Evans panics under the slightest pressure...

1507~~~
Evans has his injury problems as well. If you're looking for depth, i'd much rather have Mcnair and Blackett instead of evans.

1508~~~
It's also about what Evans wants himself. If in a season where he'll turn 28, we bring in another centre back to compete with Smalling, Jones, Rojo, himself, plus Blackett and McNair then he'll want assurances on playing time. If he doesn't get them then he may well decide to move on and spend what are supposed to be his peak years elsewhere.

1509~~~
Scapegoating is such an inescapable human trait. Everyone just loves to blame someone else for everything that's wrong in this world.

Evans really isn't as shit as some people are making him out to be. He has been poor since coming back, yes, but that can be put down to rustiness after long bouts of injuries. (And playing in that dastardly 3-5-2 even. lol) Give him some time to get back his match fitness and then we'll see if he really fits into LvG's system.

Cause if we're going to condemn him for being injury prone or mistake prone, then we can very well say the same with Smalling and Jones as well. Anyone remember Smalling's genius red card? Let's just give them all a chance to settle down in the team under LvG's system. Time will reveal if he is good enough or not. And if he fails to settle down and gets shipped in the end, then so be it.

1510~~~
McNair and Blackett aren't ready yet IMO, they have played well but they still have a lot to learn , until we have a dependable back four, much like Chelsea have at the moment then it would be crazy to sell anyone. It's also just not about depth, getting new players to fit into the team takes time, Vidic and Evra are perfect examples of that.

1511~~~
Not being funny but he has looked poor all season, yes I know hes had his injury problems but from the perspective of a new manager coming in all of the defenders have been injured etc (including McNair) but Evans (who is supposed to be the most experienced) is the one who looks worst of the bunch. Not to mention he looks very nervous and not composed on the ball.

If we get a new CB in, I would much rather Evans was sacrificed than McNair. Its not just about ability its also about the mental capability and ability to handle the pressure and get back to your game quickly. If he takes 4/5 games to get back into the flow of things and is injury prone then that IMO counts against him.

1512~~~
He could try but he'd only cock it up

Wow.

1513~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He was utter shite in that Liverpool game... pretty much sums up his season so far

1514~~~
Yep. Agree with this. Based purely on first team performances so far this season, Van Gaal won't have seen a player worth keeping. Which is a pity. Because anyone who has followed his career for longer than just this season (and has a functioning memory) knows he's got it in him to be a top class defender. He's going to have to play out of his skin for the rest of the season to salvage his United career. I hope he succeeds.

1515~~~
For me he has until the end of the season to show that he's as solid as midtable CBs, which would be enough for our backup behind Smalling, Jones, Rojo and whoever else we sign. He's currently looking about as bad as Rio last season and hes found himself out of the team at QPR

1516~~~
Just because he's the most experienced doesn't mean he can't lose his confidence. Even the Worlds best suffer from a lose of confidence from time to time, as for taking 5 or 6 games to come back from an injury, very few and I mean only a handful of players have the ability to go straight back into a team at their peak level.

Do I think Evans will be our number 1 CB in a couple of years? No, is he as bad as some are making out? Hell no. Is he the best we've got? I'd say yes, obviously he's in a lull at the moment but he will come good.

1517~~~
Regarding last season, there's already been some <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2013/2014/jonny_evans/126/64/574/0/p|premier_league/2013/2014/gary_cahill/126/64/451/0/p|premier_league/2013/2014/john_terry/126/64/72/0/p|premier_league/2013/2014/phil_jones/126/64/89/0/p#defence_score/total_forward_passes/interceptions/successful_passes/key_passes/pass_completion/successful_take_ons_%/tackles_lost/tackles_won/aerial_duels_won_%/fouls_suffered/clearances/blocks#avg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stats</a> posted, which back up opinions that he played quite well. Predictably ignored by the usual suspects, of course. Who only post stats when it suits their agenda.

Looking at this seasons stats there's a significant drop off in his tackles and aerial duels won. A big problem for a defender. No idea why that's happening but definitely possible it's all part of the uncertainty you see in our defence every time we play 3 centre backs. Nobody knows whether to stick or twist in any given situation.

1518~~~
Wow what,?

1519~~~
Wow thats completely delusional sir

1520~~~
Obviously neither McNair or Blackett are the finished article yet but neither are they as apparently error prone as Evans. Evans, who is supposed to be the finished article, clearly isn't and doesn't look like he ever will be and we won't be having any semblance of a dependable back four with Evans involved that's for sure.

The writings on the wall mate.

1521~~~
Its nothing to do with coming back at your peak level though is it, just come back competent enough to pass the ball to the next defender, that would be good enough no?

Like I've said before I actually like or liked Evans but right now we are in a dog fight to try and get back to the top, and we don't exactly have a lot of time. Like some have said he has till the end of the season to save his United career IMO, if he doesn't at least show some form, why should he stay at the expense of someone like McNair providing McNair continues to show some promise over the course of the season?

Just look at Rio now, sometimes people just dont get back to that level, we can't be waiting all day and a season is long enough to wait.

1522~~~
How?

1523~~~
It wasn't long ago that Jones was the one who people wanted kicked out and sold and the same group of people has launched at Smalling this season too. Not to mention that the same was said about Rojo in the start as well.

One bad game is enough to cause the bandwagon to slate you, two bad games and you've been shit your entire career and will never hit form again.

1524~~~
Hes been shite all season, not 2 games I'm afraid, he was even a bit naff in pre-season

1525~~~
He played 17 times in the league for us and was clearly not up to snuff. Yes he might have been comfortable in 3 games in the champions league, that clearly doesnt make him one of our best players

1526~~~
Of course, my point is that Evans, unlike other players hasn't been given the chance regain any type of form, instead history has been rewritten and he's never had a good game for United in his life, in fact I believe he's cost us on average 6 goals per game (apparently)
However I agree that he has until the end of the season to save his career, but that can be said of Jones, Smalling and Rafael. As for Evans  performances, I don't think he's been as awful as you'd believe from reading this forum but he certainly has to improve.

1527~~~
The poster I quoted says that himself. Of course he has been shaky this season, but with a lot of injuries and a new system and manager there are good reasons for it. 

He's not adapted as fast as the rest to it all, but that doesn't mean we should go to any extremes as of yet. He's our fourth choice defender by now, he doesn't have to be the best in the world. But he deserves the time to do his best to again become comfortable as his level in his peak has been very respectable.

1528~~~
Rubbish.

1529~~~
In a nutshell.

1530~~~
Man you need to calm-down,
I am not giving excuses, its what look like,
He has awful season so far I can't denied it.

1531~~~
He isn't some sort of a youngster, he is 27 and hasn't really improved from his early days. He is probably around the level of Michael Dawson currently and even Spurs who are considerably worse than us did not keep Dawson. He will probably have the next six months to improve and perhaps prove himself and if it doesn't work out then Van Gaal will be ruthless at the end of season. It will be better for him to leave and go to Hull/Sunderland/QPR and play than stay here and be 5th choice.

1532~~~
I never said LVG should change formation for Evans, Dont know from where you got that.
If LVG wants 3-5-2 then I don't see any future for Evans here.

1533~~~
On the "shit passing" thing, he's made a couple of outrageously poor passes in every game he's played. This doesn't mean there's some sort of fundamental technical problem, though. Not when he's already proven himself to have a great range of passing in the past. Arguably the best out of all of our defenders. Just like all his other good qualities, this is getting dismissed by people who seem remember anything past the beginning of this season.

Not entirely sure <i>why</i> he's making so many bad errors with his passing but you'd have to say an uncertainty with the formation plays a big part. Let's not forget that every other defender has looked similarly hapless in the 352 formation. A formation that Evans is unlucky enough to have played exclusively under Van Gaal.

1534~~~
Definitely, he's been poor this season. But he's hardly played (what was it, 5 in 17? and currently only playing his second game after coming back) and everytime he's played, it's been in a back 3, IINM. Just give him some time and see if he grows into the role. If he really sucks that badly, I'm sure LvG would be the first to kick him out.

I know what you mean. I just don't get why everything has to be so extreme. Every little small thing and it's the end of the world. Whatever happened to moderation? Everyone is so itching to hate a manchester united player these days.

1535~~~
Loublaze has a tendency to make things up.

1536~~~
I'll give you a response on that, Jones Smalling and Evans have been below par and/or injury prone for a couple of seasons. Out of them I don't even rate Jones full stop, don't really think he is a good defender, he is a good player mind you, think he could do a job as a holding midfielder but I'm not convinced he is good enough for CB, you never know though.

Smalling out of the 3 is the best all round defender but is never fit.

Evans out of the 3 has had the longest period playing at a high level but that was about 2/3 years ago.

They're all on trail this season IMO, but Evans is loosing the race on this seasons form.

1537~~~
With Jones there's the benefit of age. With Smalling theres the benefit of being our best CB by a mile last season. Thats why writing them off was too soon.

Evans is 27 and hasnt done the business for a season and a half. Time is against him to turn it around

1538~~~
Michael Dawson? You'll get hunted with the Evans fanboys for that mate. Late in last season, I seriouslu had a discussion with someone who thought that Evans is better/at leasts as good as Cahill....

1539~~~
I'd agree, I'd add that the one out of the three of Smalling, Jones and Evans, Evans seems to be a LVG type defender.

1540~~~

(Can't get stats for Ferdinand but doubt they were much good)

1542~~~
You had to actually watch the matches and not look at stats for where he played Right Back. He's a CB

He was one of the higher rated CBs in the league when played there

7.39 at CB for 11 matches and 7.22 at RB for 10 matches. Of course anyone who watched and had a memory would remember the mistakes and poor distribution of Smalling when playing at RB and that often clouds people's thinking. He's not a RB, he's a CB and as a CB he was our rock

That season only Skrtel (due to amazing goals contribution) and Curtis Davis (by 0.1 point) rated better than Smalling's rating at CB

But you missed all that somehow. Okay.

1543~~~
No shit, sherlock. I did watch the matches. There's no way he was our best central defender. Although obviously the games at right back will explain how he has more key passes than Evans. Ditto Jones with his games in midfield.

1544~~~
WoW

1545~~~
Ahhaa looked it up mate, and it was literally you who was arguing that, proper Evans fanboy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>.

since I added to it above :

1553~~~
Currently, no.

1554~~~
Hull and Sunderland? Christ. This is a guy that has performed at a high level in stadiums all across Europe, yet you insinuate he should be playing for teams in a relegation battle? 

Evans is more than good enough to play Champions League football and I suspect that many clubs across Europe would take great interest. His distribution has generally always been a strength which hasn't simply disappeared overnight and I suspect he would acclimatise rather well on the continent.

I do see Evans as the most dispensable of our three British centre half's, and It's fair to say I would look for a replacement come the upcoming transfer windows, but some of the stuff in this thread is bizarre. His injuries are his biggest problem, which I suspect has had a knock on effect on many areas of his game. 

Evans has it in him to be a very good defender again, without doubt. Talk of Michael Dawson is downright laughable.

1555~~~
I think Evans' distribution is suffering notably at the minute for a few reasons:

1) Lack of match fitness/sharpness - Has played very few games in this calender year and has really struggled to get any sort of form going as a result. Fatigue as the game goes on probably resulting in poorer decision making and execution.
2) Lack of confidence - Linked to lack of sharpness, him being worried about this shortcoming being exposed, also previous mistakes this season perhaps playing on his mind.
3) Change of personnel - Hasn't had time to get used to play with new signings like Rojo at the back, or McNair who came in to the side while Evans was out. Communication therefore a problem and also leading to mistakes.
4) The 'Philoshophy' - Onus is on playing out from the back and keeping possession. Evans making more passbacks and putting other centrehalfs in bother where before he might have went long to avoid trouble.
5) Lack of movement -  Used to having the likes of Paul Scholes or Carrick showing in midfield, and Patrice Evra racing down the side of him. Now he has the cumbersome Fellaini trying to find space, and the go to man Carrick instead now alongside him.
6) 5-3-2 - Also linked to No.5. Evans is taking up the position a left back would usually occupy when we're playing out and he's finding himself more boxed in. The channel to the left wing back is narrower, and instead of having 2 outlets (you could be certain the marauding Evra would be one) on this side he only has 1, the LWB who's nearly always marked. Infield is often congested with the likes of Fellaini poor at making himself available, and Mata also getting crowded out when on the ball. Decision making we've seen is often slow and sometimes careless.

Certainly he's been poor for the reasons outlined but i'll not be getting on his back until he's had a good run of games in a settled defence, and hopefully a formation more suited to him, with the 5-3-2 doing none of of our defenders any favours at the min.

1556~~~
Heh. Ironic that you open your post talking about needing to watch matches, then base your entire argument around some sort of rating system, without any substantiation or reference. Never work in science.

1557~~~
You brought stats into the argument straight away with your sqwawka thingy and when you get told the stats that are relevant, you try and change the picture with sarcastic comments

1558~~~
Time is against him. But he does have the benefit of the doubt based on performances from past seasons and the fact that he has hardly gotten a good run this season and the fact that the few times he has played has been in a back 3. 

I just think we should give him more time and maybe be less extreme with our opinions in here. And let's be honest. I'm not sure if our defensive performances last season was anything to shout about.

This. I couldn't agree more.

1559~~~
I'm not sure you even understand what is meant by stats in this context. They are objective metrics that can be used to impartially assess performance. Ratings are subjective opinions, not impartial at all.

Hope this helps. Like I said, never work in science.

1560~~~
Why are people calling him a scapegoat? He's not been scapegoated. He has actually been complete shit this season by his own standards.

Tom Cleverley was the scapegoat last season. He got all sorts of abuse last season but at least he was doing the basics right. Evans struggles to pass the ball to his teammates these days.

1561~~~
Good post.

1562~~~
Sorry but he has been bad all season, regardless of the formations. 

I know hes a home grown lad and some people here want to give him a chance but if we really want to get back to the top of the league and challenge for the UCL we need to stop making excuses for players and realise if they arent good for us by the time they are 27 they never will. I would go as far as saying in SAF last season i thought Evans was really bad towards the end of the season which carried on into last season where he had about 3-4 good games and the rest what i would class "Evans type performances". I was hoping that last season was just a result of playing with other players who were not up for it but the fact that he seems to be the only player who hasnt improved under LvG (paired with a number of average seasons) i would think we should get rid like Cleverley and Welbeck

1563~~~
A scapegoat is an individual being singled out to blame for the failings of the collective.

When you consider how crap we've defended in a 532 this season, with and without Evans, the fact he is being singled out for so much criticism is pretty much the definition of scapegoating. Even if we look at the last game alone there were some horrible individual defensive moments from Phil Jones, he was just lucky that they weren't punished by a goal. Yet this thread has far more critical comments than Jones' thread.

For the record, I think Jones is as much a victim of the system as Evans. On the plus side, his athleticism helps him adapt to the persistent chaos at the back we've seen whenever we play three central defenders. He thrives on last-ditch defending, so has actually coped admirably well, all things considered.

1564~~~
I don't need you to edit my post for me, my opinion is valid even if it is cutting.

The guy hasn't played a good game in over 2 years, the standard we are supposed to set is way above the level Evans offers.

The contrast between the proposed levels we should be achieving and the actual levels he is producing is worrying. The most annoying part about Evans is his body language and the way he tries to deflect his frustrations at other players by waving his arms in the air and sulking, always looking to pass the blame and never accepting responsibility for his mistake. He needs to look in the mirror and realise his short comings. I find this particularly embarrassing.

It has become sad that a team who should embody strength, desire, intelligence, nous and every other positive adjective that should be associated with our great team, has to resort to a player of his calibre who consistently hampers the defensive side of our game.

Granted I could have extended on my original post which was short and not extensive but what else is there to say about this player that hasn't already been said?

The proof will arrive when Van Gaal gets rid of him in the summer.

Getsme how can you keep defending this guy? you have no basis for an argument and its comical seeing your endeavours to prove his rightful critics wrong, he hasn't produced anything to note in the last 3 years so surely you can see why the daggers are out.

There are at least 15 centre backs in the English league who are better than him, that alone should tell enough of the story.

1565~~~
The formation is shit, I agree with that. It does go a long way in explaining why we are a shit team defensively on the whole. What it does not explain or excuse is the inability of Evans to even do the basics right. The sort of backpasses Evans has come up with this season are the sort you see once a season. He's done it multiple times and we've not even had half a season. There's no one he can blame for that. Not the formation, not Fellaini (as indicated above).

1566~~~
Yeah, agreed. I think I made that point myself a page or two back. He's made one or two absolutely outrageously bad passes in every appearance this season. There's no defending that sort of slackness. The only mitigating factor is that he's consistently been one of our better passers of the ball in previous seasons. So there's a good chance he can iron that shit out of his game.

1567~~~
Even if he had been as bad as some of the exaggerated shite spewed in this thread would have you believe in the few games he's played this season which he hasn't been. He hasn't been good by any means but hes not been completely useless either.

It still wouldn't explain the venom and hatred some seem to hold for him, its odd really. Product of our academy, good servant of the club and contributor to many of the clubs success's in recent times. What am i missing? Why do some seem to actually despise the guy?

When you read randomly plucked guff like this little gem below, it makes you wonder if some people actually watch our games with any great interest or maybe they just have very short memories.

1568~~~
I stopped reading the post after that line you quoted.
Some people only see what they want to see, they will look out for the smallest error and jump all over it to justify their beliefs.

1569~~~
Good post. Evans is a quality CB. My only criticism is that he's not as strong or aggressive in the tackle against a big/brutish type of CF.

He has struggled to adapt to LvGs new philosophy but once he cuts out his injury issues and has a run of games, he'll be back to his best.

Imagine having Skrtel and Sakho-things could be horrendously worse.

1570~~~
It depends on your definition of 'good' though, throughout Moyes tenure he may have played a handful of games that were acceptable for a squad player but non that made you believe he was that player that could be our next great player. And now under Van Gaal he has been awful.

The term 'good' was loose and should have used something along the lines of excelled, which he hasn't done.

1571~~~
If he continually makes small error after error, then I think its fair to say he is an average player, one who hasn't grown into Manchester united quality.

1572~~~
How many British defenders, or footballers in general, go to play abroad? Generally even the ones who could go to decent European clubs like Schalke or Lazio usually prefer to stay close to home and pick up better wages at clubs like the ones I mentioned. This is a trend that I haven't invented or made up, British footballers do tend to stay in Premier League when they can which is why I mentioned Hull and Sunderland rather than Lazio and Sevilla. I also don't think a top 6 side would present him an offer but a team like Newcastle definitely could.

He's injury prone, has not been very good at all this season and at 27 he is no longer a youngster who has years to develop. He is also not particularly strong for a defender. He is not a bad defender at all but I don't consider him a top one either, Jones and Smalling have more potential than him IMO.

1573~~~
I gave you whats available of last season. If you wanted to have a crazy idea about Smalling not being clearly our best CB, you could have done it at the end of last season when all the individual stats that brought about his rating (and no its obviously not goals like with Skrtel) then. But instead you're having your little meltdown about him not being our best CB now, when those individual stats aren't available and are instead using his stats as a rightback for some reason.

Loving your levels of self awareness here.

Regarding Jones, Smalling & Rafael I think you're spot on. There's a case to be made for all of them to be fecked off if they don't improve. Odd though, and quite contradictory, to defend Evans so vehemently throughout this thread whilst above recognising that his career is on the line.

Never good enough for us and wouldn't get into the defence of the two teams above us either.

1576~~~
I’m defending Evans simply because he has come into unfair criticism and the fact that some are rewriting history in an attempt to justify their posts, it bizarre to say the least, further its far from contradictory to suggest his future is on the line and defend him at the same time, I’ve no idea how you’ve came to that conclusion. Maybe it’s because I’m not looking at the situation with a blinkered view, or I have a memory that goes beyond this season. When you don’t have an agenda you tend to see things more rationally and take a common sense approach to things.

His biggest issue isn’t his talent, contrary to belief he has had some very good games for the Club and has not only played at the highest level but has held his own and on occasion has been the standout defensive player. It’s his injuries that are holding him back and this has put his future at the Club in doubt, this belief that he has never been good enough for us, is built on the imagination of some posters, he has constantly been good enough for us in the last few years, we have won titles with him in the team FFS.

1577~~~
He's a bag of nerves [especially when he has to lead from the back], weak physically and has that lapse of concentration in him EVERY game. I use to hear he is/was good on the ball, now we used 3-5-2 that actually requires him to show it, he's been worse. The only reason he's getting it easy is because he came through the club ranks. I mean, if everyone of our defenders could actually be fit, Smalling would be ahead of him, Jones too. He's not good enough for our first team.

1578~~~
He's had some good games for us yes. Just not enough to be good enough for us. Thats no agenda its a reality that some of us have always seen him as a liability

Won't be here next year and you can perm him with possibly one or two others from Jones, Smalling & Rafael to be packing their bags too.

1579~~~
I know it's unfair to assume he's suddenly a poor defender, we all know he's capable of performing at a much higher level, we've seen him do it.

But if you're lucky enough to survive the summer storm in which we've lost players like welbeck, kagawa and nani(on loan) among others without being given a proper chance to impress, you had to know that this year is a make or break for everyone. The past won't make any difference unless you're still a young player. Anyone over 25 won't survive a poor first season with van gaal. Some of our worst players last season have managed to make amends and prove their worth for the manager, i fully expect young, valencia and felliani to be here next season, smalling is making a big case for himself, jones's age will buy him sometime, evans so far looks fecked, same for fletcher, and even new players like falcao and mata still have a lot to prove to survive next summer.

1580~~~
Let's think about Jonny in a different way:

If he were with another club over the last three seasons, performing for that club as he has for United during that time, would anyone here for one second seriously call out for Louis to buy him?

I didn't think so.

1581~~~
Maybe at the end of the 12/13 season yeah, we'll probably then yes, but after that no.

1582~~~
And that can hamper your view on him, I’m not saying you personally have an agenda but when some fail to recognise any good he does in game but highlight any mistake no matter how small then surely there is an agenda, he has become this season’s scapegoat, of that I have no doubt. I’ve never understood fans who have to have someone to blame, especially given the difficulties we have had at the back this season the defence should be praised not hung out to dry. I’m not saying players should never be criticised, of course they should, but we should only do so when we look at the picture as a whole. As I said previously, I wouldn’t go as far as saying posters are hoping that Evans makes a mistake but there are certainly some who jump on his back for the silliest of things, the match day thread is evident of that, barely a mention of the superb tackle in the first half or the double block which looked like it stopped a certain goal, but plenty of mentions over a failed pass or any other error.

It would be easy to sit back, ignore this thread and let people rant away, especially when defending him has led to insults and jokes on my behalf, but feck it.

1583~~~
Not true. His longest run of games last season was eight and, apart from the Stoke game, he did well in all of them. Should have done better against Lovren - and for Cardiff's first goal - but overall he had a very good game against Southampton. In this period, we didn't do too badly, and he was our best centre-back in the first half of the season. It's easy to forget that he was one of our better players in what was a terrible season for us.

None of that matters at the moment though because he seems to have lost his composure on and off the ball. He's making basic mistakes and is less flexible than any of our other centre-backs. At least in the Burnley and QPR games he was defending well, but since then he's looked terrible.

1584~~~
Jonny Evans has been shite all season. That statement is a fact

1585~~~
It was actually 6, my mistake. He hasn't played more than 7 straight in 2 years

1586~~~
It's your opinion, not a fact.

1587~~~
Indeed, one that is shared by many. You can't say he's making a strong case to be part of our starting 11. Evans has easily been outperformed by our other CBs including the rookies.

1588~~~
Evans has always been a confidence player, the best form we've seen from him has come in periods he's been consistently fit and selected. When he played backup to Vidic and Ferdinands, his cameos tended to be disappointing. I've no doubt in my mind he can perform better, once he remains fit.

1589~~~
Never mentioned anything about him being in our starting 11, just stating that your so called fact is simply an opinion.

1590~~~
You clearly rate him above our other CBs. Where do you honestly see him in the pecking order?

1591~~~
And sadly, therein lies the problem.

1592~~~
At the moment, third, when he regains his confidence, first.
Edit: Also depends what formation we play.

1593~~~
Same issue with all our defender then, so a bit unfair to target Evans more so that the others. Especially when a certain Brazilian full-back is by far the worst.

1594~~~
Evans seems to be this years preferred target for some reason, no idea why though.

1595~~~
He's got to show improvement to stay here past the summer, I don't think that's In doubt.

Van Gaal will be ruthless, and it's hard not to see at least one quality centre back coming in, so if Evans doesn't lift himself above the younger, and physically more dominant Smalling and Jones, and manager's own Rojo, he has to be out.
Especially with a host of young defenders being blooded this year.

1596~~~
He's playing terribly when he's supposed to be our 'leader' and most experienced CB, this is why he's the subject of criticism. Smalling has also recieved his fair amount of stick but he's responded with strong performances. Maybe Evans can do the same, but so far he's been a huge disappointment. I have more confidence seeing McNair or Blackett in the side than Evans

1597~~~
Do you honestly believe the level of criticism is justified? After 5 games, of which he has been nowhere near as bad as is being made out on here, not to mention coming back from a long lay off and playing an unfamiliar formation. He has been thrown on the scrap heap and history has been rewritten about his performances, it's laughable. From what I can see no one on here has said he has played consistently well this season, it's just some of us have a memory that goes beyond 5 games.
I'll ask you this, did you praise Evans double block against Villa that possibly got us a point, or his superb tackle in the first half when Villa broke away on a counter attack?
Further all this talk about him being a leader and the most experienced defender doesn't mean that he can't have a dip in performances?

1598~~~
I don't know why people are bringing his performances in the champions league into it last season. Considering our best defensive display was at Bayern at home without him.

1599~~~
I'm going out on a limb here, but maybe it's because he played well in the Champions League, crazy I know.

1600~~~
Because he is the oldest and you'd think he'd be over these problems. Vidic and Rio at his age were helping us win the champions league and premier league. Evans can't stay fit still.

1601~~~
What game did he stand out in?

1602~~~
For 3 games...

1603~~~
Evans has been pretty poor in the CL. Was it Oscar Cardozo who turned him ease a couple years back?  It was terrible defending.

1604~~~
It's a strange one but his career has been blighted by injuries. He looked like a top class youngster at Sunderland, had a few difficult first few years at United but had some big performances in that time then he was consistently good for 2-3 months a few years back but then the injuries come back and it's just a vicious circle, it will probably be best to let him go if we can sign a top class CB in the summer.

1605~~~
Wheres Sunderland when you need them?

1606~~~
One of them was Leverkusen away, where the whole team even Nani looked amazing.

The other against Shaktar at Old Trafford, who had 17 attempts at goal. And we were quite lucky to win that I recall because a better team would have killed us off with the chances they had.

1607~~~
Apparently those 3 games were enough to make him one of our best players last season, so you must be leaving out the part where he scored a hatrick in each match

1608~~~
He still managed to get into the Champions league team of the group stages, but sure let's rewrite history again shall we.
<a class="username" data-user="21825, @Ekeke" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21825/">@Ekeke</a>, no offence but your posts in here make you sound like you're  12 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1609~~~
What are you talking about now getting into group stages? So did Buttner. Does that make him great? Hmmm no. Oh wait Buttner played in the quarters, so that makes him better. 

Yet to answer my question about these so called champions league performances. Which game did he look good in? The one where we were a defensive shambles at times against Shakhtar and very lucky not to concede. Or the one where the whole team played well against a poor Leverkusen team.

1610~~~
Re-read my post.

1611~~~
If we're buying a top centre back (please!) then we'll have to sell one of ours at some point surely. Evans seems the least likely to improve doesn't he?

1612~~~
Ah the old 'depends on your definition' argument, popular on here recently it seems when people post rubbish and someone else points it out. You posted:

Thats rubbish by any persons definition of the word good and you know it, he had some good performances last season when half the team went to shit. And he had some excellent performances in Ferguson's final season when we won the league. All within the last 2 years.

Next great player? What are you talking about? Is this where your frustration with him stems from have you for some reason been expecting him to develop into some cross between Ferdinand/Vidic in their pomp and be a world class centre back. I don't know which player you have been watching but its not the same one i have. I expected him to develop into a solid defender who would be loyal and a good option at the back and thats what he has been for the vast majority of his career at United. What more do you want?

What 5-6 games under LVG in an unfamiliar position in a back 3, with a 3 months break in between these handful of games returning from injury. Yeah thats a great sample of games to judge a player on.

Very loose indeed, you would need to shorten your time frame also from 2 years to a few months for your statement to be even remotely true.

1613~~~
I have. And there is no official champions league group stage team. So it still doesn't make sense. Unless you can provide a link. 

And three times, I've now asked you to provide me with a standout performance. The fact you can't says it all for crying out loud.

1614~~~
Six is correct, if you're only referencing league performances, but I'm referring to overall appearances which is what I assumed you were referencing. If we're specifically looking at league performances during this period, he only had one league performance where he and Jones were poor. Other than that, he was fine. Definitely nowhere near the player that's turned up this season.

And that was partly down to the way Moyes constructed the team.

Evans played well in the Champions League games he featured in. I don't know about a stand-out performance. It's very difficult to judge because was very good against Real Sociedad and Bayer Leverkusen. Probably the former because he had more defending to do.

1615~~~
There is a link somewhere on this forum, have a search.
As for his performances in the Champions League, go watch the Leverkusen and Sociedad games again.

1616~~~
I have. He didn't stand out.

Nani and Kagawa looked great vs Leverkusen, which says it all. If you giving me that as an example of a great performance then it is a poor one.

And why should I search for a link. If you going to say something then back it up.

1617~~~
You watched them again that quickly, Sky Plus? 
Evans played well in those games, in the Leverkusen game he scored one and stopped a certain goal with a crucial tackle, I believe that tackle resulted in a counter attack from which we scored,  God knows how that game would have ended up had they scored.
About the link, I've already backed it up, you want to find it go look for it.
You seem a little angry, are you ok? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1618~~~
I have a lot of time for Jonny - a proper club man who seemed to be genuinely hurting last year when things were going against us unlike some more senior, celebrated team-mates who went missing when things got tough.

However - if you were LVG, and looking at a set of CB options who were all constantly injured (when was the last time Jonny, Jones & Smalling were all fit and available at the same time), who would be the first one you'd get shot of to make room for the defensive signings that are sure to come, not to mention the highly promising young defenders coming through? Sorry but it's going to be the oldest one who has clearly struggled more than the others to adapt to 'The Philosophy'.

1619~~~
You haven't backed it up. Where is the evidence? 

Angry? Says the guy who sits in the Evans thread on the defensive all day. You know we have other players you can discuss right? Unless you related to Evans?

1620~~~
Ah the old you must be related to Evans comeback, classic.

1621~~~
Some of the criticism is OTT, but I believe it all stems from a culmination of opinions and analysis of his overall contribution and career at OT. Most people don't feel he's progressed enough in his time here and I feel they are right. What makes it worse is that his potential was hyped up by Fergie and Keane. It was fvcking absurd and I never once thought he'd reach those heights. My expectations were always for Evans to become a reliable player like Wes Brown or John O'shea, but those players were better than him in all honesty.

1622~~~
We already have too many defenders who are decent squad players. Rojo hasn't yet shown he's anything more than that, McNair and Blackett are too young at the moment, Jones and Smalling's injury problems are well documented. I don't see room for Evans unless he improves a lot.

1623~~~
Spot on....

1624~~~
Thank you

1625~~~
Squad man, maybe.

Jones, Smalling and Rojo are much, much better.

1626~~~
What's that?

1627~~~
It was a team built on the average performances of each player recieved in the group stages of the Champions league.

1628~~~
He has played a handful of games at a reasonable level, at no point in that time period did I think wow that was a good game. There might have been a few passable appearances but that means nothing considering we play the majority of teams who are lesser in quality. My definition of good games is a run of appearances which creates a perception of high quality.

I disagree, he had some passable appearances.



I would prefer a squad player of better quality and non someone who is prone to mistake after mistake and a defensive liability which he is. Opposition must lick their lips when he is playing. One thing is for sure, they dont fear playing against Johnny Evans.

Well other players have proved their quality in a short period. Look at Carrick. Evans is supposed to be an experienced player who can be relied upon on short notice. The definition of a squad player - but he cant even achieve that.

I stick by that statement as his last 6 months of Fergusons tenure wasn't anything special either. Not sure how that can be argued.

I speak with a lot of fans and read a lot of football journalism and the overwhelming consensus is that know one outside of our fans rates him and they see him as a liability, that says something.

Yes he is a home grown product but we should expect a lot more.

1629~~~
The perception people have regarding Evans being good last year is because he scored a few goals....and that's it, his defending has never been of a high quality. Quite the opposite really, consistently brain farts every game.

1630~~~
Him and Jones have been very good going forward. Taking up the right positions and good taking the ball up field. Good performance and very composed on the ball so far.

1631~~~
Yeah okay.

1632~~~
Was good today, hopefully a sign of regaining his confidence.

1633~~~
Played well and actually looked up whenever he passed the ball back to De Gea.

1634~~~
Shaky start but improved as the game went on and played better than his usual self. Still don't think he's good enough to start for United, mind.

1635~~~
Just needs to stay fit. The form will return.

1636~~~
He was solid enough today and didn't Jonny Evans anything up.

1637~~~
Looked much better today and will likely continue to improve if remaining injury free

1638~~~
He was decent today. Had a bit of a howler early in the game when he failed to deal a simple high ball and let Perez nick the ball away.

1639~~~
First half bad, second half much better, but it's not near enough and he can do much better.

1640~~~
Passable appearances? Yeah you are just seeing what you want to see then mate.

Bit of an exaggeration there mate, every defender makes mistakes. Evans has had a few bad ones this season. But over the years i don't think hes been a defensive liability for the most part. Basically you want a squad player who is a much better player than squad players usually are.

And? Just because on this occasion Carrick came back and played well right away every other player after a period out injured should just slot back in and be playing with their best form like they have never been away? That just not realistic mate. 

Different players take different lengths of time to get their match sharpness and form back after injury. And by the way Carrick has came back before from injury and been awful for a few weeks, he also historically isn't great for the first few months of a season.

Stick by anything you like mate its still not true. He had good performances last season, and some excellent ones the year before which is why he was rewarded with a new contract. So yes he has had a good game in the last 2 years, more than a few actually.

It says they don't watch him very often. How many journalists and oppo fans were still writing or talking about De Gea being a dodgy keeper until relatively recently, a guy i work with told me in august we have no chance of top 4 because our keeper is a 'Flapper'.

Same with Rafael a mate of mine thinks hes the worst right back in the league and doesn't understand why hes still at United and there aren't many journos who rate him either. I trust my own judgement of players when i watch them over a period and don't rely on other people to tell me how good a player is.

Maybe you expect too much from him then mate, since you expected him to be United's ''next great player''. All i ever expected from him was to be a decent/good squad player and i haven't been disappointed.  

We will just have to both accept we have very different views on this one i think, before we start going round in circles.

1641~~~
Did well enough so fair play to him. Hopefully he builds on that.

1642~~~
Whatever happens I'll always love him for that time he karate kicked Drogba in the heart and made him have a pretend fit.

1643~~~
Defended well again, but his distribution was very poor. Same applies to Jones. Our defenders are still getting used to playing from the back in a 3-5-2, but you expect them to do much better given that they have good ball-playing skills.

1644~~~
Awful distribution

1645~~~
Mistakenly thought he was playing Rugby with some of those passes to the touchline.

1646~~~
Was he out with Rio last night by any chance? Was merciless with some of those hoofs. It's a terrible sight really and together with an inexperienced McNair we simply lost every bit of sense and possession.

LVG must be fuming.

1647~~~
Had 2 awful passes before goin off that will probably hav sent the caf the meltdown. Defended well though but clearly knackered by the end

1648~~~
Loved his sumptuous cross field ball to the invisible man in the 61st minute <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Wasn't his fault that the invisible man let it run under his foot and out of play.

1649~~~
He's an annoying player, but to be fair there wasn't a lot in midfield to pick out with a pass today.

1650~~~
Still maintain when we get in the central defenders LGV wants this guy will be one of, if not the first out the door.

1651~~~
Evans may stay but we really crawl for full world class defender in that area from quite a time now.

1652~~~
Has somehow gone from being our best defender on the ball to someone that ounts it every chance. Plain weird.

1653~~~
His presence on the field is irritating me. I can't even put my finger on why, but the fact he may have come off the pitch injured only reinforces the irritation.

When he comes off, it's always a limp, as if he could probably play on, yet remains out for what becomes a month to two month.

1654~~~
His distribution is so poor he simply should not be starting games when we have everyone else fit. Won't be here next season.

1655~~~
His defending was sound today, but his distribution was poor. I don't think he will be in LvG's plans for the future if he doesn't improve in that aspect.

1656~~~
For a seasoned defender he always makes schoolboy mistakes.  Once Rojo gets back Evans won't see much action on the pitch.

1657~~~
He's getting better every game. All you can ask from a player who was out so long injured. The distribution will come. Always a strength of his, as we saw with that one Scholesque ball out to Valencia in the first half. Seems like some of ye want him to fail. Weird.

1658~~~
What the hell is wrong with him ? Why is he so nervous ?

1659~~~
He reads the Caf

1660~~~
Thought he played quite well...

1661~~~
That's the definite reason why he will be the first to be axed among our older defenders from the moment we find the quality replacements we need.

1662~~~
In a nutshell, some want to be proven right rather than be proven wrong, even though it will benefit the team in the long run <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>. Every mistake is jumped on and every good passage of play is ignored, personally I thought he played quite well today, one misplaced pass shouldn’t take away from that.

1663~~~
I just can't see him staying in the first team if we sign a new defender next summer. He's an outstanding squad player. His defending is solid. He's a bit like O'Shea - a top premier league defender but not really good enough for man utd's first XI

1664~~~
you want Falcao to fail too.

1665~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> sure I do.

1666~~~
We don't need to; he's failing himself.

1667~~~
Except he's not. He's playing better with each game he plays, after a long time out injured. Who'd have thunk it?

1668~~~
He is blatantly improving on a game by game basis, you'd have to be blind or want him to fail to think otherwise. The real issue is whether he'll actually keep himself fit long enough to hit good form and actually keep at that level.

1669~~~
He seems uncomfortable in this formation. Looks incredibly awkward on the ball, what is weird because he’s our best CB in that regard by some distance. I think he will be fine, McNair needs to be dropped first, we can’t rely on him so much.

1670~~~
Depressing how many players in our squad that last sentence applies to, word for word.

1671~~~
Glad he's showing some improvement. Hadn't been impressed with him this season, but hopefully it was more formation/returning from fitness problems and he'll find some of his better form and sustain it. Needs to go on a solid run for us now.

1672~~~
Cmon Cina, expect you to be better than saying people that criticize him want him to fail.

Anyways, today he was good defensively and justifiably looked knackered towards the end and I had the feeling there was a mistake coming which is why it was the correct decision to sub him. Way too many punts though, used to be delightful on the ball. Hope he gets that back with regular games.

1673~~~
I never claimed anyone actively wanted him to <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

I can see why people will criticize his performances, he's obviously just not been good enough, but he is recovering from injury and he is clearly showing improvement, that's the area I can't fathom how people would be able to acknowledge, because he's just blatantly been better than he was a few games ago, as you would expect, really.

1674~~~
The posts about his performance today are pretty much all about his woeful punts all game, not about his actual defensive performance which was good. The distribution was shocking though, no getting away from that besides that superb ball to Valencia.

1675~~~
Why was he subbed? Just because he kept passing it to the Tottenham fans or because he had some kind of a knock?

1676~~~
Defensively he was not as shaky as his earlier matches but on the ball he was pretty disapointing. I expected him, of all people, to have a cooler head and attempt to play it out. Maybe it's the difficulties he is encountering with this formation, I don't know, but he is and should be better than that.
Does anyone have any idea why he was hauled off?

1677~~~
I wish him or Jones would actually run into the space when they pass it along the back instead of hoofing it up front. So much space but they panic and try to find a striker. Even a pass to somebody like Carrick is on but they are worried about finding him.}

Defensively sound, distribution shocking. He tries too many Hollywood switch passes.

1678~~~
Probably because watching him, McNair and Jones mess it up at the back was starting to cost us big time. Can't help but feel Evans will be one of the players replaced in Summer, and rightfully so. The defence is crying out for a leader and someone who can actually distribute.

1679~~~
This.

However, I don't think he looks comfortable in this formation.

1680~~~
The irony of this. He's by far our best CB on the ball. I blame it on his form. Jonny should be shining in this formation.

1681~~~
He is quite handy on the ball it has to be said...Although, Rojo is not bad either.

1682~~~
His passing went to shit in the second half but he did well overall. Certainly a huge improvement on his season up until recently. Hopefully he stays fit.

1683~~~
Pogue is a keen admirer of Evans.

1684~~~
Is he?

I swear this is one of those Emperor's clothes things, everyone talks about his great distribution and how bad Smalling's is, so this season when its reversed people make a big song and dance about it being reversed.

I can't remember the last time Evans distribution was actually good, but I can remember a hell of a lot of misplaced passes brushed under the carpet because he's 'usually' good. It just doesn't rally with reality, I'm sure.

1685~~~
His passing range at least was the best among our CB's, up until this season anyway.  Seems to have left him when his confidence went.

1686~~~
He's very comfortable on the ball, does that make him a good distributor too, maybe, maybe not. I wouldnt champion his distribution either. Its probably a case of people making both categories out to be the same and choosing to be positive about his short comings.

1687~~~
I think his passing out from the back has noticeably regressed this last couple of seasons. Doesn't look as assured as he once did.

1688~~~
Try to remember last season. That'll do it.

1689~~~
I try to mentally block out last season.

1690~~~
Evans' distribution and ability on the ball is only 'good' compared to our other CHs. Compared to the very best defenders its pretty average in all honesty.

1691~~~
He's had strong composure, not necessarily distribution and technique. Whilst the terms aren't mutually exclusive, they are often put together as one by fans, incorrectly in my eye.

1692~~~
Better performance by him, bit more confident when he's in the lineup. Still dont think he'll come out as the winner in the battle between Smalling:Jones:Rojo:Evans

1693~~~
I actually feel that time is running out for him. He's had plenty of awkward defensive moments and he's also becoming increasingly poor in his passing.

1694~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fair enough.

Have a look at this thread, from February 2014. Lots of praise for his distribution but, more importantly, no criticism about it either. He's a player that divides opinion with loads of caftards quick to highlight any weakness in the game. The absence of comments about poor passing pretty much confirms it wasn't in evidence last season. 

The consensus of the thread from Evans fans and doubters alike would have him as the best of all our central defenders in terms of ability on the ball.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/jonny-evans-what-do-we-think.385437/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/jonny-evans-what-do-we-think.385437/</a>

1695~~~
This. Smalling and Rojo have been our best pairing, and Jones has been better than Evans as well.

1696~~~
They're the only two who've played as a pair.

1697~~~
They've been our best CBs IMO. So in a back three with everyone fit I assume they'd get the nod. I'd have Jones down as the third.

In fairness, I didn't say his distribution was bad last season; its just that it didn't strike me as good. And I stand by that, I think a lot of the time when he did miss pass the ball we'd get a lot of comments along the lines of 'brainfart by Evans' rather than critiquing it for what it is, a misplaced pass. I feel like he's been living off the reputation from the time when it was a bit more impressive by not being overtly <i>bad </i>without people really noticing there's been a dip. Obviously this season has been a lot worse and I completely agree that rustiness is a likely explanation for why its so bad; I just can't remember a time, post Ferguson, where I've ever been left with the impression that Evans had a particularly outstanding game on the ball. 

I feel like its one of those things where when a player clearly lacks one attribute to their game they tend to get others praised to conform to the mould. So as Evans does tend to lack physicality people will wax lyrical about his technical attributes to compensate, 
leading to the over-emphasis of Evans ability to pass the ball becoming as accepted as myths such as Rooney's lack of speed, Rafael's recklessness, and Fellaini's lack of technical ability. All things that are just repeated ad-nauseum on here until the community basically accepts it as a fact. Its the same hive mind mentality that saw people take genuine offence at the term 'Man U' on here for absolutely years before someone did some research and realised it wasn't actually offensive in the slightest.

I have no real evidence to support this claim, and realise I'm not going to convince anyone of it without it, but just a brief check of Evans' stats from last season does nothing to dissuade my argument. Taking into account the obvious flaws with using passing stats as the basis for any argument he nevertheless had a worse completion percentage last season than any of Terry, Cahill, Demichelis, Kompany, Agger, Skrtel, Koscielny, and Mertesacker. Most of that list you wouldn't claim had excellent distribution, yet Evans still sits upon the bottom of it. As I said, pass completion stats provide nothing definitive, but its nonetheless food for thought.

1699~~~
They have been our best CBs. Just pointing out that the fact they're also our only CBs to play as a pair might be more than just coincidence.

1700~~~
He's awful on the ball and goes almost immediately into panic and hoof mode as soon as an opponent comes within 50 feet of him.

1701~~~
He's improved every match I think. Distribution needs to get better though. For some reason he just bugs me, but I try not to let that interfere when I assess him. It does seem like some on here are looking for him to fail though.

1702~~~
Why was he taken off? Not another injury again?

1703~~~
He did motion to the bench a few minutes earlier.

1704~~~
I thought he had picked up a knock. Wouldn't surprise me if he misses the Stoke match. Didn't look to be serious though if he did get something.

1705~~~
A decent squad man, but greatness will forever elude Jonny.

1706~~~
Jonny reached greatness the moment his studs met Drogba's chest. Forever in our hearts.

1707~~~
Really?
I thought it was more to do with Spurs starting to press the defence and him electing to just kick it away as hard as he could every time they came near him. He'd given us a couple of minor scares just before he came off.

1708~~~
No doubt he started to struggle but that doesn't mean he wasn't feeling something but the subs did seem planned. To be able to give Rafael, Shaw and Smalling minutes.

1709~~~
IMO- Of our three center backs from the SAF era, he looks most likely to get the boot if we get a new defender in. 

Had a good game defensively though. Bad at distribution, but then when the center backs were being pressed in the second half, Carrick should have dropped back a little more to receive the ball

1710~~~
In all the talk about the way Spurs pressed our back 3 in the second half, have they been given any praise? Or has it all been about our defenders not being good enough and midfielders being cowards in not wanting the ball?

<span style="color: #ffffff">Yeh, taking the piss a little but point stands.</span>

1711~~~
I think he came off because he was tired, not because of an injury.

I'm not getting into rehashing old debates, basically we need to bring in a top quality CB and you can't just keep buying, you have to move some players on to make room, of the 4 senior CB's Evans is the one I would sell and who I think will be sold.

1712~~~
Thought he was competent enough, better than McNair.

1713~~~
I was a bit disappointed with his play. I think I'd have him as 4th choice among CB's behind Smalling, Jones and Rojo at this point. 

Starting to think he'll be starting at CB for Newcastle, Villa, West Ham (Reid would be a good partner for him) or replacing Distin in Everton's injury-based rotation of CB's.

1714~~~
2 very encouraging performances against Newcastle and Spurs. Although his distribution was wayward at times yesterday, he is looking a lot better on the ball for me - looking confident in possession. I'm not worried about his play on the ball as it is clearly a confidence thing which will improve alongside his defensive displays.

The criticism he was getting was probably fair but he was just coming back from injury so was off the pace. I would like to see a Jones -- Smalling -- Evans back 3 if we are to stick with 3 at the back.

1715~~~
I thought his defensive work was sound throughout but he still doesn't look comfortable playing it out from the back in this formation.

1716~~~
He has proved his distribution is good enough long time ago, I don’t think it’s debatable. However, he seems to hoof it quite a lot those days, not sure if it’s the instructions or he’s low on confidence (could be both). I actually liked Rojo distribution from the back (kept it on the ground), seemed more confident to travel forward with the ball too.

Jones – Smalling- Evans will be interesting, and about twice as good as it was without Chris.

1717~~~
I thought there was a few times in the last two matches where when he was on the ball and was looking for someone to play it too that there was a serious lack of options or movement going on ahead of him. He does seem to be getting into the swing of things now though, he looks a lot more comfortable in himself and looking like a lad that's gaining confidence by the game. Long may it continue.

1718~~~
Please correct me if I am wrong.

While Evans has been on the pitch in the following games:

Villa
Newcastle
Tottenham

we have conceded only 2 goals (1 of which was a penalty, for whom Jones was directly responsible).
Have I got this right?

1719~~~
We all know he's world class defender but people just being afraid to admit it.

1720~~~
Yeah but that's thanks to the other 10 players on the pitch working harder to make up for Evan's mistakes.
<span style="color: #ffffff">Am I doing this right?</span>

1721~~~
Unfortunately I think that's the case. Just watched the Spurs game and lost count of the number of times he failed to spot the quick pass - instead he shuffled forward aimlessly until all passing lanes were blocked then booted the ball upfield to nobody. (In my view, shuffling forward with the ball is a sign of indecision not composure. Obviously a lot of posters disagree with me on this.)

1722~~~
In that case, what you are doing is criticising a defender, for not having creative vision.
Once Blind is back, if in doubt, the defenders can pass to him and he will find a creative pass (to our attacking midfielders). That's what he is there for.
When I judge a defender, its on his ability to defend and looking at the stats, opposing strikers have not done well against our defence, since Evans has been playing.

Let the defence ensure that the ball doesnt go in the back of our net.
Let the attackers ensure that the ball does end up in the back the opposition's net.
If you are looking for a ball playing (intelligent/confident) defender, it may take a while for Evans to get there...if ever.

Fletcher is a lost cause. But I think that Evans still has a job to do at the club.

1723~~~
Right now a four man defense seems like the only platform for Jonny to show only positives but that would require absolutely no injury streak and some swift transfer movement in nearest future.

It's possible, not too probable but still...

1724~~~
You do realise I was joking?

1725~~~
Many a true word is spoken in jest.

1726~~~
I thought the Spurs game was his best of the season. Made some good interceptions and tracked his man reasonably well.  He does still needs to get tighter when closing down and u e looks very nervous in possession and then proceeds to either goes backwards or hoofs it forward but that's probably a lack of confidence. Overall not a bad game from Evans yesterday.

1727~~~
Newcastle for me.

1728~~~
Looking forward to seeing some defend that.

1729~~~
Has to go. Stealing a living here.

1730~~~
Wait 'till <a class="username" data-user="71720, @Getsme" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/71720/">@Getsme</a>.

1731~~~
I think it's fair to say that he's the first out the door this summer.

1732~~~
Pogue in 4,3,2,1...,

1733~~~
Ship him off to Sunderland or West Brom or Doncaster. Anywhere but here.

1734~~~
Sooner he is gone the better. Never disliked a United player as much.

1735~~~
I've said it before, There is nothing I like about Evans. No defining quality other than spending the whole game shouting at others whilst being shit

1736~~~

Nice through ball which led to the Corner which we scored from. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1738~~~
He's been complete dogshite this season. His form has been Championship standard so far

1739~~~
I fcuking hate this jonny evans cnut.

EDIT: This was in response to him ranting at Luke Shaw for HIS mistake. Not because he's hot garbage. Which he is.

1740~~~
At least Cahill is not better than him; "Getsme

1741~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1742~~~
Every man and his dog tries to bully him now as they know he is a bit soft.

1743~~~
every time someone runs at him, he has the ball or he is chasing the ball, you can see he is panicking. Clueless at the moment. Got even bullied by Diouf.

1744~~~
Liability.

1745~~~
Has regressed so much, he just seems to panic in possession all the time now

1746~~~
He's terrible. Can someone tell him to head the ball rather than letting it bounce? Idiot. Then ranting at others constantly, when it's he who is constantly messing up.

1747~~~
Can't see him being at United very long.

1748~~~
Time to sell. Makes a mistake almost every game, put him under pressure/physically get in his face and he shits himself and he's at the age where you can't say he's going to get much better. Should be the first defender out the door.

1749~~~
Probably the dumbest defender we have, always thought that it's Jones but Evans is doing everything he can to prove me wrong.

1750~~~
I've never been so nervous when we have had a defender in our back line. He is just a disaster waiting to happen every game. It annoys me even more when you see him shout at others when he is the one that has made the error! Probably the only player I really want gone in the summer, if not this January.

1751~~~
He's turned quite crap.

1752~~~
He makes me so nervous. I'm guessing he'll be dropped once Rojo is back fit.

1753~~~
How can anyone still defend him <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Awful awful player!!!!!

1754~~~
Needs dropping.

1755~~~
Apart from being wrong to let the ball bounce that time when it comes to individual errors he hasn't done much wrong at all, he definitely wasn't at fault for the goal. Our problems at the back there in that first half have mainly being as a defensive unit other than anything else, letting balls bounce, coming off 2nd best or not getting heads on crosses, corners etc.

1756~~~
He argued with De Gea, not Shaw.

1757~~~
We'll look so much better when Rojo replaces him.

1758~~~
Off at half time I hope. Useless.

1759~~~
Disgusting player. I'd take even Rojo over him.

1760~~~
Point still stands. He's always looking to blame others. He's always being like that. Seems like a right prick tbh.

1761~~~
It's funny because you have people looking out and picking the good parts of his game now, which are few are far between, to justify that he isn't crap. As if it ain't a pre-requisite to do the things he does for which he is paid for. He's an absolute liability and I've got the feeling he's going nowhere soon which is frustrating as he's got at least one huge mistake in him every single game.

1762~~~
Well, apparently the wind is playing havoc which explain why the ball keeps on bouncing.

1763~~~
You and Getsme... Are you two related to Jonny Evans somehow? I swear, you never see anything wrong with him. "Let the ball bounce"... haha.

1764~~~
Hopefully all this stick means he scores a header from a corner or something, but he really has been poor. Come back soon Rojo.

1765~~~
Awful, schoolboy mistakes, he's suppose to be our most experienced center back yet seems fresh from the reserve team.

Needs to be subbed for Blackett if he continues playing like he is scarred of the fecking ball...

1766~~~
Not the player he was couple of years ago had potential like Cleverley but regressed instead. I see him being shipped off in the summer.

1767~~~
Hasn't done much wrong? 

Nearly cost us a goal. 2-0 and would have been game over. Not the first time he's nearly cost us a goal this season. In nearly every game he's played he's nearly gifted the opposition a golden chance.

1768~~~
I was just about to post this! So annoying when he shouts and sticks his finger out when usually it's his fault.

1769~~~
Afwul awful player. Wouldn't be suprised a bit if he doesn't come out of the second half. I'm speechless how terrible he is.

1770~~~
Got beasted by Fiddy.

Because he can't defend himself! badumtush!

1771~~~
Cop on will you?

1772~~~
Not very confident performance so far. Made a multitude of mistakes including letting diouf in from a simple ball over the top.

I know the conditions have been shit but Evans just doesn't inspire confidence in anyone. The worse thing is he keeps extending blame to his teammates whenever something goes wrong (usually he is at least partly the cause).

Good squad player but we are not winning the league with him in our backline.

1773~~~
Well, maybe he was right. Not sure what exactly he did wrong in that particular situation. Had his man in sights, counted on Shaw behind him. And ended well.

1774~~~
He's shockingly bad, can't pass, can't run, too soft, blames everyone else for his shitness, he's a joke.

1775~~~
He would rather leave things to chance than take responsibility. That cross that Shaw dealt with is an example, whatever Shaw did in that position was going to be high risk but he took responsibility.

1776~~~
I thought he was ranting at De Gea for not claiming a ball which bounced at the edge of the six yard box? Either way, I still don't know why Evans just ignored the ball. Either him or De Gea should have claimed it.

1777~~~
Why does he shout hulking commands and beratements at fellow players when he himself leads the avalanche of laurel and hardy moments? Even when he troubles the other defenders with his mistake he shouts at them??

Why is he still taking all the time rolling the ball forwards slowly with a Beckenbauerly nonchalence when he is utter shite on the ball nowadays?

It's like one of those Hollywood comedy characters who everyone knows he is cow dung but himself. Infuriating.

1778~~~
7 years and 200 games later and he's still the "decent defensive skills, but with a lot to learn, who's still a bit error prone," that he looked like when he first appeared.

1779~~~
Looks very nervous,When he's bad he's bad.

1780~~~
Always look uncomfortable on the ball. Need to cut out his indecisiveness whenever he is facing his own goal.

1781~~~
I don't like the guy. Never have. Nothing to cop on to.

1782~~~
He's always backpeddling like he's in a 1970's horror movie.

1783~~~
Something I've always noticed about him is that he lays into De Gea all the time. He's been doing it for a while. You should be cleaning his boots, mate, not shouting at him.

I'd love it if he was given a bit of his own medicine when he does his compulsory feck up in gifting the opposition a chance in every game.

1784~~~

1785~~~
That's nice, but calling our players cnuts and pricks on here isn't really something we like to tolerate, it's also very childish. You can criticize a player without openly insulting them like that.

1786~~~
Precisely. Time to jettison.

1787~~~
I've already said it was shocking, there is no defending that, but sure you keep on quoting my name is it makes you feel good.
Didn’t see you making this remark when he played well over the last few games, but I suppose you were sitting on that post for some time eh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1788~~~
An absolute liability.

1789~~~
It's been three games now and I'm very sure that Evans will not make it in this system. He's not decisive enough and his comfort on the ball is very low. He takes too many touches for the pass and always complains about players not being available to him. Jones on the other hand looks like he has embraced the system and is finding a lot easier. Same concept but Jones is excelling. Evans will be gone and a new defender will be bought, unless Rojo comes onto his own and solidifies his place there at LCB. 

This is the weak link in our defence.

BTW: Smalling is looking very, very good in that defence. He's improving at a remarkable rate and may well be our rock in defence. After that suspension at City, he's been phenomenal. High hopes for him. 

Evans out.

1790~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1791~~~
I said it in the match day thread and i'll say it here, its extremely comical seeing Evans yell at people telling them what they should have done.

While Jones and Smalling arent rated too highly here at least when they play they look solid, whenever Evans is on the ball you feel he has a mistake in him. I'm sure today you can make an excuse for the wind but that situation with Diouf was indefensible - He is favourite for a ball and he still manages to screw it up. If that had gone in we would have a mountain to climb

1792~~~
This is exactly how I feel as well. His regression is becoming quite staggering to watch. Even at points last season I felt he was the best defender at the club. Not anymore though. And I agree that he's at risk of being moved on at the end of the season.

1793~~~
I absolutely hate the way he shouts at others for his screw ups. Weak mentality.

We need a CB this window.

1794~~~
We really like our spacegoats.

1795~~~
Fair point, I apologize. I'll try to be more constructive or just better yet, just ignore him!

1796~~~
He is such a coward at times.

You are better then that Jonny.

1797~~~
I mentioned that mistake but other than that he has been alright. In the 6th minute for instance when everyone else was caught in no mans land and there was a Stoke player getting ready to make a run through on goal Evans was the one that ran back and won the ball back.

Funny that the ones that actually cost us a goal aren't getting near as much crap thrown at them as Evans is though. On that first half performance alone he has been no better nor no worse than any of the rest of them at the back. As a unit they have been terrible.

1798~~~
is shit, time to get rid.

1799~~~
Doesn't matter if he has the ability and talent if his self confidence isn't with him. At 27 years old he should be matured and mentally strong enough to cope with pressure but he isn't. 

I think it's fair to say that he will do better plating for a smaller club where the pressure is less, at Unitec he's out of his depth and we do him a disadvantage to expect miracle.

1800~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/maVsd5Rq2Wg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1801~~~
Rojo can't come soon enough. And he isn't that great in the first place.

Would be absolutely surprised if Evans will be here next season. He has been one of the worst defenders I have ever seen during this season. How many mistakes that could have cost us he has made so far? 5? 10?

1802~~~
Are you really so fecking pathetic that you have to resort to Childish behaviour? Grow the feck up <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1803~~~
To be fair, Evans has been shite. No scapegoating about it.

1804~~~
I still don't know what outstanding defensive attributes he actually has or ever had to be rated so highly?

1805~~~
He, again, let the ball get past him as a central defender, he simply has to head it away and he's let it bounce fecking again with having absolutely no idea who's behind him, just like when he's got outplayed by Diouf 2-3 times in just one run.

His awareness is non-existent.

1806~~~
Has 6months to save his United career.

It's unfeasible that we won't look to strengthen centre back, and you'd have to say Smalling, Jones and Rojo are ahead of him in the pecking order, with the youngsters quickly catching up.
He must be the one to go if he doesn't show some good form soon

1807~~~
Good response as usual, are you trying to say he didn't?

1808~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I miss SAF... But Evans still hasnt woken up!

1809~~~
He hasn't got any.

Its more the fact he has spent half his career sat on the injury table that has allowed to creat this myth of some awesome defender that is just waiting to be unleashed when fit.

He's a bit pants and always has been.

1810~~~
If he plays another aimless ball straight at Begovic <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1811~~~
Cliched at it may sound, a lot of Evans' problems are in his head. To be a consistently good performer at the highest level you need to have incredible mental fortitude and a personality to handle and overcome adversities because even the greatest can go through some rough patches. He was a more than able deputy with Ferdinand or Vidic or Evra because they took command of the backline and that sense of confidence seeped into Jonny's game. Some of his relative defensive deficiencies were masked when they were around to mop up the slack. 

But now, the roles have been reversed and Evans is expected to lead the likes of Smalling, Rojo, Jones, Shaw, Rafael, McNair as the senior-most and experienced member of our defense. Whether he has the were withal to accomplish that in the near future has to be seen. But right now, he doesn't seem to be showing any promise in that regard and it might prove to be a case of too little too late if this form continues through the season because Van Gaal has shown a ruthless streak in terms of disposing players who can't perform upto expectations. Infact  I feel more secure with a central defensive partnership or Smalling or Rojo or Jones or even McNair in that order which is a rather poor reflection of Evan's current standard in all honesty. 

Will he get bogged down with the Cleverley syndrome and fail to live up to his potential because of an innate inability to man up and work out the bulk of his flaws, be it technical or tactical ? Or will he overcome a barrage or criticism and take his game to another level ala the once maligned Fletcher or to a certain extent De Gea. The next few months are quite possibly make of break time for him.

1812~~~
I honestly hope Blackett will start to get the nod ahead of him. He's just not good enough. Not strong enough. Not clever enough. At least Blackett can progress and is already quite a beast.

1813~~~
How are we scapegoating him? He didn't cost us the goal. He's just not good enough. That's not scapegoating. He's not being blamed for anything, apart from simply not being deserving of his place in the team.

1814~~~
Hope we get rid of him this summer.

1815~~~
Incredible isn't it. 4 years later he is still the bloody same, if not worse

1816~~~
Another abject Evans performance. He shouldn't be in the team

1817~~~
Really hate it instead of taking ownership he will lash out at younger players

1818~~~
Feel like I'm saying this after every game now. He really needs to go.

1819~~~
Another game, another crap performance. Nothing else to say.

1820~~~
We will sell him at the end of the summer and it's the right decision imo. Smalling is better and while I don't rate Jones either right now, he is of course a few years younger. Evans should be in his prime now, but he is a real liability instead. Evans and Fletcher are the negative standouts in our squad for me, which we have to replace with quality players.

1821~~~
I was surprised he had a go at Shaw after he himself elected not to head the ball that was his to deal with.
The irony was that Shaw cleared the ball away for a corner.

1822~~~
Utter crap. Playing in a world of his own. Worse, doesn't take responsibility.

1823~~~
He is not good enough but TBH we all know that and probably LVG think the same. I can see him leaving us in the summer.

1824~~~
He is nothing more than a constant liability.

1825~~~
Needs another one of those after today.

Absolute wank and his mistakes/lack of confidence destabilize the team.

1826~~~
one word   - liability
he just causes anxiousness

1827~~~
He hasn't played well or decent or okay in a single match this season.......poor and terrible.

There's a reason why we are defending and looking nervous in every match because of players like Evans.

1828~~~
It's a shame because he looked fantastic in his early years. Could've been great.

1829~~~
Not that I expect him to actually defend well bit at least he could stop to pretty much give away huge chances every game

1830~~~
He was rated for moments of Rio like positional sense and quiet confident possession alongside Vidic and the odd dominant header alongside Rio. All the parts of a decent defensive profile seemed to be there, he's just never brought them together. Years later and he's the same player as when he started.

1831~~~
Shite mistake there with Diouf, true, but I don't think he was that for the rest of the game.

1832~~~
Looks like he lacks the quality to meet the expectations of the club unfortunately. Interesting to see if he has any improvement in him yet, I hope so. 

I think it's fair to say Jonny seems like a determined character who will work hard to get better and not give up without a fight.

However I'd be lying if I said he couldn't be improved on.

1833~~~
He shouldn't start anymore, gives heart attacks to every fan.

1834~~~
I've never rated him. Could never tell what Fergie (and now LVG) saw in him.

1835~~~
Didn't Fergie once famously say he was the best defender in the country ?

1836~~~
What does he do in training that enables him to remain in the squad? he's awful and creates panic when he plays against other teams

1837~~~
He said that about Wes Brown too

1838~~~
He's surely got to go, he may not be suited to the back 3 more so than any of our other CB's, but he just looks a total liability.

1839~~~
He is not that young and inexperienced anymore, and it looks like he has reached his ceiling. Its a real shame, but I think its time for him to move on.

1840~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1841~~~
I think he's being unfairly singled out again today. Fair enough he deserves some criticism but not the level of criticism he is getting. Like I said at half time apart from letting the ball bounce that time in the first half which led to him getting into all sorts of bother he hasn't really done much else wrong. He actually saved our arses in the opening 10 minutes by making a good run back to intercept a Stoke player that was more or less ready to go on a run with the ball and take on De Gea 1v1. Fingers can't be pointed at him for the goal either.

1842~~~
Wes Brown without his injuries would have been world class.

But I always thought whenever Wes had a run of games he was brilliant.

1843~~~
Very true. He was immense in 2008 with Rio at CB when Vidic was out, especially against Barca in the CL semi.

1844~~~
Hoping he improves when (if) we switch to a back 4. He looks completely and utterly clueless in a 3.

1845~~~
Was thinking just before i logged on here after the match that the Evans bashers will be frothing at the mouth eager to lay into him again as Jonny was pretty poor today (as was most of the team). Then remembered Jones was actually worse and cost us a goal so he might draw all or at least most the flak today. No... guess i should know this place better by now.

Come here to find about 8 posts in the Jones thread and 3 pages of bile most of it during the actual match in this thread. 

What was that again lads about Evans not being a scapegoat?

1846~~~
He had some decent spells under Fergie but it was always next to a more experienced defender. He just can't be relied upon to lead. The moment between him and Shaw was laughable. He was happy to see the ball bounce in the box than clear it. It was his to deal with. Passing the buck tells me he doesn't need to be playing.

1847~~~
Looks beyond void of all confidence. The first half in particular was an absolute horror show. As he fecked up and lost possession in the box to Diouf I was there thinking to myself... Why do the center backs we play against never feck up like this?

1848~~~
Aye, looks more nervous than I've seen him at the moment. Whether that's down to his injuries, or just the lack of consistent games and form I don't know. He's a good player, but a sustained period of poor form under a new manager like this can kill you.

1849~~~
Wes was a potentially great defender ruined by injuries in his early years. He was a very good defender for years after.

1850~~~
He's not a scapegoat. He's just a shite player. He's like a cleverley standard player, will look more at home at an Aston Villa standard team then Manchester United. Had he not been a United youth player, he would have been sold years ago. Even the thing people tend to say he has over other defenders, his passing, is shite. He's weak, gets pushed around too easily, gets caught ball watching, and generally makes mistakes that lead to great chances every single game. Sure he can look decent in spurts, but who wants a defender who looks decent for 60 minutes and awful for 30? Jones isn't very good either but Evans is by far our worst defender.

1851~~~
Can't wait for Rojo to return.

1852~~~
He's not a scapegoat. Just an awful defender (based on this season).

How many mistakes has he done this season? On Carling Cup a few, then two or three against Liverpool, then against Benteke, then today. And surely I have missed some. All of them could have easily been goals (well, some of them were) if it wasn't for poor finishing and for the incredible De Gea.

I just don't get why people call scapegoats the likes of him (or Cleverley last season). Isn't a scapegoat someone who gets criticized unfairly? Well, that isn't the case here.

1853~~~
Its bold but I think now maybe true..

jonny evans is the worst defender in the league. I cannot think of one worse.

1854~~~
Problem with Evans goes beyond confidence now. We have spent the last 5 seasons making excuses to why he has moments like this. At least when he was younger for every bad game he would have it was replaced by a good one. Now he just looks like hes a liability whenever he wonders out onto the pitch. 

I think the time has come for us to cut our losses

1855~~~
Hate for him is unbelievable.

Voted for him as MotM.

He was the only defender not guilty for losing the goal.


Love for sheet Smalling is another strange thing...

1856~~~
The reason we are where we are (and were where we were last year) is because we accept shite like Evans as one of our senior defenders.

1857~~~
You may be right, but I think it's hard to tell for sure. I feel that the majority of his errors can still be put down to poor decision making due to him having a lack of confidence in his own abilities.

1858~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1859~~~
Motm? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1860~~~
He should be a back-up player at best, he isn't good enough to start for us. I would be surprised if Van Gaal doesn't ship him on.

1861~~~
Evans was horrific today, but Jones was inexcusably responsible for the goal.

The fix here is to repair Rojo asap and bench Evans, a defender who would be nowhere near the radar of Chelsea and City. Even Arsenal and Liverpool would have no use for him.

1862~~~
He had one season as a RB where he was awesome <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1863~~~
No, he's just a very shit defender, if he was at another club, we'll be killing him every week.

1864~~~
I thought some of the criticism of Evans was harsh, until today. He actually deserves to be behind McNair in the pecking order now. Looks a shadow of the player he was in 2013.

1865~~~
Yeah, because Diouf can't finish, his mistake for that chance was far worse than that of Jones for the opening goal. He's atrocious, the ball literally stops when he reaches him, he take longer than anyone else on the pitch to make a decision to pass it 5 yards, usually waywardly. He's shot, can't defend, can't pass, what's the point in him?

1866~~~
He's shit. And an idiot.

1867~~~
I'd agree with you when you say its all in his head. I'm almost sure it is but at a club like United you should be able to have that mental resilience to pull your socks up and get stuck in. All Evans does is hid/shy away from things and without personalities like Vidic and Rio we cant have him here any longer. 

Usually i support our players and give them time/benefit of the doubt but in Evans case (a bit like Cleverley) i just cant see us improving with him in the team

1868~~~
Needs to be shipped out.. Terrible at times..

1869~~~
Yeah MoTM for a player who could have cost us yet another goal this season. Was guilty of lossing possession countless times and was very weak in the tackle.

Jesus what do you expect from our CBs? At least Smalling and Jones both try to play the ball forward and get forward themselves to help in attacks along with being strong in tackles. Evans is the polar opposite.

1870~~~
Ship the bastard to Glasgow Rangers and make sure he stays there. If he wants to win titles on the rest of his miserable career, he can stay in the Scottish leagues.

1871~~~
Bit harsh? 

<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1872~~~
Our defense start out moves and it's probably why our moves rarely get going. There's no excuse for Evans. You either be a man or you go. We saw in pre season LVG backing Cleverly and Tom saying in a press conference he was the man. LVG saw though that. Needs to really step it up because he's showing himself not to be a leader. He's coming up to his prime and I'm sure we will look to do better in the summer. It's a shame. He's come through the ranks but too many of these players are either not good enough or do not work hard enough in training to become better players. Evans letting Diouf in when he had two chances to deal with it? Not good enough.

1873~~~
Agree, not sure why you'd hate Rangers so much.

1874~~~
I love Brian Blessed's use of English language, especially a bit from Blackadder. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1875~~~
Controversial.

1876~~~
Nothing. They are just working their asses off to get back where they belong; I'm just saying that Evans is SPL material.

1877~~~
I don't particular care for any Scottish team.

But calling our players pricks, bastards, dickheads etc is uncalled for, unless they are actually acting like a complete dick.

1878~~~
He was terrible and has been for a while now. Also, someone needs to tell him not to start mouthing off at others for his own mistakes.

1879~~~
He's an absolute tool at times. Mistakes today, passing was heavy when he joined the attack. Could have cost us the game.

1880~~~
Guys for feck's sake, it was a joke on my behalf <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1881~~~
To be fair to Jones and Smalling they are not consistently giving goalscoring opportunities away like Evans. I think most fans are recognising right now the standard he is showing is like Cleverley before him not good enough.

1882~~~
If you say so lads, and yet similar poor performances today from Evans and Jones result in vastly different reactions on here. A few posts in the Jones thread and pages worth of rubbish in here. He had a few decent games in a row there and this thread went quiet then a bad performance when most of the team were dogshit and again people pile in here (even during the actual match) to bash him. But all fair objective criticism i'm sure.

He's the Cafs new whipping boy it seems to blame all the teams failings on.

Come on mate Jones was as bad today. I never mentioned Smalling.



Isn't this the Evans thread?

1883~~~
Both Jones and Smalling were arguably at fault for giving away the goal today and Smalling wouldn't have been a million miles away from shouldering most if not all the blame if Crouch's header went in instead of hitting the post either. Then there was the hand ball in the box which we were very lucky to get away with.

If we're to judge all of our back 4 today on individual or potential costly errors I don't understand how or why Evans is being thrown to the dogs and Smalling is being praised as much as he is for his performance in an other thread. From what I can see it appears like Evans has been latched onto now and every little error he makes will be zoomed in on and the positive things he does will be largely ignored, it'll be the other way around when it comes to his defensive partners though.

1884~~~
They get different reactions because there are 5 years between them yet Jones has been much better while still being poor this season. Jones has time on his hands the nature of his mistakes are generally just different to Evans'.

1885~~~
I criticized Jones too (in fact, I never understood why he is so highly rated), but come on, he was better than Evans again. While both Smalling and Jones make mistakes, they are different to nonchalant mistakes Evans makes every week. Just look today, he is 10 yards ahead of Diouff but then slows down, thinks and so Diouff gets the ball, makes Evans his bitch before he goes one on one vs Evans. That's the type of mistake that you don't expect even kids too, let alone a player who has been playing on EPL regularly for 7-8 years.

Smalling actually played good and he has been by far our best CB this year.

Also, Cleverley was mentioned because it was the same thing last season. People criticized him for being shit, but then someone came and said that he has been unfairly criticized and is becoming a scapegoat, not mentioning how bad he was playing.

1886~~~
I'm losing faith in him. 

At the moment he's a shambles and he doesn't seem to bring together good performances for any significant amount of time.

1887~~~
He looked potentially top class alongside vidic or Ferdinand but he's an absolute liability without someone solid next to him. He's a good defender but makes far too many mistakes to be a regular here. Needs to be shipped out in the summer.

1888~~~
Jones hasn't been pulling up trees this season for United, in fact he hasn't been all that since we signed him 2011 and granted yes hes 22 and i have hope he will improve and become a good player and yes evans is 5 years older.

But none of that changes the fact Jones was just as awful today yet Evans is once again the one being vilified. Double standards.

1889~~~
To be fair mate im not exactly keeping track of which posters are criticizing which players. Only noticing that Evans comes in for much more flak when in fact Jones cost us a goal today and was generally poor in my opinion, just as bad and arguably worse than Evans.

I don't know about kids but how about Vidic he would never make similar mistake surely?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JSTgWNBBTk0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He has been mate i agree, coincidentally he is also the only centre back of the 3 to get a decent run in a back 4. And generally when hes had to play in a back 3 hes been in the centre. Makes life a bit easier for a CB when you have another CB either side of you no?

1890~~~
He's an absolute liability. He couldn't defend a long ball if his life depended on it. 

Thats really starting to piss me off.

1891~~~
Yep, that's always been his problem. Doesn't look anywhere near as comfortable when he's the main defender at the back, which is worrying at his stage. I'd hesitate to just get rid though, since he can be a decent player still when on form. I wouldn't rule out him improving and finding some better form again, although I don't think he's ever going to be top class.

1892~~~
Glad I'm not the only one who noticed this, it was embarrassing to watch really given that his own performances have been poor to say the least. We need to get rid of him in the summer, he's an average Premier League defender at best and would be better suited to a team like Hull or Sunderland which is more his level (Sorry to any Hull or Sunderland fans who are posters on here).

1893~~~
He's about the same level as Wes Brown. Not really good enough for united but would star for a midtable club team

1894~~~
I always thought the he was good for United, but with a quality partner. He had his flaws, but I did actually like him a lot.

But this season, he isn't even a championship player, he is psychologically really low down. 

He was never that bad (we can say what ever we want, but SAF would not have allowed him to be such a big part of the team, if he thought that he isn't good enough at least for rotation, lets just remember his loan spell at Sunderland), but this season something is really wrong with him.

1895~~~
To think he was been talked about as been our captain at the start of the season, if he doesn't up his game quickly he'll be first out of the door in the summer, has Sunderland transfer written all over it.

1896~~~
Another new stick he seems to be getting beat with now is him having a go at the other defenders and the keeper which as the senior player back there he should be doing. I would be worried if he wasn't, hes our most experienced defender the fact hes currently not in the best form is irrelevant. Given his experience and the defenders and keepers he's played with he's the logical choice to marshal the defence.

Yet there's loads of posts in here over the last few weeks criticizing his lack of leadership.

I guess right now Evans is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. Literally anything he does can be twisted into a criticism.

That could be a compliment to Evans or an insult to Wes Brown.

How many times did you see Brown play before his bad injuries mate? If not for his horrendous luck with injuries Brown would have been one of the best around, Wes was hugely talented. 

What was it 2 cruciate injuries one in each knee and a broken leg. That will feck up anyone's career.

1897~~~
He shouldn't be having a go when he's the one making mistakes. He had a go at Shaw today when Evans himself was the one at fault, tries to pass the buck. If he wants to show leadership then lead by example and play well.

1898~~~
Wes Brown was actually a quality centre back. Light years in front of Evans. 

Evans utd career is very quickly coming to an end. He is utterly atrocious.

1899~~~
No he was this bad previously under SAF. That season he was getting similar vitriol and people wanted him gone. Turned it around the next season and improved greatly and convinced a lot of people of his quality. For some reason, this season he's been back to that stage and looks lost again. The problem for him now is LVG is not SAF. Evans doesn't have history with him. Ferguson has seen the numerous good and great games Evans has had which vastly outnumbered the bad ones so he could let slip this form. Not so with LVG and he's older now. He's got until the end of the season to turn it around most likely.

1900~~~
Yeah I remember Ferdinand and Vidic mouthing off similarly when they had bad runs of form. They still berated their teammates for errors.

1901~~~
I don't remember that incident today mate so i have no idea if he was at fault. But you can't single out one incident like that and damn him for it, since he's came back he's been vocal and showed leadership in keeping younger defenders in line, how can that be a bad thing?

You say that like he's trying to play badly he's not. Hes was decent the last few games. 

So when he has a poor game like today he shouldn't pull any of the younger players for their errors? He should remain quiet and offer them no advice? 

Can't say i would be happy with any player who hid and shirked responsibility like that if i am honest.

Exactly mate all this lead by example stuff only applies in certain situations and rarely at the back. You need someone at the back who is vocal and takes responsibility regardless of their own current form.

1902~~~
The problem with Evans is that, by his standard, good game means only 1 Evans moment aka feck up. He always makes at least one mistake.

1903~~~
I disagree with that - watch every one of games for the last 3 seasons (particularly this season) and watch his distribution. He is utterly clueless at how to keep the ball. He continually plays the long ball down the channel and looks surprised when our midget attackers can't win a header. Add this alongside our knowledge of him being bullied by physical strikers and it doesn't equal a Utd centre back. 

Our defence is getting exposed because we have an inability to retain possession - Evans is a huge part of that problem.

1904~~~
I don't know what happened to him this season, but Evans is frequently facing problems with dealing with physical players. Before, it was Benteke. Now, it's Diouf. Evans just feels uncomfortable around them like he was during the 2009/10 season. Another issue I've seen arise from him is his lack of confidence in himself when on the ball. He tries to release the ball to quickly, unlike in the past, when he'd know when to carry the ball forward and when + where to pass the ball to. He seems to play too safely as a wide central defender when he should be more risky in his game when he has space in front of him. This game, he was decent at carrying the ball forward, but he was too slow in his game and gave lots of time for Stoke to organise themselves and read our other players' movements.

In terms of his man-marking and positioning, he's doing alright, but he gets too easily unsettled by the physical players and too often looks to release the ball quickly and safely or hoof it forward.

1905~~~
One word: Abysmal.

But dire will do.

1906~~~
I remember that season, but he wasn't this bad. He had more problems in a way that he would make maybe one mistake, but it would somehow always and up as a goal, or huge chance for the opponents so it was a problem, but this season he has 2-3 mistakes per game and mistakes which I just can't understand, because they come AFTER he gains the upper hand.

1907~~~
I'm not adding anything new but he looks shot scared of a ball played into a powerful forward at head height. He doesn't seem to be able to clear the ball out of our final 3rd when it's bouncing or at height.

1908~~~
Jones average rating this season: 6.1

Evans average rating: 4.8

Says it all really.

1909~~~
I think most people here are misjudging how good he was 2-3 years ago. IMO, he was never that good and he always made crucial mistakes, but most of the time Vidic and Ferdinand bailed him out and it wasn't so noticeable. As for mouthing off at defenders and De Gea, he was always this way. That's not something new at all. When De Gea was still new here, he was constantly shouting at him even when he himself made the errors, for some reason.

1910~~~
Don't think you can take those ratings seriously, Smalling's rating is 5.6, but he has had just 2 poor to bad matches.

1911~~~
Nah, Smalling started the season really poorly and because he's only played 11 games the City performance where he got 2/10 or whatever has dragged him down. Although I have to say his average rating from me is 6.2.

1912~~~
He did? He wasnt very poor vs Swansea, got injured vs Sunderland after a good half, then subbed in next to Blackett in the Leicester game, afterwards the City perfomance, that's about it. He was very good vs Chelsea, Arsenal, Hull, Stoke and Southampton until he got injured.

1913~~~
RvP has a 5.8.

Falcao has a 6.1.

Says it all really....


I don't think you can take the ratings too seriously.

1914~~~
Again I don't think that's particularly surprising. RVP was utterly useless before the last 7-8 games.

1915~~~
But the rating system is flawed, because if you look at all their performances you can't  say that RvP has been worse than Falcao this season.

1916~~~
Smalling is more than solid.

Evans was babysat by 2 of the world's best CBs, it was easy to look fairly good in that situation and thats all Evans did. He was never convincing with his physicality and none of his defensive skills stood out as something better than other young defenders. There was a myth that he read the game well, but there were countless times when he read the game poorly and that got him into trouble.

1917~~~
You disagree with what that he was decent against Spurs and Newcastle?

Then you are only letting yourself see the bad and ignoring the good mate, even in here the general consensus was he was good defensively against Spurs and had a decent game vs Newcastle.

No thanks mate, out of interest have you recently watched the 95 games he's played in the last 3 seasons? I will go out on a limb and say you haven't, because if you had you would realise the rest of your post is wild exaggeration.

1918~~~
I put very little stock in those ratings mate, no doubt after everyone of our recent matches there will have been a load of 1 and 2 votes for Evans from the bashers that frequent this thread regardless of how good or bad he played. 

Evans hasn't been great this season but neither has Jones, they should be roughly the same rating within half a point of each other with Jones slightly higher. The fact they are not proves my point, Evans is being more harshly judged for performances similar to what Jones is producing.

1919~~~
I disagree. Evans has been a level lower than Jones this year. I'd say Jones being a 6/10 and Evans being a 5/10 is about right. The fact that Evans is the more experienced one that should be stepping up to be the leader makes it even worse.

1920~~~
Jones wins the ball a lot but makes mistakes. Evans doesn't win the ball a lot and on top of that makes mistakes.

Of course Jones should be a lot higher rated for his season than Evans. If he didnt make the errors in judgement he'd be on par with the best CBs in the league

For example :

Jones averages 2.2 tackles and 4.2 interceptions a match - thats the most interceptions in the league with Jedinak 2nd at 3.8. Jones also averages 6.4 clearances a game, the most at United this season and 2.2 headers won per game. He's had 2 games where he was given the statistical man of the match, our most in RVP with 3

Evans averages 2.7 tackles and 1.9 interceptions. Thats 4th most tackles of United players, but the most of our CBs. He has 3.8 clearances a game which is behind Jones, Smalling, Rojo, McNair and Blackett - in that order. So Evans makes the least clearances out of the box out of our CBs including the youth players promoted. With 1.2 headers he's behind Smalling, Rojo, Jones - in that order. He's been given the statistical man of the match 0 times

Where Evans fares well is amount of passes and pass accuracy. He ranks 2nd out of our CBs behind Rojo in both, but like Rojo is very guilty of suicide passes that have given away chances to the opposition often which makes it hard to praise the other 90% of the time when he's doing okay with his passing.

1921~~~
That's your opinion and that's fair enough mate. I actually agree with Evans being a 5 i have Jones at around 5.5 though he's been generally poor for me. Evans may me older but players of all ages go through periods of really bad form RVP being a recent example. I actually think Evans has been showing some leadership despite his poor form, he's vocal in organising the defence.

1922~~~
Out of interest, do you think he's done a good job organising the defence?

1923~~~
Still true

1924~~~
Full of mistakes at the moment.  Not sure he'll survive the summer

1925~~~
Well we have looked decent defensively for the most part in this run of games so maybe, but i suspect it would be a very hard thing to judge.

He seems to be the only one who is vocal for the most part but who knows if his organisation has been a positive or negative on actual performances.

But the fact he is actually taking the responsibility of being vocal and organising the younger defenders could only be viewed as a positive with regards to Evans character could it not?

1926~~~
A completely unacceptable performance, that. Any continuation of that is a waste of our time.

1927~~~
Look lads i'll give Evans more leeway than most on here, but those reckless, stupid errors will cost us in the end. He's finished here. 

Not only him, the whole defense needs restructured.

1928~~~
An insult to Brown. Brown was class and you could depend on him to do a job. He was an athlete and way talented and stronger than Evans. A real insult to Brown. Even O'shea was better than Evans

1929~~~
He has been utter pony all season and I don't see him getting better. Not only is he a bad player, he feeds the opponent chances on a game-by-game basis.I cringe at the fact that he keeps making it in the team, I'd rather play Fosu-Mensah for feck sake.

1930~~~
I'd agree in that Brown was a much much better player than Evans during his prime. Terrible injury problems and he didn't really reach the level people were hoping for, but in terms of tackles, he was a beast. Had more pace too. And a lot stronger. For me, there isn't a particular strength Evans has. He's OK in some aspects, but too weak, too timid for one of our more experienced players who really should be a leader at the back. Would do well at a midtable club though.

1931~~~
This, Brown was actually a good player, Evans this season is like Evans in his first season for a 26 years old player, that's a disgrace.

1932~~~
And before this season Evans was a good player.

1933~~~
There are a lot of people who reckon Evans first full season 2008-09 was actually his best to date, when he played a big part in the run of what was it 14 straight clean sheets in the league. So that's a bit of a strange comparison.

1934~~~
He seems to shout at players the most right after his errors. Laughable player

1935~~~
How many times did he do that today do you reckon?

1936~~~
My memory is rubbish, was that his second season when he was literally afraid of his shadow ?

Edit: Are you sure of that ? because i remember him being good with Sunderland but rubbish with us.

1937~~~
Yeah, he was very good for at least the last two seasons, his level this season is unbelievable.

1938~~~
Can't say i remember him being too bad that season to be honest though i may be wrong. I do remember him having bad spells in 2010-11 and 2011-12 and then looking a good player again in Ferguson's final year.

1939~~~
Nah he had a bad season and lots of people were confident he'd be gone. Then he turned it around and was seen as as our best CB and not a great player but a very good one. Hence the calls for him as captain. Those bad spells you mention weren't really that bad as his second season and this one.

1940~~~
he will be very quick out of the door if he performs like that till the end of the season. Wouldnt surprise me to see him go in the summer after buying one or two centre backs. Cleverley didnt last long, same with Evans.

1941~~~
Really started to rate him prior to this season, particularly in the 12/13 season when he really was as good as if not better than Rio.

Has been woeful for the majority of this season. System or not, he just shits himself. Struggles with pacey players, isn't powerful enough to deal with a handful like Crouch or Benteke and has the most punchable face.

1942~~~
Thats pretty much how i remember his time here as well mate, though as i said i may well have been wrong about his form in 2009-10. I remembered his bad spell being later than that.

The only one of his early seasons i remember clearly was his first, he's never looked as good as he did back then since. But i still think he's been a pretty good player for us for the most part.

I reckon we will see a much improved Evans this season if he manages to get a run in a back 4 and not this abomination of a formation that we use right now. Jesus do i hate 352.

1943~~~
Goals conceded don't tell the full story. He has had several lapse of concentration that could have led to us conceding goals. He just wasn't being punished for it.

1944~~~
If all our other CBs including youngsters like Blackett and McNair can perform in 3-5-2 then why can't Evans? This is a weak excuse and i've heard it many times. Our so called best ball playing CB is also our least adaptable. Not good enough

1945~~~
The reconstruction of our defence should start with selling him.
He is clearly not cut out for first team play.

1946~~~
I think people on this forum are looking for a V.Kompany or J.Terry type level of player.
At present at least, J.Evans is not of this level.
However, the reasons why we have drawn in our last 3 away games is not Evans' fault.

LvG decided last Summer that the best way for us to win the league will be to be attack heavy.
Basically, we will out-score the opposition.
We got Di Maria, Herrera and Falcao to achieve this. All 3 have been injury prone and have not proved their worth yet. IMO Di Maria was a terrible purchase, but that's a discussion for another day.
We are drawing games not because of Evans, but because our attackers are not able to score more than 1 goal. And just to highlight, in 4 games with Evans in defence, we have conceded 3 goals, which I dont think is a bad statistic.

In comparison, in the last 4 games:

Man City have conceded: 5 goals.
Chelsea: 6 goals.
Man Utd: 3 goals.

Our issue is not the defence or Evans. The issue is our attack. Its injured/weak/limp and devoid of ideas right now. <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/our-lack-of-creativity-in-the-attacking-third.398273/">
Have a read</a>.

1947~~~
Smalling has been vocal too, just without the mistakes almost every game

1948~~~
His form this season would put him as a mid table level of player. All thats being asked of him is that he's solid when he plays, not that he's one of the top CBs in the league. So far he's been found wanting

1949~~~
I can't wait to see how money we will get for him in the summer

1950~~~
There was one moment today when Evans was screaming like a mad man at De Gea for no reason, like our keeper was the one who was messing everything up. Seemed like Jonny was really stressed.

The thing is with Jonny Evans, I understand it's difficult for him at the moment and he doesn't want to lose the ball and he's low on confidence and all that. But his decision making with the ball on his feet is ridiculous. The dithering is insane, he keeps on making 6 or more touches, after which he cuts back and plays a useless side- or backway pass. Or he hoofs it over Falcao after standing still with the ball for 10 seconds while two midfielders are free. And he's aware that it´s not going well with his passing, so the moment there is space to play a good pass, he hesitates and then, again, plays the useless simple pass to the first player tha comes available. We can never fully dominate a match with decision making like that.

Phil Jones and Smalling aren't perfect with the ball, but at least they aren't completely useless with it either, and I'm surprised how quickly they've showed progression, especially Smalling. Jones already played in midfield against Real Madrid two years ago, playing some passes with the outside of his foot, he's a really strange player and might actually be our best footballing CB at the moment.

Defensively Evans has had poor moments too, but our back three has also had some solid moments with him in it. But the way he missed that long ball yesterday, I fear for the worst. Jonny really needs to raise his game, and not a little bit.

1951~~~
He's starting to remind me of Cleverley. Time for LVG to drop his trouser.

1952~~~
The defence is definitely a massive problem, it just doesn't fully manifest itself as goals against due largely to us having the best GK in the league working overtime. I think we're the third worst in the league when it comes to chances conceded through defensive errors? That seems like a more accurate reflection of what we're seeing every week.

1953~~~
Let's make it simple, he is shite.

1954~~~
Terrible again. The Diouf mistake was laughable. He was lucky that chance came on Diouf's left. And the back pass against Liverpool should have been scored too. If these goals went in I don't think we would see Evans for a while.  

I backed him and rated him highly.  What has happened to his passing? He looks a shadow of the defender he once was. I guess he needs a strong partner with him to thrive. Sort it out.

1955~~~
If he still needs a strong partner at age 27 to mask his weaknesses, then we have a problem because he is supposed to be a leader at that age. IMHO, I think the best for all parties is to part ways with him during summer.

1956~~~
Evans has been absolute wank this season. We've had De Gea and opposition strikers missing chances to thank for not conceding far more goals. Think its time to sell, I'd rather his minutes be given to McNair.

1957~~~
Time is up for him. Needs to leave in the summer. 

We need to buy a new left sided defender, a potential leader of the defense, and let Evans go. Bring back M.Keane as the back-up academy CB in the summer.

1958~~~
He's weirdly good at dribbling. His passing is really average even for a CB, he doesn't move the ball fast enough to play in midfield regularly in games we expect to have a lot of possession. And we all know how wank his crossing is when he plays right back! Strange player indeed.

1959~~~
We have kept goals out in spite of Evan's presence. You can't hide a poor individual performance behind positive results. Evans has presented teams with chances to score with his sloppiness, he's been lucky not to be punished.

1960~~~
His fall has been quite dramatic. There was a time when people here were not bothered about Pique leaving because we had Evans. He was so assured for his age that he looked nailed to become a mainstay in our defence for the next decade. His decline started when he began to get bullied by physically strong strikers. He then recovered to become our best defender for awhile, although not quite at the level he was initially expected to reach. Over the last few years, though, he seems to be in freefall and now he just looks a bit pointless and mediocre.

1961~~~
I have not missed a game for many a year pal so if you want to assume that i have then on you go but I'm right about Evans distribution. You very clearly mistake my post for saying he was woeful in all games - I've said his distribution was which is a significant part of the problem.

As for Spurs and Newcastle. I'd ask you to watch them again and count the number of times Evans gives the ball away with a ridiculous hoof up the channel. 

As for ignoring the good - this is Man Utd for fecks sake. I'm not settling for a guy who can defend ok 3/4 of a game . We need better.

1962~~~
To be fair, it's understandable that his distribution is poor seeing as he's playing on the left side of the defence. In this 3-5-2 formation when the three defenders spread as much as they do, it's vital to have a leftie on the left. I'd have liked to see Shaw there, would likely have improved our ability to carry the ball out of defence.

1963~~~
I'd agree with most of that, but take exception to the idea that this decline has been several years in the making. Like almost every player at the club, Evans struggled for form in the "Moyes year", but the season before was excellent for a large proportion of the time. It's clear that his confidence is at an all-time low, as he appears nervous in possession, and even more so when required to control under pressure. 

On the other hand, I think he's definitely become the new club scapegoat since Cleverley left, and so many posters on here are now looking for any excuse to criticise him, when he is often no worse, and sometimes better, than some of our other defenders. It was particularly laughable that so many posters yesterday were outraged that Evans had the audacity to shout at other defenders - I'm pretty sure we've reached a consensus in the past that this is an area that's been lacking in our defensive unit.

1964~~~
Evans two footedness is one of his main assets, its obviously easier for a left footer but he should be more than fine. The problem was that when he had the ball on his left side he wanted to play long balls towards the box, which tended to give the ball away. If he was doing that with his right foot he'd probably lose the ball almost as much. Its just an unlikely avenue for us

1965~~~
I wouldn't say he's two-footed. He's pretty good with his left but he is much, much more comfortable with his right. A hoof is the safer option with your bad foot, as it involves less of a risk of giving the ball away in a dangerous spot.

Plus, it's not just Evans. As a team we just don't know how to move the ball from defence to midfield in this formation yet.

I'm not saying Evans isn't having a very poor season, I just think we should give him the benefit of the doubt for now. He's clearly in a form crisis but he showed under Fergie that he can be a very reliable defender.

1966~~~
They werent hoofs though. He had time on the ball and looked up and played a long pass towards the box - if we were Stoke it would have even have been a good idea and we'd have had some success as, playing to the left of the 3 he was able to get some decent angles to play the balls in instead of doing it centrally where its too flat. The problem is that when we play 30 yard high balls towards Stoke's box, we're very unlikely to retain the ball. We needed shorter passes from the likes of Rooney, Mata and Carrick over the top to get RVP in not high balls like Evans' ones. But they werent hoofs, just the wrong kind of pass that made it unlikely to keep the ball.

1967~~~
Whatever you want to call it, I'd still argue that he'd perhaps feel more secure in putting long passes forward instead of risking conceding possession in a very dangerous area by attempting a flat pass into the middle of the pitch with his left. I'm not saying it's the right decision or that it isn't a bit gutless, which is a general problem in our distribution from the back and not unique to Evans, just that it's understandable seeing as it <i>is </i>an awkward position for him. He's essentially playing left-back and while he did that at times under Fergie as well, it was solely for emergencies.

1968~~~
Yes I can see your point and I do think he's a bit awkward on the left of the 3. 

I just don't think he should be and its more about his head than anything else. Bad choices because of a lack of confidence, not because a right footer with a good left foot can't play towards the left side.

1969~~~
The way he's playing he has absolutely no chance of getting a game in a back 4 - even more so after Rojo returns. He's playing himself out of the team at the moment.

Those comparing his "errors" with Smalling marking Crouch are completely missing the point. Losing your man at a corner or being beaten in the air by a giant like Crouch is completely different from having a 5 yard head start in a sprint, losing the ball through lack of urgency and then dribbled past by a limited player like Diouf from a standing start. It is also completely different from letting every long ball bounce including one cross in the 6 yard box and playing a suicidal pass in the penalty area (after the Smalling handball).

One is trying to do the right thing and being outplayed. The other is being an absolute idiot. After the MK Dons, Burnley and Liverpool passes, his decision to try a pass like that in his own area was lunacy. Maybe it is confidence related but he is making far too many mistakes. He is also bullied by any physical striker. It is really sad to watch at the moment.

1970~~~
Countless times he gets bullied by players. Even last week against Newcastle in the first half, I think Perez was chasing him and he falls over, if Perez had played the right pass they could have had a good chance to score.

This year he's added dodgy back passes

But it's just predictable how he gets bullied by the likes of Diouf, Elmander, Cole, Zamora and other big lumps.

1971~~~
I'm glad that everyone seems to be in agreement now, Johnny Evans has given stevoc and Getsme a difficult corner to fight from here.

Appalling from start to finish.

The level he is displaying is comical.

And before it's said, I don't want him to fail - he has just proved he is not good enough for a long time. I want him gone for the sake of our success.

1972~~~
The feck are you on about, a corner to fight? The fact you think it's a fight suggests you are looking at the situation from a completely different angle to me. You say you don’t want him to fail but are happy that ‘everyone seems to be in agreement’ that he’s not god enough. The majority of posters on this form might be in favour of getting rid, but they don’t speak for all United fans, you do know that right?

Further, no one from what I can see has said he's played well this season, however he has been nowhere near as bad as this site would have you believe, he is being used as the scapegoat and thankfully some of us have a memory that goes beyond this season. Football fans are so fickle, it wasn’t long ago that Smalling was considered the worst defender in the Club, now he’s seen as some sort of defending God by some, same as Evans last season, he’s went from the Clubs best defender to the ‘worst defender in the league’

1973~~~
People should be the ones asking you "what the feck are you on?", Getsme.

Evans has been nothing short of being too daft to take the leadership role while feck-ups have become a trademark of his game. When you see that from a defender at that age, you ought to be worried. With the way he plays and the way he dodges any opportunity to acknowledge he's been shit, it's not too harsh to say that Evans is turning into SPL material. If you want a case for comparison, look at Tom Cleverley; it's turning into a similar situation.

1974~~~
It's all black and white with this forum, isn't it?

His confidence is clearly lost.  It's not as if everything he does is shit but fact remains that he gives the ball away in dangerous position once or twice every game.  Soon as he cuts that shit out he'll be alright.

1975~~~
So, because I have a memory that goes back further than this season, and that I’m not joining in on the scapegoating that the Evans thread has become I should be asking myself ‘what the feck am I on’? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Evans made one mistake yesterday, thankfully it didn’t lead to a goal but it did lead to page after page of abuse aimed in his direction, where as an error from Smalling and Jones, that did lead to a goal was met with near silence, actually one or two on the matchday thread tried to blame Evans for the goal. And before you mention it, no he didn’t have a good game, either did Jones, Smalling, RVP, Carrick, in fact all but Falcao didn’t play to any level that could be considered acceptable.

I have no issue with moving Evans on, I’ve said it many many times, however I refuse to rewrite History and join in on the scapegoating and abuse that is being thrown in his direction, especially when he is getting used to a new system in which he is clearly uncomfortable with.

1976~~~
Seems low on confidence has really lost that solid style defending that he had a few seasons back when he'd come in for Rio and Vidic and be just as solid alongside. I wonder if its cos he needs a leader alongside him to talk him through the game. And in a relatively (compared to Rio and Vidic) inexperienced pairing of Smalling and Jones (and Shaw next to him) he lacks that influential partner to talk him through the game.

I guess only Rio, Vidic, Evra etc could tell you how much they used to do that.

1977~~~
Your posts lacks coherence and structure.

'A corner to fight' is the phrase which signifies your stance in the matter, creating an argument to suit your opinion which lacks substance and objectivity.

It has become a discussion of 2 sides. One side, which the majority would lean towards, being the Evans is not good enough and the other side, the opposite of that. I can guarantee you that the majority of United fans would not be sad to see the back of him. Obviously redcafe doesn't speak for all united fans but I'm sure the the general consensus of those aren't that far apart. 

Smalling has never received this kind of backlash as he hasn't warranted it, he might have had dips in form but so do all players. Look at him now blooming in his favoured position.

Evans on the other hand has been on a downward spiral for a long time, and it's no longer about form, it's about his level. He can't have any complaints as he has been given all the opportunities someone could ask for, always being played in postion and always given the benefit of the doubt that not all youth are agforded. I've never rated him as you would see from my posts over the past 5 years. 

The way he goes about his business is a bit embarrassing always pointing he finger and shouting at others when he is clearly just frustrated by his inabilities but not willing to take ownership.

1978~~~
Confidence looks shot which is a shame after 2 good performances vs Newcastle and Spurs. I think the only way he could get back to the level he is capable of (and I still believe that at this stage that Evans has reached the highest level of all of our centre backs) is if we were to go to a back 4. Looks lost in that left back type position.

But to be honest if we revert to a back 4 then he doesn't deserve to be one of the 4!

1979~~~
Are you that blind? He only made one mistake?do me a favour! I counted a large handful of instances which were mistakes, additionally his overall being on the pitch creates an uncertainty.

1980~~~
Yawn
Same old shit.

1981~~~
Go on then, tell me these large handful of mistakes.

1982~~~
Did you count or make note of all the mistakes the rest of them made or just the Evans mistakes? 

I kept a real close eye on Evans yesterday and apart from the one where he let the ball bounce and got into a bit of a situation he didn't really do anything else wrong.

1983~~~
I like Johnny and on reflection he's been solid dependable defender. I think playing in a back four with arguable either one of the two best CB's in the history of the club, and a LB equally so, is going to help. Johnny has 120+ caps for Utd and 31 international caps so at 26 years old, he's no McNair. There are always casualtys of change and unfortunately he may be one of them. I'm guessing he needs to move on and he'll a decent club cause he's no way near as bad as people are making out. He's just the latest forum dog to kick.....

1984~~~
Before Leicester(?) , he made the "soft back pass to De Gea" mistake, in every game, against Leicester he is the one supposed to mark Ulloa instead of playing in no man's land.

He created around 4 or 5 clear chances for the opposition, that's too much.

1985~~~
I just hope that if/when he gets sold, it's not to a (perceived) rival. The Welbeck thread is bad enough.

1986~~~
Leicester? Again, what are you on about?

1987~~~
Johnny would look a better player in an Arsenal shirt.....

1988~~~
That's enough to be awful, shite, and terrible to boot.

At least noone called him a moron, which was a fate Smalling some time ago had.

1989~~~
What Leicester, he didn't played against Leicester ? And you don't remember his miss weighted passes to De Gea, from Swansea to Leicester ?

1990~~~
That's nonsense too, Jones was outstanding before his injury on international duty. He has certainly been unimpressive since his return, but he started the season very well for club and country.

1991~~~
Blackett and McNair have performed well in a back 3? 

I must have missed that. I remember McNair getting subbed because he was so bad and being replaced by a midfielder in defence. And generally being poor except for his first few games in a back 4.

Blackett was alright in a few games at the start of the season hasn't had a look in since Evans has been fit.

Not even mentioning Jones has also looked poor in a back 3, which is more of a surprise when you think about it for a player who has played a lot at right back and in midfield unlike Evans.

1992~~~
Nonsense? Ok, i never said he didn't have any good games just for the most part over the whole season he hasn't been brilliant which is true is it not? 

Ergo the expression he hasn't been pulling up trees.

1993~~~
I have literally no idea why you've started talking about Leicester.

1994~~~
Your contribution to this debate is starting to look little more than plain old trolling now.

1995~~~
No, he's been outstanding apart from the games he's played in recently. He was our best defender up until his injury. Jones is already 10 times the player Evans is despite being 5 years younger.

1996~~~
How?

1997~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Give it a rest

1998~~~
Is seven seasons not considered long?

1999~~~
I'm serious, how?

2000~~~
I said no such thing re-read my post, you invited me to watch 95 games in one go did you not?

I assumed you hadn't done that yourself am i right? Being a United fan for 30 years it's safe to assume i have also watched almost every game in the last 3 years.

Again i said no such thing, i don't for a second think you meant he was woeful in every game. But you said his distribution has been woeful for 3 years. Come on mate even amongst United fans most would agree until recently that was probably the strongest part of his game.

Once again mate i think you are reading my posts but misunderstanding them. Your initial reply to me was that you disagreed with my assertion that he was decent in the last few games. I don't need to watch them again, i watched them a few days ago he was decent. Maybe decent means something very different to you than it does to me and most other people

Did he hoof the ball up field yes, did Jones also yes he did. Did they do this because of lack of passing options in midfield or because they were instructed to, i have no idea.

But despite the hoofing he still had two decent games defensively. Decent nothing more which is all i said.

Did i say somewhere he wasn't mate?

2001~~~
Lack of form and injuries, could say the same of half the squad. He's a good player just unfortunately anyone who plays in defence is going to be under the spotlight. Was the same for CM last year. Carricks doing the same as he's was doing last year but now without the critism.

Every forum needs a dog to kick, pick a CB.....

2002~~~
He injured himself against Leicester, which put an end to his bad spell.

2003~~~
You've got me, I'm completely lost as to what you are talking about.

2004~~~
Nah, he's not getting off that easily. He has been poor for longer than he has been good in his entire United career. And he's 27, not 22. In fact, the further back you go, the better he was. He hasn't been good for a long time now, just levelled out at average here and there for a few spells.

2005~~~
Outstanding is a stretch i would say he did have a good run before his injury. But judging him over this season as a whole he hasn't been brilliant that's a fact.

10 times the player? Jesus he must be good can't wait to see it. And 5 years younger as well how much better will he be when he's 27 then 20 times better? Or is that hyperbole?

2006~~~
Injuries? Why is it then that everytime Smalling comes back from one he looks the best CB we have almost every time?
Evans doesnt have the balls to be a top CB. He is not strong enough physically and mentally I fear. 

The excuses in this thread are hilarious. That mistake yesterday was unbelievable. You shouldnt give away those balls in Sunday league. But do those things happen once to him? No he has at least one big feck up in almost every game he plays for us.

He either grows a pair or fecks off it's that easy atm.

2007~~~
Corner to fight? Im not fighting Evans corner more pointing out that other players can play like shit and have similar poor performances and get off without much criticism but Evans has poor game and gets vilified on here.

Would it surprise you to know i have never really liked Evans that much or ever rated him particularly highly? And i have said as much in here a few times. Never thought he would be anything more than a decent/good squad player.

But this bandwagon circle jerk scapegoating of one of our own players and a product of our academy no less, is what i find distasteful.

2008~~~
How the feck is that a fact? No, judging him over the season as a whole, he's been great. What don't you get? He was brilliant, got injured, and now he's back as of last week, he's slowly getting back to speed albeit looking a little rusty.

I find it funny how you're oh so willing to slate Jones and undermine his performances for United but are backing Evans, whose been crap for a long while now, to the hilt. You're hilarious!

And Jones isn't ten times the player Evans is because he's so good. It's because Jonny is so bad. He has no business playing for Manchesyer United anymore.

2009~~~
I have to admit I do agree with whichever poster mentioned that it's a bit bizarre how much stick Evans is getting, compared to Jones. Jones and Smalling both contrived to mess up for the goal, Jones was even worse in my opinion. It's a tactic that Stoke use, get Crouch on the first ball. It's up to the lads then to make sure they get the second ball, let's face it, with Crouch's height, he's most likely to win the first one, and Jones was absolutely terrible, just absymal, the way he let Shawcross go. 

I did mention in the Jones thread that he's completely overrated. Someone there said they didn't think he was, then I see someone here calling him outstanding? Jones? Really? The same lad I see regularly being caught out of position, regularly having to make last ditch challenges, and regularly costing us goals with hairbrained mistakes?

Even still, I don't think we're scapegoating Evans at all. People can say "Oh I remember when he was our best defender." Yeah, he had decent patches. But as a whole, I really don't think he has been a good player for us. There's been more bad than good with him, and he only really looked comfortable with a confident, experienced, world class defender beside him, be it Rio or Vidic.

Someone here is making excuses for him about the formation. Well, in my opinion, that's another reason to get rid. If he can't adapt and can only play in a back 4, then get rid. I am loving what Louis is doing. He's making changes and trying things, he's giving the players some adaptability. We haven't had that in a long time. OK, the 3 at the back doesn't look great at the moment, yet we're still going on a good run with it.

In my opinion Evans just isn't good enough. This isn't scapegoating. This isn't knee jerk reaction to his appalling displays this season.

This is based on watching him every year for United. I've seen, as I said, a lot more bad than good. 

I'll put it to you this way - how many of you aren't nervous when they're attacking, and they're attacking towards Evans? Because I bloody am. Every single time. 

He's about as self assured as I would be if I was back there!

2010~~~
Well yes, in the post I quoted you said Evans seems to be the only one vocal and organising things. Smalling is shouting at people and trying to get them to move too, so Evans cant be the only one

2011~~~
Never said he was Steve Bruce but he's was never held up to be anything other than what he is....a good squad player. Every team needs them but it's equally how they are used. Phil N, O'shea et al where the same. When they were over relied on, showed their failings. Once we sign a least one world class CB's, and all players are fit, Johnny will resume his position in the team.

2012~~~
Fair enough. But even a squad player shouldn't give the ball aways as easily, especially as a CB, as he did against Diouf. Just baffled that some are so hurt about him getting the criticism he deserves after his last outings.

2013~~~
He hasn't been brilliant. Vidic in his prime was brilliant, Stam was brilliant Jones has never played that well, and definitely not this season. He was good got injured came back and has been alright to poor. Which is what i would expect from a player returning from a spell out and having to play in an unfamiliar system.

I'm not slating Jones i for the most part actually like Jones you won't find any posts from me bashing him on here, i'm just using him to highlight how two players like yesterday can have poor games yet draw very different reactions and levels of criticism.

No where have i said Evans is brilliant. No where have i said i would be sad if Van Gaal sold him this summer. This is more about the abuse one of our players is unfairly receiving in this thread than me caring about Evans.

2014~~~
Well fair enough mate but i was generally speaking about this last run of games where Smalling hasn't featured.

2015~~~
No more than rest of them at the back Evans will be grand once LvG figures out that whatever system he is trying to implement or whatever way he wants them to operate won't work. I would have thought he would have it figured out by now going by the amount of individual and costly errors being made by them so far. As a unit or between them they can't even get the bread and butter stuff of defending right, none of them look like they know what they are supposed to be doing and that's contributing an awful lot to the mistakes.

2016~~~
cant wait for him to be starting for hull or west brom.

2017~~~
I'm not sure he will to be honest. Phil Neville and O'Shea are good comparisons. Wes Brown too. When they got to the age where it was clear they would never become first team regulars they were moved on and replaced with younger players with more potential. United already have 3 of those. I would be amazed if Evans was still at the club next season.

I find it quite sad because he probably had the ability to make it but he hasn't improved the glaring weakness in his game. He had a huge opportunity this season and just hasn't taken it at all.

2018~~~
i meant under van Gaal

2019~~~
The irony of this post makes me chuckle.

2020~~~
We have different views on him. A decent good squad player is Brown or O'shea, players who should not be starting regularly but can come in on occasion and do a job when required. The problem is though, Evans role isn't that, he is a regular starter and the most experienced centre back that the youth are supposed to look up to, but he isn't even reaching the levels required of a squad player.

My anger towards him stems from his bad attitude. He isn't a natural leader so whenever he is shouting and pointing, he isn't being constructive, he overcompensates for this inability, it is just angry and irrational, part of the problem is his mentality. He doesn't appear to see mistakes in his own game, rather he looks to others to pass it to. Shouting at De Gea and Shaw displayed this. 

So what he came from our academy? He has been given a long enough period to prove himself and by conducting himself in what appears to be an immature way, he has lost the free pass to hide behind the home grown tag. He is hardly a character that youngsters should look up to, he obviously doesn't spend enough time in the gym (he hasn't addressed his weakness), he clearly is mentally weak and as I said before he doesn't take ownership for his actions. Our young defenders should not be looking in his direction for a role model. They should be learning from much higher quality.

Jones and Smalling still have a lot to prove but at least they have the youth on their side. Evans now has the remaining league games to enjoy life at manchester united as he will be gone by end of the season.

2021~~~
Spot on.

The two central defenders who seem to be getting the least criticism are Rojo and Smalling. It's clearly not a coincidence that they also happen to be the only two who have had the opportunity to play in a familiar formation (familiar to them and everyone else in the team) In contrast, Jones and Smalling has exclusively played in a formation where nobody seems to have much of a clue what they're doing. Which is bound to unsettle individuals and lead to the type of mistakes we've seen from them so far this season.

Hopefully, Van Gaal will show a bit of faith in his fullbacks so we can drop this awful cocking formation and give the likes of Jones and Evans the same opportunities to shine that Smalling and Rojo have had. Meanwhile, the tedious scapegoating we've seen in this thread is going to crack on regardless.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> jesus wept...

2023~~~
If O'Shea and Brown were here today there could be a good argument put forward for starting them so I hope we have better luck when or if we're going to replace Evans with a younger model that has potential.

2024~~~
We have previously covered most of this mate, i don't  agree some of your views and we have different opinions that's fair enough lets leave it at that.

On the bolded part Smalling is only a year younger than Evans, he is 26 this year. I personally hope he can get over his injury problems and fulfill his obvious potential. 

Or in he not too distant future there may be a Smalling thread on here where people are ripping him to shreds after every little mistake.

2025~~~
Are you being serious? Brown or O'Shea?! I'd love to hear that argument!

The point was that United will sign a first choice in the summer and already have younger and better defenders than Evans in Smalling, Rojo and Jones. Keeping Evans as a squad player is unlikely. This season is his opportunity to become first choice and he's not taking it.

2026~~~
Whoaaaa you went to far here.

2027~~~
Tbh his constant wave arming towards the ref when he is pushed off the ball again can be a bit annoying.
More of a bad habit than attitude though.

2028~~~
I don't think so. Any time I've seen the pair of them this season I've been really impressed. Their defensive display against Chelsea in particular has been the best I've seen in a long time.

2029~~~
They have all put in good performances and have looked comfortable in 3-5-2. Evans has had issues with it going back to preseason. Blackett and McNair have outperformed Evans this season. Jones had two MOTM performances in a back 3 early in the season before his injury. You're clutching at straws in your blind defense of Evans

2030~~~
Usually, I would see that as a reflection of his attitude. When I combine his reaction to the tone of his post-match comments from yesterday, I have the feeling of living again what we have seen with Cleverley.

2031~~~
Which player doesn't wave his arms after being fouled yet hearing no whistle?

2032~~~
Sort of confusing post. Smalling is familiar with 3 at the back??

2033~~~
What godfather said.

Come on be fair, its hard not to get frustrated by his manner/ approach/ attitude whatever you want to call it.

2034~~~
Evans is 27 tomorrow, Smalling isnt 26 until the end of the year, there is 2 years between them bar 1 month. 2 years is a long time in football.

2035~~~
We've let in 3 goals since Evans has taken up his 1st team CB position.
1 goal (penalty) - Phil Jones was directly/solely responsible.
1 goal (against Stoke) - Jones and Smalling were culpable.
The other goal - not sure, you have to remind me.

Evans is not the reason for our draws.
He may lack footballing intelligence, invention and attacking prowess, but that's what Blind is there for (once he returns). Evans can pass Blind the ball, all day long and Blind will spray the ball forward, in all directions.

I agree that for us to win the CL, we cannot rely on Evans, but Evans is not our weakest link at this point in time. Our defensive record is now one of the best in the league.

2036~~~
Name them. When have Smalling and Rojo put in a good performance and looked comfortable in a 3-5-2?

2037~~~
When is Blind back?

2038~~~
I think you missed the point of my post mate, Smalling doesn't exactly have youth on his side. He's not a youngster he will be 26 this year.

2039~~~
But Smalling have been consistently good, he only struggle when he comes back from injuries or sometimes when he played right back.

<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>  I couldn't remember one game where Rojo played in a back 3, so i cheated and looked he played against Southampton.

Was he good, i can't remember ?

2040~~~
In what games did McNair look comfortable in a back 3? It certainly wasn't in any of our recent games.

Blackett looked alright early in the season but i would expect a left back by trade to be more comfortable in the left of 3 CB's. Certainly more comfortable than a right footed centre back. 

If Blackett and McNair have outperformed Evans why aren't they in the team in place of him then when both are fit?

Jones had some good games before his injury, but in our recent run he hasn't looked comfortable in a back 3 for me he was poor yesterday.

2041~~~
No i understood the point but Smalling at 25 still is in that development phase, where over the next 2 years, which will take him to the same age as evans, he should fufill his potential, if not then it will be time to look for an upgrade.

I think your just wording it to make it sound that their ages are closer than they actually are! 2 years is a long time of development in football dont forget!

Smalling has also played at right back more than centre back in his time at Old Trafford, which must been confusing. Evans hasnt been given this disadvantage.

2042~~~
As bad and all as Evans is supposed to be no one gave him a roasting like the one Burnely's Afrield gave Blackett this season. Blackett's performances taking all things into account have been nothing more than just alright.

If you're going to go down the road of ridiculing the shite of players or defenders for poor performances or making possible costly errors well then it might be no harm if you went full hog besides setting your sights on the one lad because that's all you and a fair few others are doing on this thread now.

2043~~~
He just turned 25 on november 22.

2044~~~
I guess MK Dons was a better performance. Sure thing

2045~~~
Thanks for the info mate but whats your point?

2046~~~
My point is he's still got time to develop into an even better player. You make it sound like he's turning 26 sometime soon. I just had to add that he just turned 25.

2047~~~
Yeah he does still have time to improve and i hope he does. I make it sound like he's turning 26 this year which he is that's an indisputable fact. I'm not sure what you are disagreeing with exactly.

Some of you lot have Evans washed up at 26-27 and yet Smalling at 25 has all the time in the world it seems. Truth is both are still relatively young for centre backs both can still improve.

2048~~~
It's the same as Cleverley and Anderson. Every year these shite players have their threads filled with a few delusional supporters of theirs, endlessly bashing on about how spacegoated they are, and then when they've fecked off either out the club, to the U21s, or to the feckin glue factory, nobody misses them. As I've always said, Manchester United should have genuine world class players throughout the lineup, and replacements who are either 100% reliable, solid, 7/10 players or hungry youngsters.

Evans is never going to be a WC centre back, is MASSIVELY unreliable, mediocre to shite, weak, slow, can't concentrate, can't head a ball, isn't young, so what is the point of having him around? There isn't one.

2049~~~
I think comparing Evans's age to Smalling's doesn't fit the plot.  I admit that I like Smalling so I'm biased but Smalling has shown much more from his recent performances than Evans has.  Evans has made mistakes that are unacceptable on any level of professional football, let alone PL, and he seems to make them <i>every </i>game.

I was shocked when Evans in that one sequence defended against Armstrong in the Newcastle match.  A 25 year old international almost completely bottled it against a 17 year old kid.  Pathetic.

Same thing against Diouf at Stoke.  Has a situation where he needs to assert himself and play the ball, gifts them a chance.

I want Evans to turn it around, I really do.  A couple of seasons back I would readily have accepted him into the starting XI alongside Vidic.  He looks too far gone now for whatever reason and needs to be replaced.

2050~~~
There is a 2 year age gap between them. Not sure why you keep trying to insuiniate that they are of a comparable age.

One is in a development stage the other has just entered his prime.

2051~~~
I think I've been one of these fans you describe there in the past and I must say I'm now inclined to agree with you. We haven't missed any player that left last summer. And aside from a few good games from Nani in the Champions League and Welbeck's general game-to-game effectiveness for Arsenal, not one of them has flourished having left the club. I always like to see the best in our players, and still maintain faith in much of the squad, but the reality is that when there has been a common consensus of late, the consensus has generally been correct. Evans is no scapegoat, he's simply playing shite.

We should have quality running all the way through the team and I welcome the briefings Ed Woodward has supplied the press in relation to having two excellent players for every position on the park. I've always liked Evans, and there's still a good defender in there somewhere, but I think it's time to bring in a replacement that can walk straight into the side and improve the defence.

2052~~~
This is true, they can both improve. However, people have run out of patience with Evans. At what point does one just give up and accept that a player isn't good enough overall? Evans is 27 with a huge question mark over his career. He's been a first team member since 19 and he had a proper loan to aid his development. He has way more experience and games than Jones and Smalling, yet next to them he's looked a level or two below them this season. In my opinion he simply hasn't been good enough. Even if he became a backup player his injury record would still make him very unreliable.

2053~~~
Spot on

2054~~~
Tbh this place can be really harsh, and I can go over the top especially after shitty games as well.
I don't think that he is a shit player neither. Just that he lacks a lot of confidence, and sadly, a bit of physicality in his game. The confidence thing is why I think he really must man up. He is our most senior CB atm and he should be handling bad periods better imo.

2055~~~
I'm not sure why you seem to be so hung up on this and what exactly you are having a hard time understanding. Evans turns 27 this year 2015, Smalling turns 26 in 2015 same year. There is less than two years between them in age, had they went to the same school Evans would have only been a year ahead of Smalling.

Even if there was 2 full years between them they would still be around the same age both in their mid twenties.

So given all this information please explain how they are not comparable in age?

Who decided this you?

Do you create these theories and assume not only are they fact but also that everyone else automatically subscribes to them?

2056~~~
Different people have varying levels of patience when it comes making judgements on players. Personally i decided Evans would never be world class or a first team player here long ago, for me he would always be a squad player in the O'Shea/Butt mould. I like Smalling and still think he can come good, if he sorts his constant injuries out he will.

With Jones it's more hope as for me he's never came close to fulfilling his early hype but he's still very young so he has time, but i have yet to be seriously impressed with him.

But that's true of all 3 of them. All 3 are injury prone and while i hope they get over this i don't have much faith that they will at this stage especially Jones.

To be brutally honest while its impractical and it won't happen. If i was LVG and could get in 2 quality defenders who would each give you 30-40 games a season i would sell 2 or maybe even all three this summer. I really like Smalling and would be sad to see him go but these annual defensive injury crises have to stop one way or another.

Every year we are forced to cobble teams together with midfielders in defence and it costs us. I reckon with a settled back 4 this season we could have another 5-8 points and be in with at least a shout for the title.

2057~~~
I agree with you mostly. I don't even think a player like Hummels is the answer because he seems quite injury prone himself

2058~~~
Poor spells more than good ones? List them please.

2059~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2060~~~
I would say it's a lack of genuine natural leadership which he misses. He looked brilliant next to Vidic or Ferdinand, as they did all the shouting and organising. Whilst he might technically not be a terrible defender, his lack of leadership is a significant problem when he is by far our most experienced and senior defender. 

Even a confident and on form Evans would still have this problem.

2061~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you're brilliant.

2062~~~
Evans isn't being made out to be a scapegoat. He's just crap and hasn't looked up to it for two years now. Sure, he has talent, but we don't have time to wait for four of our senior centre backs to suddenly blossom especially when they keep getting injured.

Simply put, our defenders are rubbish compared to the top teams. If we wanna get back to what we used to be, we need a solid defence. Smalling is the best of the lot, followed by Rojo, Jones and then Evans. That's a lot of mediocrity (albeit a lot of potential in the case of the former three) in those ranks. We simply need to bring in a better starting centre back or two and it only makes sense to get rid of the worst (and oldest) one as there's no point in having that many defenders.

There's only so much time you give some of our defenders too, Evans being given the longest, yet still finding it difficult to impress. To add that, the British trio can't stay fit to save their lives so slowly one by one, if they can't prove their fitness, they should be shafted out and replaced. Evans, however, is the first one that needs to be shown the door.

2063~~~
A rearguard defensive effort for a team like Sunderland vs Chelsea is a very different type of defending than 90% of games United defenders play in. I've got a terrible memory but watch Lampard's winner vs Sunderland. He was the only threat in the box and he got a free header (didn't even have to jump) from 10 yards out with Brown just looking at him. Far worse than any of the mistakes Smalling was being criticised for at Stoke. Even when he was at his best Wes was capable of some terrible howlers.

2064~~~
So do we not count the glaring chance Evans gave diouf, because it wasn't scored? That was just as bad a mistake as any of the others. He compounded that in my view when he left the ball bounce again about 5 minutes later. This time he got away with it but just shows the guy is very slow to learn. I'm simply saying, the guy isn't good enough. Every week he makes at least one awful mistake. The fact they don't all lead to goals does not make it ok in my opinion.

2065~~~
He has made a right few errors this season to be fair and centre forwards are trying to rough him up (that's the last thing you need). Would be good as a back up but we now have Rojo Smalling and Jones. We need a better quality of centre half than the 3 we have (a leader) so one has to make way imo. Evans due to performances is the one in danger.

2066~~~
I hope that these Hummels rumours remain as that, just rumours. We must use our scouting to find that defender or couple defenders that we need and not perpetuate this thing of throwing away £40m+ in fees at our problem areas. Our limit should be thirty million and that is enough to get Godin in, play him alongside Smalling with Jones and Rojo as back ups. If we buy Godin then someone has to make way and on current form there is no doubt who that is.

2067~~~

Evans almost gifted a goal to Mame Biram Diouf at Stoke
<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maVsd5Rq2Wg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"F*****g wake up," Sir Alex Ferguson barked at Jonny Evans</a> inside the San Siro nearly five years ago.

Evans is still stirring.

The Northern Irishman looked as confused to be in 2015 as Marty McFly at the Britannia Stadium on Thursday. Mame Biram Diouf ought to have punished his haphazard defending with Stoke ahead but Evans was reprieved.

He wasn't the only defender to amateurishly allow the ball to bounce and struggle to cope with Stoke's artisans. Louis van Gaal wrote in his notes one player had conceded a "stupid" free-kick, as Chris Smalling encouraged Stoke with a needless foul, Phil Jones disobeyed David de Gea and Michael Carrick failed to protect United's flimsy defence.

The Evans-Smalling-Jones triumvirate started together for the first time at Stoke this season - United's 25th different central defensive combination under Van Gaal - and it showed.

The trio are all out of contract next year and their form, as well as their brittleness, means they are fighting for their United careers.

Of the trio, Evans has the fewest excuses. A talent who has benefited from emerging through United's academy, at the Amsterdam Tournament in 2006 an 18-year-old Evans flourished against the predatory Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.

Yet he is in danger of developing into a deluxe John O'Shea. Both enjoyed auspicious breakthrough seasons under Ferguson before regressing.

Like O'Shea, Evans tends apportion the blame elsewhere. At Stoke, he allowed a cross to go over his head and immediately hollered at De Gea - who is prone to remaining on his line - for not claiming the ball. The linesman also copped it in the second-half for failing to raise his flag.

From the first minute at Stoke, Evans looked as delicate as many felt on New Year's Day morning as he grappled with Jonathan Walters. Physical strikers smell fear whenever Evans is in their vicinity, and Christian Benteke capitalised on that with his opener against United last month.

Evans once tellingly told a reporter the Championship battering ram Rob Hulse was his "toughest opponent". The Ulsterman has marshalled Didier Drogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic authoritatively but has also helped Carlton Cole resemble Pele and was bullied by the might of MK Dons.



<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i4.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article8373655.ece/alternates/s615/JS53724148.jpg" src="http://i4.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article8373655.ece/alternates/s615/JS53724148.jpg"/>

The quandary with Evans for Van Gaal is he is a good footballer but an erratic defender. His distribution is useful beside the clunky Jones and Smalling and, as one of the few United players reluctant to adopt long ball tactics, he advanced into Stoke's third time and again.

Evans turns 27 on Saturday, though, and his hesitance in defence is akin to Tyler Blackett or Paddy McNair's. Those two can be excused after being thrown in at the deep end whereas Evans has had the benefit of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic leading him through matches.

Should Blackett or McNair look to Evans for guidance they will be disappointed. Evans seemed to boast the silk, steel and talent to emerge into a future United captain at one stage but looks forlorn without Ferdinand or Vidic.

Vidic reportedly approached United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward in a desperate attempt to cancel his move to Inter Milan in the summer after David Moyes was sacked. Despite his decline, retaining the seasoned Vidic would have alleviated some of the pressure on Evans, now the most senior United defender.

In 2009, <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs88nvpF_gw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Evans perfected the kung-fu kick to the abdomen</a> long before Nigel de Jong left his mark on Xabi Alonso. Tough and fearless, he was unfazed until that night against a Ronaldinho-inspired AC Milan attack.

Evans endured a demoralising 2011, memorable for the humiliation Mario Balotelli inflicted on him in City's 6-1 shock, and a festive drinking session with Wayne Rooney and Darron Gibson that led to a fine and a suspension.

"In the winter of 2011, I did have to take disciplinary action after Wayne, Jonny Evans and Darron Gibson had a night out," Ferguson writes in his autobiography.

"They went across to Southport to a hotel to celebrate our 5-0 Boxing Day win against Wigan. They came into training the next day weary.

"I went into the gymnasium where they were doing their exercises and told them they would be fined a week's wages and not considered for selection against Blackburn on the Saturday."

United lost 3-2 and Evans missed the next two games, as well.

He recovered to excel alongside Ferdinand in 2012 and became a goal threat, netting vitally against Braga, Queens Park Rangers and Newcastle, only for three injuries in three months to scupper his momentum in 2013.

The irony is Evans has not properly recovered from Ferguson's order to him in Milan back in February 2010. Later that week, he was bulldozed by Jack Rodwell at Goodison Park in the first memorable instance of a player dominating him.

And now Ferguson is gone, Evans has just 18 months to convince Van Gaal and wake up at United.

2068~~~

2069~~~
Happy Birthday!

May we wish you that for ten more years!

2070~~~
I've never rated Evans but the replies to this tweet by <a class="username" data-user="20857, @ManUtd" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20857/">@ManUtd</a> from supposed United fans are embarrassing. 

Happy Birthday Jonny.

2071~~~
Bit like this thread then.

2072~~~
Wow this is becoming difficult!

They are not comparable because smalling is 25 and evans is 27, there is 23 months between them, which is as good as 2 years. 2 years which will take Smalling towards his prime. I am not sure why your finding that hard to accept? 

Consider - Smalling started his senior career in 2007 at Maidstone so has far less experience.

Would you not agree me that at 25 and 27 respectively that they are at different stages in their careers? 

It's common knowledge what I have stipulated, its hardly a ground breaking theory is it?! Players from the age of 16/17 develop at different rates and usually once they reach 27/28 they enter their prime, the period of time where their physical and mental attributes align and they start to produce their best football, this of course is not gospel and can fluctuate with players who peak early, or even late, but it's a fair parameter to measure from.

2073~~~
Cafe sometime ago. About Smalling this time.

2074~~~
Yes there are some comments on here that are OTT but there's one thing discussing his performances in a thread like this and another berating him with abuse after the club wish him happy birthday. Not good.

2075~~~
The only posts that are embarrassing in this thread are yours. The only thing being spoken in this thread is sense. Even stevoc with his stance can have an structured debate.

This thread isn't vile and doesn't go overboard, it's actually interesting to see the thoughts coincide with those in MEN, which suggests our thoughts are shared, even though they are more diplomatic about the argument.

2076~~~
That was when Smalling got his stupid red card and cost us the game so the comments are entirely justified. If a player performs poorly and does stupid things, you won't expect people to praise him, right?

2077~~~
What, it's praise or that garbage?

Also, those quotes are not from match thread, but player one.

2078~~~
Is there though? You can't really control who posts on Facebook, many of them might not even be United fans, on here however we are all supposed to be fans. There's nothing wrong with constructive criticism, he deserves criticism for some of  his performances this season but this thread is far from that.

Ok then <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Oh and still waiting for a reply to this in reference to the game on Sunday.

2079~~~
I think at this stage it's safe to assume that i don't no.

I honestly don't know if you are on a wind up at this stage mate or you made such a big deal of out such a minor point in one of our exchanges that you feel compelled to just keep going with it, despite it not making much sense.

The fact several people have been quoting our exchange about this and are laughing at the simplistic terms in which i am having to explain things should tell you something.

Either way i don't care anymore as it's becoming boring, tedious and it's derailing the thread, so subscribe to whichever theory you like. 

But to me and most people if they were asked would accept Evans and Smalling are very close in age seeing as one turns 27 this year and the other turns 26 that's really all there is to it.

2080~~~
I'm simply not prepared to go through the game and pinpoint these moments, that would require a large amount of effort on my part which I'm not prepared to exert because even then your bias would prevail.

If it's come this far and you can't see his weakness and consistent failings I can not change your opinion.

Why don't you go through the effort of rewatching it an try to observe without your bias glasses on, and see how many times he played poor passes, showed poor decison making, cleared inefficiently and defended without conviction. He has been the same all year and last that's why everyone is calling for his head.

2081~~~
Quoting you I believe - I would point those laughs in your direction.

Keep wording it whatever way makes you happy. ☺️

2082~~~
You said you counted a <b>large</b> handful of incidents which were mistakes, surely you can remember some?
Further you say I have 'bias' glasses on? Funny that, I have said many times that he hasn't played well this season, or that I wouldn't mind if he was sold in the summer, funny way of looking at things from someone who's biased isn't it?

2083~~~
I've given up on him. He's 27 already and it looks like his injury problems have really affected his confidence and form.

He's actually regressed. Ferguson used to describe United as a bus that doesn't stop for anybody. Van Gaal has not stopped for Cleverley, Anderson and Welbeck so I wouldn't be opposed to not stopping for Evans.

2084~~~
I agree, I have a feeling all three of our CBs are living in fear of getting injured again, it must be the most frustrating thing a player can go through.

2085~~~
Shambolic defender, shows no confidence what so ever. In turn i have none in him. Hes finished here surely. When u21 defenders have shown more composure, defensive capabilities and even adaptability than yourself when given the chance, you know the games up. Opposition attackers must rub there hands together when they read his name on the team sheet. He has shown in small intervals he can do a job, but overall no one can argue with the fact that he has a mistake in him every game. A club like ours deserves much better. His position is surely one most under threat.

De Gea in particular cannot be gaining anything from his inabilities, and looked extremely pissed with that ball over the top he made a feast over for diouf. Unforgivable in my view.

2086~~~
1. The shocking defending with Diouf which lead to the chance, there was 3 instances in that section of play alone, the letting it bounce, the not dealing with it whilst it was in front of him in his possession, then getting bullied off the ball and mis-controlling.
2. When he attempted to pass the ball out after the Smalling hand ball and passed it straight to their player, it was an easy ball to deal with and he made a complete hash of it and played it to Dioufs feet for another shot in the box.
3. When Luke shaw cleared the ball at the back post after the ball was crossed in, he did very well, Evans reaction was anger towards Shaw for some bizarre reason, when he was actually covering for him - just a stupid reaction
4. Similar incident with De Gea which I cant actually remember the full extent of -just that I was disappointed with his reaction.
5. Summary point -Dilly dallying on the ball as he brings it up field and doesn't have a clue what to do with it. Poor decision making and passing leading to uncertainties throughout our play.

The majority of what you have said is positively in favour of Evans and giving him benefit of the doubt and looking at the whole situation from a blurred optimistic POV.

Now your back tracking because the jury is out, this whole season you have defended him and thats not debatable, you can spin it whatever way you like but the truth is you have continually argued his case with lots of members of this forum throughout this season. Unfortunately he is a player who is completely out of his depth and was carried for large parts of his early career and he has been exposed as a weak link who would do well to get in the Aston Villa team.

2087~~~
He's still got four months to turn it around. We know he's capable of far more, but he's definitely in trouble.

2088~~~
That is the point with Jonny that is worrying me. In the past he was the kid alongside a Vidic or Rio. Now he is the elder statesman and he is being found wanting and all his shortcomings are coming to the fore. He has always had a senior pro there to cover for him He is making mistakes and then berating his team mates when they get him out of trouble. That will not be going down well with them. Nobody wants to take the blame for other peoples cock ups.

2089~~~
I don't have much faith in Jonny turning this around. I'm all for giving time, but when the rest of the team has managed to grasp the essence of the new state of play and are moving in the right direction, he seems to be stuck in his mistakes.

It's the same thing with him for the past three games now - He struggles on the ball, takes too long to pass and constantly complains about lack of options. Jones who plays on the right side, has the exact same scenario, except he almost always manages to move play quickly from the back. It comes down having the guts to make mistakes. With Jonny, you get the sense he's afraid to make mistakes, so when he gets the ball it's one too many touches, followed by either a back pass, a hoof forward or a sideways pass. He rarely takes gumption in moving forward with the ball like Jones does. When he does do it, he looks good, but the hesitation is jarring and it interrupts the flow of play.

Not to forget defensive frailties. He used to be quite good in the air, but he's even shown weakness in that as well. Not just the Stoke game, but he's been bullied off the ball too many times for my liking.

It pains me to say that a United lad isn't good enough, but I'm sorry he just doesn't cut it in this system. Not in the starting eleven that is.

2090~~~
He should regain his confidence, then he will again be one of the best CB in the league but I think we have not another 2 years time to wait so he is very likely to be on his way out in summer. I guess he could go somewhere like Everton or even Soton. We have too many center backs in the team and there is possibility we will buy one world class so we should make room for him or even for the youngsters who should go out on loan, Keane could finally feature in our A-team.. And Happy birthday Jonny.-)

2091~~~
I think all the injuries have hampered him greatly. He is years behind in his development and we might not, as you say have time to wait. He is not a Paddy McNair who can learn from his mistakes and has time on his side. Jonny is reaching the age where he should be reaching his peak and he is nowhere near being there.

2092~~~
These are both the same incident, he didn't shout at Shaw at all, in the replay it was clearly aimed at De Gea, for not coming out and collecting a free ball which ended up in the Shaw clearance.

2093~~~
Give him a start in the cup and if he still fails to look anything but capable then his days are numbered I feel.

2094~~~
Well, from memory, he let the ball drop, giving Diouf a golden chance.
About five minutes later, he did the same thing. Luckily the ball bounced for him and he got away with it, but again, appalling defending.
He didn't deal with a cross into the box which Shaw then had to deal with. Then had the temerity to turn around and berate De Gea who has saved him on previous occasions this season, which I thought was rather cheeky, yet par for the course from Evans. Some, I believe, see this as "organising".
There was another incident which I think was during the passage of play where Smalling handled the ball, ball came to Evans and he hit some panicked half assed ball right back across our box. Again, these are just a few incidents, from my memory, which isn't the best. However, they all happened, there may well have been more.

<edit> Ah, I see <a class="username" data-user="30879, @Fergies Formula" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/30879/">@Fergies Formula</a> got there before me.

2095~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>
1) Yep, terrible defending.
2) Not initially Evans mistake, he should have dealt with the deflection better though.
3) In his opinion De Gea should have come for it, Evans was not going to get the ball, any attempt to get it could have resulted in an own goal with Shaw there to cover it was the sensible option. Is a reaction a mistake now by the way?
4) ?
5) You could say that about any player.

Hardly a large handful of mistakes is it? Tell me, have you been on the Jones and Smalling threads giving them as much abuse?

Furter, how am I backtracking? I’ve defended him against those that have decided to re write history, I’ve defended him when he has played well, and I’ve defended him against posters who lay blame on him for errors that weren’t his fault. The over reaction on here is beyond foolish, some are waiting for the smallest of mistake to crucify him. If you think thats fair then you go for it.

2096~~~
See above.

2097~~~
For some reason this incident annoyed me more than any of the others, really poor defending.

2098~~~
2 - Does it matter whether he made an initial mistake or not? You asked for pointers as to when he made mistakes. That was one. It was absolutely shambolic. Whether it was the first mistake or not is irrelevant, the fact was, the ball came to him and rather than clear, he panicked and sent it straight back across the box.
3 -Any attempt would have resulted in an OG? It was just as dangerous a ball when Shaw took it, maybe even more so because of the flight, yet he took control and went for it. Evans would rather not do anything. This was a mistake on his part. De Gea regularly leaves balls like that and stays on his line. Evans should know that.

2099~~~
I already said he should have dealt with it better, but his error came from the deflection of what was a blatant handball.

Further, I said could have not would have, I assume you know the difference?
If you think it’s a mistake to let a player in a better position handle the danger then you must be the most critical of supporter, or of course you could be just looking for reasons to blame a player who is the latest scapegoat.

2100~~~
Yes, his error came from another appalling error. It was, however, still an error, was it not? And I believe you asked for instances of Evans errors? Maybe I'm incorrect on that, but I'm too lazy to read back to be honest.

Yes, I absolutely think it was a mistake in how he failed to deal with that ball. In my opinion a top class defender deals with it. Perhaps I am the most critical of supporters, is that a bad thing? That I want top class defenders, and I criticise those who aren't?

I disagree that he's a scapegoat. I don't blame him for our recent results, I believe scapegoats are players wrongly blamed for causing bad results. In my opinion, Evans simply isn't good enough. He makes multiple mistakes in a game, gets outmuscled by anyone with a bit of strength. Not scapegoating. Not blaming him for results.

Whether his mistakes come after other player's mistakes doesn't matter. They're still mistakes. He's not good enough in my opinion. Not that my opinion matters a whole pile, but sure, we'll see what Louis thinks in the long run.

2101~~~
Why is this even a discussion? The mistakes just listed here from the last game would be unforgivable in my u9 team, never mind at the pinnacle of the english game. 

His age works against him unfortunately and a good gague to measure him would be to ask would he get in any of the top 6 teams in the prem? Granted would any of our cbs? But regardless of that, he looks the most isolated and less at terms with our new philosophy than any of our current cbs. 

I feel other than the northern irish contingency in here, most know he is not a top class defender and also know hes never showed potential to be even close to one. After buying falcao, di maria etc surely only the top class bracket is what we are aiming for even at the back. Clearly a squad rotation player from the get go, and now he is showing his most consistency with atleast "a howler a game" surely he can not even be considered that any more. 

I may be mistaken, but im sure after a Evans clanger vs stoke the camera cut to LVG and he looked like he was blowing steam. His days are clearly numbered.

2102~~~
I’ve already said he could have dealt with it better, I’m simply highlighting that there were other factors leading to it. However I asked for the LARGE handful of errors he made in the game, I’m still waiting.


In regards to the Evans, Shaw incident, if Evans stretches for it and it deflects into the net, who do you blame? I guarantee that everyone would say that he should have left it for Shaw who was in a better position, for you and others to blame him for that isn’t over critical it’s just plain daft. There is nothing wrong with being critical when it’s due, but when you are looking to pass the blame onto someone when there is no blame there, then that’s when it becomes scapegoating.
A scapegoat is not someone who is blamed for poor results, it is someone who is blamed for the wrongdoings, mistakes, or faults of others, especially for reasons of expediency.

2103~~~
This is why I didnt want to engage with these because I knew you would challenge them with bias replies. 
1) This was Sunday league stuff and embarrassing to watch, the kind of defending that has become synonymous with Evans.
2) He made a mistake doesn't matter if it wasnt his mistake, Smalling was clumsy with his hands being out wide, Evans on the other hand had a long time to play the pass and still managed to hand another chance to diouf on a plate.
3) De Gea could never have come out to get that, he did the right thing by letting the defence take it, he is on top form right now and I trust his judgement over yours. Evans did nothing and let Shaw clear a difficult ball. And yes his reaction and shouting at others is a mistake - it shows his character and gives other team players fuel to develop a negative perception of him, distancing himself from an error is a mistake.
5) No I couldn't because it would be valid about others. Smallings passing has been progressive and positive and is getting a lot better, he is playing with assurance and this breeds confidence. Jones although a bit shaky at times is solid enough and strong in his mind and the tackle. Evans is the fragile one which creates knock on effects throughout the team.

Dirkeys replies are spot on.

He is doing these kind of small mistakes regularly throughout and lucky for him hasnt been punished for them.

No I havent because Smalling has my support as does Jones, who still has a lot to prove. Evans is supposed to be leading the way for these guys, but he has become a liability who is getting outshone by players a lot younger than him.

2104~~~
You have had a handful your not getting anymore, I gave you 5 of which you agreed with 1. 

If these kind of mistakes are happening in every game and causing a negative impact on the team he needs to be removed.

2105~~~
100% accurate.

We need to aim a lot higher as currently our defence is not hitting the standards we set for so long.

2106~~~
You still didn’t answer my questions, where is the large handful of mistakes he made in the game.

This is getting fecking boring now, but one thing has become obvious, it’s a clear case of scapegoating if ever there was one. To say it’s become synonymous with Evans shows the lack of knowledge you have about his United career. Yes he made a mistake after Smallings handball, my point is there are reasons leading to the error, are you saying that shouldn’t come into it?

How do you know De Gea couldn’t have come out for it? It was just outside the six yard box? Was it too high for him? Shaw was in the better position to deal with it, it was dealt with, and that’s not a mistake its good defending.

It wasn’t that long ago that people were slating him for not taking leadership, now hes taking it, guess what?
Bolded part says it all.

2107~~~
You think thats a LARGE handful <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2108~~~
Believe whatever you need to mate if that's what makes you feel better.

2109~~~
It is not scapegoating because as a team we are doing reasonably well in comparison to last season, the players are responding to an acceptable level, but Evans is not. This is purely identifying the player who is struggling and performing at a low level who has become a liability to his team mates.

That is enough mistakes for any manchester united defender in a game. I gave you 5, a mistake for every finger! I really dont need to list anymore - and I provided that list without re-watching the game.

Please provide me with evidence of him taking leadership? Or is this just another one of your fictional statements. Leadership is not passing the buck and shouting at others for your own mistakes which he has always done.

The ball was whipped in too low and too close to our defenders for De Gea to gamble and come and collect, like I said I would trust the talent and judgement of De Gea who is in peak form over yours/ Evans.

2110~~~
Like I said its your posts that are being mocked.

I cant change your inability to see that.

2111~~~
I notice this a lot with Evans. He's always blaming someone else for his mistakes. Very irritating.

2112~~~
For the last time Scapegoating has little to do with the team, if you don’t understand what it means how you can say he isn’t being made a scapegoat?
In regards to the <b>LARGE</b> handful of mistakes Evans made against Stoke, You didn’t give me 5 examaples , you gave me 2, in a game which his defensive partners made the same if not more mistakes, where the forward players only managed two shots on target.

You accusing me of making up fictional statements <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He has started to show leadership by organising the defence, he has also become a lot more vocal, the same can be said for Smalling, something which many on here wanted him to be. He lacks natural leadership and it’s going to be a learning curve for him, if he’s given the time of course.
The ball was whipped in to low? It went over the Stoke player and Evans head, how was it to low? Finally are you some sort of Child, 'My De Gea is better than your Evans' really?

2113~~~
No idea why you bring Smalling into this, he was good again. Jones probably did more daft things than Evans, but none as bad as the Mame car crash.

2114~~~
Not this again. Evans is almost two years older. Smalling turned 25 a little over a month ago (November 22). Evans turned 27 today (Jan 3). Clarification.

2115~~~
Not passing the blame onto someone it was not due. Quite simply, Evans should have cleared, or at least attempted to clear, that ball, which passed him at head height. But sure, if you think it was easier for Shaw, as it dipped in at him,then fair enough. Nice that our young left back in his first season has the balls to take responsibility though. Thankfully one of them was. Evans would rather do nothing and then abuse our world class goalkeeper.

2116~~~
Because Evans is the most experienced CB. LVG is giving him his chance to prove himself and he's failing. LVG won't hesitate to cut him off when he's seen enough

2117~~~
He needs to do the following(or at least three) for a complete resurgence: 

-shave his head 
-Grow a beard
-wear a smaller kit(ask Valencia for tips)
-Get a full sleeve tattoo

This will make him look tougher and he'll be able to defend better. His new intimidating look will cause an infinitesimal amount of hesitation in attackers which will in turn help him by giving him more time to defend--just a tiny bit, but that's all he needs. All good defenders that don't look like freaks by birth(Per etc) develop a quirky look(Puyol's hair, Stam's head etc). Maldini is an exception but he looked good so that worked for him. 

Look at Skrtle, if he looked like Evans he'd be playing for Plymouth Argyle Sweater FC.

2118~~~
He virtually is.

2119~~~
Organising the defence? Ah yes. A world where shouting at teammates after ones own mistakes is considered organising. Yep. We were lucky they managed so few shots on target. Imagine he defended like that in the Champions League, instead of against diouf? 

Do you think Evans is a good enough player to regularly start for this club?

2120~~~
Why did you quote a post of mine mate from yesterday posted before you and i had this conversation on this topic in this thread?

2121~~~
Yeah ok, if you say so it must be true. 

Meanwhile back in the real world...

2122~~~
Forget Evans for a minute and look at the broader picture, imagine we defended like that or or what we have been defending like sense practically LvG came on the scene in the Champions League. Any fool of a manager would know what to do against us, whip in as many high balls, corners, and crosses as possible because chances are they'll panic, panic and panic again. The sooner a plan, philosophy or whatever  it does be called these days it is put into action at the back, one that the players understand right from the off and not be running around the place like headless chickens and being 2nd to almost every high ball that's aimed for goal area the better. Chances are we'll see less silly mistakes being made at the back and not just by Evans either but them all.

2123~~~
Smalling made several errors. Those ignoring that fact is why I keep bringing it up.

2124~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2125~~~
Indeed.

2126~~~
I think we can flog him for about 6-7 M. Typical United transfer business. Hull City is calling. He'll thrive where there isn't too much pressure

2127~~~
Definition of the verb Scapegoat - Scapegoating is the practice of singling out any party for unmerited negative treatment

The negative treatment of Evans is 100% warranted by his shit performances. Its not scapegoating if its warranted criticism. Brush up on your understanding on the word.

I gave you 5 of what in my view mistakes (and others agree in this debate so its not just my opinion), your chopping it down to 2 to suit your bias. I will be given you no more, I don't have to justify it any longer. There was other instances but I am using my memory to extract those ones I listed. Your holding onto the point about a LARGE handful of mistakes. Look at the bigger picture. He is playing shit and your defending him relentlessly.

Let me put it to you - you have said he has shown leadership? Show us positive evidence of this. The truth is, as I and others have noted all we see him doing is shouting at others and ggenerallylooking annoyed and frustrated by any decison that goes against the side and in turn blames others for his mistakes. Where has he shown leadership this season?  Leicester? MK Dons? Stoke? Villa? There is no basis to what you say, your obviously a youngster with a point to prove but your doing yourself no favours because you have no substance and provide nothing to suit your argument, and quite frankly becoming another "Scholsey" in this thread.

It wasnt a lofted floater that could be plucked out the air, there was a lot of pace on it, as crosses go it was a very dangerous and decent cross, and no way should De Gea be scrambling out to get it, it would have been risky.

Not sure what you mean with that last bit - your argument is progressively deteriorating and lacking coherence. Have a lay down pal.

2128~~~
The season before we got Jones and Smalling most United were calling for him to go in the summer. He was terrible, but Fergie gave him another chance and he played well that season. I am of the opinion that he has been poor for the last two years too,  certainly since Fergie left. I'd say his first season was impressive, and he was good in that other season I mentioned.  Other than that, he has underwhelmed.

2129~~~
Can't say I remember any clear error. Remind me? I'm not counting a penalty shout the ref was perfectly entitled not to give. (If I'm not bringing the thread off track by asking you to do so.)

2130~~~
You’re not blaming him for the penalty that thankfully they didn’t get? Really?  It was as clear a handball as you are likely to see FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2131~~~
It was a genuine question, what were his other mistakes? I'm forgetful. I expected a grown-up answer, not avoidance and emoticons.

(On this particular incident: It hit his hand of course, but it hit it from 20 centimetres or something like that. Clumsy, but certainly not intentional. It's one of those where the ref is entitled to give it or not give it. Meh.)

2132~~~
What’s the point in discussing it with you when you refuse to put any blame on Smalling for that handball, it’s obvious which way the conversation is going to go. I can’t be arsed anymore to be honest.
For the record – The first goal, and Crouch hitting the post, in both incidents he could have done a hell of a lot better, and obviousley the penalty shout.

2133~~~
When crouch hit the post Smalling was all over him and as tight as a defender could be, even one of the commentators admitted there was nothing else he could have done there.

2134~~~
Yep. The ball came exactly where Crouch was. No CB on planet earth will beat lanky Crouch in the air there.

Yep. Hit him almost point blank on the hand. Hardly his fault. Anyone who thinks he deliberately hand balled it is giving Smalling way too much credit, he'd need cat like reflexes from that distance.

2135~~~
Holy feck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2136~~~
Two of those were shouting at teammates, though you were wrong as he didn't shout at Shaw, it was De Gea, are they mistakes? Or are they just things that you didn't like about him on Thursday?

2137~~~
Let's list his seasons then:
2008-9 - Great debut season
2009-10- Bad
2010-11- Good
2011-13- Great and people were calling for him to be and were comfortable with him starting
2013-4 - Decent but injuries
2014-5 - Horrible

2138~~~
Read previous posts for elaboration. Thanks.

2139~~~
Getsme, I like the way you have massively failed to respond.

2140~~~
I can't be bothered to read previous post.... Just like you said earlier. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2141~~~
Massively failed to respond? Are you on the drink?

2142~~~
I'm waiting for your response from my post earlier, in your own time. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> 

I'm guessing it won't be coming now!

2143~~~
Nothing compared to Evans brain farts. Smalling is twice the defender Evans is

2144~~~
We are going in roundabouts, plus you bore me.

2145~~~
I think that's fair.

2146~~~
Check mate

2147~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2148~~~
He really hasnt progressed tbh. I wouldnt be surprised if he was moved on. I think he would move on before Smalling

2149~~~
Whilst Jonny's been well below standards so far this season, he's got at least until the summer to find form and turn it around for himself. Seeing as we regularly play with 3 CHs these days, who all seem to get injured consistently, he will get plenty more opportunities to sort his season out.

I think he's been shite but if you said to me a year ago Ashley Young would become a valuable player for us I wouldn't have believed it so not going to lose all faith in Jonny yet.

2150~~~
I argued my point so obviously there is a point in discussing it further. You might have chosen to point out flaws in what I wrote or you might have provided a different argument. You chose neither, you prefered simply making a hyperbolic assertion. it's not me making discussion futile here. But yes, we can leave that aside since your claim was that he made several errors. I wondered which. You managed to provide me with an answer after a bit of struggle. You're hard work. But thanks for that, I am now satisfied (but not in agreement with you).

2151~~~
He'll do alright at a side which lets him hoof it any time it's near him.

2152~~~
Ashley Young is decent as cover.

We have too many decent defenders. We need to get rid of some of them and buy world class ones or potential world class defenders. Out of all the defenders we have got, I would get rid of Evans first. 

He's the oldest and still gets bullied. There is nothing that really stands out about him as a defender. And he still is injury prone. Smalling for me is our best defender and he had none of the football education Evans had as a kid. Smalling was playing for Maidstone at 17. Evans has been with us since he was 9. You expect at 27 he'd be consistent and has established himself. But he hasn't.

2153~~~
I've never been totally convinced by Evans and he has been poor this season. He needs to rapidly improve or be will be replaced. 

Smalling has been improving and is younger. Evans is much younger so will be given more time but he also needs to improve.

2154~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/evanse8urr.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/evanse8urr.gif"/>

I don't even...

2155~~~
Which is strange, because at the start of the season, there were reports that LvG was really impressed at Evans ability of playing it out of the back.

2156~~~
While there is no hiding from the fact that it's very poor defending there from Evans, it's a single moment in a match, he is one of those players whose mistakes are highlighted, such as this but his positive contributions go unpraised because most want rid of. Imagine if that's a United striker chasing the ball down, we would be praising the effort and desire to get the ball (not defending Evans there, just saying).

He hasn't been up to the standard he has set himself in the past but I don't think he has been as poor as many would like to think he has been. No doubting he needs to improve though but I'm sure he will, he has overcome tough spells before.

Maybe I'm biased because I always rated him when he was said to not being good enough to make it at United and was pleased to see him become a regular but I still see a valuable player there.

2157~~~
He has too many of these moments. MK Dons all game, Liverpool backpass to Sterling, getting bullied by Benteke for Villa's goal. Has he been poor? Hell yea!

2158~~~
No doubt he's playing quite poorly but I think calls to get rid are a little premature. I think we're all a bit impatient sometimes. He's had his injuries this season and players react differently and recover differently and re-find their form/confidence in different ways. I'm still confident he'll turn it around. An on-form Evans is a fine player.

2159~~~
65/71 passes, that's Xavi like.

2160~~~
Well MK Dons, I don't think anyone can look back at that with any pride. A poor backpass yes but bloody hell, what players don't commit the odd shit back pass, especially defenders with the instruction to play it out. Also, how dare a player get bullied by Benteke lol the guy is a beast.

Again, I don't want my backing of him to look like I'm blind to his poor performances but there is no way he is as bad as many want him to be. He shouldn't be made a scapegoat for us wanting a world class CB, that's not his fault, it's the clubs fault.

2161~~~
We need better defenders and if we sign them, we will be selling atleast 1 we have. Unfortunately for Evans, it looks like it'l be him atm.

2162~~~
At the moment I'd agree, however, given our injury record at the back we would need to get more than 1 CB in before we even think of selling anyone.

2163~~~
With Van Gaal, the perennially injured will be asked to leave I reckon which is why I fear for the likes of Jones and Smalling. So much potential but can't stay fit.

2164~~~
Indeed, you need a solid foundation to build a team, at the moment ours is built on sand. It’s a shame, we have the players, they just can’t stay fit <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2165~~~
Your reluctance to respond to my measured post showed your worth.

You will notice he does this a lot.

2166~~~
Im being serious here, but are you on drugs?

2167~~~
Your a moron and have been exposed time and time again, not just by me by others.

You are the one who decides to evade questions and didn't respond to my perfectly legit discussion, you have become irrational and just because you couldn't answer have resorted to juvenile insults. 

Futile is the perfect description of your behaviour.

2168~~~
Insult the post not the poster, naughty naughty, tut tut.

2169~~~
Will be interesting to see if Evans plays today, if he does he will have to show some strength as he has come under a lot of warranted criticism this week.

2170~~~
I hope he does start today. If we go back to a back 4 in the PL I don't think he'll be involved and I don't want to see one of the first choice's fitness risked with our record. Plus a game like this might be good for his confidence.

2171~~~
I'm hopeful he starts today in a back three with the two young lads (but more-so because that means we can leave Smalling and Jones out to hopefully avoid rushing them into playing too many games after recent injuries). Once we have some midfield players back and the defenders fit, I'm confident that Evans will be left out of the team in favour of Smalling/Jones and Rojo, with Carrick being the deep midfield player in a diamond who slots into a back three when needed. Evans' only saving grace and the reason he's been in the team so much for my money is that he's not as injury prone as the rest (seemingly). Sure, he's had his fair share of injuries too, but actually being fit and available is one of the most important things to get any kind of consistency going (although he's been consistently bad or average IMO for about a season and a half at least). 

At the moment, without trying to be too harsh on the guy, I think he's the most likely out of our current defenders to move on in the Summer.

2172~~~
Edit: Sorry thought I was in the Smalling thread haha.

He hasn't been as awful as he's made out to be, no, but what's disappointing is he has shown no leadership as our most senior defender.  

Still a WC CB may help him a lot.

2173~~~
Certainly.  The most disappointing thing about Evans is that he has shown virtually no leadership in a defence where he is the most senior player.

2174~~~
The reason being leadership isn't a natural quality of his. Someone who struggles with confidence will always struggle to project leadership.

Will be interesting to see how well he fares at a lesser club when he eventually moves on.

I would like nothing more than him to turn this around and become the player we need but there is a sense of inevitability about the situation.

2175~~~
He's not a scapegoat, he's simply not good enough for United. Evans is bullied by any strong forward with a burst of speed. That forward from MK Dons raped him for their fourth and he almost even scored a fifth goal. I guess Evans gets a pass for losing out to 'beasts' of players. What an excuse. How come Smalling doesn't have the same problems against similar players? So its the club's fault that Evans is performing badly and getting justly criticized by a large section of United support? Its anyone but Evans fault isn't it? If not the fans its the club now.

2176~~~
Can't believe people are still calling him a scapegoat! How many shit back passes and feck ups is it going to take for people to realise he's been utterly shite this season? Jones hasn't been very good either or Rojo for that matter but at least they are not handing chances on a platter to the opposition to score every time they play.

2177~~~
If you are going to defend his performances, at least do it properly. But greenies are all you've got alas!

2178~~~
Defend who's performances?

2179~~~
You don't need natural leadership to necessarily organise a defence. Sure it helps but it can be done without being an out and out leader. 

The confidence issue is a big problem though.

2180~~~
Jones is really growing into the season though to be fair. HIs last few games have been much better.

2181~~~
What a gorgeous turn of phrase you have

2182~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2183~~~
I don't know him/her, but from now on I do. I see that I'm lucky that Getsme managed once to reply to me without an emoticon. Almost his/her single post the last few pages without one.

2184~~~
It's because this place is full of funny posts, what can I say.

2185~~~
Comes across to me as a nervous reaction to the painful truth about Evans that he struggles to swallow.

2186~~~
Remember that goal a few years ago at Villa where we won 3-2. Villa's first goal was a result of Benteke putting Smalling on his ass before sliding the ball across for a goal. So, Smalling was bullied by the exact same player.

I never said it's the clubs fault Evans is out of form, I said it's the clubs fault for not investing in the CB position, don't try and twist my words to suit your argument, my statement was clear.

2187~~~
How about you start quoting me when talking about me. Thanks.

2188~~~
It seems many comments in support of Evans have to go back a few years. Clutching at straws. Why are you only focused on Benteke? Evans has come up short against physical strikers every time he's faced them this season.

2189~~~
I didn't have to as I was responding to other posters. Happy now?

2190~~~
No, tag me when talking about me, simple.

2191~~~
Is that a house rule or is that Getsme's rules? I don't have to tag you my man, I really don't. I doubt you'll ever miss anything related to you in this thread since you're always in it.

2192~~~
Well I'm not going to go to the future to gain evidence am I?

I am not hiding from the fact that Evans has been poor this season but every time he is out muscled, he gets painted with the same brush but given no praise when he comes out on top of that battle, which like it or not, he does. If he came out worse in every challenge, we would be losing 5 goals every game. It just stands out more when he loses it because the result is more dangerous to us.

2193~~~
It's the polite thing to do, I suppose I should have known better.

2194~~~
Evans gives at least 1 sitter away a game. He's shit.

2195~~~
It's bizarre. Evans just had a great defensive action, and first two posts were in "just retire" and "go away" variety. Back in match thread.

2196~~~
He was okay today, not great but okay. But does he really have to give away a big chance in every game? Very infuriating.

2197~~~
He gave the ball to Moore on a plate. He's lucky that both Moore and Diouf are poor finishers, this guy is a liability. Even when he has a decent game he has to do at least one absolutely brainless thing to help the opposition. I'll be glad if he's gone tomorrow

2198~~~
He does. He's got lucky twice now with that. That backpass could have cost us big time.

2199~~~
I didn't notice him Jonny Evans anything up today, which is an improvement over his last couple of games.

2200~~~
Another howler today. Defend that Getsme.

2201~~~
Good Lord what was he thinking with that flick for their chance? Indefensible.

2202~~~
It was his token pass to the opposition forward. Its Evans trademark, cant let his fans down

2203~~~
In serious danger of being sold in the summer, assuming van Gaal will be ruthless and other centre-backs will be signed.

2204~~~
A bit unfair to shift all blame on Evans for their chance today.  Not sure what he should have done other than let the ball go altogether.  Meanwhile, their striker was left unattended between Smalling and McNair.  I realize that chastising Evans is the new thing but there were many worse players out there today.

2205~~~
I thought he wasn't that bad today... until I saw that he gave away yet another big chance for the opposition.

That habit of his will cost us big time one day.

2206~~~
It might be a danger to him for being sold, it's a danger to us when we play him.

What in Heaven's name was he thinking with that flip back today?  Is he going to blame the wind like against Stoke?

2207~~~
It's getting boring, to be honest. That was a poor header but he needed a shout from Smalling if he was going to leave it. Plus he made one defensive header (cross from their left back) that was the best bit of defending in the game. 

Smalling was fecking diabolical. Had an absolute nightmare playing in a back three. Just like every other centre half at the club.

2208~~~
Its because he's in such a poor position that he can only get a flick on it, and has no idea whether it'll help or hinder his team

2209~~~
How about some decisive defending like heading it out to touch or in any other direction that is not our box? Surely that isn't too hard, he was good apart from that though!

2210~~~
Jonny needs to pull himself together immediately.  Louis won't put up with this shit for another season.

2211~~~
Wow really? I don't want to derail an Evans thread so feel free to quote this into the Smalling one, but diabolical is incredibly harsh imo. Easily our best CB today I'd have said, although perhaps that's not much of a compliment in itself.

2212~~~
Thought Smalling was fine, as was Evans really, other than that horrendous header. And McNair, other than his handball.

2213~~~
Dont' agree with that.  You might argue he should have let the ball go but his position was okay in terms of watching that other guy who was coming into the box.  Can see it in the gif thread.  Now look at Smalling.  Who is he marking?

2214~~~
How is it on Smalling to shout "Jonny dont be suicidal and flick the ball where you have no idea if its going to be closer to the keeper or an attacker" ?

Its not. You dont need a shout for the very basics of defending. I guess Smalling could have shouted "Evans, get in a decent position. I thought I heard once that you were good at reading play" like I did at my tv though

2215~~~
There you go. Sums up the difference in how they're perceived. Smalling made a bunch of silly errors and couldn't pass water. The same performance from Evans would get him crucified.

2216~~~
As I thought. You've never played football. Other than computer simulations, anyway.

2217~~~
I was only referring to that incident when they got their chance.  He had to stretch to get a touch on the ball.  Therefore I've said that you might argue he should have let the ball go.  But he never was in a position to head it clear.  That is easy to see.  Why don't you rather ask who Smalling is watching?

2218~~~
Word

2219~~~
That awful backpass that should've resulted in a Sterling goal
Being outmuscled and leaving Diouf through on goal
Heading it back to Yeovils striker who missed a sitter


These are all recent, Evans is lucky by the grace of God that none of them went in.

2220~~~
Nah mate that can't be true can it? Haven't you heard all our other centre backs are perfectly comfortable in a back 3 except for Evans, common knowledge apparently.

2221~~~
Back a few years
Correct but even he did stay on his feet let the ball fly past him and I suspect it still would have landed in a danger area he would still be criticized for standing up looking on.

From the second that ball was kicked Evans unfortunately found himself in an extremely tricky situation or two worlds he didn't have the time to think or figure out that he was more than likely going to get enough on the header that would have taken the ball away from danger. If he was another inch taller or the ball was an inch lower when he connected with it, it could have been a brilliant interception by him.

Smalling leaving a lad with an acre of space in the box is nothing new either but he has age on his side, 5 hundred odd days younger than Evans or something.

2222~~~
I would rather ask why he was in a position where he had to stretch to deal with an aerial ball that he had time to watch. Smalling's position becomes irrelevant the moment Jonny deals effectively with that ball. He has got to get his act together and fast because he is not making the best of decisions currently.

2223~~~
and here comes Pogue, Jonny's biggest fan.

It's been said million times- Evans gives away one chance a game...no, in fact he creates one. It's been like that for ages.

Smalling has solid games in between poor ones. 

Evans' reputation is actually based on something.

2224~~~
I've said my view on his errors on various occasions but in this case I don't think he deserves the stick. He was in a position to mark another player running into the box.  He was about to track back with him when the cross came and he stretched for it.  On hindsight, he probably shouldn't have but hardly a howler by him.

2225~~~
So far this season:

Back pass against MK Dons
Back pass against Burnley
Back pass against Liverpool
Completely out of position and then out muscled by Benteke.
Out muscled by Diouf against Stoke.
Flick on straight to Yeovil player.

That's in 11 games so far. Horrendous stuff.

2226~~~
Honestly, I can't remember a single match this season where he didn't give at least one golden chance for the opposition. It's that bad.

2227~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/evansbrs7r.gif" src="http://abload.de/img/evansbrs7r.gif"/>

2228~~~
What a great defensive line. Even the 19 year old knows what a line looks like...

2229~~~
Arguing over Evans and Smalling just feels pointless, people may scoff at oldschool Pally and Bruce but I'd take those two Ingurlish bruisers over any of the current turnips we have, I honestly cannot see any of them as a top CB that is required at every club with ambitions of winning their league and the CL, there's such a mix of weakness, fragility, idiocy and poor positioning between them that I've pretty much lost hope. someone get Leia and R2, I need to send a message.

2230~~~
Does he or does any of them for that matter? All I can see going on there is yet more evidence of how disorganized and clueless the defence is and has been since LvG took over. Thank feck the ball or cross didn't land in the direction of the lad strolling around whistling at the back post or he would have had then until next Christmas to figure out where he wanted to bury it.

If they were set up properly or in the system they were used too before all this 3 at the back and keep passing it back to them shite was introduced I think you'd see a big difference.

2231~~~
An old Laurent Blanc, was very intelligent and experienced.
He used his vast experience to help us, particularly in European games where we seemed to be struggling.
Like T.Sherringham, if you have intelligence on your side, speed and age count for little, because you can "think" 2 steps ahead of the younger, less experienced opponents.
A great example of this right now, is F.Lampard. Pelligrini did well to get Lampard.
Similarly, at Chelsea you have J.Terry, who is their best defender.
IMO, we need an older, experienced defender at the back, who can organise our defence.

2232~~~
I think it is high time for <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> to reconsider his devil's advocate act. I myself love to spot a ruby trying to sprout out among a heap of excrement, but occasionally, one has to recognize that it's turned out to be a shiny crock of dried cow menstruation...

You can't always win. For example, I shamed myself with my faith in Kagawa and it is time you stop<span style="font-size: 16px"> trying to swim your way up through a  waterfall...

Why is that waterfall part in bold. Strange stuff..

2233~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That's great. Surreal but great. The weird font change enhances it.

2234~~~
It's been done.




Nice gif above, and can't really fault him much. It was just unfortunate it dropped to the Yeovil player.

2235~~~
Another bad performance, almost produced a very similar error to the one which led to a goal in the League Cup earlier in the season.

2236~~~
I've been very critical of Evans and don't think he's up to it.... But I also don't really think his mistake was anything more than bad luck today. Tried to get a head on it and was very unlucky it feel to their lad.

2237~~~
I'm not overly surprised to see people labeling that chance as a howler by Evans, when it wasn't really. If anything it could be viewed as poor communication by the CB's, but you can hardly put that chance fully on Evans. For me he simply couldn't get enough on it and it skimmed off his head, hardly his fault or a howler. I'd have greater concern over why the other two CB left the striker free in the box in the first place, or didn't provide a shout to let Evans know he didn't have to attempt to reach it.

Evans was rather solid today. Nothing great, but he was decent for the most part. Our second best CB out there behind Smalling who agains was only slightly above average himself. What today did show was that we need to move away from the three at the back. None of our CB really look comfortable in it and when we did make the switch, you could see some improvements.

2238~~~
To be rather solid against Yeovil is the least you'd expect of a United CB. Unfortunately, it's the most we can expect.

McNair gets a pass from me for a season or 2 given his age, but Smalling and Evans especially are simply not the quality of player one expects at United.

2239~~~
Anyone wanting to slate Evans for that header needs to take their agenda and do one. It's sheer bad luck.

2240~~~
Doesn't head it, there's a great chance that Yeovil player running forward gets it.

2241~~~
And he's not the scapegoat?

2242~~~
An accident waiting to happen. If he can't turn the form soon he should be sold

2243~~~
I don't particularly rate him as a defender but that was a pretty brutal ball to deal with. Really unlucky where it landed, but we got away with it.

2244~~~
Well I meant in that one particular clip.

Smalling and McNair are in a decent line, Evans is half way to midfield

2245~~~
It really isn't. You can clearly see Smalling is getting in a position to simply clear the ball with ease, except for Evans' header wrong footing him and heading it into the path of their forward.

I would be surprised if Smalling didn't shout and it was ignored; but even if he didn't Evans misreads the flight of the ball completely and has no idea about what was going on around him. A good defender has a picture of the situation and simply leaves it for Smalling to deal with, or puts themselves in a position to deal with it in the first place.

For me it was similar to defenders that just stick a leg out and end up deflecting a tame shot away from the keeper into their own goal. Yes you can brush it aside and hide behind "bad luck" but the fact is that it's actually poor decision making. Saying that he wasn't the only one, McNair was dreadful and Smalling was mediocre as well.

However Evans has been incredibly fortunate not to has cost us 5-6 points this season; he seems to gift the opposition a golden opportunity once every 150-200 minutes, which is unacceptable.

2246~~~
Evans knows what's around him. He's a couple of yards away from the attacker. He doesn't need to drop into the box and have 3 defenders covering the lone striker. Smalling or McNair should be much closer to the attacker

2247~~~
Which is exactly what he did against Stoke when Shaw cleared the ball over the bar, and yet somehow it was still his fault and he obviously got slated for it on here.

2248~~~
You're over complicating it to try and believe that Evans is at fault (no one is at fault, it's football, sometimes these things happen). You're forgetting that this situation happened in real time, from the time the ball left the attackers boot til it got to Evans is so little, I don't care what Smalling says or doesn't say, it's a natural reaction from Evans to try and get something on the ball. If he thinks he can head it, he will try for it, that's nothing to do with ability, it's nothing to do with reading the game, it's nothing to do with coaching etc it's pure natural instinct. You and I would have done the same thing, it's just a reaction when the ball comes from that distance.

If you slow everything down, all your points have grounds. However, football is played at normal speed and that is extremely quick on the ground compared to the TV, so when you break everything down like you have, well you have just wasted both our time.

2249~~~
The difference against Stoke was that he could have done exactly what Shaw eventually did, head it out of play. Leaving it in that instance merely complicated the issue and potentially gave the opposition a chance. There is a big difference between Option A being gifting the opposition a chance and Option B being to leave it for your defensive partner; versus Option A being to comfortably clear it or Option B being leave it for someone else to have a more difficult job clearing it.

The first scenario is smart defending, the second is cowardice.

If that's the case then almost no one ever makes a mistake. If a striker fluffs a shot and it's clearly going wide, natural instinct tells a defender to try and get a boot on it. If it ends up in his own net, bad luck. If a defender is in a poor position or misreads a cross, just bad luck. Everything happens quickly on a Football field, but if you lose your man at a corner, you've screwed up (just as our other defenders did vs Stoke); likewise if you play a blind back-pass, put yourself in a poor position or misread a situation, at the top level it's screwing up.

The fact is there are tiny margins in Football. Evans flick on was completely blind and wasn't just bad luck; it was bad positioning and a failure to recognise that his defensive partner had the situation covered, and ultimately we could have been out of the FA Cup because of it. Likewise we'd have lost to Stoke if Diouf put away his chance. Against Liverpool they could have gotten back in the game if Sterling doesn't fluff a simple chance. I think there was another occasion earlier in the season where he put a striker through as well.

Admittedly it's harsh to blame Evans; however do we settle for having defenders who constantly made poor decisions that lead to this bad luck? Or do we call them out on it and aspire to the standard that Bruce, Pallister, Stam, Ferdinand, Vidic etc have set in the past? If McNair was a 27 year old experienced defender with over 200 top level caps his thread would be similarly negative.

2250~~~
Yep, I have to agree with Getsme here. I don't think Evans was to blame here. He should have tried to get his head on the ball there, you can't assume your fellow defenders are going to bail you out. He was very unlucky that it dropped to their lad.

2251~~~
The lengths some go to to defend Jonny is amusing. As soon as LGV gets the defenders he wants this guy will be shipped out, simply isn't up to the standard we want to reach.

2252~~~
I agree with this too, that he's not good enough, and will be shipped out.

2253~~~
I don't think it's so much in defence of his performance, more so defending him from the absolute avalanche of abuse he cops because he isn't world class.

I have a lot of time for him, I'm the first to admit we need to invest in new defenders but I don't understand the abusing of players like Evans.

2254~~~
Dunno how anyone can look at that gif and single Evans out for criticism. Which is - obviously - not to say he couldn't have done better. He did mistime his jump. However, it was a difficult clearance for him to make and a simple hoof for Smalling if he'd been a bit more positive and let Evans know it was his ball. If he'd heard a shout from his defensive partner there's no way Evans would have tried to head that ball. Playing in front of a few thousand people there's simply no excuse for not making yourself heard. Dreadful lack of communication from the one defender with a clear picture of everything that's happening. Reminds me of the moment in that Leicester game which made Rooney lose his shit. Smalling and Blind both competing for the same header. Speak up ffs.

Anyway, that header is the least of our problems. Smalling and McNair can see the line being held by Evans and Blackett yet, for some bizarre reason, are holding their own line - about 5 yards further back. Which is crappy defending, before you even get into the fact that they've managed to mark neither of the Yeovil players in the box. Smalling has left the striker completely free on the 6 yard box and McNairis is at least 10 yards away from the bloke he should be marking, who is standing in acres of space at the far post. Although, to be fair, he's drawn out of position by Smalling's brainfart.

To be honest, we should be past the point of blaming individuals by now. Our defensive woes are systemic. Nobody seems to have the faintest idea what they're supposed to be doing. This is most apparent in a 352 but the gif above was during the second half, with a more conventional back four. And our defensive shape is still abysmal. We spend so much of the season playing a formation that confuses the shit out of everyone, they're still addled when they revert to a formation that''s supposed to be familiar!

If you ask me, there's far too much emphasis on the quality of individual defenders this season and not enough on the defensive coaching, which can make any back four look more than the sum of their parts. I really hope Van Gaal's "philosophy" pays  attention to the basics of defending as a unit and we'll see long term benefits in the latter half of this season. Because up until now, we've been an absolute fecking shambles.

2255~~~
Indeed and being perma camped in this thread defending the guy is bordering on the pathological.

He's one more high profile mistake away from ending his United career I reckon. As it stands he's a dead man walking United wise.

2256~~~
This.

2257~~~
For me I dont slam Evans for their chance yesterday really. Its just his overall performances this year, he could if performing like he used to 3 yrs back have stamped his place as our first choice CB. And been a leader in the back line with probably the most experience out of the lot. BUT he looks shakey and average. He's lost a yrd and reading of play is poor, his range of passing looks weaker and just all round isnt as sure as he used to be. But as I mentioned before only Rio or Vidic could tell you how much they talked him through games, maybe he needs a leader next to him, which we dont have.

Thats my criticism just that if he was playing at a similar level as to how he used to, he'd be our first choice. 

Hope he refinds this form, as he's a long way from being 'past it'.

2258~~~
I don't think the header yesterday was a real howler; certainly not his worst mistake in recent weeks. However, watching the gif makes me believe that it wasn't his ball to head anyway. Our defenders should know what everyone else is doing so, as Evans was tracking the run of the person in front of him, he should have the belief and understanding that his partner would be covering off any more attacking players making a run in behind. 

Individual errors are infuriating but most of our problems at the back seem to be coming from a complete lack of confidence / trust. They panic and make stupid decisions and, whilst that is acceptable with the kids still learning their trade, Evans won't be at the club much longer if he can't display the skills that he should have picked up in abundance from Rio and Vidic for the first decade of his professional career. He should be the one keeping things together at the back but he looks miles away from that at the moment unfortunately.

2259~~~
That our defenders cannot fathom defending or switch between 3-5-2 and 4-3-3/4-4-2 is not done really - its been a good 4 months now, and they should have adapted to it nicely by now. And its not that no one has adapted to the system - Phil Jones, Valencia, Young certainly have.

As for LVG paying attention to defending as a unit, well thats the first thing he said when he was asked about the quality of his defenders - an emphasis on organisation. He said that after the game with Spurs as well:

Its pertinent to note how easily his Holland players, especially defenders were able to adapt/switch between the systems, while quite a few of our players are not able to do so - to my mind, a fair bit of blame of the blame has to go to individual defenders as well.

2260~~~
At the age of 27, Jonny Evans is at the peak of his powers.

2261~~~
That doesn't mean that he should be abused for every bloody single mistake, some of them not even his mistakes.

2262~~~
Big blow for Evans today, getting dropped for a midfielder who had been injured for a while and then Blackett getting on before him. Did Evans have a slight knock or something or is the writing on the wall for him?

2263~~~
Dont rate him but still miles better than Blackett and should start. Want to see him play in a 4 man defence, all our defenders have looked better in that system.

2264~~~
Why didn't he come on for Shaw? I understand that he hasn't been in good form at all (and I am one of the ones who have been harsh on him) but all the three older CBs are still way ahead of  Blackett and McNair.

2265~~~
As bad as he is, he's still better then Blacket (who is woeful).

2266~~~
No, he's not. There's not a single defender in the league who's been as shit as Evans has been this season. THat's one of the few things LVG did get right yesterday - not rewarding his shit performances with even more appearances.

2267~~~
In another thread there are comments from LvG saying Rojo is a fixture in his main starting line-up, couple that with Blackett being chosen as the LCB sub today and Evans is looking like he'll be the one to make room if we can get a top CB in this window.

2268~~~
How many times has de Gea saved his brainfarts? Useless player.

2269~~~
We need a serious overhaul of the defence. Surely LvG can see such a simple thing?

2270~~~
Defense, midfield and forward line.

Rooney and Di Maria need to be swapped.

2271~~~
Absolute teapot.

2272~~~
He is consistent in making mistakes every game.

2273~~~
By now I feel like it's a decent performance for his standards if he only gives away 1 clear cut chance in a game

He's hardly top half standard at this point, that's how far he's regressed.

2274~~~
I think the writing is on the wall for him. He has totally folded under the pressure of being the senior defender at the club. 

The word was that Van Gaal thought that he was the pick of the defenders when he first joined. I think that is because Johnny is the best on the ball. It is a shame that all goes to pot when he is under pressure.

2275~~~
To think people were bemoaning his absence in the last game. He's complete wank.

2276~~~
Yep, I'm about finished with him now. Should be sold in the summer, without doubt.

2277~~~
All three centre backs weren't very good but today was a pretty standard Evans performance from what he's shown this season. Needs to go and is running out of games to change my mind.

2278~~~
Utterly gormless.....

2279~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Love Herrera's reaction

2280~~~
Wilson said he went off injured. I shudder to think he might have played the full 90 and we'd have kept the three at the back if not for that injury

2281~~~
Is our defence really that weak?
We have one of the best defences in the league, according to the table.
Surely our attacking midfield is weaker, given the lack of chances being created?

2282~~~
That's because we have the best goalie of the entire league saving our defenders' butts. Otherwise, Jonny Evans has been involved on a large number of goalscoring chances conceded just like a number of others at the back. Again today, his level of performance was unacceptable for a 27-year-old.

2283~~~
It's not just that. We're also trying to find a balance that will help the back line - but it's costing us big time upfront.

2284~~~
At best, he's in 4th place among our CB's right now, and I'm not sure he'd make it over Carrick playing there (if Shaw is around at LB and Blind can play DM) or McNair coming in, if we had a cup final. 

I really didn't expect to be saying this 2-3 year ago, but he should probably go. He's one of those British players who should play in a different league, but won't and it will hurt his career. He'd do well in La Liga, I think. Get bullied less often and his intelligence and technical skills would be more useful. Sevilla, not Newcastle, but it won't happen.

2285~~~
Yet again another mistake which could've led to the opposition scoring. This guy is a complete joke and should be nowhere near the starting 11.

2286~~~
Yeah I've pretty much given up on him. Showed at times great potential but sadly a move Sunderland it is.

2287~~~
Even in four man defense it may be hard to find a place for him right now.

He'll probably stay to the end of this season as there's no certain answer on January's transfer plans yet.

2288~~~
this - could have just played it out , kick it 20 rows up but he tried to control it.

2289~~~
Didn't deserve to start ahead of Smalling. Strange decision. The clock is ticking on his United career.

2290~~~
I tried being patient with him due to his injury and thought he was rusty, but now I realise, he is just not good enough. He should be sold ASAP.

2291~~~
Thought he was pretty good bar the incident that lead to the chance.

2292~~~
Did anyone else notice that when Felliani scored and ran over to the bench to hug Adnan - Evans looked so pissed off? (perhaps someone stepped on his toe), didn't look like he knew we had just scored a vital goal!

2293~~~
There was some gif that's shown that Evans was poked by either Fellaini's elbow (<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>) or Adnan, can't remember.

2294~~~
Someone mentioned that since his marriage his form has deteriorated quite considerably...

2295~~~
Fecking hell. His is a rock solid defen...

Oh wait.

2296~~~
His wife is a looker, so I guess he'd rather be home getting nursed.

2297~~~
That's a little cheap if we have to blame the missus either implicitly or explicitly.

For me, it's all coming down to how he copes with everything and he has shown that he cannot cope well enough to be worthy of playing professional football at United any longer. Just sign the transfer papers for him to get to whatever damn place as long as it is far away from Old Trafford.

2298~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://38.media.tumblr.com/d0b1bcc6e9faeda960a7d0ce70b53ec3/tumblr_nibxg5pge01td4ofto3_400.gif" src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/d0b1bcc6e9faeda960a7d0ce70b53ec3/tumblr_nibxg5pge01td4ofto3_400.gif"/>

2299~~~
Yea, he wasn't too bad outside of that IMO but he's always good for that mistake.

2300~~~
As are all our defenders.

2301~~~
And always what he's judged against irregardless.

2302~~~
I know he is hated by many at the moment but I thought he did well. Didn't have to do much but thought in a 4 at the back, he looked a lot more confident with and without the ball.

2303~~~
I thought he was our best CB with the ball coming into this season but at this point I think Smalling is about as good as him.

2304~~~
He was better than Smalling yesterday though.

2305~~~
He improved on the ball and played with more confidence than he ever did. He still struggled against Elliot, physically, but with Smalling taking care of Elliot, Evans was okay. He didn't make too many mistakes, and all in all, he looked relatively comfortable. I just hope this isn't because he was facing low-level forwards.

2306~~~
Of course it was <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2307~~~
I can't fathom how he went from under Fergie showing promise of being an accomplished ball playing defender to someone who struggling to control the ball.

2308~~~
Diabolical today, dragged the whole defence down. And I've usually been a supporter.

2309~~~
He benefited massively from playing alongside top defenders.

2310~~~
Needs to go, simple as.

2311~~~
His long balls are very accurate, it's a huge asset in times when we just cant play the ball on the ground.

2312~~~
Wank as usual. We always concede with him at the back and his clearances/passes are just so panicky. It causes our whole back four to become shaky.

Squad player I suppose and with Shaw/Jones both out we have no choice but to use him.

2313~~~
Terrible at the start of the second half and it's only two mins in.

2314~~~
Fire him out of the first team and into the sun.

2315~~~
An absolute embarrassment these days.

2316~~~
fecking shite, sell him to Hull

2317~~~
Never rated this guy, complete liability.

2318~~~
I've always been a staunch supporter and defender of Evans, but my god, he's just not good enough anymore, it's plain to see now. Needs to go.

2319~~~
Beyond shocking tonight.

2320~~~
McNair is about twelve and is already more adept at playing every defensive position as well as central midfield than Evans is at playing centre back.

2321~~~
It's the basics that he fails to do which can cost us tonight

2322~~~
I don't expect to see him here next season. He has regressed very badly. Zero confidence to add to that.

2323~~~
Hopefully Keano gets back into management ASAP. He'll take him off our hands

2324~~~
He's past it. Sell him.

2325~~~
What happened to him? I reckon he needs a move to refresh his career.

2326~~~
Terrible tonight and our worst player this season. Doesn't even look like a viable squad option.

2327~~~
Shaw back in the squad will be a welcome relief. I shit bricks watching him shit bricks when he plays. There is a good player in there, just looks nervous when playing

2328~~~
Scared of his own shadow

2329~~~
Bad at everything. Good at nothing. Tom Cleverley of centre backs.

2330~~~
Wouldn't look out of place playing for a lower PL club.

2331~~~
Definitely on his way out in the summer. Every time I see his name on the team sheet I get nervous...

2332~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Couldn't have said it better!

2333~~~
Was he that bad?

2334~~~
You really wonder why he's picked before... well, basically anyone

2335~~~
Worse.

2336~~~
It'd be easier to say how many times he found a teammate than how many times he gave the ball away. Can't see how anyone can defend him now. He's so so bad. Wouldn't look out of place at Burnley.

2337~~~
He gets bullied. He has the most punchable face. And when he puts his hands out, shifts to the left and hopelessly hoofs it when usually there is a 'midfielder' with his arms out calling for it, I cringe.

2338~~~
I tried to give him 0 in the match rating thing but it wouldn't let me.

2339~~~
He was shit again...at this rate Bradford City wouldn't even buy him!

2340~~~
He looks afraid of his shadow these days and makes ridiculous number of errors.

2341~~~
I thought this game would be good for him to ease back into form, but nope. Still same old useless Evans.

Sick of him now, ship him off as soon as possible.

2342~~~
He really is dick cheese

2343~~~
My favourite bit was when a Burnley player was running at our goal and he just ran alongside him but kept a distance of about 3 metres the whole way, allowing him to run freely towards de Gea and get a shot off.

2344~~~
Yes.

Every short pass he made went to a Burnley player.

Smashed into Blind, when both were jumping for the same ball and he's got a concussion now.

Was literally given the run around by Burnley attackers.

2345~~~
He would, he'd be a liability for anyone in this form. Worst player on the pitch

2346~~~
I've never rated him and wish he'd just f*ck off to Everton or newcaslte

2347~~~
The problem with Evans is that he is like a 'best hits' of our worst defensive traits over the years: 

1. Has the appalling distribution of Wes Brown, meaning teams let him have the ball
2. Has the ball watching brain farts of young Rio
3. Has the terrifying lack of pace of late Vidic
4. Has the 'Silvestre' moment at least once a match when he gifts the opposition a chance

He really brings nothing. No organisational skills, no aerial dominance...nothing but a big target that says to the opposition: Give it to this guy, he won't hurt you.

2348~~~
He'd be lucky to even play for them.

Seriously wouldn't look out of place in the lower half of the Championship.

2349~~~
Interesting performance. A couple of superb long cross-field passes yet simple 5 to 10 yard passes seemed beyond his capability so often did he find an opponent. Routine clearances went straight up in the air, or out for a corner. Beating his man to a cross a complete non-starter.

2350~~~
I thought that he improved in the last 20minutes, but before that horrible (and I was a big supporter of him).

2351~~~
I remember some people on here saying he was one of the best ball playing CB in the world.

2352~~~
First one out of ten I've ever given. Just everything about him is terrible. 

Playing him because he's left footed.. Christ all mighty, he can't use both feet, his head and it looks like he barely uses his brain.

2353~~~
He's finished here at the end of the season.

2354~~~
He hasnt progressed AT all and is regressing IMO. He should be shipped out in the summer.

2355~~~
He is probably our worst defender in every facet of the game now. His passing is hideous, he's nervous on the ball, positionally all over the place, his headers have even less direction than his passing and why oh why does he always let the fecking ball bounce?!

2356~~~
And the injury proneness of Smalling and Jones.

2357~~~
Haha yep. He kept away and then slipped and stumbled as well.

2358~~~
One of the least confidence inspiring performances by a United defender I've ever seen <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2359~~~
Forgot that bit yeah. Just fell over, adding to the spasticity of the whole thing.

2360~~~
Looks like a pub-style player out there. 

Really should never be anywhere near the team sheet.

2361~~~
Pant soilingly diabolical. Like a tangled puppet being controlled by a drunken cat.

2362~~~
Always fought his corner, thought he was going to be great when he was 19, 20. Hard to see any way back now. I talk about the good days now, I nearly feel like I'm making it up.

2363~~~
Horrible to watch (and more than a little scary). Thank god Smalling was there - and not only for his goals.

2364~~~
Terrible today, wort player on the pitch, and thats saying something given Falcaos performance.

2365~~~
He's just an absolute disaster of a player.

2366~~~
He looks to burst into tears every time he gets the ball. Parody of a footballer these days. Feel sorry for him.

2367~~~
he really has to go doesn't he? He's not even championship level now....probably might make the bench at Southend...

2368~~~
Same for me as well, hard to believe he's 27.

Also, I used to think he was a two-footed CB, now I'm convinced he is neither-footed.

2369~~~
Has regressed so much it's unreal. Plus it's not like he was world class in the first place.

2370~~~
Wouldn't look out of place in the Burnley defence, actually that's a bit offensive to their defenders. Hopefully we see the last of him and Jones in summer.

2371~~~
Sabotage performance.

2372~~~
Wank. He's definitely finished here. Hasn't recovered from that MK Dons game, needs to move for his own sake.

2373~~~
I'd hate to see his dry cleaning bill given how often he shits his pants, Jesus wept.

2374~~~
Atrocious is the word

2375~~~
Simply not good enough. Looks like time may well be up for Jonny at this level.

2376~~~
It is amazing how bad he is, he must be the worst defender in the World when being pressed.

I simply can't see him being here next season, LvG must be twitching his ass everytime he has the ball.

2377~~~
Anyone else shit their pants when he played a ball along the ground?  It's bad when I'm glad he hoofs it.

Never ever rated him, despite my hopes he would turn out better than his old partner Pique (what others used to say) he's never fully convinced.

2378~~~
He brought the ball down on the spin in our area at one point. Convinced it was an accident.

2379~~~
Reckon he will be decent for whatever club he signs for. He seems unable to cope with the pressure here and his confidence is non-existent. Shouldn't be playing for us anymore.

2380~~~
can't remember a player regressing so much

should be on his way in Summer

2381~~~
Like playing with 10 men, might as well pass to the opposition instead of him, would result in the same thing.

2382~~~
Rossi you make me laugh! Btw - 'dick cheese'?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2383~~~
These last three pages have been hilarious tbf. Best thing he's contributed to all night.

2384~~~
This is how I feel about Jonny Evans right now...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2WZ9epECifo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2385~~~
He was equally as bad as Falcao. He won't be here next season that's for sure. He will be a great player for a club with less expectation and pressure......similar to how the likes of Brown, O'Shea, P.Neville all thrived at clubs with less pressure

2386~~~
Our most experienced defender. Doesn't act like one but as a sub he can do his... nah, feck it.

2387~~~
Only thing I can describe him as. Well, actually no that's a lie. I can think of worse.

If I didn't know any better, I'd say they've shaved a chimp and stuck him in a No.6 shirt. I've seen Sunday league footballers pass the ball better and have more composure.

He keeps the Andrex puppies in business

2388~~~
He's like a Virtual pro of someone brand new to FIFA. Horrendously bad at this point.

2389~~~
Shocking. Needs to be moved on in the summer when we can bring in another quality LCB as compeition for Rojo. Belongs in the championship.

2390~~~
Still can't believe he headed that clearance backwards, under zero pressure, for a corner <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2391~~~
I know that was absolutely bizarre.

2392~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2393~~~
Gave him 4 on the match ratings... and that was generous.

2394~~~
Gave him 5... out of 50.

2395~~~
Hahaha, The Thick of it!!! Brilliant show.   
If Evans is Swain, does that make Fergie Malcolm Tucker and Moyes Hugh Abbot?

2396~~~
What happened to Evans? Used to be Evans + 1 a few years ago <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2397~~~
No Rio, no Vidic, no Evans.

2398~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Good call!

Van Gaal is Stuart - a master bullshitter.

2399~~~
i know... it's sad. i've always really liked him, but he was so, so poor today and not for the first time recently.

2400~~~
Don't like overly criticising our players but I really don't want Evans anywhere near the team any more, unfortunately he has completely lost all confidence but worse the whole defence becomes nervous when he's there

2401~~~
Yep both were abysmal, way way below the required level of performance.

2402~~~
So not only is he shit, he then goes and knocks out our one ray of sunshine consistent outfield player...

2403~~~
Dreadful performance bereft of confidence and basic know-how.

Smalling-Rojo partnership whilst Jones is out please.

2404~~~
I don't think I've ever seen such a unanimous decision in a post match thread. Absolute garbage.

2405~~~
Ship him to Everton and get discount on Stones :-D

2406~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How do you follow that?

2407~~~
Don't know what's happened to him.

2408~~~
He umm, is a future club captain don't forget.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2409~~~
He was very good only 2 seasons ago. Not world class, but it is just bizarre how much he has gone backwards.

2410~~~
Completely forgot about that. Poor Daley.

2411~~~
That was fecking awful. He and Falcao battled it out for who the worst player on the pitch was. I don't know why LcG persists with him in the LCB. Yes Smalling/Jones are right footed but c'mon! They would be nowhere near as bad as that. What was with the clearance he headed out for a corner?! And just letting that Burnley player get a shot off in the first half. Time to go Jonny.

2412~~~
It genuinely upsets me how much he's declined in the last year. 

He was a genuine contender for captain and I'd have been happy if he did get it at the time. So, so far from that now.

2413~~~
I was worried every time the ball came into his immediate vicinity. He couldn't even play the simple pass tonight and was at sixes and sevens all night. Dire performance.

2414~~~
Certainly seems like he's played his way out of the club this season.

2415~~~
And considering he spent all that time learning from the best CB duo of their time, it's even more baffling to see such steep regression curve.

2416~~~
What the hell has happened to him?

He's been absolutely terrible all season, you could probably make a decent length compilation video of his numerous feck ups this year. He's been so lucky De Gea has pretty much saved him every time.

He has to go in the summer, he's been a mess.

2417~~~
You could have picked anyone in the crowd tonight who would have been less nervous.

2418~~~
He's done as a United player.

2419~~~
Looks like a nervous stoat about to make a dash across a busy main road. Worse, his anxious, fidgety, diffident approach and demeanour makes the rest of the defence neurotic and apprehensive.

Rojo and Smalling at CB for the rest of the season. Please.

 Smalling will pick up an injury though, so will likely see Evans feature again before the summer when he and Jones board the Dead Wood Stage out of town.

2420~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2421~~~
What are his wages?   I can see us being stuck loaning him out and picking up his salary

2422~~~
He's so bad he should be fired. I genuinely believe Kagawa would do a better job than him at centre-back.

This is coming from someone who rates him as an excellent defender in terms of natural ability and intelligence - he has just lost all of his balls & nerve. He is totally useless to us, he plays worse with every game.

2423~~~
He is steadily devolving into a terrible terrible player, he is at this point one of the worst cb's I have ever seen at MUFC. He can't defend, attack or pass.

He and falcao need to not play for us again, they will cost us games and while LVG is at it, he could be starting Herrera in the CM and letting rooney play up top.

2424~~~
It's shocking, what happened to him? Somebody put a kryptonite in his pockets?

2425~~~
£65k a week

2426~~~
He started to deteriorate after his marriage I guess.

2427~~~
Awful defender nowadays.
And to be honest he has only played because Rojo has played left-back and Evans left foot is better than Smalling's.

Like said in the Transfer forum. I can only see clubs like Sunderland, Crystal Palace or promotion clubs are interested in him.

2428~~~
Should be the first of our defenders to be shown the door this summer, with massive question marks remaining over Smalling and Jones with regards their fitness.

2429~~~
So washed up.

2430~~~
Not even sure how he can regress so terribly at a time when he should technically be entering his prime. This is like a Gary Neville before his retirement style regression and he's 27.

2431~~~
Having watched the game for the first time just now, he was fine. Not brilliant but not awful. His confidence was notably lacking though. He was no better or worse than the majority of players.

2432~~~
Woeful player

2433~~~
Same here.  It was like watching a car crash video on youtube, you know the crash was coming but didn't know how bad it would be in the end.  And to think I thought he would do well under LVG due to his ability to play the ball out of the back.

2434~~~
Fine? 

What game were you watching? He was far from fine.

2435~~~
Great point. It is just so strange. His belief in himself seems to have been completely shot.

2436~~~
He was very bad, his passing gives me heart attacks and he doesn't make you think he can beat his opponent in 1v1 duels.

2437~~~
Can't see him staying beyond this season. Injuries or otherwise never progessed to become the player he showed glimpses of in the earlier part of his career.

2438~~~
He's in the same boat as cleverley imo, way out of his depth at United and will go to a mid table team but not really impress there either. Evans was solid and promising years ago when he had the 2 best defenders in the world carrying him and making whoever was next to them look good. Any time he was without one of those two, he has been mediocre. Never as bad as this year though. The form he's shown isn't even premier league standard. We sold Michael Keane to Burnley who are 19th I think and he's comfortably been better then evans this season, that's the scary thing. 

He's obviously a premier league quality player overall, who is way off form but nothing more then mid table and was always incredibly overrated imo. His passing is awful too, can't believe we used to think he was a good ball playing defender. Wank all around.

2439~~~
Happened to Cleverley, Anderson and to possibly Chicharito. 

More on topic, it's tough to argue against selling him for the 5-7 million (and 65K in wages off the books) we should get from someone desperate for another CB like Newcastle (Coloccini so old, Yanga-Mbiwa gone, Taylor always hurt and Williamson straight Champ) or Everton (They'll have 2 CB's soon now that Distin has finally succumbed to the aging process, and also Alcaraz is technically a pro footballer). 

As I've written before, the money and British/Irish myopia means it won't happen, but he should absolutely go to Spain or Italy, where there are less big, fast strikers to bully him and his passing and normally solid reading of the play will matter more.

2440~~~
Good to know that his previous decent performance was just a one off <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Seen people compare him to Cleverley. Why? Evans was actually good for a decent amount of time. He's actually regressed massively, unlike Cleverley who never progressed.

He needs to go. I was an ardent supporter of Evans under SAF. But now he's become a complete liability. I have no idea what LvG did to him but he's in complete shambles. He's so afraid of putting his foot in. Always waits for the attacker to make his move and then tries to intercept him. He's playing like a frightened kid. His passing was his greatest asset and that's gone down the drain. How many times did he lose the ball under no pressure whatsoever. He got enough opportunities and didn't take them. Definitely he'll be the first to go this summer.

2442~~~
He just isn't physical enough. I don't know if he has lost weight or a previous injury has left him being timid to contact, but he just looks scared stiffless as soon as anybody get's near him. He doesn't even need to be the hulk either, just enough to not let the strikers get 1 over on him, but every game they run him ragged or push him around. I would genuinely rather use Thorpe than Evans at this point.

2443~~~
He's a great example of how much a centre-back can contribute if he has a strong partner (Vidic) next to him.

2444~~~
Its nothing that LvG has done to him, he has never been a good player.
For what ever reason his myriad of long term faults were washed over when we were winning things and people seemed to willfully ignore the fact that he has always been liable to panic under pressure, struggled with physicality, always made dozy hospital passes that put us under pressure, always been suspect with his positioning and not great in the air.
Its no coincidence that as soon as he didnt have Vidic and Ferdinand to play along side him it became increasingly obvious to more and more people that he is not a very good player.

2445~~~
Chelsea would get 12-13m for him <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

I hope 7-8m for Evans and 15m for Jones.

2446~~~
The bold part is absolute tripe and a great reminder of how shortlived the memories are of supporters.

2447~~~
He was very poor, as poor as he has ever been but some of the shit he is getting is embarrassing. I still have a lot of time for him and thought from a defensive point of view, he was okay. On the ball though, he was woeful, I'll accept that.

Still a United player and needs the support which he just isn't getting. Just like Fellaini last year, not supported, shit performances. This season, fans behind him, positive performances.

Smalling and Rojo have the best chance of a decent partnership though.

2448~~~
More like 4 and 6, on a good day.

2449~~~
Looks mentally shot but to be honest if my mrs looked like his I'd have an issue focusing on anything other than the needs of my knob.

2450~~~
He's not far off from becoming the subject of a match-fixing investigation.

Bramble > Senderos > Traore > Evans

2451~~~
LVG with the stinger.

2452~~~
Ouch!

2453~~~
Bit mixed for me, on the one hand I remember him having excellent spells. We once played a match in the Bernabeu, drawing there with Jonny having a decent match, great to see. On the other hand I remember the City match. And against Everton with him just standing there, letting Fellaini score the equaliser when we gave the league away.

In pre-season USA I remember a moment where Van Gaal started pointing and shouting at Evans at half-time because he was losing it. Very similar to this one years ago:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/maVsd5Rq2Wg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He's never looked less confident than this season though, shame to see because when he's confident he's not a bad player.

2454~~~
Honesty from LVG, at least he says what he thinks.

But regarding Evan’s performance yesterday, he was terrible. I can’t remember when was the last time he was so bad… Often he looks weak defensively, but he can compensate with a good distribution, and a good intelligence, but he can’t head the ball… did he won a dual yesterday?

At the beginning of the season I was sure that he was our best defender. He’s the most experienced, he play a lot of games, he had bad moments and top ones. He had a great partnership with Rio and was a rock defensively, and I thought that he would step up this season, as during the preseason LVG said that he was impressed by him…

The worst in this entire thing is that in the famous PHILOSOPHY, Evans is the type of player LVG is looking for. Somebody able to pass the ball, to play simple passes forward, who can integrate the midfield on possession.

I think that I will regret him this summer, but it’s for the sake of the club and his own… Good bye mister Evans. We’ve been ruthless with Cleverley, Welbeck and Fletch regarding their level recently, we must do the same now with him (and maybe one of Smalling and Jones too)

2455~~~
sorry can't see tweet at work, whats it say?

2456~~~
Well I'm sorry but he's still the idiot, for want of a better expression, for refusing to start a superior centre-half because he is stronger on his right side anyway.

2457~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2459~~~
No debate from me there.

I would of started Smalling over Evans

2460~~~
Let's be honest here,  as bad as Evans was defensively, Smalling wasn't to far behind.  In fact our whole defence was shit,  but mainly the two CBs.

2461~~~
His decline this season has been horrific. By all accounts, he's quite an intelligent lad. I wonder if he's getting too caught up in this whole philosophy thing and over-thinking everything he does? 

Nothing seems to come instinctively or naturally anymore. It's all tortuously drawn out and laboured. Utterly bereft of confidence too. If there's nothing else going on then it's one of the strangest and most dramatic regressions I've ever seen. At an age when he should be hitting his peak too.

2462~~~
I think it's simply down to confidence, but you are 100% right when you say his decline has been horrific.  What ever the cause,  its going to be hard to come back from it.

2463~~~
He's playing with absolutely 0 confidence, and he's been like that since the start of the season. The only way to start getting confidence is by doing the basics right, and for a defender that just means hoofing it out rather than trying to play your way out. But obviously, LvG won't condone that, so there's a bit of a catch 22 there...

2464~~~
Burn.

2465~~~
Smalling hasn't spent the entire season trying his level best to pass the ball to the opposition though.

2466~~~
He does end up doing that often, though. The difference between the two is that Evans seems to have trouble dealing with long balls at times and gets nervous and goes through terrible spells (remember the West Ham cup game?), whereas Smalling is almost always good defensively and just not so good on the ball. 

Evans' slumps would be fine at a position like winger, but at CB it's more important you have a high floor than a high ceiling. He was excellent at times, especially during our streak where we didn't concede when Van Der Sar was around.

2467~~~
even by his recent standard, yesterday was really, really, really bad from evans.

definitely the first one to go once we bring in a new CB this summer.

2468~~~
Smalling may or may not have defended poorly on the night. But if LVG feels that he simply could not play Smalling because he is predominantly right-footed, then he's quite simply an idiot. And that is the implication I got by him saying he played because Shaw was unavailable (which meant we needed Rojo at left back and a new centre-half). The obvious question then is 'why not Smalling then?', and the likely answer is that he wasn't an option, due to not being left-sided.

As I said, that scenario would, in my opinion, make LVG an idiot. And I don't really care for anyone saying 'well I'm sure he knows more about football than you' etc. For all his footballing theology, he did not invent football, and there have probably been a lot more all right-footed partnerships than one right/left-footed one. There are better partnerships in this very league than any his right/left fettish allows that are all right-footed. He seems to like to over-complicate the game.

2469~~~
Evans is right footed as well.

2470~~~
And I don't think Smalling has ever even played LCB for us? It was always Rio and Jones who shifted to the left when partnered with Smalling, with Vidic and Evans almost exclusively playing as the LCBs under Fergie/Moyes (apart from when partnered with each other).

2471~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that's a better burn than the one on twitter, higher up the page.

2472~~~
Is he not right footed but can also play with his left?

2473~~~
It's simply the way he operates,  he must not like Smalling playing on the left side of a cb pairing.  In fact he doesn't seem to rate Smalling in the right of a cb pairing.

2474~~~
No, he doesn't. Nowhere near as often as Evans has this season at any rate.

2475~~~
Bulk is not an issue. To be a top class footballer, you need to be thin. 
Rio Ferdinand in his prime was built like a rake.
Di Maria is our thinnest player and some might say one of our best.
J.Terry is Chelsea's best defender and he is thin.
I could go on, but you get my point.
Contrary to what some believe, to be a top class footballer in 2015, being thin is better than looking like WWE wrestler.

J.Evans' problem is that he is scared of making an error and his size/weight wont make any difference - this is mental issue.

I agree though, that as long as he and P.Jones are on the pitch, we are likely to concede. This guy needs to be replaced.

2476~~~
Nope, you can go over my posting history.
I've never rated him at all.

I like to think for the most part I am a fair judge of players and for the most part get it right.
I never rated Welbeck either.

I remember saying Fletcher was finished two seasons ago and being shouted down and that he would be OK with a pre season under his belt.

2477~~~
1. I am not saying he needs to be fat <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> weight can be lost muscle mass too. he IMO to me looks less powerful and has worse balance than he used too.
2. John Terry may be in shape, but he is certainly not "thin". He's a big guy and certainly able to throw his weight around. 
3. Di Maria is a completely different area of the pitch, and does get bounced around quite a lot in some challenges. He rarely wins a 50/50 shoulder like Nani or Valencia could. They aren't fat either but certainly aren't "thin".

2478~~~
Remember when we thought it was "three at the back" causing the problems? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Put these clowns in any formation you like, they're shit. Jones and Evans giving perfect cameos to their United careers last night. 

3 at the back, 4 at the back - it doesn't matter. They simply don't have the quality to do what is required of a modern European level centre back. That's the level we should be going for!

2479~~~
Not at all. My post states 'due to not being left-sided' and 'predominantly' right footed. I am fully aware that Evans is right-footed. I am also aware that he is left-sided, and is generally ambidextrous.

2480~~~
Hope I never have to rake your lawn...

he will be a good player for someone like Everton once he regain his confidence back..

2482~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Rio was always physically imposing. Ronaldo is one of the best footballers in the world and I wouldn't call him thin, that would be too simplistic. Another example is Drogba at his peak
Being thin and being bulky are very different things and you don't have to be thin to be a great footballer.

2483~~~
Smalling has completed 89.2% of his passes this season - that's just behind Mata and Carrick and just ahead of Blind. He is by no means poor on the ball.

2484~~~
You can't compare a CB with midfielders. So many basic passes. Rio usually averaged in the high 90s. 82% is actually a bit shit with the amount of time we spend passing it around the back.

2485~~~
Mind you, just checked Jones and Rojo's stats vs West Ham. Atrocious. I've a horrible feeling all our centre-backs can't pass water since Rio and Vidic left. Would explain a lot.

2486~~~
It's 89.2, not 82.

2487~~~
Vidic wasn't really the greatest passer of the ball. Usually you'd have one who was the great passer and in our case back then it was Rio.

2488~~~
Oh right. That's pretty much standard for a CB. Even in a 442. Probably expect higher considering we've played three at the back so much.

2489~~~
Evans eh?..deary me....

2490~~~
Evans, we had so much hope. But he's beyond saving. Everything he does, turns out bad.

2491~~~
Just checked Rio's pass completion was around the 90% mark in the league for United. Vidic a little lower. About 85%.

Increased to 89% since he joined Inter. Do they play three at the back?

2492~~~
Sorry, but that's simply wrong. I'll use 2007-8 as an example (because I found some stats for it on Soccerlens.com). Scholes led the league with 89.6%; Rio led defenders with 84.8%. From a different source (ManUtd24): In 2009-10 Rio only made 13 appearances - his completion rate was 80%. Finally for 2010-11 (rationalfootball.wordpress.com) his rate was 80.1%.

2493~~~
Completely different to the stats I saw. See above. Was looking at his last few seasons. Not sure why you chose the ones you did.

2494~~~
Stats, schmats. I guess the point here is that you can't use the fact that a CB manages ninety point whatever pass completion in a match as an indication that he's good on the ball. Unless a CB attempts loads of long passes, he will have deceptively good passing stats in terms of pure percentage. If he doesn't, he's an utter liability (which Jones, for instance, was the other day - and his percentage reflects this).

Smalling is not good on the ball in any meaningful sense. Not that I care, really. As long as he can defend properly, that'll do - just team him up with the right man.

Anyway, Evans. Yes. I guess he needs to go unless he improves dramatically. Shame, as he did look very promising at one point.

2495~~~
Its no surprise Smalling has high pass completion rates, the amount our defenders dick about with it at the back passing to eachother under little pressure or going back to De Gea to hoof long. Having said that his ability on the ball is far better this season now that he's playing more central. He doesn't have much of a range and can't play an incisive pass but when he keeps it simple he's fine. I think he knows that himself and so atleast theres no delusions of grandeur. Bearing this in mind, we need to have a good ball playing defender alongside him to make up for it so we can get the ball moving upfield quicker, which means Rojo is his best partner.

2496~~~
82% or 89.2???? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2497~~~
Lolzssz

2498~~~
So, 89.2 not too shabby huh?

2499~~~
The way we play? Wouldn't expect any less from a CB.

2500~~~
The high 90s  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2501~~~
Indeed!

2502~~~
Smalling is third in pass completion in the league for centre backs this season, behind Skrtyl and Terry. Marquinhos is first in Europe with 92.4%. FWIW I don't think there are any great all playing centre backs in England at the moment. Smalling is almost identical with Jagielka for pass completion so that tells you all you need to know. The problem with Smalling is him rifling in passes too hard, statistically those will be counted complete.

Edit

<a class="username" data-user="61080, @Still ill" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61080/">@Still ill</a>

<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> 's man John Stones has a pass completion rate of 92.7% in the league so he is the standard.

2503~~~
Our lads can only aspire to the silky passing of Martin 'Platini' Skrtel. Really? Martin Skrtel?

2504~~~
This is the worry with Smalling. It may not matter that much to the fans about his inability to pass, but it matters to the man that picks the team. As I’ve said in previous posts, I don’t think he rates Smalling because of it.

2505~~~
I was constantly high in the 90s <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2506~~~
Aye, that's a fair point. To my thinking you can pair up someone like Smalling with a silkier partner - and that should work, provided Smalling is good enough as a pure defender. But LVG may indeed think differently.

Thing is, though: LVG can't spend any more time assessing his players, trying to teach philosophy to dunderheads or waiting for Smalling to magically become a ball player.

If he needs to bring in a different brand of player, then do it. In my opinion he should have brought in stop-gap defenders this window if our current selection is so poor it's forcing his hand when it comes to tactics and formations. It's an unacceptable situation for a club of our stature if the manager is stuck with players he cannot use properly.

2507~~~
A liability. Hopefully we get rid in the summmer.

2508~~~
Yes. Fine might be the wrong word to use but looking at the game knowing the result he was okay. Wasn't brilliant nor was he awful. Passing was shoddy as noticed by having the worst passing accuracy bar Jones.

2509~~~
You smoked that good ish eh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2510~~~
Smalling has been our best passer this season among the CBs lol! Good thing to criticize him on something he's actually improved on. He's passed better than your boy Evans

2511~~~
Will you please feck up with your silly little comments. Are you 12? seriously. Smalling can't pass for shit, I don't care what stats you use to back it up it's common knowledge. Best passer, do you actually watch games?
I think he's made up his mind, I think he sees it as Rojo + 1, with that one currently being Jones, or who ever is fit at the time.
I was surprised he didn't bring someone in at January, not because there was better players available, simply because of our horrendous injury record at the back.

2512~~~
Fvck up with my silly little comments? I speak the truth. I watch every game. Smalling's passing has improved a lot this season, you won't even fvcking admit that. 'I don't care about stats' LOL.

2513~~~
You're fecking childish with you immature little remarks, seriously just grow the feck up.

2514~~~
You get upset very easily don't you? I don't take you seriously no matter how hard you try to come across as a mature and fair poster. You have it in for Smalling because he's a threat to Evans. You say you don't care about stats but it seems you only don't care for them when they don't suit your argument. Im not childish, im realistic and you can't stand it. You have no integrity in this debate

An example of you using stats to defend your boy Evans and now you don't care about stats when it comes to a player you don't rate. Laughable.

2515~~~
Do jog on you silly little boy.

2516~~~
You're livid! I've destroyed you and your nothing response says it all. Take it easy my man haha.

2517~~~
You've destroyed me? Well that confirms it for me then.
I noticed I've called you childish before thanks to the quote you posted, it seems you still haven't matured enough to have an adult conversation with.

2518~~~

2519~~~
Ladies, ladies. Listen up, I can settle all for you and you can put away your guccis..........

Both Evans and Smalling are mediocre CBs, not good enough for United. Evans especially.

2520~~~
fecking hell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> integrity, Jesus wept.

2521~~~
Well, this thread has taken a turn for the worse...like Evans's form this season.

2522~~~
Given the players we are being linked with I'd say you're spot on. It seems a Jones and Rojo is the preferred option at the moment, I'd imagine it will be those 2 + 2 brought in.

2523~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2524~~~
I'm not into statistics. My eyes confirm Evans easily being better on the ball than Smalling. Smalling being better at defending both in the air and ground.

2525~~~
If I had to choose who our best central defender purely on passing merits and taking the ball out of defence I'd say it would be close between Paddy McNair and Rojo. In the Premiership, I think John Stones ranks pretty high up.

2526~~~
He might be more comfortable on both feet and can run better with it, but that means nothing to me if you are as solid as a wet sponge. 

It's no coincidence that everytime he has played recently (cambridge aside) that we have looked very nervous and unsure of ourselves in defense. He just doesn't have any presence.

2527~~~
He might be better but Evans is as clumsy as any other of our central defenders with the ball at his feet.

2528~~~
Smalling was all over the place against Burnley. Ings ran him ragged and how can anyone forget that miskick which led to the best chance of the game. That said, Evans was equally woeful.

2529~~~
John Stones is an excellent defender. Only 20 I guess. Amazing how good he has been everytime I have seen him play for Everton. Compare that to the jokers we have in our CB pairing.

2530~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2531~~~
But both prone to stupid errors. Sigh.

2532~~~
To me, Smalling looks a lot more composed. Better at actual defending, in the air and ground as Sultan has said. He also doesn't look like he's going to shit himself constantly.

2533~~~
Fair enough, but it's a bit like saying I'll have the Snickers over the Milky Way when really I want a Mars.

2534~~~
Yeah IMO the tempo of the game caught him out, coming on as a sub like that without warming up can take you a while to get into the game. It was a very quick tempo and he just didn't look settled until the 2nd half.

It definitely wasn't Smallings best game ever, but I would choose him every time over Evans, he just doesn't fill me with any confidence.

2535~~~
He was all over the shop throughout the game. We didn't look settled defensively at all. Anyway, I really liked Evans and had hoped he would now take the mantle of leadership at the back since both Rio and Vidic are gone but for some inexplicable reason he has just regressed a lot this season.

2536~~~
Agreed. I'd trust Smalling over Evans for now. Once we get another defender, I'm hoping Smalling will either improve from having a great leader beside him, or will be good enough to act as a backup. Which I feel he is. 
Evans I wouldn't trust with a gun if you put him in a knife fight.

2537~~~
I think a few posters have misunderstood my post. Smalling is absolutely a better defender at this moment in time. Evans is a better passer. 

Evans seems to have lost it at the moment.

2538~~~
Agreed. I think Smalling probably has passed the ball better than Evans this season but only because every aspect of Evans' game has completely fallen apart. To be fair to Smalling, he does seem to have improved slightly on the ball but he's still a long way from looking comfortable. As Michael Owen said, he doesn't have "pass appreciation". Might hit his target but doesn't get it to them in their stride, or in space to run onto. So often he's just hit it a little too hard, or a little behind them. Really fecks with the flow of our football.

2539~~~
I don't know why they're wasting their time arguing over these two anyway. They'll both be gone this summer. Evans has only himself to blame and Smalling just isn't his type of defender.

2540~~~
The absolute worst for "pass appreciation" and I meant to comment about it in his thread, is Rooney. 

It's like he has to stylise everything. 10 yard passes are done with a sand wedge and arrive at knee height, 30 yard passes come with check side Ronnie O'Sullivan would be proud of. Just pass the ball either to their feet or slightly in front of them for God sake. The extra half second it takes to use an extra touch, to wait for it to arrive or push it back in the right direction is such a momentum killer.

2541~~~
Couldn't agree more. Especially with the point in bold. Never understand them.

2542~~~
Unsurprisingly, I disagree. His passing (and his whole game) has been a bit off recently but in terms of "pass appreciation" he's actually one of the best in our squad. Usually gets the weight of pass absolutely spot on. That little reverse to Di Maria leading up to our second goal being an example.

2543~~~
He needs a good strong phsyical presence beside him I think. 

He's certainly not the player for experimental, 3 men at the back, set ups. None of our CB's are.

2544~~~
Yep.

The importance of pass appreciation shouldn't be understated. So many of our passes are either 1/2 yards to the wrong side (or behind), or even hinder the player in their stride. It kills our momentum.

2545~~~
Yes. I called you out on your 'I don't care about stats' bullshit

2546~~~
Smalling isn't going anywhere.

2547~~~
Are you seriously that fecking deluded. Stats only tell part of the story, being a United fan you'd think you'd know that. We are currently third having played some of the most mundane football I've seen us play in years, looking at our stats alone you could argue that we have had a fantastic season, however most fans tend to use their eyes to gauge an opinion. Further, Smallings passing stats are probably impressive as he knows how to pass a ball in a general direction, stats don't show how he under or over hits the pass or plays the ball behind the player or not in his line of play. It's not fecking rocket science.

You're boring me now.

2548~~~
If stats dont matter then why did you bring up the comparison matrix stats in support of Evans? Sorry but you're full of shit. More examples of your one sided BS. <a class="username" data-user="83324, @Dumat12" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83324/">@Dumat12</a>  posted this in response to your Evans stats

<i>These stats can make Demba Ba look like Messi, but it ain't so. It's proven countless times that they are misleading and inaccurate. <b>You can judge him with your own eyes</b>. </i>

This was your response:

You, one page back:

<i>I don't care what stats you use to back it up it's common knowledge. Best passer, do you actually watch games?</i>

I'll again quote your original post with the Evans stats

You, just now:

<i>looking at our stats alone you could argue that we have had a fantastic season, <b>however most fans tend to use their eyes to gauge an opinion</b></i>

You're a walking goddamn contradiction. I don't even need to waste my time with you anymore. No integrity, no credibility <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

His confidence looks completely shot.

2550~~~
I feel sorry for him. He really has regressed in the past year or so and it's hard to fathom why. It wasn't so long ago that he was pretty much a certainty to take over Rio's spot in the team when he retired. Now he looks bereft of ideas and, as you say, his confidence has evaporated. Pity.

2551~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through">Getsme</span> Evans has been schooled!

2552~~~
Are you for real? I haven't said stats don't matter, show me where I said that? You have a very bad habit of making things up, again the actions of a child.

Stats only tell <b>part </b>of the story, you can use them when assessing the ability of a player and to back up your belief in that player’s ability, it's not black and white, surely you're not so stupid that you believe they tell the full picture, no one can be that fecking stupid.

Again, back to the Smalling stats, you completely ignored when I said that his passing stats may be high but his passing ability is terrible, I've been able to arrive at that opinion simply by watching the game, you see, stats say one thing but any fan can tell you that passing is his biggest weakness.


As for bringing up my previous posts (<i>in which I posted the stats</i>), I was replying to this post from you

2553~~~
Now you're just embarrassing yourself, the fact remains that stats are only good in your eyes when they suit or help back up your argument. When I said the 'stats are there' why didn't you say then that you don't give a shit about stats?

Good for you, you dug out some stats in the matrix that favored Evans and you posted them. You took the time to actually create them because they helped you raise a point against me, yet you don't believe in them because as you say, most fans tend to use their eyes to gauge an opinion. Fvck outta with your contradictions.

2554~~~
He's more Evans than Evans himself <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2555~~~
fecking hell, are you really that fecking stupid? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Again with the childish remarks, well done. Im done with you.

2559~~~
Smalling >>> Evans vs Burnley. For the goal Smalling was at least trying to get to the ball - Evans was marking no one on the penalty spot will his man was also in behind. And Smalling single-handedly stopped them scoring an equaliser on at least 4 separate occsassions 2nd half when it was 2-1, and was our best defender overall despite his first half.

2560~~~
Feck me guys keep it clean and less of the low blows!

You can not reason within stupidity chaps.

2562~~~
Jonny Evans should come and fly kick them in the chest.
Handbags.

2563~~~
Only ones I could find. Where did you get yours (if you don't mind me asking)?

2564~~~
Nice. So let's hear it, what's stupid about my posts in here?
Oh, and it's you cannot reason with stupidity.

2565~~~
Too right you are

2566~~~
Smalling gave Ings the best chance of the match from 5 yards out. That should have been the equalizer.

2567~~~
I understand the crowds frustration with us moving backwards and sideways, I share it but I really didn't like them getting on his back the few times he went back to De Gea. I mean, he had to go get the ball, facing his own goal, absolutely no options on and even if he wanted to turn and pick a forward pass, Sunderland are pushing up on the backs of those options, nothing wrong with keeping the ball in that situation.

I expect an avalanche of abuse coming his way but I think he has done his job fine.

2568~~~
You are 100% correct.

2569~~~
Im with you on this. Evans had a fine half.

2570~~~
Yea, as much as I dislike watching Jonny nowadays, it's pretty fecking rich to single him out when it's pretty clear that it's the instruction from our coach to play it as safe as it gets in defence.

2571~~~
Agree with the above sentiments but he's such a worry when an attacker gets at him square on. Defoe did it once or twice, and had a few chances.

2572~~~
I agree with this, it was still funny to hear all the groans when he made that back to DDG.

2573~~~
I don't rate him but he's been fine. Ridiculous from the crowd to whistle him for passing it to De Gea that one moment, he had no options.

2574~~~
He really didn't though.

2575~~~
The booing of him for taking the CORRECT decision to pass back to the keeper both times is embarrassing and small-time.

He's had a good half and his distribution has been fine from the back.

We're being let down by those in front of him, ahead of of the midfield.

2576~~~
I don't think the crowd are getting on Evans back specifically, I think they're just pissed off that within 5 seconds of having a corner, we've got the ball back to De Gea. Which is true, it's ridiculous.

2577~~~
Totally agree with you he has been one of our better players in the first half. The way he neutralized both players in the 2 vs 1 situation was really good.

2578~~~
Oh jeez. We didnt concede any goals and he didnt feck up considerably, certainly no more than anyone else. In a game like this, there are actual issues/players to pick on before Evans.

2579~~~
There were not plenty a player around him making themselves available for a safe pass, to be fair.

2580~~~
Couldn't hear jeering and booing when Falcao and ADM lost the ball setting up counters which put us in danger and both of them have been ten times more wank than our special Jonny.

2581~~~
I agree with this, and I can understand the frustration.

2582~~~
I now what you mean but they should know how it comes across to the players themselves.

2583~~~
He's not supposed to though. His performance in that half was (at best) what you'd expect as standard from a defender. 

Over the top criticism for passing the ball back to De Gea is wrong but it's just as wrong to match that with over the top praise.

2584~~~
Exactly, why? Why have we played it back to Evans and not given him an option to go forward? Frustrating.

2585~~~
Captain??? oh dear

2586~~~
All our leaders left last summer and we have no else in this team after Rooney went off.

2587~~~
Let me say this, Smalling has shown great responsibility and courage since Van Gaal has arrived, these are the kind of qualities which define leadership, the same can not be said for Evans has has shown nothing of the sort and giving him that reward of wearing the arm band is pretty sad really.

There was at least Blind, Smalling and Rojo who were more deserving of holding the captains arm band today, when rooney went off.

Evans played ok and only made one real mistake when he was so deep playing defoe on side which resulted in a dangerous attack. But the point remains - a leader he is not.

Should really be celebrating the victory but that just annoyed me.

2588~~~
Well I guess he has to be criticised for something today doesn't he?

On topic though, a good performance, did well to overcome the crowd. Wasn't under much pressure but he grew into the game and did his job well.

2589~~~
I'm one of his biggest critics but I thought he was good today. Wouldn't choose him over Smalling though.

2590~~~
good game jonny, not the starting option for me tho

2591~~~
His best game in a long town, for the first time this season he didn't look like a deer in the headlights when the ball or opposition player got near him, big improvement.

2592~~~
That second time he got booed was ridiculous.

2593~~~
Did surprisingly good today, long may continue!

2594~~~
He played well, looked composed for once which is rare for him!
Still want Rojo starting though.

2595~~~
Yep, I really doubt the crowd are booing Evans they are booing the fact that we had a corner and the ball ended up a few seconds later with our keeper. 

Understandable I felt the annoyance myself too but not with Evans himself.

2596~~~
Don't agree with the grief for the back passes. He had nothing on.

Played fine.

2597~~~
He played well for once and long may that continue. I don't think he deserves the grief he got for those back passes either.

2598~~~
fecking hell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2599~~~
Wasn't bad today, but with Sunderland playing so defensively he wasn't under a lot of pressure and seemed more composed than previous games.  He is not starting XI material but he did his job adequately.

2600~~~
Was close to shitting myself anytime he was involved.

There was a stage in the second half he was in possession facing de Gea whilst he was being pressed by a Sunderland player, it took him about six years to clear the feckin' ball. I absolutely roared at the screen. I've no confidence in him at the moment. He allowed Defoe a few easy shots in the first half too.

2601~~~
Your out the changing rooms already Johnny?

2602~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Yeah, wanna see the captains arm band. 
You're a weird type of fan.

2603~~~
Good game for him,
He look lot confidant when we play back 4.

2604~~~
Played well today, gotta give the man credit when he has a good game <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2605~~~
He's great when he doesn't have to do any actual defending...

2606~~~
Do you ever say anything positive? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2607~~~
Occasionally.

2608~~~
He had a good game by his standards. He didnt gift them a goal.

2609~~~
Good today. Hopefully by now Van Gaal realises that he only does well as the left-sided CB in a back 4.

2610~~~
Credit where it's due, he didn't bend over and gift them a goal and he rarely hoofed it aimlessly.

2611~~~
I was going to say the same <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

In regards to Evans, he isn't good enough for this club anymore unfortunately. Surely will be gone come Summer.

2612~~~
Absolutely agree with this post. Especially about the part in bold: the worst thing I see in a football match is when a player dallies on the ball - it drives me nuts.

2613~~~
He was fine today…there will always be a degree of 'iffiness' when the manager changes the defence every week. Defenders need to play in settled back 3/4 or whatever. No defender has had that luxury so they have all looked dodgy on occasions.

His biggest weakness has been his distribution. He was good with the ball today and I would much rather him take his time to find his man (regardless of how it might appear on TV) and also pass the ball back to De Gea when there a limited options.

Crowd who got on his back are brainless.

2614~~~
Not a fan of his but he shouldn't be criticised for today's performance he had a good game.

2615~~~
I guess I'm the only one who thought he was poor today?

Several backpasses to the keeper when he had better forward options, and mostly easy side and backpasses generally. Didn't have much defending to do at all and offered nothing else on the field.

The best thing I could say is that he didn't feck anything up, which shouldn't really count as praise.

2616~~~
Hopefully Poyet was impressed as Sunderland is likely destination for him in the summer.

2617~~~
A few wobbles, but nothing horrific.  I think I gave Jonny a 6 for today's performance.  

He's not a United regular starter in my book, but as a fifth or sixth CB option I have no objections to Jonny being on the squad.

2618~~~
Excellent post.  I hate seeing our fans getting on his back when he is doing the right thing.

We played our "traditional" formation (wide players, four at the back) and I don't think it is a coincidence that this was the best he has looked all season.  He may be one of those players that has a lot of trouble adapting to the changes in tactics.

2619~~~
What worried me today wasn't his passing but he was so easy to take on. Granted, there wasn't much actual defending required today but on the two occasions someone ran at him he was easily bypassed.

2620~~~
Maybe fair but those specific times he was left isolated and you could see him in two minds about whether to tackle or hold the player up. Of course, could have done better but I think he made decent decisions, sometimes credit has to go to the attacker for taking a defender on, when one of ours do it, we praise the attacker, not look at the defender.

2621~~~
For once, Evans didn't really make a big mistake in a match, and in the end, he put up a decent performance. On the ball, he wasn't as ponderous as slow as he used to be, and he showed more confidence on the ball for quite some time. Defensively, he was okay bar the beginning when he was shaky. I still don't think he can make it as a starting defender, but as a squad option, he can be okay.

2622~~~
I think the more natural width contributed to a better performance, he had more angles, less congestion to play through. I know it's one performance against Sunderland but as one of the few that still rate him, especially above Jones, I'm just really happy that he hasn't be thrown under a bus.

2623~~~
On those occasions where was smalling? On one of the occasions you mention Evans had the nan ruining at him and the man just over his shoulder. He held his ground till help arrived. I thought he did ok

2624~~~
I really hate watching this guy play for us as he's not United quality but he wasn't bad today. Put in a good shift and didn't make any silly mistakes or brainfarts.

2625~~~
He was decent. Not as good as his CB partner but he didn't make any bad errors; I'm not an Evans fan either. Hopefully he can build off that performance and improve his form.

2626~~~
He was good today, let's not have another case of trying to fish out any little mistakes to try and suggest otherwise.

2627~~~
3 match ban comming up for spitting?

2628~~~
I don't like him anymore.

2629~~~
Hard to defend it, unless it was just out of habit.   Cisse certainly thought he meant it and retaliated in kind

2630~~~
Incredibly stupid from him if he ends up getting a ban.

2631~~~
Out of habit?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2632~~~
Our defenders can't help the kamikaze football. Smalling trying to give a penalty away and Evans trying to get sent off.

2633~~~
As in footballers spit every 5 secounds as it is

2634~~~
No worries anyway. He was gonna drop out anyway. Jones/Rojo is a upgrade.

2635~~~
What a moron.

2636~~~
I guess, he'd have to be ridiculously stupid to just spit directly at someone else though even if spitting is a habit <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

2637~~~
I really don't think it was intentional but I could be biased because he is our player. Cisse was the bigger idiot though.

2638~~~
Nah. Ref dealt with it. They both kicked and spat at each other and got nothing.

2639~~~
surely he was just spitting on the floor, as per every footballer all the time?

Didn't see Cisse spit back. Did he?

Can't remember a UK/Irish footballer spitting and getting banned. When was the last one?
Can remember a few Europeans.

2640~~~
Just me who can't see what he did wrong then?

2641~~~
BT are blowing the 'spit' out of all proportion, unsurprisingly. 

There's no way he was spitting at him, he was just spitting and it went near him. Understandable for Cisse to think there was something in it, but the commentary and punditry is making it out to be a horror show.

The bigger deal is that Cisse lashed out with his foot.

2642~~~
Well done Scholes, voice of reason.

2643~~~
Irish people are incredibly racist.

2644~~~
But you don't do it when there's someone on the floor right below you... if you're going to spit, you do it when you're by yourself, away from others. He clearly knows what he's doing there.

2645~~~
Evans spits on ground, no question he's spitting at Cisse. Cisse on the other hand.....couldn't be clearer. Rijkaardesque.

2646~~~
Very well put, I agree with everything.

2647~~~
He may just get away with it. Cisse, no chance.

2648~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2649~~~
El Hadji Diouf got a 3 game ban in 2004

2650~~~
Spitting on the ground? For feck sake. I was expecting some blind defence of him but I was hoping for a stronger stand than that.

Cisse is standing up to go head to head with him and Evans just happens to spit in that direction "on the ground" at that moment.

Spitting is scum behaviour and he'll rightly be banned. No harm either.

2651~~~
It was a strange time to spit vaguely in Cisse's direction if he wasn't spitting at him. It does seem like he probably wasn't spitting at him, but it still seems a very odd time to spit with someone so nearby.

2652~~~
Sorry, but who spits on the ground that close to someone? Even if your being incredibly lenient, it's still a bit disgusting. I don't imagine I'd be too thrilled if someone spat that close to me on a football field, especially if I was on the floor too.

Not excusing what Cisse did mind, that's just outright idiotic.

2653~~~
Ah yes, El Hadji Diouf the proud Irishman.

2654~~~
Sorry thought he ment pl players

2655~~~
I doubt much would be being made of the spit if it wasn't one of out favourite scapegoats. He played pretty well tonight if we want to talk about the game.

2656~~~
Hope he doesn't get done.

We're just starting to string some pretty solid performances together and he's playing largely very well.

2657~~~
Excellent performance tonight.

2658~~~
Given him plenty of stick this season but he played really well today and improved as the game went on. His best game of the season so far.

2659~~~
Formed a really solid duo with Smalling, and his advantage is, he isnt rash. Want them to play together for some matches, looked really good.

2660~~~
Was okay in the second half, thought him and Smalling looked a bit shaky in the first.

2661~~~
What's this about him and cisse being involved in a spitting incident? Jeff Stelling just mentioned it on SSN.

Who did the spitting?

Edit: Just saw posts above. As you were...

2662~~~
I can see him being banned for spitting. That was really stupid

2663~~~
Did he spit at him though? He spat, I don't think anyone can deny that, but it was nowhere near him.

2664~~~
Any spitting is disgusting, whether aimed at a player or not. Imagine any other professionals just gozzing on the floor every two minutes, and yet footballers do it.

I thought he was very good tonight for once.

2665~~~
Difficult to say and we need to see it from different angles but first reaction was it was very close to Cisse which is just daft

2666~~~
Seems to be improving as has his "shouting at other players for no reason" habit.

2667~~~
I'd be very surprised if he was banned for that spit. Just a standard footballer spitting every 30 seconds.

2668~~~
It was a stupid thing to do.
Apart from that he played very well today.

2669~~~
Looking at it again in the slow motion replay, it looks to me like Evans has kind of spat at him. I feel like he's either done it deliberately, or has kind of done it and thought, "Oh shit, I spat on him!", since he doesn't really seem to take his eyes away from Cisse. If it's the latter, then it's daft of him because he should just turn elsewhere and spit. Looks fairly deliberate though: yes he spits downwards, but he knows Cisse is there, and generally maintains eye contact with him.

2670~~~
There's a spitting image joke to be had but I can't think of it right now, at any rate I thought he was ok tonight, him and Smalling seem more comfortable together than when paired with one of the pit-bulls.

2671~~~
Not when they're facing an opponent and in that closer proximity they don't.

Footballing wise, he was very good tonight - which makes the spitting nonsense all the more annoying.

2672~~~
Glad someone said it. He's got no future at the club and has been shite all season but let's give credit where it's due.

2673~~~
Have to be honest, I hadn't realized he spat until I read the thread. Nothing in it for me.

2674~~~
Now that he is getting a bit better he will probably get banned.

2675~~~
No way was that a deliberate spit at Cisse. Any fool can see it was just a small bit of spit that fell out of his mouth as he was breathing out, very easily happen too in fairness. Feck them stupid camera's anyways, making things look like something they aren't.

On his performance tonight, he can't be faulted on anything. He appears to be getting more consistent too lately and that's probably down to him building up his confidence again. A fully confident and charged Evans would easily be our best CB, not saying that would be a hard job these days.

2676~~~
I think you underestimate the stupidity of the average footballer, myself.

2677~~~
Wouldn't surprise me.

2678~~~
Thought he actually played one of his better games this season. Heck, I appreciated when he tried to take the bull by the horns and drove the ball all the way to the 18 yd line. Thought he was gonna take it all by himself, LOL. Almost came off, and if we had put in a cross while he was up there, I don't doubt he'd gotten his head on it. Wish some of our other players would risk it sometimes.

2679~~~
There's still a big distinction between<i> spitting at somebody's feet and spitting at them</i>. One is just an expression of hostility and the other is the equivalent of a blow.

2680~~~
Spitting wise aside he was very good today with Smalling. Would be annoying if he got banned as he is getting his confidence back. I liked the sense of urgency he showed bringing the ball forward in the last 25 minutes.

2681~~~
It's still spitting <i>at</i> someone - which is a bit moronic whatever way you look at it.

Basically, if Evans really needed to spit, he could have turned his head and done it elsewhere.

2682~~~
I must be blind, didn't even see the spit. Thought he was good though, been harshly voted on in the match day voting I think. Was solid with Smalling. Well done Jonny.

2683~~~
He probably didn't need to spit - most likely he did it deliberately. But he still didn't spit<i> on</i> Cisse. And that's important.

2684~~~
He's still got it, if he can just stay fit for a few games in a row then we've got a real ball playing cb to play next to Rojo.

2685~~~
He did quite well and looked more like the Evans of old. His defending was much more assured and confident from before, and he was very good at carrying the ball forward. He's been more positive than he has ever been this season, both on the ball and off of it.

With Rojo struggling in the air against Obertan, Evans did a good job of preventing Newcastle do much with the second ball. It's a very good time for him to be coming into form as well as we'll be having some tough matches in the next few weeks.

My only criticism of him at the moment would be that long diagonals are horrible. Then again, none of our defenders other than Smalling can play a good long, diagonal pass out to the wingers.

2686~~~
Did good today, maybe there is still hope.

2687~~~
He did look good today. If he keeps it up he'd do well as a squad player.

2688~~~
He spat? I didn't see that but happy he was decent tonight. Never have a United defender made me more nervous than Evans has this season.

2689~~~
Seems to be getting his confidence back. Looked very comfortable on the ball today, and made some nice tackles.

2690~~~
I actually think it was one of his best games this year. Both good defensively and great going forward. It's always helpful when your midfielders are unwilling to play risky passes.. Keep it up Jonnyand maybe you're going to turn it around here!

2691~~~
Definitely his best game of the season. 

The spitting thing is ridiculous. Blatantly wasn't spitting at Cisse (who is a revolting turd btw)

2692~~~
Usually Evans biggest critic, but today he played like the Evans of old, and what many people expect him too be like. 

Perhaps he needs to be stamped and spat at a few times to give him that edge, as he seemed to play with an aggression I rarely see from him. Some of his dribbling forward was pretty impressive too. 

He will probably get banned now anyway but for once he did himself justice.

2693~~~
Someone is getting a ban, what an idiot.

2694~~~
Thought it was his best game for a good while.

Don't think he spat <i>at</i> Cisse either.

2695~~~
Thought he was just spitting out of habit and Cisse was just there. Still should get banned though if Cisse does.

2696~~~
It's impossible to say what he meant, but it seems pretty unlikely that he'd spit there had they not been having a barney at the time. How often will a footballer spit that close to a player when he could turn his head an inch or two and miss him by three or four feet? It looked like one of those where he deliberately spat near him, but not at him. A sort of "piss off, you twat" spit, rather than actively trying to gob on him. After all, no matter how ropey he's been this season, it's hard to believe he could miss him from there if he was trying to hit him. 

Who knows, though. Daft thing to do. Equally it doesn't bother me as much as, say, a really bad challenge, or almost everything every manager in the league says in interviews after games.

2697~~~
Looked like he was spitting on the ground. Footballers do it all the while. Rvp does it from his nose.


In actual news. I think he was valiant in defense today. Did well and concentrated. I always bash him when he shits himself. He was calm and cool today.

2698~~~
He did really well tonight. And he clearly wasn't spitting at Cisse ffs.

2699~~~
Think his performance has been a bit overrated. Struggled at times in the first half. More of a 6.5 or a 7/10 than anything too special.

2700~~~
6.5 or 7 for evans is an amazing performance by his standards these days

2701~~~
He looked a lot better today. Still not where he was a few years ago, but definitely better.

2702~~~
I thought he did really well, very good infact, so frustrating that he can put in performances like tonight and then look like an error waiting to happen in other games, if he was just constantly shit  it would be far easier to write him off as dead weight <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> tonight we saw the type of performance he should be delivering far more often.

2703~~~
He was clearly spitting at Cisse FFS! Are people actually suggesting that he just happened to be spitting at the ground right where Cisse was standing at that exact moment? Of course not. Cisse's was worse but Evans spat first. Both will get hefty bans and deservedly so.

2704~~~

2705~~~
There was the moment late in the game where it was still 0-0 and he of all people was the one who finally showed some urgency and tried to force the issue rather than just pass the ball around and ait for something to happen. For that, he's back in my good graces. On top of it, I thought he did well defensively.

As far as the spitting goes, I didn't see it. Nor did any of the commentators pick up on it when they showed at least 3 replays of the tussle with Cisse.

2706~~~
Until the start of the transfer window hopefully <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2707~~~
Been a critic of him this season but aside that spitting incident I thought he actually played well, at least better than the shit he's been serving for majority of the season.

2708~~~
He's been on a one man mission to convince the club to sell him all season long. So stupid.

2709~~~
Spitting at the ground? My arse.

I'll ignore the fact that he also flinched away from Papiss fecking Cisse.

2710~~~
He blatantly was spitting at him, pogue and it was fecking idiotic of him as it was like you say his best game of the season and he is likely to get banned for 3 games now, fecking needless!

2711~~~
Seeing the footage, appeared to definitely spit at him IMO. Unless the footage doesn't show the best angle. Anyway, he still played well.

2712~~~
Maybe it's just the vines I'm looking at...(I didn't see the match and can't watch highlights) but he clearly seems to be spitting at him and then shits himself when Cisse has a go back. 

I'm just saying from the angle I saw. If he was spitting, he needs banning. That is disgusting

2713~~~
Having seen it again (a good few times) it does look a lot worse then I first thought.

That was quite embarrassing. He proper flinched, then remembered he was a footballer and had to pretend to be hard <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2714~~~
Thought he played really well the last few games, but that spit is disgraceful really. No two ways about it. If you say anything else then you're full of shit as well. It was a blatant spit at Cisse, and Cisse back at him. Embarrassing and maybe the final nail in the coffin with regards to his United career, considering he was probably on thin ice with regards to the awful form and constant injuries.

2715~~~
I like that after a disastrous start he might be yet <i>another</i> redemption story from this season.  Even if many only realized it a month or so too late. 

And then of course he will probably get banned temporarily afterwards...

2716~~~
I think him and Cisse will be getting a 3 match ban at least, the media are after blood and the FA will feel there's enough there to act.

2717~~~
Had one of his better games, and I say that because he didn't literally hand the other team a goal. So well done Jonny.

2718~~~
Yeah, I'd say he was pretty good. Against a fairly decent striker as well. Think I heard the commentator say Cisse had the best minutes to goal ratio at 84 minutes/goal.

2719~~~
Nonsense. He was our best defender yesterday. Rojo and Smalling were poor and Smalling in particular was lucky not to cost us a penalty with that lazy tackle. Only on redcafe can we have a player's good performance undermined by a snide remark.

2720~~~
If he doesnt keep getting injured, he can be pretty good.
Keeps getting injured and then takes a few weeks to stop being scared of the ball

2721~~~
Thought the defense would be 'Cisse lashed out first'.

Both deserve three match bans, at least.

2722~~~
Forget the spitting, he has had two very good games, especially this one. 
- He didn't make any of the mistakes which he tends to (atleast one per game)
- His tackling was absolutely top notch
- He brought a sense of urgency to the game in the last half hour
- He didn't panic, nor did he blame the others (which he tends to do)

Suddenly seems to have turned a corner, which is good to see. I wish we could combine the qualities of Jones, Evans and Smalling together and get one awesome defender - as of now, it's a difficult decision over who to keep and who to sell at end season!

2723~~~
Yes, he had one of his better games, and didn't give the opponents an easy chance to score - a trait he's been demonstrating with regularity. Don't be so sensitive.

2724~~~
You had made it sound, just like the bold part here, that he didn't goof up and that's why you think he had a good game. The fact is he was brilliant and handled their striker very well. Intercepted a lot of balls and was generally strong in the air. Any other defender doing this for any other team and all here would be drooling over him wanting him to play for us.

2725~~~
Not my favourite player but played well yesterday so credit where due.

2726~~~
Good game but he will be banned for long time

And after he will get injured as usual.

2727~~~
Gutted about the spitting incident, disgusting and deserves a ban. As one of his few fans, I was so pleased to see him do well but to see him do that really puts a bad spin on his performance.

In regards to his performance, he was very good again.

2728~~~
Nah. He didn't spit at him. That vine shortens perspective. He spat at the ground in front of Cisse. Watch a proper replay.

2729~~~
I can't get over how he looked genuinely like he was going to shit himself when Cisse confronted him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Moronic behavior to spit, that's the way of a twelve year old posh brat. Great way to feck up what actually looked like a promising string of performances from a guy who's looked finished as a footballer this season.

2730~~~
I accept you might not like him and in no way am I defending the spit, he deserves a long ban but don't try to make him look worse by saying he was scared. He was the one who confronted Cisse anyway.

2731~~~
He looked a bit freaked out because Cisse spat a massive gob in his neck. No doubt you wouldn't have flinched, right? I guess it all depends on how used you are to being drenched in another man's bodily fluids.

2732~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2733~~~
I think what happened before the spitting was worse. Evans gets his ankles scraped with studs twice, then after a bit of a tangle, Cisse makes a clear kicking motion towards him, which has barely been mentioned by the pundits. Spitting is disgusting, but the kick-out had more intent, IMO.

2734~~~
Yeah, you know damn right if it was the other way around the replay's would be of the scraping and then the kick out. Cisse clearly went for him with his studs but ended up missing, and that was before any of the spitting happened.

2735~~~
Nah, Evans looked scared just after he the first spit fell, that is from his own mouth. Like he understood there was a pretty decent chance he might get smacked in the face. After playing so many years along side Vidic you'd thought he had learned how to be hard as feck.

I'm just looking at his body language dude, he's clearly on the defense pretty quickly after he spat. I'm not saying anything about the fact that I like him or not, I just find it amusing that, to me, he looked to be acting all tough with his spitting for a moment and then suddenly seems to regret it, afraid of what Cisse might do to him. That's genuinly how I interpret the situation and his behavoir, feel free to disagree.

2736~~~
Agreed on the kick out part, if it connected, Evans is out for 6 months. I can understand why Evans reacted but still very poor from Evans.

2737~~~
I agree, but there is no place for spitting is is nasty and disgusting, both players should rightly get a ban.

2738~~~
I think spitting is worse than kicking out but the whole spitting thing was all a bit unfortunate. Evans didn't spit on Cisse, he spat near him. What Cisse did was disgusting but he obviously thought he had been spat <i>at</i>, which makes what he did a little more understandable.

2739~~~
any more than 3 games would be harsh.

2740~~~
He won't be fecking banned, nor should he. Am I the only one here who saw a proper, hi-def, full size replay?

2741~~~
Evens clearly spat in his direction when he was on the ground and  Cisse spat back at him.
No defense for either player, they will be charged by the FA and both banned.

2742~~~
apparently if charged and found guilty 6 match ban <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

From Sky Sports

Should the pair be found guilty, <i>Sky Sports</i> understands the bans will be lengthy following a change to the rules at the beginning of the season.

Both could be facing a six-match suspension, after the FA fell into line with FIFA which demands that term for such an offence.

2743~~~
Evans shouldn't, but Cisse should, at least for 5 games. The kicking plus the spitting on Evans neck. Don't get why all the media miss out the kicking, first of all BT during the game yesterday and now the newspapers I saw.

2744~~~
Yeah, agreed.

2745~~~
Come on Pogue, Evans has full control of when and where he spits. He could easily have turned his head and done it somewhere else... instead, he chose to do it incredibly close to Cisse... which is enough.

He wasn't spitting on him (because if he was, he would have spit on him) but he was obviously spitting in his direction, which - whilst not as confrontational as actually gobbing on a bloke - is still confrontational... and also not allowed.

2746~~~
I agree about the kicking , but Evens is clearly seen spitting near Cisse, for me there is no defense for this, clearly seen on video.

2747~~~
I hope the club get on the front foot and come out and condemn Evans and not go all Liverpool about it.

In saying that, he still has my support and should still get it from the club.

2748~~~
Yeah, but how can you prove that Evans intentionally wanted to spit on him or scare him or whatever, that's not clear to me. Whereas Cisse's kicking and spitting is very clear to me.

2749~~~
This. However, Evans will be out of the team when Shaw is back (hopefully for Arsenal) so a suspension might be a moot point <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2750~~~
again I agree , but Evans is clearly seen spitting first in the direction of Cisse and the intent ,it will be enough for an FA charge.

2751~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> At least I won't have to wear incontinence pads when I have to watch him trying to defend.

2752~~~
If Evans gets a charge, then Cisse should get at least double the amount IMO.

2753~~~
Evans being banned for 6 matches should improve our top four chances. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2754~~~
In an ideal world yes that would happpen but we know it wont.
Both will be charged with the spitting and get 6 match bans , the dreadful tackle that started it will be forgotten.

2755~~~
Good performance yesterday actually but how hard is it to turn away when spitting? Evans knows what he's doing there for me and tried getting a kick in too so I'm not having any of this 'he's not that type of player' bollocks.

A 6 match ban is excessive but it should hopefully set an example and we never see this crap again on the football pitch. Spitting should be kept only in the bedroom.

2756~~~

2757~~~
He has to be banned for that , dirty cnut , spitting is disgusting . Shame too cos he played quite well .

2758~~~
As poor as spitting is, I can't for the life of me understand why some people say it's the worst thing that can happen on a football pitch.

How is it worse than a leg breaking tackle and racism etc. Again, it's bad but there are worse things that happen on the pitch.

2759~~~
I think most people would be more likely to twat him than to spit back to be honest . There is no way we should defend that
I agree that there are worse thiings than spitting but it is digusting and he should be banned for it , there is no defending him I'm afraid .

2760~~~
He was stupid to do it and should get the ban but god how I hate 'there are kids watching' comment by Phil Neville and similar comments.

Also, as I dont have sound at work, but seen at MOTD facebook page that there was a debate about spitting being the worst thing player can do on a football pitch. Am I hearing that right?

2761~~~
Spitting is not the worse thing to happen on a football pitch.
I have only been ever spat at one and the person that did did not stay on his feet a long time, spitting is nasty.

2762~~~
Surely he'll get off as they can't prove he deliberately spat in the direction of Cisse.

2763~~~
of course he did , we know he did and Evans knows he did.

2764~~~
If he'd wanted to spit at him then he'd have bloody spat <i>at</i> him, he was about two feet away, it's not like he's going to have tried and missed ffs. 

I honestly don't understand how anyone can have seen a proper reply (not an edited vine) and come to the conclusion that he was spitting at Cisse.

2765~~~
People only say its the worst thing because its completely out of context with sport. 

They should probably both get bans for being such fannies over a minor tussle on the half way line

2766~~~
He wasn't spitting on him, but he was spitting at him. Like if you were to throw a ball across the office with the intention of missing someone, but still getting there attention. He wasn't aiming it at Cisse, but he was doing it towards him... Brophs summed it up well:

2767~~~
Nah, I don't agree with that.

It looks more to me that he's got up from a challenge and gone to spit on the floor like a lot of players do and at the same time his brain has decided to get angry that Cisse has kicked out at him, so his 'spit on the floor' and 'get angry at kicky guy' reactions have happened at the same time.

This is Jonny Evans, not El haj Diuff, there's no way he was trying to spit at or intentionally near the guy.

2768~~~
They both spat at each other. Trying to determine whether Jonny meant it is a lot more difficult than it would have been to just not spit near someone on the ground. They both deserve bans.

2769~~~
In which case, he's still daft to spit in such a close proximity to Cisse. For me - he's fully in control of his functions and he could easily have turned his head and spit elsewhere (as players do 99.9% of the time), but he's made the conscious decision to do it in Cisses direction.

2770~~~
He wasn't spitting in his direction because - as you say - that would have involved spitting on him.

At worst, he deliberately spat on the ground in front of him. Which is a bit inflammatory but really not that big a deal. Be very harsh to ban him for that.

Basically what <a class="username" data-user="23710, @Rado_N " href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23710/">@Rado_N </a> said. I find the outrage in this thread very strange. No doubt there would be a <i>lot</i> more people making excuses if it was a more popular player involved.

2771~~~
I think I heard somewhere after the game that spitting in someones vague direction is punishable... or something to that affect... and we know that the FA view spitting as a far worse crime than actually trying to physically harm someone for some inane reason. (As an aside, if he got banned for 6 games, that would be 2 games more than Terry got for being racist...top priorities from the FA)

I don't think the actual offence is a massive deal at all - it's just completely moronic from Evans (He should surely realise if you're spitting that close to someone it's going to kick up a shit storm - and if the ref saw it he may well have sent him off, which would have made things a bit harder) which is why it annoyed me.

2772~~~
Precisesly and tragically true. The Ander Herrera spitting thread would make a salutary contrast to this nonsense. Jonny finally puts in a solid performance, confidence returning and this is the shite we're coming out with?

2773~~~
Really? I'm genuinely surprised that spitting near someone has caused the hooplah it has on here. Although, as I said, I suspect that is due to so many caftards being desperate to put the boot into Evans and when they can't do that over his performance...

So long as you're sure your goz isn't going to hit someone I never knew it would cause a massive drama to spit <i>near</i> them. I'm assuming Evans thought the same. He got up, was about to spit, then got kicked and ended up simultaneously spitting - on the ground - and glaring at Cisse. Seriously, that's a strange reasons to criticise anyone, never mind ban them.

2774~~~
Thought Johnny was rather good last night all in all. I have been very critical of him lately.

2775~~~
Evans had a good game, the spitting incident is a non -story. I genuinly think so.

Feeling better now ?? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2776~~~
It could be my mind playing tricks on me, but Evans seems to be spitting all the time. If the camera is on him after a clearance or tackle he's usually spitting. More than anyone else in the team.
Also, looking at his reaction to Cisse simply getting up, I don't think Evans would even have it in him to spit at/near someone maliciously, even if the thought entered his head.

However, he may well get a ban, and I don't think there can be huge complaints. It <i>can </i>definitely be interpreted as a spit towards Cisse due to how close it was to his head.

2777~~~
Evans spat first.

2778~~~
Not on here, I meant in the media (which has already happened, and will probably lead to him getting banned) - ultimately that barometer for causing a hooplah on here isn't that high.

2779~~~
Well I don't think we care if Evans is banned because it will probably improve us but as for Cisse, assuming the six match ban rumours are true well then Newcastle play Arsenal, Liverpool and Spurs in those six matches so it will just help our rivals.

2780~~~
Why oh why did he do that.

The kick out is shocking and unfortunately will be overlooked because of the spitting.  Whether Evans is aiming at cisse or closeby, it's a huge sign of disrespect and disgust.  Cisse spitting 5cm away on evans with no slyness whatsoever is a joke.

And the penalty incident...why is he spitting again.  These spits arent even 'excess saliva' spits.  They're the chavvy little ones where you spit through your teeth thinking you're a hard man, when in fact you're just a premature little child.

So so pointless jonny.

2781~~~
The incident itself is a big deal because of Cisse's reaction. Which really was unacceptable and looked pretty disgusting on replay. If that hadn't happened, I don't think Evans gobbing on the ground would have caused much of a palaver at all. 

Although no doubt a few of the usual suspects on here would dig out a vine and gleefully use it as character assassination. Same with that clip of Fellaini allegedly spitting on someone earlier on this season.

2782~~~
Cisse spat on Evans. 

Evans didn't spit on Cisse.

2783~~~
Kudos to a photographer, he caught Cisse's spit just in time.

2784~~~
Sky are really stoking the fires on this, 10 games <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

<b>Sky Sports pundit Alan McInally believes spitting should carry a mandatory ban of 10 games.</b>


The issue has come into sharp focus after <a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9744255/jonny-evans-and-papiss-cisse-involved-in-spitting-incident-during-newcastle-manchester-united-clash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a clash between Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse</a>during United's 1-0 win at St James' Park on Wednesday.

Following a tackle and what appeared to be a kick-out from Cisse, the pair appeared to aim spit at each other in an incident now being investigated by the Football Association, while Newcastle are looking at a situation earlier in the game in which Evans appeared to spit close to Emmanuel Riviere.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://cf.c.ooyala.com/k2bmRyczoFMDHjXPfWpHwA3geyWOxvsX/promo249806522" src="http://cf.c.ooyala.com/k2bmRyczoFMDHjXPfWpHwA3geyWOxvsX/promo249806522"/>
Louis van Gaal and John Carver refused to comment on the incident

Should they be found guilty of spitting, Evans would be automatically suspended for six games while Cisse's ban would last for seven due to a prior charge of violent conduct - but McInally suggests the punishments could be firmer.

The Scot told <i>Sky Sports News HQ</i>: "It shouldn't be in the game. I don't think it's a problem but guys can't spit on each other. Maybe six games is not enough. It's a deterrent because you get banned for six but maybe you'd think 'that's alright'.

"Maybe you should make it 10 games - that's two-and-a-half months and that's a long time out of the game and for your club to be paying you. They aren't going to be happy.

2785~~~
Well, he is a Sky Sports pundit.

2786~~~
I think the angle repetively shown is a touch harsh on Evans, from the game yesterday on BT in the several replays it  looked as if he spat just infront of Cisse, but you can also understand Cisse's reaction, if you think someones spat at you, in the heat of the moment, feeling aggrieved, losing your head for a second, you or at least I could imagine myself doing exactly the same in return, just one big mess really.

Its a shame as I thought Evans played really well yesterday, looked the CB we all know he should be.

2787~~~
its ok Johnny, Jon Snow is coming to your rescue there

2788~~~
This spitting thing is bit boring, so I'll skip to his performance. He played good game, he definitely looks far better player in two CB defence than he looked in 3 man defence, surprise, surprise.

2789~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> absurd...

2790~~~
Some of the comments in here are a bit rawkish. People can dress it up how they like but they spat at each other, disgusting. They should both get the maximum suspension which is six matches.

2791~~~
Are these the best replays we can get? <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqIvkyxvLLo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe> / <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6WQm8WDl_EU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Pretty damning to Evans if you ask me, seems pretty straight forward - he spat at him.  He was staring straight at the guy and spat.  If he was targeting anywhere, it was his legs, but still.  If Evans had been so inclined to spit without spitting AT Cisse, he could easily spit to the side while maintaining any aggressive stance he might want to.

I say all this as a guy who feels that Evans is actually an alright defender for us.

2792~~~
They should both be banned. 6 games though? Seems excessive, never knew there was such a rule in place.

2793~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BhrZdDDIgAAf0Ue.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BhrZdDDIgAAf0Ue.jpg"/>

2794~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2795~~~
Happy days if he gets 6 games. He really should be the first player out the door in the summer.

2796~~~
If only he got some injury that would keep him longer than that, right? Happier days?

2797~~~
Phil Neville, the absolute clown.  According to Phil Neville, spitting is the worst act you can commit on a football pitch.  Above:

1. Punching
2. Kicking
3. Headbutting
4. Biting
5. Breaking bones
6. Pissing
7. Defecating
8. Killing
9. Torturing
10. Raping

I'm in total agreement with the little fellow.  
Past spitting bans btw: 
-------------------------------------------------
<i>El Hadji Diouf was fined two weeks' wages by Liverpool, £5,000 by the Glasgow Sheriff Court and given a two-match ban after spitting at a Celtic fan in the front row of the stand during a Uefa Cup tie at Celtic Park in 2003.</i>
-----------------------------------------------
<i>Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was handed a four-match ban and a £30,000 fine for spitting at West Ham's Neil Ruddock in a Premiership match at Upton Park in September 1999.</i>
-----------------------------------------------
<i>France and ex-Manchester United goalkeeper Fabian Barthez was given a six-month ban (suspended for three months) for spitting at a Moroccan referee during a friendly between Marseille and Wydad Casablanca in 2005.</i>
-----------------------------------------------
<i>Alexander Frei of Switzerland was charged with misconduct and banned for three games after a crafty spit on the neck of Steven Gerrard during England's 3-0 win at Euro 2004.
-----------------------------------------------</i>
Now as much as I dislike Evans as a player and would enjoy not watching him play for 10 games, 10 match ban for spitting in the direction of a player who kicked out at you...seems a tad ridiculous?  Media is blowing it way way up.

2798~~~
Nah, he should be 100 % fit when he leaves in a couple of months time. Wish him well and hope he finds his level, like partnering O'Shea/Brown at Sunderland or something.

2799~~~
Not sure you've understood his point.

2800~~~
I just threw them in for flavour.

2801~~~

2802~~~
Both players deserve big bans! Disgusting creatures

2803~~~
And you support Manchester United? Bizarre.

2804~~~
That escalated quickly. Going a bit OTT there?

2805~~~
I don't think he meant to spit on the player, any ban will be harsh because it's  going to be hard to prove intent. Van Gallery said he does not think Evans to be a type of person who spits at another man. Knowing FA, they'll ban him for 4 games.

2806~~~
So 6 match ban for Evans and 7 for Cisse is looking likely, hopefully it wont affect our ability to sell him in the summer.

2807~~~
Six matches, that is insane.

2808~~~
how much do you get for braking someone's leg. 
3 matches?

2809~~~
Media strikes again.

2810~~~
Not that bizarre really.

2811~~~
Just saying..

2812~~~
Where is fergie when you need him?

2813~~~
Not sure if he meant to spit at him or not tbh. If he didn't, he shouldn't be punished really as it would just be a misunderstanding. If he did mean it though, then by all means ban him. I would not complain at all, it's disgusting and highly disrespectful. If he does get a long ban, then it could leave us short at the back. Though I guess we still would have McNair and Blackett.

2814~~~
Six game ban does look likely, the video evidence is enough to punish both of 'em. It's an excessive ban but the FA will want to make an example. He'd have only got two extra games for racially abusing Cisse...

2815~~~
Seems a pretty clear spit at Cisse from Evans to me. Though it seems completely random to spit at someone because of that so that puts a bit of doubt in my mind. Then again, people can control when and where they spit, and he pretty blatantly spat right at or a couple of inches in front of cisse jut as he was getting up, he could have spat to the side or not spat at all, so it just seems pretty blatant that he purposely spat at Cisse. Both should get a ban, but something like 6 games is a bit ridiculous. 3 games like if it was a red card would be fine. 

Its a shame because he was starting to get into a bit of form, but it just seems like a pretty blatant spit, looking at that gif above, that vine or the YouTube videos. They all seem pretty conclusive.

2816~~~
Or two less.

2817~~~
"Papiss, did you fink I fackin' spat on you? I didn't fackin' spit on you like this."
*Proceeds to spit on Cisse*
*Receives four game ban*
"I didn't fackin' spit, did I?"

2818~~~
Can't see how anyone can say it wasn't intentional by Evans. He's looking at him and having said something, spat in his direction without moving his head away.

The video evidence is pretty damning IMO.

2819~~~

2820~~~
It's okay folks, he's denied it.

2821~~~
To claim he didn't spit at Cisse is just ludicrous. He completely and utterly did and I hope he gets banned for a good number of games. Disgusting behaviour.

2822~~~
Giving him the benefit of a doubt.

2823~~~
I also hope he retires at United, along with Young, Valencia and Cleverley.

2824~~~
Good statement from Evans.

2825~~~
I think it's clear that he didn't mean to spit at Cisse. Watch how Cisse spits, he puts "force" into it, for want of a better word. Which is common when you see someone spit at another person. Evans didn't do that at all. He's an idiot for spitting in Cisse's direction at all but it'd be extremely harsh if he got a 6 game ban for it.

2826~~~

2827~~~
Looks like they will both be in trouble and rightly so. Agree that bad tackles should get greater punishment but there you go.

2828~~~
Sorry Jonny, we don't believe you because we're quite happy if you get banned. If you had been more of a Herrera or a Blind type we might have supported you.

2829~~~
Why? He's not nearly good enough and Cleverley has already gone thankfully.

2830~~~
Some of you lot are embarrassing. This is similar to mob lynching. Say the same footage exists for De Gea, you lot would claim it's not conclusive. Just because the player is not doing great currently, you lot want him to be banned and laughably transferred. He's at this club when he was a little boy, and he has given his best for United. Have a fecking heart, if the manager says the boy is good, then he's good. The manager thinks that Evans couldn't have done it, Evans has issued a statement he didn't mean to do it. Video evidence only proves he spit immediately after the incident. Whether he meant to direct his spit at Cisse is something only he can know. If the FA wants to ban him, then fine. Give the benefit of the doubt to the player, he's our player.

2831~~~
whats this? you are ruining the thread, it started so well...pure comedy

2832~~~
Nothing to do with that. He is caught on camera, spitting at an opponent. No matter what player it was, I would conclude that he deserves a lengthy ban, as it's disgusting. To claim he didn't mean it is simply not a defence in my opinion, he spits directly at him. Unless his spitting is as wayward as my outside of my left foot passing, it's pretty conclusive.

2833~~~
Waheeee, we don't want him to play, let's get the FA to ban him. For feck's sake, it's so embarrassing that I wish we had a RAWK like mentality denying Suarez is a dirty player.

2834~~~
It was mostly a reaction post towards some of our most embarrassing support.

But still, if they stay, all good. They are anyway not <i>that</i> bad.

2835~~~
Thousands of football players spit on the ground. At best, he's being extremely ignorant while spitting so closely to an opposing player and he can cop a fine if the FA thinks so. What will you say if it happened with De Gea and he claims that he didn't spit at the opponent?

2836~~~
Those that think he is lying about spitting at Cisse? All I can say to that is if he was not a United player I feel most would admit the video looks bad and expect any player to deny it.

They are though, if our goal is to actually be a title contender again we can't be carrying mediocrity like Evans and Cleverley, and that is entirely independent of this incident.

2837~~~
No. Not about them.

2838~~~
I see, which ones then?

2839~~~
Evans was a backbone of the team that won the league at a canter.

2840~~~
Oh god not this crap again.

2841~~~
As I mentioned in the post you quoted, no matter what player it was, I would say he deserved a ban. If he really needed to spit, and wasn't spitting at the opponent, he'd have waited the further 3 seconds to turn around and spit on the ground. 

As it was, he quite blatantly spat right in the direction of the player who was getting to his feet from below him. Can't be more conclusive, deserves whatever ban he will rightfully get.

2842~~~
Sorry but I think it is a poor show by Evans , the video evidence is there he spat in the direction of him, he knew where he was spitting and he knew the reaction, he should just accept what he did and take the ban.

2843~~~
He denied it and deserves the benefit of the doubt, it can't be proven that it was intentional. Nobody wants to be labeled a spitter and it's not like he has any sort of form for it.

2844~~~
What? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2845~~~
Honest to God, to those claiming he was just spitting on the ground, watch this again. Look at the start, after the tackle. Back to Cisse. Spit then. Nope, I'll wait ... wait ... get to my feet ... turn ... kick out ... then spit. But hey, I'm only spitting on the ground. Sure.

Disgraceful, embarrassing conduct of a Manchester United player. ANY Manchester United player.

2846~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2847~~~
There's just no way that you can say that for sure. We are talking if's and but's. Like I said, if Evans is banned by the FA, then fair enough. But most of this 'Ban him' from our supporters is mostly because the player is going through a difficult time form wise.

2848~~~
Am struggling to actually see Cisse's spit from that gif.

2849~~~
Not from me , I think he spat.
I like Evans thought he played well last night , he just let himself dawn, sadly looks like Cisse is the one with balls right now and admitting what he did was wrong.

2850~~~
I'm not his greatest fan, but he's a player who showed a lot of promise. We let go of Pique because of Evans. He played through much of that record breaking no goal conceded sequence with Vidic. He has contributed massively in our defence. I have no idea why some of you behave as if he has always been a terrible player. feck off with that shite.

2851~~~
Not from me. I'd say the same about anyone in the same position, from De Gea to Rooney.

I really don't think there's any ifs and buts there to be honest. He waits until he's in the perfect position to spit at him. Has all the time beforehand to spit, and could wait a few seconds until they untangle after the spit to do it. Is he that much of a compulsive spitter that he simply HAD to spit at the exact moment that Cisse was in his line of fire? Just after kicking out at him, with a pretty contorted look of anger on his face? Lot of coincidences really.

2852~~~
Those that would like nothing more than to haul his arse out of the club. That would welcome as long as possible ban not to see him play. Injury? Ah, no, would kill his price in the summer. There were similar cries against Young, against Valencia, still against Cleverley, and I loathe seeing that on THE Manchester United forum.

2853~~~
I think Cisse spat at him in retaliation thinking Evans did spit at him. The gif does him no favors, and it looks like he's spitting directly at Cisse. But it's difficult to prove intent. I'm ok with him copping a ban, but I'm not sure it's a clear cut case. 

I don't have a portal inside Evans' head, so I can't be sure. All I'm saying is that you are making an assumption there.

2854~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> funny 'cos it's true.

2855~~~
Didn't we let Pique go because he was homesick/wanted to go back to Barca or something like that?

2856~~~
You're right, I guess I am making an assumption. But I think there's enough there to make that assumption to be honest. Far too many coincidences, timing too perfect, allied to the fact he's obviously annoyed.

2857~~~
Understood, I guess if thinking he should be sold makes me a bad fan I'll wear that, I've thought that for ages now, some players just aren't the quality needed, nothing wrong with saying they should be sold IMO, the team comes first. As far as wanting him banned, I agree that is unpleasant, personally I am neutral on it, if he's punished I can't see an avenue to argue, but if he escapes punishment then fine.

2858~~~
It's a combination of a lot of factors, He wanted playing time, he was wanted by Barcelona, and we had Evans who can play from the bench. Ok, I was a bit disingenuous with that post, but anybody who thinks Evans was dogshite always shouldn't be taken seriously, IMHO.

2859~~~
Game, two, three. Should accept it. But six is madness. Someone from Sky Sport wants ten!

"...black cnut..." gets you four, lad that kicked fellow footballer "because he was black" got eight.

2860~~~
I don't think anyone would think he's complete shite: certainly he has had some good spells for us, although was probably a bit overrated for a while.

2861~~~
A low blow, if ever I saw one. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2862~~~
What a cowardly kick out by Cisse, he has already been banned for violent conduct for this season, wasn't he?

2863~~~
Spitting is rank at any time except when it's a genuine accident. I hope they both get banned.

2864~~~
Shock, united fans give a British player a hard time.

2865~~~
The football authorities, whether FIFA or the FA, aren't thinking objectively about how likely bad behaviour is to injure an opponent etc. They're interested in appearances - the 'image' of the game.  -  money. Spitting looks ugly on TV.

2866~~~
The kick has been forgotten now, everybody is focused on the spitting, it is wrong, the kick was what started it all.

2867~~~
In England spitting at someone is seen as the lowest thing you can do in a sport, I know other countries don't seem to take it as seriously, but we do here.

2868~~~
If it was Suarez who spitted on Cissé, we would have destroyed him. I mean that it’s clear that Evans did something, and something bad. Even if he’s our player, we have to accept the decision because it was a bad behavior from him, that can affect our image.

I remember Fergie saying that he will never say something to a player if he’s suspended after a tackle or so, but he would destroyed him because of a bad behavior…

It’s too late now, if Evans has 6 to 10 games, it’s purely on his fault, and he will penalize us a lot.

2869~~~
it has nothing to do with being british, most people just find him absolutely shite.

2870~~~
No defending it - can't see a reason for defending him at all.
Nothing to do with him being British, or being pretty average when he plays, but the fact of the matter is he spat at another player then doesn't even have the balls to admit it, apologise and take his punishment. 
It's been hard enough to warm to him as a player this season but this just makes me not care for him as a man….which he isn't acting like.

2871~~~
Spitting at another player is ok though, yes?

2872~~~
Imagine being a professional sportsman and getting that wound up by a couple of little flicks at each others legs that you start spitting on each other. 

What a pathetic way to get yourself a 6 game ban. That's Evans' season near enough over if it is 6 games, considering he'll need to get into "match rhythm" when he returns.

2873~~~
He'll barely have time to get himself injured again.

2874~~~
"Most people" are idiots, then. He's clearly not absolutely shite. 

All the more idiotic to cling to that notion less than 24 hours after a very good performance.

2875~~~
This is a bit sad tbh. If it's a 6 game ban then he might well have played his last game for United

2876~~~
6 game ban <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Only 2 less then Suarez's racial abuse ffs.

2877~~~
well they are fecking idiots then.

2878~~~
its what FIFA say a player found guilty of spitting should get.

2879~~~
Sure he may as well have have got a few racial jabs in. Maybe something about Cisse's mom or sister. Make the suspension worthwhile at least.

2880~~~
I don't like spitting, but I don't remember ever finding it as disgusting as a lot of you seem to.

2881~~~
If Evans appeals the expected charge and is found guilty , will he get an extra game ban for a frivolous appeal ?

2882~~~
So you're suggesting he could be spitting against the wind?

2883~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2884~~~
Yup. Pretty sure Ferguson wanted to keep him, but let him go when Pique asked to go home to Barcelona.

2885~~~
Well, he's officially charged now....

2886~~~
I assume he's remaining phlegmatic.

2887~~~
It's disgusting everywhere, not just in England. I just hope that racist abuse is a bit lower. But seeing possible punishment for Evans...

2888~~~
Not great timing by Evans considering the nature of the offence and probable ban if he was already playing for his future at the club. It will be interesting to see what public comments, if any, LVG and the club make - close ranks or condemn it?

2889~~~
LvG after the match and in today's press conference, said he believed Evans and considers the matter as closed.

2890~~~
Cisse has apologised where as Evans hasn't and has denied it. The guy is a complete tool, hope the club get rid of him at the end of the season. This incident has certainly given us more of a reason to if his pathetic performances haven't.

2891~~~
Just a reminder, this is pretty much evans at his peak now, he wont be getting much better.  Especially with his injury record.  I dont think people are exaggerating when they're not too bothered with him being banned.

Honestly, he seems like a genuinely nice guy.  But United quality CB?  No way.  And there's plenty of players in our squad right now who I'd say the same about.  I'd rather start moulding a fresh young CB in our defence or have a solid experienced quality veteran back there though.  6-10 games for spitting considering some of the other spitting incident bans is just silly though.  You're right, if it was a more important player, I'd be more bothered by it.

2892~~~
So that video of him spitting is just some CGI s**t or something?

2893~~~
Cisse clearly spat straight towards Evans, there was nothing he could deny. Evans could legitimately just have been spitting on the floor, its very hard, make that impossible, to know if Evans meant to spit at Cisse or not.

I would imagine he will be found guilty though, on the basis of probability.

2894~~~
Spitting at someone is equally insulting as spitting on someone. He's an idiot for doing it.

2895~~~
It's a shame he got a lengthy ban. Was slowly showing signs of getting back to his old self.

2896~~~
In which case it's a good job he's got a 6 game ban, because "slowly getting back to his old self" is usually around the time he suffers a catastrophic drop in performance or gets injured for 3 months.

At least this way, when he gets back from suspension he will still be in the "slowly getting getting back to his old self" phase of the Evans performance trajectory.

2897~~~
Too bad as the last two matches were probably his best this season.

Did anyone else think he looked really scared when cisse stood up?

2898~~~
If Smalling, Jones and Rojo stay fit I don't think its a huge loss.

Shame for him though.

2899~~~
Damn. Was hoping Evans and Smalling could build up to something, based on recent 2 games. Hopefully McNair will take the spot.

2900~~~
on the bright side, he can start his summer holiday now

2901~~~
Idiot, not good enough for United so his loss should be our gain (unless we've another list of injuries)

2902~~~
To be expected, was pretty blatantly a spit. Not sure why he denied it when he looked right at him and spit. Not like he can't control it. Was in good form but I wouldn't want him playing against Arsenal or in any of the tough games coming up anyways.

2903~~~
It's probably been his worst season since starting with the first team. Lots of people are writing him off but I think he might use the ban period to address his game and contemplate his future. I am not sure his days are numbered just yet.

2904~~~
United ready to sell with Spurs and Arsenal interested according to this.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-united/tottenham-and-arsenal-interested-in-manchester-uniteds-jonny-evans-31050730.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/s...-manchester-uniteds-jonny-evans-31050730.html</a>

2905~~~
Since Christmas

Without Evans - Played 6, clean sheets 1, W2 D 2 L2  
With Evans - Played 9, clean sheets 6,  W7 D2 L0

2906~~~
He's got Spurs written all over him I reckon.

2907~~~
Whole season...

With Evans 13* games, 6 goals allowed
Without Evans 16* games, 20 goals allowed

*one is Leicester game

2908~~~
And he was undeniably crap in a bunch of his opening games too. He's gradually improved in recent weeks and been an important factor in our recently improved defensive performances. And people are actually <i>happy</i> he's missing for 6 games?! Weirdos.

2909~~~
You could really thank De Gea for most of the clean sheets instead of spinning it again to 'Jonny's class' because it's really getting boring, now.

I'm still waiting for a whole season worthy of Man United from him without being covered by some real characters of defense.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.manutd.com/sitecore/shell/~/media/EA271B01AF1A4433A42216A5AFAC6ADC.ashx?w=480&amp;h=270&amp;rgn=0,63,1890,1130" src="http://www.manutd.com/sitecore/shell/~/media/EA271B01AF1A4433A42216A5AFAC6ADC.ashx?w=480&amp;h=270&amp;rgn=0,63,1890,1130"/> 

In case you forgot this is how a first team standard in this club looks like.

Why not demand it again ? Is it that much to ask ?

2910~~~
At least he's in the NI squad so he should get match practice there.

2911~~~
It was just two games

2912~~~
Spurs are too good for Evans.

2913~~~
Bullshit.

2914~~~
Its true. Sunderland is more his speed. Jonny Evans fitness record won't be good enough for a top 6 team. Wait a minute, there's always Arsenal, they are used to that sort of thing.

2915~~~
go away. if you can't see that Evans is better than Sunderland you need to stop watching football

i bet you were one of the people who used to say that Fletcher was no better than mid-table Championship prior to his peak

2916~~~
I hope you're patient, because you'll be waiting a while to see a defence like that again. In the meantime, better get used to Smalling, Rojo, Jones and Evans

2917~~~
You're right about the Fletcher part. I absolutely didn't rate him. The hype he got from 03-06 was OTT and Fergie was to blame, just like he's to blame for Evans and Jones ridiculus appraisals. Fletcher became a genuine key player for United. Evans will never justify all the early praise he got from Fergie and the fans. Also, Fergie's prediction that he'd be captain one day and lead the team (probably like Terry leads Chelsea) will never come to fruition. First senior player to be sold this summer most likely.

2918~~~
If he plays like he did against Newcastle then he is good enough for most in the league, but it's whether he can reach that level consistently.

2919~~~
It's not a matter of patience but a matter of football standards. We splashed huge cash on Rio back in a day and it was a spot on investment after getting rid of Stam. It was a proper response to our trouble in that formation, rather than getting used to playing Brown with O'Shea as the main CB pair.

Getting used to Evans has to be absolute nightmare coming true for such club as United. There are defenders that could substantially upgrade us and we both know Evans has stopped developing from some time.

2920~~~
Spot on. The funny thing too is that even Brown and O'Shea were better players than Evans, so we've really gone backwards if Evans is what we consider acceptable United standard these days.

2921~~~
He represented Premier League level that day indeed but then again should we ignore that his season is already over and it's not even because of the injury record ?

After such break from first team football he'll be without match rhythm, he basically will start from zero again while rest of the team will have to eat grass to get us back in the Champions League.

We simply can't rely on him.

2922~~~
Brown and Sheasy had their moments of comedy at times but I can recall few class acts from them even on Champions League stage.

Brown's pass exchange with Scholes and then surgical cross to Ronnie in Moscow with his weaker foot was definitely one of them. O'Shea embarrassing Figo, other time playing as goalkeeper and the other time scoring a winner at Anfield... They had their moments. Can't deny that.

2923~~~
There is no denying Brown and O'shea's moments but Jonny Evans has produced also. Yes, he isn't the world class CB we need but for a young player to come through the system, we have gotten good use out of him.

2924~~~
Did you see Spurs defenders on sunday?

He's easily good enough for spurs.

2925~~~
Your hatred for a Evans is disturbing,  especially if you're a United fan.

2926~~~
Please don't mistake me not rating Evans for hatred. He seems like a decent guy, he's just not good enough for United. Must sell

2927~~~
He was playing decent enough but we definitely need a top quality CB as none of our four defenders are consistently good but realistically, who's out there for us to go for?

I don't mind having Evans in the squad at all but as much as I hate to admit it, if we bring in a new CB, he at the moment seems to be the one most disposable. But then a few months ago, it was Smalling; Jones has had his "he's useless" moments; Rojo has had his ups and downs...we will have to see at the end of the season. Trust Van Gaal to make the right decision.

2928~~~
Am I the only person who thinks Jan Vertonghen is massively overrated? I mean, he's comfortable with the ball at his feet, but when it comes to actually defending I don't think he's that good at all.

2929~~~
You are being generous. He is absolutely rubbish. 

As for Jonny, I thought he would become VG's favorite defender with his ability on the ball. Shame injuries have never allowed him to fulfil the potential he showed in the '08 and the '11 seasons.

2930~~~
Not at all mate, never seen the fuss about him myself. As you say he's good on the ball and driving forward going the other way nothing special at all. I wouldn't want us to sign him for a start.

Put it like this plenty on here moan about Evans and Jones and insist we should buy xyz defender. But most of the names mentioned Vertonghen being among them would be getting the same criticism and attacks within 6 months after a few bad performances.

2931~~~
That's my thought as well.

2932~~~
A few? Some wold be on his back after one bad game.

2933~~~
Yes, lets base this on one game.

2934~~~
One game? Yeah right, Spurs have conceded 42 goals this season so far thats the highest amount in the top 10, and ironically only one less than Sunderland have conceded which you seem to think is Evans level but he's not good enough for Spurs am i right?

Spurs defenders are crap, and Evans is comfortably good enough for them. He's better than Dier for a start and on form he's a better defender than Vertonghen.

2935~~~
yes on all counts. not good enough for united.

2936~~~
Yeah that's a good point mate. Judging by the bile posted in here a few months ago after Evans first game back.

Who Vertonghen?

2937~~~
Evans is not reliable enough for a top 6 side. He wouldn't improve Spurs, he'd just add numbers to their ranks.

2938~~~
You seem to have changed your tune now, i thought we wasn't good enough for Spurs?

You really think he isn't better than Dier?

By the way Evans seemed reliable enough in a top 1 side in 2009, 2011 & 2013.

2939~~~
evans who is better than vertongen. neither is good enough for united. evans would play for spurs.

2940~~~
I haven't changed my tune. He wouldn't improve them therefore he's not good enough for them
(why purchase a player who wouldn't, especially at the wages he'd ask for). He's unreliable and any ambitious team shouldn't be looking to sign him. Evans had a period of sustained good performances but even you surely can't sit here and pretend that he fully came into his own as a player and a leader at the back, someone you can rely on like Rio and Vidic. First senior player sold this summer. Its time to move on and build a team of consistent and reliable players. Evans isn't either, not by a long shot. He won't <i>settle</i> at a top four or even top six team after United. Im certain of it. He might sign for Spurs or Everton, but his fitness issues will be his eventual ruin as far as 'top' teams are concerned. Quote this post in 2-3 seasons, maybe sooner.

2941~~~
Well i think Evans is good enough to be a second choice at United. Is he good enough to build a team on, well no he isn't but you need more than 11 players.

2942~~~
You quite clearly have changed your tune when it was pointed out to you just how bad Spurs defence have been this season.

By saying he wouldn't improve them (in your opinion) you are saying he is as good as the defenders they already have, which clearly contradicts your earlier statement below.

So why don't you quit while you're behind.

So he's not as good as two of the best defenders to ever play the game, and thats the reason you think we should we should sell him. Well in that case we should sell all our defenders then as none of them will ever be that good.

feck sake give it a rest will you. Do you feel it is a duty of yours to pop back into this thread every few pages and post the same old bull shit nonsense over and over again.

2943~~~
Its not about being as good as them, its about being reliable, consistent and dependable, showing spine and being a goddamn leader. key words i've been using throughout this discussion and throughout my criticisms of Evans. I've maintained that he wouldn't add quality or any kind of improvement to a top 6 team. You can quote my words and try and use them against me but my overall tone and piont is the same and anyone can see that. Not good enough.

2944~~~
I feel the same way about Evans as I do Jones and Smalling, where I rate them and think they're good enough, but I've been disappointed with how none of them stepped up and made the position theirs when Vidic and Rio left which was the plan all along.

There's been games or in Evans case, a season where they showed what they're capable of, but none of them have really kicked on. With LvG wanting to bring in a defender, even they stay here, it's a good bet that they'll be nothing more than squad players.

2945~~~
You spouted some nonsense and contradicted yourself if you don't want to admit it that's fine.

But you said he wasn't good enough for Spurs (nonsense) and Sunderland was his level yet they have both conceded the same amount of goals and are therefore both equally wank defensively. 

Do you still stand by these statements?

You've been consistent alright you keep posting the same 4-5 points over and over again.

2946~~~
Apart from Terry I don't think there is a centre half in the PL who is as reliable, consistent and dependable as Ferdinand and Vidic.

2947~~~
Evans is wank. This debate is pointless. Not good enough for United, not good enough for a top six team. Those are my thoughts.

2948~~~
But good enough for Spurs then yes, seeing as they are 7th?

So we agree you were in fact talking a load of nonsense a few pages back then yes?

2949~~~
Dude, you're making something out of nothing. When it comes down to it i've made my main points and thoughts clear. Spurs are a team that are always chasing a place in Europe and they are widely considered a top 6 team. The other five being United, Liverpool, City, Arsenal and Chelsea. Are you denying this? Spurs may be 7th at the moment but they're always in the frame whereas teams like Everton and now Southampton pop in from time to time. Anal retentive much? The real questions will be answered a few seasons from now when we see where Evans ends up, and IMO it won't be with a top team.

2950~~~
You spouted nonsense and then contradicted your nonsense several times now and are too proud to hold your hands up and admit it which i find hilarious. That's what i'm making something out of.

It might be Spurs, you never know.

2951~~~
Spurs play a puffy child at RCB, so he might start there, but an Evans-Walker right side defies all logic, taste and reason.

2952~~~
You're the one who is being pedantic here. You can't really come up with any reasoning for your own belief so you're merely picking out the continuity errors in his posts. I don't think he's said anything far fetched.

2953~~~
Which is?

2954~~~
to be honest, not really sure. You haven't even made a clear argument for yourself here.

2955~~~
I had an idea you didn't even know what the discussion was actually about. Might be an idea to know whats being discussed mate before jumping head first into someone's conversation and making assertions.

What argument exactly do i need to make?

Well let me fill you in with the short version, i don't need to make any argument because i wasn't posting nonsense pulled out of my arse, i was simply highlighting said nonsense. 

Have a read back through the last 2 pages if you want the long version.

2956~~~
With his suspension, and his lack of 'match-rhythm' - added to the importance of every game now with the run in - I think there is a possibility that Mr Evans has played his last game for us.

If that is the case, it would be a sad way for it to all end, but I would imagine he would be first of any senior central defensive departures this summer, and injuries permitting - I can't see him getting much more of a look in with the stakes so high.

2957~~~
Played very well against Finland.

2958~~~
It's a shame the stadium didn't <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2959~~~
I was in that stand too... <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2960~~~
Would anyone else prefer:

Evans - Rojo

Or

Jones - Evans

To

Jones - Rojo


Don't get me wrong, both Jones and Rojo are better defenders than Evans but the chemistry between Jones and Rojo is frightening. Bad Cop/Bad Cop is never a good recipe.

2961~~~
I still rate Evans, so I would be happy to see him play with Rojo. In saying that, I do accept the view that if a defender is leaving, it's Evans.

2962~~~
Evans and Smalling has seemed a good combo when I've seen it. We'd probably have been playing it had Evans not got himself banned.

2963~~~
He is our worst CB these days and I don't want to see him playing if any of Smalling, Jones, Rojo, and even fecking McNair are available.

2964~~~
Helen can stay at Old Trafford.

But he can really go.....he is again injured <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2965~~~
He must be gone. He's older than Smalling and Jones, gets injured just as much if not more, and performs at a lower level. It's a shame but we can't carry him anymore. It will be interesting to see who comes in for him.

2966~~~
Rumours Arsenal and Everton are interested

2967~~~
He'll be following Rafael out of the door this summer.

2968~~~
He can go to either.

2969~~~
Arsenal please. We need another agent there after the more recent successful infiltration by Agent Silvestre.

2970~~~
Rafael & Evans for Stones & Coleman <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2971~~~
That's gotta be the life. He was suspended then Van Gaal gave him some free time... and now he's back to being injured. Surprise, surprise...

2972~~~
how has he managed to get himself injured, having sat out a 6match ban?!

Got to be shipped out.

You can't see us not buying a centre back, so he'd be scuffling with McNair and Blackett to be 5th choice

2973~~~
I think there will be decent PL interest for him so we can get a decent fee.

2974~~~
How is it even possible.. He had such promise, really hasn't worked out for him

2975~~~
See ya

2976~~~
While he may not have gone on to become a club legend, he has had a good time at the club. Not too many come through the system and do as well as he did. In a time where we spend like crazy, can't ask for too much more than the service he has given us.

2977~~~
He is injured? Again? Its becoming tedious at this point. He's made of cornflakes.

2978~~~
He won't go for more than 6

2979~~~
I have a feeling we may keep him. Lots more games to play next season.

2980~~~
A lot know my stance and while I am the first person to call for a world class CB to be signed, Evans is a player I would like to stay. I fully understand if he moves away both from his and the clubs point of view but I still rate him.

2981~~~
Really? I cant see it myself, he is injured half of the time. Lindegaard, Evans and Rafael are for me as good as gone.

2982~~~
Get rid!

Will never forget it...He was asked about George Best and Irish footballers in an interview...

His response?

"I can be a leader like George. That's why they look up to me!" ( I assume he was on about NI)

1. No one looks up to you!
2. You had amazing potential and shat on it
3. You spat on or "near" someone....Not having that...Manchester United carries itself with dignity and respect. That's not it

2983~~~
Whats the point if he has another season like this one? Time to get rid! We already have a ready made Northern Irish replacement in McNair!

2984~~~
If you go by fanzines etc, LVG wants rid of him

There is an interview from last August, where Evans himself said he was struggling with LVG's tactics....

2985~~~
And yet he's been preferred to Jones and Rojo.

2986~~~
Evans has to go.  We can talk about his potential 5 years ago but he pissed himself away with shit play and too many injuries.

2987~~~
I believe you. Its evident in the way he's performed. Ive never rated Evans but he's been diabolical this season save for his last two games before spitgate. Do you happen to have the source or remember the name of the fanzine?

2988~~~
I don't understand this post? Who's been preferred to Jones and Rojo?

2989~~~
I'd post a picture of it but, I'd have to go through numerous issues of Red Issue and UWS.

If you Google an interview with Evans, from August, it will come up....In it, he admits he's not sure of what LVG wants to do etc....

Where as, you Google an interview with Phil Jones, he's always going on about LVG's philosophy...It's a stark contrast. 

There was one article, in a few fanzines that LVG copped on to Evans after the MK Dons match...

All I know

2990~~~
Evans. Jones only came in after Evans was suspended, Rojo hasn't played ahead of him either.

2991~~~
My friend you're delusional. I can't believe what im reading! Rojo was undroppable as soon as he got his work permit sorted out. It was always LVG's intention to play a left footed CB. Evans has been overlooked for many games. You're having a laugh

2992~~~

<a class="username" data-user="39261, @gooDevil" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/39261/">@gooDevil</a>

Evans has made Blackett look good this season.....Evans has been abysmal and I'll openly admit to saying he was going to be immense.....But that was when he had Vidic and Rio to guide him.....Now he's the senior defender and he shits himself everytime he's played.

He spreads panice around the back four anytime he plays.....Sooner he's gone, the better.

2993~~~
I agree. Needs to leave sharpish. I hear Arsenal and Everton are interested. He should consider himself lucky if he parachutes to any one of those teams. They'll see for themselves how unreliable he is though. O'Shea and Brown were better.

2994~~~
Difference is, O Shea and Brown done their duty and then some. Brown was never afraid to give out orders or try and boss the world's best strikers. He was determined as hell

O' Shea....Not talented but gave his all and was never found wanting. Our MOTD in the CL final. Never backed down from a challenge.

Evans......Shits himself at MK Dons, whilst being the senior defender at the club.

I said bye bye, bye bye....Bye bye Johnny...

2995~~~
<a class="username" data-user="39261, @gooDevil" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/39261/">@gooDevil</a>  Evans played against Sunderland (2-0 home win) because Rojo and Jones were injured. McNair was on the bench for that game. Jones passed a late fitness test for the next game (Newcastle United) so he was on the bench. Rojo was also injured for that.

2996~~~
Amen to that

2997~~~
Sing along <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2998~~~
Haha. Great tune.

2999~~~
I agree, he has had a poor season, although not as bad as some would have you believe. He is still a good player and before this season was easily the best CB of the lot we have. His biggest problem, like a few others, is his constant injuries.

3000~~~
That's just silly.


Wow, Rojo's been injured that much? I do recall LVGs obsession with left footed CBs on the left. I feel like I haven't seen Rojo play CB in months.

Evans was so bad in a back 3 I think people are overreacting a bit. It seems Rojo is a sick note, we know Jones and Smalling are too, we're going to need a lot of CBs, he fine for that kinda deep cover.

3001~~~
Rojo is hardly a sicknote. What am I actually reading here? I seriously feel you're on a WUM. Evans is sooo gone.

3002~~~
You underrate Evans, hes had a bad season.. Blackett hasnt shown a level Evans has once

3003~~~
I haven't even mentioned Blackett. I don't care what potential Evans has shown in the past. He's failed to live up to it and needs to go

3004~~~
He is a joke like Rafael

3005~~~
Thank God they'll both be leaving this summer.

3006~~~
Some posters are too sentimental. There is nothing that suggests Evans is worth keeping,  nothing.

3007~~~
Given his age and injury record i dont see a point in keeping him. Given that we will most likely bring in a CB Evans would be 5/6th joice. 

His exit will benefit both parties.

But i cannot understand the venom towards him. He has been a good servant to this club.

3008~~~
It's pathetic really.

3009~~~
if he rediscovered his form from 11/12 12/13 he would be massive boost for our defense. I don't care how he ends up tbh, I lost patience with him but I don't think it's all clear that we will let him go and buy center back.. as well as with rafael but we will see.

3010~~~
Its not personal. He's just fecking useless to us as a team going forward. Thats the way it is. I saw a whole lot worse written about Evra in his final seasons and it wasn't right. Evans is not even half the player Evra is

3011~~~
Thing is if we buy a CB then he becomes 5th/6th choice at current state. Plus he gets injured all the time and has the least scope for improvement in terms of age of our batch of defenders.

Moving now would be best for both parties.

3012~~~
He's stealing a living at United. Time to bring it to an end <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3013~~~
Do be quiet.

3014~~~
Thats a knee jerk.. Prove it isnt, how many games has he played so far?

3015~~~
Its like this place is full of 12 year olds at times....

Its a difficult one this as the lad may find his solid form again, however, I'm not sure we can risk having him in the squad when Smalling and Jones are also so injury prone.

 As much as Jones has never had an injury free season or one solid season you'd think it'll come down to a choice between them and Jones will probably stay.

3016~~~
Tears will be shed when this guy leaves. I can't wait for us to get rid

3017~~~
What age are you? Genuine question.

3018~~~
Exactly, it's not like he's been rubbish for us. Apart from this season and a season earlier in his career, he's been good to great for us. He was first choice starter for a lot of people because he deserved it.

3019~~~
Really? Im not going to give you the satisfaction of an answer to that. We've debated before several times.  I don't rate Evans at all, that doesn't make me childish.

3020~~~
You’ve kind of answered it, cheers.

3021~~~
We could do with a few coming through at that level, shame that level is that of a squad player. I don't think he has reached the level we hoped a few season ago.

3022~~~
I like Johny, but don't really see any logical role for him since Smalling has emerged, Rojo has been bought, and Jones has been playing a fair bit at CB. And that's not even factoring the possibility of Hummels or another CB getting bought this summer.

3023~~~
I think the next time we see him will be in a Spurs or Everton shirt.

3024~~~
I'm one of his bigger critics but he was fine for us, doesn't deserve any stick looking back at his whole time here. Was a promising young player, became a useful squad player for a few years, looked like he might step to be real first team quality for a club of Utd's size but just fell short at the end. Made it further than most and it was all for free.

3025~~~
He was fantastic when he had a leader like Rio next to him. 

injuries havent helped, but hes had some really good games for us. I just dont think it works with a defender like Jones / smalling next to him unfortunately.

3026~~~
he was never that good. weak and heartless. yes he may have had a few matches when he played well enough to be a squadie only when he had a world class defender watching him , he is the senior defender and has shown his lack of a spine. 5th choice cb for me.

3027~~~
Is this your fist season watching United?

3028~~~
Come back soon, Jonny, we miss you!

3029~~~
no , yours?

3030~~~
Show him the door. Not good enough to be first choice and not fit enough to be second. Fair well.

3031~~~
I’m struggling to understand your previous post then, of course, you may just be talking bollocks which is the more logical theory.

3032~~~
i was never impressed by him. looked like he was going to be something but never did anything beyond being a squad player for me. looked good enough when next to a WC defender but too easily went sideways then backwards when push came to shove. you have a different opinion of him.

3033~~~
How many games has Rojo played at CB? You're saying he's first choice, if he's not starting he's injured then, right?

3034~~~
Get a grip. Just because you don't agree with his points doesn't mean you need to belittle him like that.

3035~~~
Not reliable enough in form or fitness. I would rather sell and replace with a top class defender and let Rojo and Jones battle to be the back ups to new player and Smalling.

3036~~~
Taking emotions out of it, his form has been up and down in his time here, you can understand why some see the glass half full with him, and others half empty, I'd say with LvG, he's been his 4th choice CB for the majority of the season behind Smalling, Jones & Rojo, he's also made a few poor passes that could well have seen us punished which i'm sure a manager who scrutinises every game in minute detail will have picked up on.
When you think he's had his injury problems as well, then you have to come to the conclussion LvG cant be too enamoured judged on what he's seen from him since his arrival, it wouldn't be a shock to see him leave this summer.

3037~~~
Jonny needs a fresh start with a new club.  It hasn't worked for him at OT for the last 3 seasons and he's at best 4th in the depth chart and with a top CB coming in and McNair emerging as a solid young prospect there's no point in him staying.  Instead, he could have a solid career with a mid table club such as Stoke.

Best to rip the bandage.

3038~~~
You're so passive aggressive. Pathetic really. I've seen you do this with other posters who didn't share your views on Evans. Most of your last posts in the Smalling thread were deliberately timed to counter the flack Evans was getting in this thread. You can try and deny it, I don't care.

He does this shit all the time and tries to come off as the more mature poster. Passive aggressive.

3039~~~
His post suggested to me that he had only watched the team this season.

Passive aggresive? Explain, or will you ignore this post like you many others that call you up on your bullshit?

3040~~~
And he's back!

3041~~~
Slippery Jonny.

3042~~~
I feel like they should play the Phantom of the Opera music as he comes on the pitch.

3043~~~
ITS JONNY!

3044~~~
This guy couldn't organize a piss up in a brewery let alone our defense. Such a horrific player.

3045~~~
Has he been training with Gerrard? He seems like he's wearing banana peels for football boots.

3046~~~
hasnt played since march, give him a break

3047~~~
Seems to forget how to play football.

3048~~~
He's lacking match rhythm.

3049~~~
He's looked like a clown in the circus, trying to make people laugh with sheer stupidity.

3050~~~
No support for struggling player of the team you are fan of?

We really are such great fans.

3051~~~
As soon as saf left it was obvious he would be exposed for what he is and that certainly isn't a defender.  Even when saf was here he only ever looked good when we were in control of a match. 

He should have been sent packing after the city defeat at OT, when he managed to go from being goal side to not and then getting sent off.

3052~~~
This is a board to post messages regarding the performance and other such football related matters, we aren't here for him to check at half time for a morale boost by plying him with lies.

3053~~~
ok

3054~~~
What? He's had so much support over the years, I could understand if it if people were having a pop at McNair and wanting him sold but Evans has been atrocious for way too long and has to go.

3055~~~
i can't get over how utterly shite this guy has become for us, Im not even over reacting either every time this season he has come on he looks lost and petrified, I hope he is told to do one in the summer, punt him to sunderland

3056~~~
I bet Getsme still manages to find positives from this performance.

3057~~~
What this guy said.

3058~~~
He's been shit (bar probably 1 game, at a stretch 2) for a long time before then.

3059~~~
Bye bye Jonny

3060~~~
Makes me so nervous.

3061~~~
Win ball, dribble slowly towards opposition player, lose ball, get nutmegged.

Terrible from him today, just terrible. May have been his first game back in ages but christ I didn't expect him to be that bad.

3062~~~
Sell him.

3063~~~
He's turned so shit. It's unexplicable.

3064~~~
That's his own fault.

Absolutely sabotaging us this season.

3065~~~
thought it was a no brainer he'd get sold, but Shaw and Smalling again showing how our defenders are made from glass made me wonder if we'll keep him for an extra body.

6th choice centre back next year. will probably still play 20-25 games!

3066~~~
The 80th minute summed him up, reads the play well and makes a smooth interception on Zaha, then immediately gives it away to him and gets beaten by him leading to a chance for Palace.

3067~~~
Out of all our defenders this season, he is <i>by far</i> the one that makes me shit myself whenever he has the ball or an opponent is running at him.

3068~~~
The guy has been a good servant to the club and we shouldn't get too personal with the criticism. But that was a real stinker by Evans.

3069~~~
fecking fraud of a player, belongs at a midtable club. Sick of seeing this crap everytime he plays, he is so bad...

3070~~~
Hasn't kicked on and no sign he will. Time for him to move on this summer and would be very surprised if he doesn't.

3071~~~
Why is he so error prone? Is he the new Pascal Cygan or Boumsong?

3072~~~
I don't know how many times this conversation has to come about.

He is quite simply not very good.

Rather like Valenica, he can't really be blamed for being what he is, which n Evans case is a not very good defender.
But while he is unfortunately still with us, we have to just accept him for that.

3073~~~
Did you just watch that game? He's an embarrassment, the guy struggled against a League One team earlier in the season.

3074~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Jesus some of you feckers must have missed this thread, posting a few minutes into the second half. Be honest some of you have had it bookmarked for months just in case.

He was gash today though but he wasn't alone so were Valencia and Jones. Evans hasn't played in 2 months so at least he has a slight excuse.

We need to start shipping some of these defenders off and Evans is looking like a good bet to be first, also wouldn't surprise me if Jones follows him.

3075~~~
Did anyone else notice him stop playing to appeal for a handball, the ricochet then nearly put Palace through on goal? The ref didn't give the handball. He was stupid and lucky.

3076~~~
he played as left back didn't he? after two months, he made some good defending and also some inconvincing but I guess Valencia was much worse and it's much more usual role for him now...

3077~~~
It was Jones at left back wasn't it?

3078~~~
God he was bad. Completely void of any confidence, combined with no form and accompanied by a dollop of generally just being shit.

I actually think I might be better than him.

3079~~~
Time for woodward to make a call to sunderland. 

Bardsley-brown-evans-oshea

3080~~~
was it  if so than my bad but I swear I've seen hhim at LB, maybe he finished half there for Shaw and than switched to CB but that doesn't matter much..

3081~~~
To put it in perspective, McNair did more defending in the 15 mins he was on the pitch.

He did make a really good tackle late in the second half and I was thinking great challenge Jonny and then he gave the ball back and to top it off proceded to get nutmegged!

3082~~~
Still the same deer in front of the flashlights.

What's up with his studs though? He fell on the floor at least twice today.

3083~~~
Shame about how he's fallen from what he was 3-4 years ago. Our worst defender atm, even more than Valencia a converted RB. Slipping, sliding an getting nutmegged - he made one great tackle and then messed up trying to pass it off.

3084~~~
Must have been the pitch quite a few players on both sides slipped.

Can remember Jones slipping 2-3 times and Shaw also i think.

3085~~~
If the rumours about him being in danger of being sold this summer are true then he did himself no favours tonight.

3086~~~
I saw that too and surprised it wasn't mentioned by others. That was piss poor, but he was lucky.

3087~~~
With all the talks about Hummels and God knows who else (Laporte?), I would certainly not be surprised if Evans is sold soon.

3088~~~
He's regressed horribly. I won't be unhappy if he gets sold.

3089~~~
The 'play' when he turtled along the touchline and gave Palace a run at goal is why I can't have any sympathies for him.  Not only does he make poor decisions but he also completely bottles challenges that any defender with one testicle would make.  Should be the first to go this summer.

3090~~~
Evans has this unique ability, I don't know how to explain it, but whenever he's on the pitch, we have zero composure in defence. I've never rated him even when he was having a purple patch. At one time, he had a good tackel, recovered the ball, lost it, then got nutmegged - just how incredibly stupid can these lad be?

3091~~~
He is not good enough for this club, but he is not worst player on pitch today.

3092~~~
he had some serious competition, but nobody else makes you shit yourself as much as our Jonny

3093~~~
I've said it earlier, but the best thing about having Evans is his wife working at MUTV.

3094~~~
The situation is simple. LVG shall perform miracle therapy on him like he did with Fellaini or we're gonna shit bricks when he'll play against Champions League firms next season.

His injury record isn't helping though as he constantly look not focused enough when trying to reach some kind of a form.

3095~~~
I'm sorry, but he's fecking appalling these days.

3096~~~
The abuse he was getting on social media (and I'm assuming on here too) was truly embarrassing. Ok, he isn't Rio or Vidic but he has done well for a player who came through the system, it doesn't happen that often these days so we should support the players when they do. In fact, support should just be the done thing, I really feel sorry for him. I remember all the players slipping and it was down to the pitch, Evans slipped, it was because he was shit? I just don't get it.

I have seen people blaming him today, we fecking won, he didn't cost us the game, stop acting like he did only because you want it to be true.

3097~~~
When he'd comically fallen over twice within about 3 minutes of being on the pitch you knew he would be way off the pace and of course he was.
I think it's a real shame how much he's struggled, there have been periods here and there where he's looked really good and even been a decent goal threat but he looks a mess now.

Can't see him being here next season.

3098~~~
What about Blackett? Evans isn't <i>that</i> bad! His confidence is at minus now however and it permeates the entire defence when he's in there... if/when we buy this summer he'll be permanently benched or sold.

3099~~~
All our away fans (including me) had this <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> face as he come on.

3100~~~
His defending has been bad enough but his indecisiveness really does my head in. He has this routine of holding up the ball for about 10 seconds longer than he needs to before he either hoofs it up or loses the ball as was the case yesterday. Just clear the fecking ball.

3101~~~
Aye, it's a strange game to be turning on him. Admittedly, his first five minutes were pretty terrible but once he got up to the pace of the game he was actually quite solid. Won as many aerial duals and made as many headed clearances in his 50 minutes as Smalling did in 84 minutes. Twice as many tackles too.

3102~~~
Evans is that bad and has 7-8 years on Blackett. As soon as he came on yesterday you could see there was a mistake there waiting to happen. There was one piece of defending in the first half which was so comical it made me think "why dont defenders do that against us!" Evans was running onto a ball he was favourite for but somehow slipped allowing the Palace winger to pick it up and run at Smalling in the box. I thought he didnt do all that bad after but hes the type of defender where you know theres a mistake in there. When he was in his early 20s you would say hes young and learning, add a few comparisons with Rio at that age but now hes just not good enough for us.

Its a shame but a few seasons ago i really thought he'd be the first name on the teamsheet he was composed on the ball and could read the game very well, i thought he was on course to develop into a great CB. Now i just see him as a liability.

3103~~~
This pretty much. Can't fault him much for the slipping either as that was the pitch. Can only remember the losing the ball to Zaha incident after that period.

3104~~~
I blame him for causing panic in the defence. He comes on and starts making panic gestures with his hand when he can't find a pass. At one point he also stopped playing to appeal for a handball that the ref didn't give. Palace almost got a clear run on goal because of that.

He did a nice tackle on Zaha at one point but then tried to dribble away and got tackled himself by Wilf! Palace had a dangerous attack as a result. He did plenty wrong in fairness.

3105~~~
What the hell is a "panic gesture" and how is it different to trying to organise the defence?

3106~~~
It is waving your hands in a panic motion, he does it all the time. He does it as soon as he can't find an easy pass and the opposition start to get close to him. Nothing to do with organising the defence.

3107~~~
Appears we have already begun replacing Helen on MUTv too. I saw a new blonde on there on Thursday.

3108~~~
Taking into account his age and performances, I think he will not be playing for United next season.

3109~~~
While some of the stick he got was unfair and over the top, he does not help himself does he? Homegrown or not, hes been very poor for a long time now and needs to be moved on.

3110~~~
There is poor and there is not up to fans high expectations. And to be honest, I think many of his performances fall under the latter category.

I admit, he hasn't been great this season and out of all the defenders, he should be the first to be moved on (as much as I like him) but he is one of those players who won't get praised, only criticized.

Some of the grief he gets from our fans is way ott, just like Tom I think he will do well in a team where he can play regularly under less pressure. Fans sadly have this habit of developing a picture of a player in their mind and unless you have a Fellaini - Young level comeback it never seems to change

3112~~~
He causes panic across the whole defensive line. He shouldn't be here next season, he would still do a decent job at a mid table premier League side.

3113~~~
When Rio, Vidic and Evra were around Evans, Smallimg and Jones looked quite good. Now they've gone all three have gone through hell but Evans has been left behind. His decline in form over the last two seasons has been tragic. I genuinely think, if a solid CB was on board all three would find their form restored.

3114~~~
What exactly is "panic gestures"? Can you show some examples.

3115~~~
It is waving your hands about saying 'who is on, where are you?'. Just watch him next time he plays.

3116~~~
Think some of the criticism he has got has been over the top (and I am not his biggest fan at all).

3117~~~
Well he wasn't playing the Everton game when we were all over the place defensively,  even Yesterday Valencia gave away lots of silly free kicks, Smalling conceded one for the goal and Blind was absolutely awful in the wall and yet it's Evans who supposedly caused the panic

3118~~~
the good thing about Evans is his past record for Sunderland and us would suggest that he still holds a decent transfer value - I think he could rekindle some form at a lower table team

I think a team like Sunderland would pay 10 million plus for him

it sickened me to hear we sold Kagawa for 6 million

3119~~~
You are criticizing him for the sake of it now. So if he is being closed down, he will obviously wave out to his team mates to make themselves available for the pass. If that spreads "panic" among paid professionals at the top level, then God help us.

3120~~~
Just watching the match again, the basic defensive errors he makes are shocking. Why is he always ball watching? But for De Gea, Murray would've scored and we'd be looking at the barrel of a fourth consecutive defeat. Evans, meanwhile is marking their DM Jedinak, who he loses anyway. Smalling wasn't much better yesterday either.

3121~~~
I am only speculating on that point. I accept that. Watch him next time he plays, in away games it gets the opposition crowd a little bit roused when he does it and he turns back passes backwards. It makes us look on the back foot. 

That aside he still made too many mistakes for me.

3122~~~
Jesus asking your teammates to position themselves for a pass is a panic gesture now?

What should he have done then just lumped it up the pitch?

3123~~~
Just pass it back without a fuss like everyone else.

3124~~~
So you can't ask your teammates to move for the ball? What a bizarre criticism. Ander gave Valencia a bollocking yesterday for just standing there and not making a move down the line for a pass. Should we go into Ander's thread and bitch about that?

3125~~~
Yeah but if no one was showing for a pass then who is he passing it to without a fuss?

Also he wasn't the only player to do it yesterday, i would expect every player to do it if the rest of the team are not making themselves available to receive the ball.

How the feck that can be twisted into a criticism i don't know.

3126~~~
First thing in the transfer window we need to get rid of this waste of space. He gets injured too much and even when he's fit, he does a lot of silly mistakes. He's 27 now.

3127~~~
If you watch our defenders play they pass back and sideways if they can't find a forward man readily. It is a pattern that happens time and time again in every game we play. Evans is the only one who looks terrified every time he can't find someone and is getting pressed. 

Watch for yourself next time he plays for, if he ever does again that is. I am out on this point.

3128~~~
Honestly that is one of the dumbest criticisms I've ever heard. Next thing he'll be criticized for trying to talk to the other players.

3129~~~
Agreed.

3130~~~
So instead of trying to be positive and urging his team mates to make themselves available for a forward pass he should just pass it back to the keeper.

I am almost positive he was getting vilified for taking the easy option and passing it back too much before his suspension. I guess his biggest crime now in the eyes of a lot of fans is being Jonny Evans damned if he does and damned if he doesn't it seems.

I wonder which player will be turned on next and constantly criticized if/when Evans does leave the club.

3131~~~
Nah i think that already happened a few months back mate when the same set of numpties criticized him one week for not showing enough leadership and the next week ripped into him for bullying the younger defenders by telling them what to do.

So basically any vague criticism that pops into their heads in any given week.

3132~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I remember that. Apparently he is too shite to tell other players what to do.

3133~~~
Hard to disagree with this. Hopefully he'll never have to play for us again.

3134~~~
Watched the game again and apart from the moment with Zaha he seemed fine to me.

3135~~~
He was fine, no way anyone can argue otherwise. Peoples opinions just get in the way and the want to believe what wasn't there.

3136~~~
I hope we've seen the last of him.

3137~~~
Well no, it is quite easy to disagree with that.

3138~~~
The usual Evans apologists out in force again I see. 

He's garbage lads and he won't be wearing the shirt next season. Let it go.

3139~~~
Simply not good enough and has not been for a while. He's a decent cb. Not the calibre we need here.
